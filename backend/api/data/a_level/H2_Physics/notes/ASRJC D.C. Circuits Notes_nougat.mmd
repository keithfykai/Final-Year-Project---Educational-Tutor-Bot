### Resistors in Series

* Resistors connected in series have the same current flowing through them i.e. any charge that flows through one resistor must flow through the others.
* Derivation (not required): Consider an e.m.f. \(E\) of negligible internal resistance applied across \(n\) resistors connected in series, as shown in the circuit diagram on the left of Fig. 15.6. \[\begin{array}{c}\includegraphics[width=150.0pt]{150.eps}\end{array}\] The resistors have resistances \(R_{1}\), \(R_{2}\),.... \(R_{n}\), and the potential difference across each resistor are \(V_{1}\), \(V_{2}\),... \(V_{n}\) respectively. Since the same current \(I\) flows through all the \(n\) resistors, using the relation \(V=IR\), the potential difference across each resistor can be expressed as \(IR_{1}\), \(IR_{2}\),... \(IR_{n}\). Since \(E=V_{1}+V_{2}+...+V_{n}\), we have \(E=IR_{1}+IR_{2}+....+IR_{n}=I\left(R_{1}+R_{2}+...+R_{n}\right)\). If a resistor of equivalent resistance \(R_{\mathrm{eff}}\) is used in place of the \(n\) resistors in series as shown in the circuit diagram on the right of Fig. 15.6, using \(V=IR\), we have \(E=IR_{\mathrm{eff}}\). From the two equations, we have \(E=IR_{\mathrm{eff}}=I\left(R_{1}+R_{2}+...+R_{n}\right)\). Hence, for resistors in series, \[\begin{array}{c}\includegraphics[width=150.0pt]{150.

If a resistor of equivalent resistance \(R_{\text{eff}}\) is used in place of the \(n\) resistors in parallel as shown in the circuit diagram on the right of Fig. 15.7, using \(V=IR\), we have \(I=\frac{E}{R_{\text{eff}}}\).

From the two equations, we have \(I=\frac{E}{R_{\text{eff}}}=E\left(\frac{1}{R_{1}}+\frac{1}{R_{2}}+...+\frac{1} {R_{n}}\right)\).

Hence, for resistors in parallel,

\[\boxed{\frac{1}{R_{\text{eff}}}=\frac{1}{R_{1}}+\frac{1}{R_{2}}+...+\frac{1} {R_{n}}}\]

This equation allows us to use \(R_{\text{eff}}\) to represent equivalent resistance of a set of resistors in parallel.

The equivalent resistance \(R_{\text{eff}}\) of resistors in parallel is always less than the smallest resistance in the group of resistors.

If all the \(n\) resistors in parallel are of the same resistance \(R\), then the equivalent resistance \(R_{\text{eff}}\) is \(\frac{R}{n}\).

Current continues to flow through the remaining resistors connected in parallel even when one of resistor fails and has an open circuit across it.

As the resistors are connected in series, the effective resistance of the circuit is \(R_{\text{eff}}=R_{1}+R_{2}\).

Using \(V=IR\), the current through the circuit, \(I=\dfrac{E}{R_{1}+R_{2}}\).

Therefore, p.d. across \(R_{1},\ V_{1}=IR_{1}=\dfrac{E}{R_{1}+R_{2}}\ R_{1}\)

\(V_{1}=\dfrac{R_{1}}{R_{1}+R_{2}}\ E\)

Similarly, p.d. across \(R_{2},\ V_{2}=\dfrac{R_{2}}{R_{1}+R_{2}}\ E\)

In general, the p.d. across a resistor \(R\) in a branch of resistors in series is given by

**Practical uses of a potential divider circuit**

The resistors

In order to vary the p.d. across two resistors \(R_{1}\) and \(R_{2}\) in a potential divider circuit, one of the resistors should have variable resistance.

Ways to setup a potential divider circuit include:

a) a fixed resistor connected in series with a resistor with variable resistance (e.g. rheostat, thermistor, LDR)

**Fig. 15.9**

As the resistance of \(R_{2}\) in Fig. 15.9 varies, the p.d. across both resistors, \(V_{1}\) and \(V_{2}\) will vary.

The resistance of thermistor decreases with temperature increase. Thermistor in a potential divider circuit can be used as a temperature sensor to detect fire and activate water sprinkler system, switch on the heater of a room when outside temperature drops and many more applications.

The resistance of LDR decreases as the light intensity falling on the LDR increases.

LDR in a potential divider circuit can be used as a light sensor to switch on light when the surrounding is dark, activate burglar alarm and many more applications.

a resistance wire (usually of uniform cross-sectional area and resistivity) providing variable resistance

In Fig. 15.10, the resistance of section AC, \(R_{1}=\frac{\rho}{A}\ L_{1}\).

Similarly, the resistance of section CB, \(R_{2}=\frac{\rho}{A}\ L_{2}\).

As the two sections of wire AC and CB are in series with each other, they form a potential divider setup.

Hence, p.d. across section AC, \(V_{1}=\frac{R_{1}}{R_{1}+R_{2}}\ E\)

\[=\frac{\frac{\rho}{A}L_{1}}{\frac{\rho}{A}L_{1}+\frac{\rho}{A}L_{2}}\ E=\frac{L_{1}}{L_{1}+L_{2}}\ E\]

Since \(L_{1}+L_{2}=L\),

p.d. across section AC, \(V_{1}=\frac{L_{1}}{L}\ E\).

anderson Seraugoon Junior College

Physics 9749

Similarly, p.d. across section CB, \(V_{2}=\frac{L_{2}}{L}\ E\).

The p.d. \(V_{1}\) and \(V_{2}\) are sometimes expressed as \(\frac{E}{L}\ L_{1}\) and \(\frac{E}{L}\ L_{2}\) respectively, where \(\frac{E}{L}\) is a constant called the potential gradient (i.e. the potential drop per unit length).

### Worked Example

A thermistor has a resistance of 1000 \(\Omega\) at room temperature but quickly drops to 300 \(\Omega\) when the temperature is at 80\({}^{\circ}\)C. The thermistor is connected to a buzzer arranged in parallel to a fixed resistor as shown in the circuit below. The effective resistance of the buzzer and fixed resistor is 100 \(\Omega\).

As the setup is a potential divider,

\(V=\frac{100}{100+R_{\text{thermistor}}}\) (6.0)

Hence, \(V_{\text{min}}\) occurs when the resistance of the thermistor is the largest and \(V_{\text{max}}\) occurs when the resistance of the thermistor is the smallest.

\(V_{\text{min}}=\frac{100}{100+1000}\) (6.0) = 0.55 V

\(V_{\text{max}}=\frac{100}{100+300}\) (6.0) = 1.5 V

Therefore, the range of values of p.d. across the

100 \(\Omega\) resistor is from 0.55 V to 1.5 V.

### Balanced potential

* To determine the e.m.f. of a cell, there are two methods:  a) using a voltmeter
* It is a fast and efficient method.
* However, a voltmeter draws some current from the circuit under investigation as it does not have infinite resistance, thus affecting the circuit to be measured. The accuracy of the results obtained depends on the resistance of the voltmeter used. b) using a potentiometer (uses balanced potential method)
* It is a bulky setup that requires the use of a resistance wire and a moving coil galvanometer.
* The galvanometer is used as a current detector. Its needle is normally at the zero mark in the centre and deflects to either side when current flows.
* Measurements are made on the potentiometer when no current passes through the galvanometer (or null deflection).
* This method measures the e.m.f. of a source accurately as no current is drawn from the circuit to be measured.

### Condition for null deflection on the galvanometer

* Consider two e.m.f. sources, \(E_{1}\) and \(E_{2}\), with their high potential ends connected together as shown in the circuit in Fig. 15.11 below. A galvanometer G is connected to detect the presence of current in the circuit, when the switch is closed.
* Depending on the e.m.f. of \(E_{1}\) and \(E_{2}\), the galvanometer will deflect according to the direction of current flow in the circuit when the switch is closed. *

### 2.2 Potentiometer

* A potentiometer makes use of the balanced potential method to determine the potential difference across two points.
* It is more accurate than a voltmeter as all practical voltmeters do not have infinite resistances, and hence, draws current. A potentiometer acts like a voltmeter with infinite resistance as it draws no current from the circuit to be measured.
* A potentiometer setup is shown in the circuit in Fig. 15.13 below:

Figure 15.13:

**ANDERSON SEARINGOON JUNIOR COLLEGE**

**PHYSICS 9749**

* A potentiometer typically comprises of the following components (i) a driver cell (ii) a resistance wire (XY) (iii) a jockey (J) and (iv) a galvanometer
* The unknown p.d. to be measured is to be connected to the ends AB with the point of higher potential connected to A.
* The jockey is then tapped on the wire, causing \(V_{\text{AB}}=V_{\text{XJ}}\).
* When the jockey is moved along the length XY, we want to identify a point on XY where there is null deflection in the galvanometer, which means that no current flows through the galvanometer.
* The point on the wire where null deflection occurs is called the balanced point.
* At balanced point, and the length \(L_{\text{XJ}}\) is called the balance length.
* Therefore, p.d. across XJ, \(V_{\text{XJ}}\) = \(\frac{L_{\text{XJ}}}{L_{\text{XY}}}\)\(V_{\text{XY}}\) \(\text{where}\)\(V_{\text{XY}}\) = p.d across wire XY \(L_{\text{XY}}\) = length of wire XY \(L_{\text{XY}}\) = length of wire XY \(L_{\text{XY}}\) = \(\text{where}\)\(V_{\text{AB}}\) = \(V_{\text{XJ}}\), we can therefore work out that \(V_{\text{AB}}\) = \(\frac{L_{\text{XJ}}}{L_{\text{XY}}}\)\(V_{\text{XY}}\).

**Case 1 (single branch connected across AB)**

* Consider the following potentiometer setup in Fig. 15.14 where a single branch containing a secondary cell and a fixed resistor is connected across AB.
