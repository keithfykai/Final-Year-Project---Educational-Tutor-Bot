### Electrons around the Nucleus

Electrons are considered to be orbiting in circular motion around the nucleus at relatively large distances away. The electrostatic forces of attraction between opposite charges (protons and electrons) provides the required centripetal force for the circular motion.

In the history of the atom, the concept of the atom was revisited and elaborated upon by many scientists and philosophers.

## Appendix A The Nucleus, Isotopes

### Alpha-particle Scattering Experiment

In the "plum-pudding" model, first proposed by J. J. Thomson in 1904, the atom is composed of electrons surrounded by a soup of positive charge to balance the electrons' negative charges, like negatively charged "plums" surrounded by positively charged "pudding".

In 1909, to test the "plum-pudding" model of the atom, Rutherford suggested the alpha-scattering experiment. Two of his students, Geiger & Marsden, carried out the experiment.

a narrow beam of positively charged alpha (\(\alpha\)) particles (helium nuclei) were directed from a radioactive source onto a thin gold foil (\(\sim\) 1 \(\upmu\)m thick) in vacuum.

a zinc sulphide screen (fluorescent material) is mounted such that it could be set at different angles to the gold foil.

a scintillation is observed on the zinc sulphide screen when an \(\alpha\)-particle strikes the screen. It could be deduced that an \(\alpha\)-particle had been deflected from the gold foil to hit the zinc sulphide screen at that angle.

the entire apparatus was set up in a vacuum chamber to ensure that deflection of \(\alpha\)-particles is entirely due to its interaction with gold atoms and not with the air molecules in the chamber.

Results of alpha-scattering experiment:

The number of scintillations (\(n\)) observed at each scattering angle (\(\theta\)) is summarized in the following graph:

## Anderson Serangoon Junior College

PHYSICS 9749

\begin{tabular}{|p{142.3pt}|p{142.3pt}|} \hline
**Observations** & **Interpretation** \\ \hline (a) Majority of the scintillations were observed at a scattering angle of around 0\({}^{\circ}\) to the direct path. & Much of the atom is made up of empty space, hence the nucleus has a very small volume compared to the atom. \\ \hline This indicated that a vast majority of the alpha particles were able to pass through the gold foil with little or no deflection. \\ \hline (b) A small proportion of scintillations were observed at an angle of more than about 10 \({}^{\circ}\) to the direct path. Gold foil & The centre (or nucleus) of an atom is charged. Alpha particles, which are also charged, passing close to the nucleus will experience a repulsive force causing them to deviate. \\ \hline (c) An extremely small proportion of scintillations were observed at a scattering angle of more than 90\({}^{\circ}\). Some of these particles were even detected to reflect back on the path they came from (back scattered). & The alpha particles must have collided with comparatively massive particles to make an about-turn. The fact that so few particles did so confirms that the nucleus is very small, and that most of the atom is empty space. \\ \hline \end{tabular} From the results above, it can be concluded that

1. there is a very dense positively-charged centre core in the atom (nucleus). 2. the nucleus must be very small compared to the atom.

### Rutherford's Model of the Atom

* Every atom has a central core, called the nucleus, which carries all the positive charge and almost all the mass of the atom. The electrons surround the nucleus.
* The atom is made up of mostly empty space; the nucleus occupies only a small fraction of the atom's total volume. \(<10^{-18}\)

**ANDERSON SEARARSOON JUNIOR COLEGEG**

**PHYSICS 9749**

* Further experiments show that the diameter of the atom is about 10\({}^{-10}\)m whereas the nucleus is about 10\({}^{-15}\)m

### Terms and Notations for Representation of Nuclides

* The number of protons in the nucleus of an atom is called the _proton number_ or the _atomic number_. It is denoted by the symbol \(Z\).
* Nuclear particles, both protons and neutrons in a nucleus, are called **nucleons**.
* The number of nucleons (protons and neutrons) in the nucleus of an atom is called the _nucleon number_ or the _mass number_ of the atom. It is denoted by the symbol \(A\).
* Nuclide is a particular species (type) of nucleus that is specified by its proton number and neutron number. In symbol form, a nuclide can be represented by _A_: nucleon number or mass number _Z_: proton number or atomic number _X_: element
* neutron can be written as: 0 n since it has \(A\) = 1 and zero charge _p_: proton can be written as: 1 p or 1 H since the nucleus of hydrogen has only 1 proton _p_: electron can be written as: -1 e since there are no nucleons and has a negative charge

## Appendix B Mass Defect and Nuclear Binding Energy

### Einstein's Mass-Energy Equivalence

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:9]

**Example 2**

What is the binding energy of the nuclide \({}^{4}_{2}\) He? (use mass-defect from Example 1 to solve)

Solution:

**B.4 Binding Energy Per Nucleon Number**

**Nuclear Binding Energy per nucleon** is the average energy released per nucleon when a nucleus is formed from its constituent particles (protons and neutrons). It is obtained by dividing the binding energy by the number of nucleons in the nucleus.

**OR**

**Nuclear Binding Energy per nucleon** is the average energy required per nucleon to break down a nucleus into its constituent particles (protons and neutrons). It is obtained by dividing the binding energy by the number of nucleons in the nucleus.

The binding energy per nucleon of a nucleus is a measure of the nucleus stability. The higher the binding energy per nucleon, the more stable is the nucleus.

**Worked Example**

What is the binding energy per nucleon of \({}^{4}_{2}\) He? (use your answer to example 2 to solve)

Solution:

The binding energy per nucleon of \({}^{4}_{2}\) He = \(\frac{28.479}{4}\) = 7.12 MeV

## Anderson Serangoon Junior College

Physics 9749

### Binding Energy Curve

* The binding energy curve is a plot of binding energy per nucleon against mass number.
* The most stable nuclides are those with the highest binding energy per nucleon which occurs at approximately 8.8 MeV. Iron-56 \({}^{56}\)Fe is one of these stable nuclides. Nuclei on either side of the maximum are less stable.

## Appendix C Nuclear Processes

### Introduction

* A nuclear process (nuclear reaction) is one which causes nuclei to undergo changes.
* Examples of nuclear processes include: 1. Nuclear fission: a heavy nucleus splits into two lighter nuclei of similar sizes. This reaction does not occur in nature naturally, the process is usually man-made.
2. Nuclear fusion: light nuclei fuse to form a heavier nucleus with release of energy. This reaction occurs at very high temperature e.g. in the sun.
3. Radioactive decay: a big unstable nucleus emits an alpha, beta or gamma photons to form daughter nucleus which is more stable. This reaction occurs in nature.

## Anderson Serangoon Junior College

Physics 9749

### Equations to represent nuclear processes

* A nuclear process can be represented by a nuclear equation as shown below: \({}^{235}_{92}\) U + \({}^{1}_{0}\) n \(\rightarrow\)\({}^{139}_{57}\) La + \({}^{94}_{35}\) Br + 3 \({}^{1}_{0}\) n indicating clearly the nucleon number, proton number, chemical symbols, products, reactants and the number of each nuclide/particles involved in each process.
* Below are examples of nuclear equations to represent nuclear processes (reactions).
* Nuclear reaction leads to the discovery of proton Bombardment of nitrogen with \(\alpha\)-particles (first nuclear transformation to be observed in Rutherford's Lab in 1919) \({}^{14}_{7}\) N + \({}^{2}_{2}\) He \(\rightarrow\)\({}^{17}_{8}\) O + \({}^{1}_{1}\) H
* Nuclear reaction leads to the discovery of neutron Bombardment of beryllium with \(\alpha\)-particles (carried out by Chadwick in 1932 which led to the discovery of neutrons) \({}^{9}_{4}\) Be + \({}^{4}_{2}\) He \(\rightarrow\)\({}^{12}_{6}\) C + \({}^{1}_{0}\) n

### Nuclear Fission and Fusion

**Nuclear Fission** is the splitting of a nucleus of high nucleon number into two smaller nuclei of approximately equal mass with the release of energy and neutrons.

For example:

\({}^{235}_{92}\) U + \({}^{1}_{0}\) n \(\rightarrow\)\({}^{236}_{92}\) U

\({}^{236}_{92}\) U \(\rightarrow\)\({}^{141}_{56}\) Ba + \({}^{92}_{36}\) Kr + 3 \({}^{1}_{0}\) n

\({}^{235}_{92}\) U is induced by a neutron to form the highly unstable U-236 nucleus. Then it undergoes nuclear fission to form \({}^{92}_{36}\) Kr and \({}^{141}_{56}\) Ba. Both \({}^{92}_{36}\) Kr and \({}^{141}_{56}\) Ba have higher binding energy per nucleon than \({}^{235}_{92}\) U (as seen in the binding energy curve on pg 11).
* A particular nuclide may split into many different pairs of fission products. For example, \({}^{235}\)U can also undergo fission to form \({}^{140}\)Xe and \({}^{94}\)Sr \({}^{235}_{92}\) U + \({}^{1}_{0}\) n \(\rightarrow\)\({}^{236}_{92}\) U \(\rightarrow\)\({}^{236}_{54}\) Xe + \({}^{94}_{38}\) Sr + 2 \({}^{1}_{0}\) n

**Nuclear Fusion** is the formation of a larger nucleus from two nuclei of low nucleon number, with release of energy.

For example:

\({}^{2}_{1}\) H + \({}^{3}_{1}\)H \(\rightarrow\)\({}^{4}_{2}\) He + \({}^{1}_{0}\) n

One \({}^{2}_{1}\) H and one \({}^{3}_{1}\) H can join together to form \({}^{4}_{2}\) He. \({}^{4}_{2}\) He has a higher binding energy per nucleon than \({}^{2}_{1}\) H and \({}^{3}_{1}\) H.
* However, for a fusion process to occur, a large amount of energy is first required to overcome the mutual electric repulsion of two nuclei in order to fuse them. Hence fusion can only occur under extreme conditions, i.e. at very high temperature.

## Anderson Serangoon Junior College

PHYSICS 9749

### Fusion and Fission on the Binding Energy Curve

* Since Fe-56 has one of the highest binding energy per nucleon, it is the element with the one of the greatest nuclear stability. Nuclides of other elements can take part in fission or fusion processes to form more stable nuclei which have higher binding energy per nucleon.
* The rising part of the binding energy curve shows that elements with low mass number can produce energy by fusion by forming nuclei with larger mass number and higher binding energy per nucleon.
* In contrast, the falling part of the curve shows that very heavy elements with high mass number such as uranium can produce energy by fission of their nuclei to lighter nuclei with higher binding energy per nucleon.
* To understand how energy is released in fission and fusion, refer to the next section.

### Method of Calculation of Energy Released

* Method 1: Using differences in binding energy

Energy released

= total binding energies of final nuclei - total binding energies of initial nuclei

The term "mass defect" applies only to the situation where constituent nucleons forms the nucleus. In situations where a nuclear reaction results in a different nuclei, the term "mass difference" is used.

If the calculated energy released is negative, it implies that energy has to be supplied for the reaction to occur.

**Example 5**: The nuclear equation represents the bombardment of nitrogen with \(\alpha\)-particles

\({}^{14}_{7}\) N + \({}^{4}_{2}\) He \(\rightarrow\)\({}^{17}_{8}\) O + \({}^{\dagger}_{\dagger}\) H

Check whether the following conservation laws are applicable for this nuclear reaction. Solution:

(i)atomic number

Total atomic number of the nuclides before reaction =

Total atomic number of the nuclides after reaction =

(ii)mass number

Total mass number of nuclides before reaction =

Total mass number of nuclides after reaction =

(iii)Conservation of mass-energy:

mass of N = 14.00307 u mass of O = 16.99913 u mass of He = 4.00260 u mass of H = 1.00783 u

Total mass before = \({}^{\dagger}_{\ast}\) u Total mass after = \({}^{\dagger}_{\ast}\) u

(iv)Conservation of linear momentum:

Not enough information is given by the question to determine.

In general, nuclear reactions induced by \(\alpha\)-particles cause the emission of either

protons or neutrons depending on the energy of the \(\alpha\)-particles and the nucleus under attack.

**ANDERSON SERANGOON JUNIOR COLEGE**

**PHYSICS 9749**

**Example 6**

A stationary radium nucleus emits an \(\alpha\)-particle spontaneously. Find the energy released and velocities of the \(\alpha\)-particle and the recoiled Radon (Rn) nucleus.

\({}^{226}_{88}\) Ra \(\rightarrow\)\({}^{222}_{86}\) Rn + \({}^{4}_{2}\) He

226.0254 \(u\)

Solution:

Mass-energy, as well as momentum, is conserved in nuclear reactions. We can use this to determine whether a given reaction will occur or not.

If the total mass of the products is less than the total mass of the initial particles, then the energy will be released by the reaction - it will appear as kinetic energy of the outgoing particles.

But if the total mass of the products is greater than the total mass of the initial reactants, the reaction requires energy. The reaction will then not occur unless the bombarding particles have sufficient kinetic energy.

**Example 7**

Two deuterium ( \({}^{2}_{1}\) H ) nuclei fuse to produce one \({}^{3}_{2}\) He nucleus and a neutron.

(a) Write down the nuclear equation for this reaction.

(b) Calculate the total mass defects before and after the fusion.

(c) Find the energy released in MeV.

mass of \({}^{2}_{1}\) H = 2.0141 \(u\)

mass of \({}^{3}_{2}\) He = 3.0160 \(u\)

mass of proton = 1.0073 \(u\)

mass of neutron = 1.0087 \(u\)

Solution:

## Appendix D Radioactive Decay

### Introduction

* The positively charged and closely spaced protons in a nucleus have huge electrical forces of repulsion between them. At the same time, the neutrons and protons within the nucleus are bounded to one another by strong nuclear forces of attraction.
* One important aspect of the strong nuclear force is that it is a short-range force: acting over a very short distance. For electric forces, it can act over great distances and are therefore long-range forces. A delicate balance between these two opposing forces keeps most nuclei stable.
* If a nuclide contains too many or too few neutrons relative to the number of protons, the nucleus becomes unstable as the binding between the nucleons is reduced. As seen in the figure on the right, stable nuclides (dots on the graph) are located in an area known as the valley of stability and unstable nuclides lie in the shaded regions.
* Stable nuclei tend to have same number of protons as neutrons, up to about \(Z\approx 20\). Beyond this, stable nuclei contain more neutrons than protons as electrical repulsion increases, so a greater number of neutrons (which exert only the attractive nuclear force) are required to maintain stability. For \(Z\) above 82, there are no completely stable nuclides as no number of neutrons can overcome the greatly increased electric repulsion. A stable nucleus is one that stays together indefinitely and an unstable nucleus is one that comes apart, resulting in radioactive decay.
* **Radioactive decay** or **radioactivity** is the spontaneous and random decay of a nucleus with the emission of an alpha particle or a beta particle, and usually accompanied by the emission of a gamma ray photon, to obtain a more stable nucleus.

anderson Serangoon Junior College

Physics 9749

Natural radioactivity is observed in unstable isotopes that exist in nature.

Artificial radioactivity can be acquired by isotopes as a result of nuclear reactions.

### Spontaneous and random nature of radioactive decay

Radioactive decay processes are spontaneous.

**Spontaneous decay** means the decay occurs on its own and is unaffected by environmental or external factors such as temperature and pressure.

Other external factors include:

physical parameters (e.g. electric or magnetic fields in the environment)

chemical composition (e.g. decay rate of Uranium remains the same in any sample containing Uranium like UCI\({}_{3}\), UO\({}_{2}\) or UF\({}_{3}\))

Radioactive decay is also a random process.

**Random decay** means the nucleus has constant probability of decay per unit time.

There is no way to predict when any individual nucleus will decay.

Random decay means particles are not emitted at equal time interval, and it is also impossible to know the direction of emission of particles.

This irregularity of decay may be demonstrated by the Geiger-Muller tube (GM tube). GM tube is used to detect radioactive particles, making use of their ionising property. When connected to a loud speaker, you can hear a 'click' for each radioactive particle entering the tube. The 'clicks' heard will be irregular.

### Background Radiation

Not only does radiation come from elements in the form of radioactivity, some come from our natural environment, others from human activities and devices. The various sources include:

cosmic rays entering the Earth's atmosphere from outer space

radioactivity emissions from contaminated apparatus, rocks, soil and buildings

Because of these, any radiation detector placed in a location with no radioactive sources nearby will usually register a count of 20 to 50 per minute. This is known as background radiation.

In experiments determining count rates from a specific radioactive source, and the emission from the radioactive source is high (e.g. 5000 counts per minute), the background count can be neglected without much error **BUT** the rule in conducting a radioactivity experiment is for the background count to be recorded first and its values deducted from the count rates obtained in subsequent readings.

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:20]

## Anderson Serangoon Junior College

Physics 9749

In travelling the same distance in a given material, a \(\gamma\)-ray produces 1 ionised atom, a \(\beta\)-particle will on average produce about 1000 ionised atoms and an \(\alpha\)-particle will produce 1,000,000 ionised atoms.

\(\alpha\) and \(\beta\) particles are better ionising agents as they are more massive and possess charge.

A radiation's ionising power affects its penetration. The stronger the ionising power, the weaker the penetration since the radiation travels a shorter distance before all of its energy gets absorbed.

### 4.5 Changes in the Nucleus during Radioactive Decay

When radioactivity involves the emission of either an electron or a helium nucleus, the unstable parent nucleus becomes a different element by either of these processes - \(\alpha\), \(\beta\) and \(\gamma\) emission. The new nucleus is called the daughter nucleus.

\begin{tabular}{l l} \(\alpha\)-emission: & \\ \(\gamma\) & An \(\alpha\)-emission results in a new & \\ \(\gamma\) & atom with a mass number 4 less & \\ \(\gamma\) & and an atomic number 2 less than & \\ \(\gamma\) & the original atom. & \\ \(\gamma\) & Examples of radioactive isotopes that & \\ \(\gamma\) & emit \(\alpha\) particles: polonium-210, & \\ \(\gamma\) & americium-241 & \\ \(\beta\)-emission & \\ \(\gamma\) & In a beta decay, the electron & \\ \(\gamma\) & emitted is not an orbital electron & \\ \(\gamma\) & of the atom. Instead it originates & \\ \(\gamma\) & from the nucleus through a & \\ \(\gamma\) & nuclear transformation in which & \\ \(\gamma\) & a neutron changes into a & \\ \(\gamma\) & proton: \(\stackrel{{ i}}{{o}}\)\(n\rightarrow\)\(\stackrel{{ i}}{{p}}\)\(+\)\(\stackrel{{ i}}{{e}}\). & \\ \(\gamma\) & Positive \(\beta\)-emission (positron & \\ \(\gamma\) & decay) can also occur. This & \\ \(\gamma\) & originates through a nuclear & \\ \(\gamma\) & transformation in which a & \\ \(\gamma\) & proton converts into a neutron: & \\ \(\gamma\) & \(\stackrel{{ i}}{{p}}\)\(\rightarrow\)\(\stackrel{{ i}}{{o}}\)\(n\)\(+\)\(\stackrel{{ i}}{{e}}\) & \\ \(\gamma\) & Examples of radioactive isotopes that emit \(\beta\) particles: Caesium-137, Sodium-22 & \\ \(\gamma\) & A \(\beta\)-emission results in a new nucleus with a mass number unchanged and an atomic number 1 more or 1 less than the original nucleus. During the process of a beta decay, a third particle called neutrino (\(\upsilon\)) is released. \\ \(\gamma\) & Existence of neutrino: \\ \(1\). & In a beta decay from a single type of nucleus, the total energy released in the reaction is always a fixed value. If the daughter nucleus and beta are the only products, by conservation of momentum and energy, the daughter nucleus will gain very little kinetic energy as its mass is very much bigger than \(\beta\)-particles. Hence beta particle should gain almost all the energy released. \\ \(2\). & However, experimentally, it is found that beta particles from a single type of nucleus are emitted over a range of continuous energies as opposed to alpha decay, in which alpha particles are emitted withdiscrete energies. This suggests a violation of conservation of energy and momentum.
3. It was thus hypothesized there should be a particle which has a very small mass and no charge and acts almost like a photon, emitted during the decay. Hence, the energy released must be split randomly between beta and the other particle.
4. This other particle was included to account for conservation of linear as well as angular momentum. It is called the neutrino.

Neutrino was detected experimentally in 1956 and concluded to have the following properties:

* it has zero electric charge
* its mass is zero or very small (\(\sim 10^{-36}\) kg or less)
* it interacts very weakly with matter and is therefore very hard to detect
* \(\gamma\)-emission:

\(\gamma\)-emission often follows \(\alpha\) or \(\beta\)-emission which usually leaves the daughter nucleus in an excited nuclear state. The daughter nuclide would then return to a lower energy state by emitting high frequency electromagnetic wave called \(\gamma\)-rays. This process is called de-excitation.
* Since \(\gamma\)-emission is caused by the change in nuclear energy states in the daughter nuclide, therefore, if nuclear state transition takes place in a few steps, \(\gamma\)-rays of several frequencies would be emitted. \(\begin{array}{c}2^{4}\text{Na}\\ 12\text{Na}\\ 24\text{Mg}^{*}\\ 13\text{Mg}^{*}\\ \end{array}\rightarrow\begin{array}{c}2^{4}\text{Mg}^{*}\\ 13\text{Mg}\\ 13\text{Mg}\\ \end{array}+\begin{array}{c}0\\ \text{e}\\ \text{\gamma}\\ \text{\gamma}\\ \end{array}\)
* A \(\gamma\)-emission results in both the atomic and mass number unchanged. This process is also known as isomeric transition.

### Decay Curve

* Like all statistical random processes, the rate of decay of a radioactive sample is directly proportional to N, the number of radioactive atom present in the sample, i.e. \(\frac{\text{d}N}{\text{d}t}\propto\text{N}\).
* During decay, the number of undecayed nuclei will decrease, hence \(\frac{\text{d}N}{\text{d}t}\) is negative. The rate of decay is also known as the activity.
* **Activity**, A, is defined as the number of nuclear disintegrations per unit time.
* Thus \(A=-\frac{dN}{\alpha t}\propto N\xrightarrow{}A=-\frac{dN}{\alpha t}=\lambda N\) where \(\lambda\) is a constant, known as the decay constant, of the radioactive nuclide. Different radioactive nuclides have different values of \(\lambda\).

* Since activity and mass of undecayed nuclei are directly proportional to \(N\), they also follow the same exponential decay curve and they can be represented by the following equations: \[A=A_{\rm o}\,{\rm e}^{-\,i\,t}\] \[m=m_{\rm o}\,{\rm e}^{-\,i\,t}\] where \(A_{\rm o}\) and \(m_{\rm o}\) are the activity and mass of undecayed nuclei at time \(t\) = 0 respectively.
* **Count rate** is the number of emissions received by a detector per unit time from a radioactive source, which may include background radiation.
* **Background count** is the number of counts recorded by a radiation detector from background radiation in the absence of a radioactive source.

Since count rate \(C\) received by a radioactive detector (e.g. the Geiger-Muller tube) is directly proportional to the activity, \(C\) also follows the same decay curve: \[C=C_{\rm o}\,{\rm e}^{-\,i\,t}\]

**ANDERSON SERANGOON JUNIOR COLEGEG PHYSICS 9749**

* Hence the vertical axis of the decay curve above can also be activity, mass of undecayed nuclei or count rate.

### Half-life

* The **half-life**\(\mathrm{t_{1/2}}\) is the _average time_ taken for the _activity_ of a particular _radioactive_ _nuclide to fall to half of its initial value.
* Thus if \(N_{b}\) is the original amount of radioactive nuclide present in the sample, at a time equals to half-life later, the number of radioactive nuclide is \(\mathrm{\char 37}\)\(N_{b}\).

* Relation between \(\lambda\) and \(\mathrm{t_{1/2}}\): If at \(t=0\), \(N=N_{0}\), then \(N=N_{0}\) e \({}^{-\lambda\,t}\) When \(t=\mathrm{t_{1/2}}\), \(N=\mathrm{\char 37}\)\(N_{0}\) Hence, \(\mathrm{\char 37}\)\(N_{b}=N_{0}\) e \({}^{-\lambda\,t_{1}}\)\(\mathrm{\char 37}\)\(\lambda=\frac{\ln 2}{\mathrm{t_{1/2}}}\)

## Appendix E Uses of Radioactivity and Biological Effects of Radiation

### Uses of Radioactivity

Cobalt-60 emits emit penetrating rays which can be used to penetrate deep into welding to reveal faults and to check for consistency of thickness of sheets of paper or plastic.

Radioactive nuclide can also be used as tracer. Nitrogen-15 is used as tracer in plants and Technetium-99 is used to trace blood flow in the heart and lungs.

Gamma radiation like Cobalt-60 can also be used to kill cancerous cells by focusing a high dose of it at the defect cells. Gamma Knife therapy uses doses of radiation to kill cancer cells and shrink tumors, delivered precisely to avoid damaging healthy brain tissue. Gamma Knife radiosurgery is able to accurately focus many beams of gamma radiation to converge on one or more tumors. Each individual beam is of relatively low intensity, so the radiation has little effect on intervening brain tissue and is concentrated only at the tumor itself. The non-invasive nature of gamma knife makes it very suitable for treating tumors in the brain region.

Ar Archaeological Dating with Carbon-14 Carbon dating is a variety of radioactive dating which is applicable only to matter which was once living and presumed to be in equilibrium with the atmosphere, taking in carbon dioxide from the air for photosynthesis. Presuming the rate of production of carbon-14 to be constant, the activity of a sample can be directly compared to the equilibrium activity of living matter and the age calculated.

## 2 Biological Effects of Radiation

* Immediate effects of over exposure to radiation includes nausea, vomiting, bloody diarrhoea, loss of hair, coma and even death. Delayed effect includes leukemia, weaken immune system and will even affect your offspring.
* Precautions against radiation hazards
* Radioactive sources should be kept in well protected, lead lined rooms and boxes.
* Signs should be put up to inform people of the present of radioactive source.
* No direct contact should be made when handling the radioactive sources
* Special protective clothing should be worn during experiment.
* No food and drinks should be taken when doing radioactive experiment.
* Effects of radiation on health Radioactive materials that decay spontaneously produce ionizing radiation, which has sufficient energy to strip away electrons from atoms (creating two charged ions) or to break some chemical bonds. Any living tissue in the human body can be damaged by ionizing radiation in a unique manner. The body attempts to repair the damage, but sometimes the damage is of a nature that cannot be repaired or it is too severe or widespread to be repaired. Also mistakes made in the natural repair process can lead to cancerous cells.

## 3 Alpha particles

As any heavy charged particle, alpha particles lose their energy within a very short distance in dense media, causing significant damage to surrounding biomolecules. The health effects of alpha particles depend heavily upon how exposure takes place. Generally, external alpha irradiation (exposure) is not harmful because alpha particles are completely absorbed by the thin layer of dead skin cells in the outermost layer of the skin as well as by a few centimeters of air.

However, if alpha emitters have been inhaled, ingested (swallowed), or absorbed into the blood stream, sensitive living tissue can be exposed to alpha radiation. There is resulting biological damage to vital organs and increase in the risk of cancer; in particular, alpha radiation is known to cause lung cancer in humans when alpha emitters are inhaled.

The death of Marie Curie at age 66 from leukemia, was likely caused from radiation exposure, such as alpha particles from radium, during her years of important research on the subject.

The 2006 assassination of Russian dissident Alexander Litvinenko is thought to have been caused by poisoning with polonium-210, an active alpha emitter.

## 4 Beta particles

Direct exposure to beta particles is a hazard, because emissions from strong sources can redden or even burn the skin. However, emissions from inhaled or ingested beta particle emitters are the greatest concern. Beta particles released directly to living tissue can cause damage at the molecular level, which can disrupt cell function. Because they are much smaller and have less charge than alpha particles, beta particles generally travel further into tissues. As a result, the cellular damage is more dispersed.

* the body is mostly empty space at the atomic level and gamma rays are vanishingly small in size.

Gamma rays can ionize atoms in tissue directly or cause what are known as "secondary ionizations." Ionizations are caused when energy is transferred from gamma rays to atomic particles such as electrons (which are essentially the same as beta particles). These energized particles then interact with tissue to form ions through secondary ionizations. Because gamma rays are photons and thus interact less frequently with matter than alpha and beta particles, they are more penetrating and the damage they cause can occur much farther into tissue (that is, farther from the source of radiation).
