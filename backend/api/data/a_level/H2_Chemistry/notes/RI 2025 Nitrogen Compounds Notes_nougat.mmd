### Solubility

* All three classes of amines can form hydrogen bonds with water.
* Why are the lower members very soluble in water?
* their molecules can interact with water molecules via hydrogen bonding
* their molecules have relatively small non-polar hydrocarbon portions
* The higher members have poor solubility in water because they have relatively large non-polar hydrocarbon portions. Borderline solubility in water is reached at about six carbon atoms.

### Odour

* The smell of the early members of the amine series is similar to that of ammonia, though with a slightly fishy character.
* Dimethylamine and trimethylamine are found in rotting fish and are partly responsible for its peculiar smell.
* Putrescine (butane-1,4-diamine) and cadaverine (pentane-1,5-diamine) are found in decaying animal flesh.

### Aromatic amines

* Aromatic amines are liquids or solids with high boiling points. They are generally toxic.
* Phenylamine is only sparingly soluble in water due to its large non-polar benzene ring which interferes with the formation of hydrogen bonding between the -NH\({}_{2}\) group and water.
* Phenylamine has appreciable solubility in non-polar organic solvents. Its ability to dissolve in fats means that it is readily absorbed through the skin.

### Amines as bases

* An amine, like ammonia, can act as a **Bronsted-Lowry base** (i.e. a proton acceptor) and **a Lewis base** (i.e. an electron-pair donor).

An amine can be a **Bronsted-Lowry base** (i.e. an electron-pair donor).

An amine can be a **Bronsted-Lowry base** (i.e. an electron-pair donor).

The strength of an amine as a Lewis base is dependent on the **availability of the lone pair of electrons on the nitrogen atom to form a dative covalent bond with a proton.

To compare the basicity of amines, keep in mind the following:

* any factor that increases the electron density on the N atom increases the basicity of the amine,
* any factor that decreases the electron density on the N atom decreases the basicity of the amine.

### Relative basicities of primary, secondary and tertiary amines in the gaseous phase

* The basicities of methylamine, dimethylamine and trimethylamine in the gaseous phase increase in the following order:
* The basicity of each given amine depends on the availability of the lone pair of electrons on the N atom to form a dative covalent bond with an electron-deficient species.
* The methyl group is electron-donating. It increases the electron-density at the N atom, making the lone pair of electrons on the N atom more readily available for coordination to an electron-deficient species.
* Since the number of electron-donating methyl groups bonded to the N atom increases from CH\({}_{3}\)NH\({}_{2}\) to (CH\({}_{3}\))\({}_{2}\)NH to (CH\({}_{3}\))\({}_{3}\)N, the strength of the given amines as Lewis bases in the gaseous phase increases in the following order:
* In general, the strength of ammonia and aliphatic amines as Lewis bases in the gaseous phase increases in the following order:
* increasing strength as a Lewis base in the gaseous phase
* increasing number of electron-donating alkyl groups (R-)
* increasing electron density at the N atom
* increasing availability of the lone pair of electrons to form a dative covalent bond with an electron-deficient species

### Relative basicities of amines in aqueous solution

* Amines are relatively weak bases in aqueous solution. Each amine has its characteristic **base dissociation constant**, \(K_{\text{b}}\).
* The relative basicities of amines in aqueous solution can be compared using their \(K_{\text{b}}\) or pK\({}_{\text{b}}\) values. The \(K_{\text{b}}\) values of ammonia and some amines are shown below.
* In CH\({}_{3}\)NH\({}_{2}\), there is **one electron-donating -CH\({}_{3}\) group*
* bonded to the N atom.
* In (CH\({}_{3}\))\({}_{2}\)NH, there are **two electron-donating -CH\({}_{3}\) groups*
* bonded to the N atom.

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:9]

### Effect of substituents on the basicity of aromatic amines

**Worked Example:**

Arrange the following compounds in order of increasing basicity and explain the order:

phenylamine, 4-nitrophenylamine and 4-methylphenylamine.

**Suggested answer:**

* The given compounds can be arranged in the following order of increasing \(K_{0}\) value:

* The basicity of the given compounds depends on the availability of the lone pair of electrons on the nitrogen atom to form a dative covalent bond with a proton. The greater this availability, the more basic the compound.
* 4-Nitrophenylamine is a **weaker base** than phenylalanine.
* In 4-nitrophenylamine, the -NO\({}_{2}\) group is **electron-withdrawing**.
* It **decreases the electron density** at the nitrogen atom of the -NH\({}_{2}\) group, making the **lone pair of electrons less available for coordination to a proton** as compared to that in phenylalanine.
* Hence 4-nitrophenylamine is a weaker base than phenylalanine.
* 4-Methylphenylamine is a **stronger base** than phenylamine.
* In 4-methylphenylamine, the -CH\({}_{3}\) group is **electron-donating**.
* It **increases the electron density** at the nitrogen atom of the -NH\({}_{2}\) group, making the **lone pair of electrons more available for coordination to a proton** as compared to that in phenylalanine.
* Hence 4-methylphenylamine is a stronger base than phenylamine.

### Reaction of ammonia with halogenoalkane (_Refer_ to Halogen Derivatives lecture notes)

* Alkylamines are, in principle, capable of being prepared by nucleophilic substitution reactions of halogenoalkanes with ammonia.
* A problem encountered with this method of preparation of amines: a mixture of products is obtained due to polyalkylation. The use of excess NH\({}_{3}\) in the reaction discourages polyalkylation.
* Since the 1\({}^{\circ}\) amine formed is also nucleophilic, it may undergo further reaction giving a 2\({}^{\circ}\) amine.
* By further alkylation, the 3\({}^{\circ}\) amine and even the quaternary ammonium compound may be formed.
* The actual result is a complex mixture of products.
* On an industrial scale, the products are separated by the addition of alkali to liberate the free amines, followed by fractional distillation.
* **Note:**
* This method is limited to the preparation of aliphatic amines because aryl halides will not undergo nucleophilic substitution reactions with ammonia under such conditions.
* A p-orbital of C\(I\) overlaps with the \(\pi\) electron cloud of the benzene ring
* lone pair of electrons on C\(I\) delocalises into the benzene ring
* the C-C\(I\) bond acquires partial double bond character
* the C-C\(I\) bond is strengthened and is not easily broken

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:12]

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:13]

### Reduction of nitrobenzene

* This method is usually used in the preparation of **primary aromatic amines**.
* Phenylamine is usually prepared in the laboratory by reducing nitrobenzene using granulated tin and concentrated hydrochloric acid.

* Nitrogen (1): Reduction
* Nitrobenzene is reduced to form **C\({}_{6}\)H\({}_{8}\)NH\({}_{3}\)+** under the acidic medium.
* Acid-Base reaction
* NaOH(aq) is added to the mixture **to liberate phenylalanine**.

C\({}_{6}\)H\({}_{8}\)NH\({}_{3}\)+ OH- \(\longrightarrow\) C\({}_{6}\)H\({}_{8}\)NH\({}_{2}\)+ H\({}_{2}\)O

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:15]

* The amine can be **regenerated** from the amine salt by reacting the salt with an alkali (e.g. NaOH).

* The diagrams below illustrate an experiment in which acid is added to a solution of ethylamine.

### Worked Example:

Suggest a simple chemical test which can be used to test for the CH\({}_{3}\)CH\({}_{2}\)NH\({}_{3}\)\({}^{*}\) ion.

**Reagent and condition:** Add NaOH(aq) to the sample and warm the mixture gently.

**Observation:** Pungent CH\({}_{3}\)CH\({}_{2}\)NH\({}_{2}\)(g) evolved and turns damp red litmus paper blue.

**Explanation:**

In an aqueous solution of CH\({}_{3}\)CH\({}_{2}\)NH\({}_{3}\)\({}^{*}\)C/\({}^{*}\), the following equilibrium exists:

**CH\({}_{3}\)CH\({}_{2}\)NH\({}_{3}\)\({}^{*}\)(aq) + H\({}_{2}\)O(l) \(\leftrightarrow\) CH\({}_{3}\)CH\({}_{2}\)NH\({}_{2}\)(aq) + H\({}_{3}\)O\({}^{*}\)(aq) -(1)**

* Addition of NaOH(aq) removes H\({}_{3}\)O\({}^{*}\) ions by neutralisation reaction. This causes [H\({}_{3}\)O\({}^{*}\)] to decrease and hence the equilibrium position of reaction (1) shifts right in accordance to Le Chatelier's principle. This produces more CH\({}_{3}\)CH\({}_{2}\)NH\({}_{2}\)(aq).
* CH\({}_{3}\)CH\({}_{2}\)NH\({}_{2}\) is soluble in water. Warming the mixture gently helps to force more CH\({}_{3}\)CH\({}_{2}\)NH\({}_{2}\) out of the reaction mixture i.e. produces more CH\({}_{3}\)CH\({}_{2}\)NH\({}_{2}\)(g) which will turn damp red litmus paper blue.
* Some properties of amines and amine salts are tabulated below. The formation of amine salts can be used to isolate and characterise amines. It is used to separate amines from neutral or acidic organic compounds.

\begin{tabular}{|p{142.3pt}|p{142.3pt}|} \hline
**Amines** & **Amine Salts** \\  & **R\({}_{2}\)NH\({}_{2}\)\({}^{*}\)** \\  & **R\({}_{3}\)NH\({}^{*}\)** \\ \hline \(\bullet\) water insoluble (except for amines with low M\({}_{*}\)) & \(\bullet\) ionic salts, high melting points \\ \(\bullet\) soluble in organic solvents & \(\bullet\) relatively more water soluble \\ \hline \(\bullet\) some are volatile & \(\bullet\) generally insoluble in non-polar organic solvents \\ \(\bullet\) pungent / fishy odour & \(\bullet\) non-volatile solids \\ \(\bullet\) non-volatile & \(\bullet\) no odour \\ \hline \end{tabular}

### Preparation and reactions of ethylamine

### Relativity basicity

* Basicity increases in the following order: **phenylamine < ammonia < ethylamine**

### 1.1 General Formulae

Amides are derivatives of carboxylic acids that contain the following group:

\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|c|} \hline Amides & RCONH\({}_{2}\) & 1 - Introduction \\ \hline Amides are & & & \\ classified as & & & \\ primary, secondary & & & \\ or tertiary according & & & \\ to the number of & & & \\ alkyl groups & & & \\ bonded to the & & RCONH\({}_{2}\) & R-CONHR\({}^{\ast}\) & R-CONR\({}^{\ast}\)R\({}^{\ast}\) \\ nitrogen atom of the & & & \\ amide group. & primary (1\({}^{\circ}\)) amide & secondary (2\({}^{\circ}\)) amide & tertiary (3\({}^{\circ}\)) amide \\  & & & \(N\)-substituted amide & \\ \hline \end{tabular}

### 1.2 Nomenclature

* To name a 1\({}^{\circ}\) amide, first name the corresponding acid. Drop the -ic acid or -oic acid suffix from the name of the carboxylic acid, and substitute the suffix **-amide**.
* 2\({}^{\circ}\) and 3\({}^{\circ}\) amides are named by treating the alkyl groups on nitrogen as substituents, specifying their positions by the prefix \(N\)-.
* A cyclic amide is termed a **lactam**.

Example:

\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|} \hline  & & \\ \hline caprolactam & & \\ (6-aminohexanoic acid lactam) & & \\ H\(-\)C\(-\)N\(-\)H & & \\ H\({}_{2}\)C & & \\ H\({}_{2}\)C & & \\ \({}_{N}\)C\({}_{0}\) & & \\ \({

### Boiling and melting points

* Amides are polar organic compounds.
* All primary amides except methanamide are crystalline solids due to fairly strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding.
* Compared to 3\({}^{\circ}\) amides, 1\({}^{\circ}\) and 2\({}^{\circ}\) amides have higher melting and boiling points due to the presence of hydrogen bonding between molecules.
* 3\({}^{\circ}\) amide molecules do not form hydrogen bonds with each other since there are no hydrogen atoms directly bonded to the electronegative N atom.

### Solubility

* Lower members of aliphatic amides are soluble in water because the amide molecules can interact with water molecules via hydrogen bonding.
* Solubility of amides in water decreases with increasing size of the non-polar hydrocarbon chain.

\begin{tabular}{c c c} \hline \hline
**Amides** & **RCONH\({}_{2}\)** & **3 - The Lack of Basicity** \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}
* The simple amide structure shows a lone pair of electrons on the nitrogen atom. Unlike amines, however, amides are only very weakly basic. In fact, we regard the amide functional group to be **neutral**. Amides are neutral to litmus.
* Why is the amide functional group **effectively neutral?**

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|} \hline The lack of basicity in amides arises because the orbital & \multicolumn{1}{c|}{} & \multicolumn{1}{c|}{} \\ containing the **lone pair of electrons on the nitrogen atom** & \multicolumn{1}{c|}{} & \multicolumn{1}{c|}{} \\ overlaps with the \(\pi\) electron cloud of the adjacent C=O bond & \multicolumn{1}{c|}{} & \multicolumn{1}{c|}{} \\ and the lone pair of electrons is **delocalised**. & \multicolumn{1}{c|}{} & \multicolumn{1}{c|}{} \\ \end{tabular}

Hence, this lone pair of electrons on the nitrogen atom is not available for coordination to a proton.

**Exercise 1** (N2014/P1/Q22)

The following diagram shows the structure of the tetrapeptide T.

When 0.1 mole of T is heated under reflux with NaOH(aq) until no further reaction occurs, how many moles of NaOH(aq) will react?

### Reduction

* Amides can undergo **reduction** to form amines using LiA\(\mathrm{H}_{4}\) in dry ether. (_Refer to Amines Section 4.3_)
* **Note:**\(\mathrm{H}_{2}\), Ni, heat and NaBH\({}_{4}\) cannot be used to reduce amides.

\begin{tabular}{c c c} \hline \hline
**Amides** & **RCONH\({}_{2}\)** & **6 - Summary** \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}
* Amides are effectively neutral. Amides are not basic because the orbital containing the lone pair of electrons on the nitrogen atom overlaps with the \(\pi\) electron cloud of the adjacent C=O bond and the lone pair of electrons is delocalised. This lone pair of electrons on the nitrogen atom is therefore not available for coordination to a proton.

### 2-Amino Acids

* Amino acids are organic compounds that contain at least one amino group (-NH\({}_{2}\)) and one carboxylic acid group (-COOH).
* Amino acids can be classified as \(\alpha\), \(\beta\), \(\lambda\), and so on, according to the location of the amine group on the carbon chain that contains the carboxylic acid group.
* Although more than 700 different amino acids are known to occur naturally, a group of 20 of them commands special attention. These 20 are the amino acids that are normally present in proteins.
* All the 20 amino acids from which proteins are derived from are **q-amino acids (or 2-amino acids)** i.e. the amine group is attached to the \(\alpha\) carbon atom i.e. the carbon atom that is bonded to the carboxylic acid group.

Our focus will be the **_a-amino acids (or 2-amino acids)_.

* They are the **basic building blocks of proteins**.
* They differ only in the substituent (-R) attached to the \(\alpha\) carbon atom.
* The 20 amino acids commonly present in protein structure are shown on the next page.

### 2 Nomenclature and Classification

* Amino acids are named systematically by considering them as amino derivatives of carboxylic acids. However, many are still referred to by their original names.

\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|} \hline Name & Abbreviation & Structure \\ \hline glycine & Gly & H2N-CH2-COOH \\ (aminoethanoic acid) & & \\ \hline alanine & Ala & H2N-CHCOOH \\ (2-aminopropanoic acid) & & CH3 \\ \hline phenylalanine & Phe & H2N-CHCOOH \\ (2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid) & & CH2-C6H5 \\ \hline aspartic acid & Asp & H2N-CHCOOH \\ (2-aminobutanediolic acid) & & CH2-COOH \\ \hline lysine & Lys & H2N-CHCOOH \\ (2,6-diaminohexanoic acid) & & CH2-CH2-CH2-NH2 \\ \hline \end{tabular}
* Amino acids may be classified as neutral, basic or acidic according to the number of amino and carboxyl groups they contain. The neutral amino acids contain an equal number of amino and carboxyl groups (usually one of each). The basic amino acids contain an extra amino group. The acidic amino acids contain an extra carboxyl group.

* The structures of the twenty amino acids that are commonly found in proteins are shown below.

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|} \hline
**Name** & **Structure** \\ \hline glycine & Gly & \(\mathrm{H_{2}N}\)\(-\)CH\(-\)COOH \\ \hline alanine & Ala & \(\mathrm{H_{2}N}\)\(-\)CH\(-\)COOH \\ \hline valine & Val & \(\mathrm{H_{2}N}\)\(-\)CH\(-\)COOH \\ \hline leucine & Leu & \(\mathrm{H_{2}N}\)\(-\)CH\(-\)COOH \\ \hline isoleucine & Ile & \(\mathrm{H_{2}N}\)\(-\)CH\(-\)COOH \\ \hline methionine & Met & \(\mathrm{H_{2}N}\)\(-\)CH\(-\)COOH \\ \hline proline & Pro & \(\mathrm{H_{2}C}\)\(-\)CH\({}_{2}\) \\ \hline phenylalanine & Phe & \(\mathrm{H_{2}N}\)\(-\)CH\(-\)COOH \\ \hline tryptophan & Trp & \(\mathrm{H_{2}N}\)\(-\)CH\(-\)COOH \\ \hline \end{tabular}

* Some of these amino acids are **essential amino acids**. They are not biosynthesized by the human body and must be provided for in the diet.
* A deficiency in any one of these essential amino acids prevents growth and may even cause death.

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|} \hline
**Name** & **Structure** \\ \hline asparatic acid & Asp & \(\mathrm{H_{2}N}\)\(-\)CH\(-\)COOH \\ \hline glutamic acid & Glu & \(\mathrm{H_{2}N}\)\(-\)CH\(-\)COOH \\ \hline \end{tabular}

* **2-amino acids with polar side chain**

### Optical Activity

* With the sole exception of aminoethanoic acid (glycine), all 2-amino acids contain at least a chiral carbon atom and consequently display enantiomerism and can exist in optically active forms.

### Formation of zwitterions

* Although we commonly write amino acids with an intact carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and amine group (-NH\({}_{2}\)), their actual structure in the dry solid state is **zwitterionic**.
* The amino acid undergoes an internal acid-base reaction in which
* the carboxylic acid group loses a proton, giving a carboxylate ion (-COOH),
* and the amine group is protonated to an aminium group (-NH\({}_{3}\)*).

* Amino acids exist as **zwitterions**.
* The zwitterion is also often referred to as a **dipolar ion**. Note, however, that it is not an ion but an electrically neutral molecule with oppositely charged ends.

* A **zwitterion** is an electrically neutral molecule with oppositely charged ends
* The zwitterionic nature of amino acids gives them some unusual properties as described below.

* Amino acids are crystalline solids with **high melting points** or decomposition points, usually above 200 \({}^{\circ}\)C.
* Example: Glycine has a melting point of 262 \({}^{\circ}\)C.
* Amino acids are **much more soluble in water** than in non-polar solvents.
* Amino acids are **less acidic** than most carboxylic acids and **less basic** than most amines.

* Amino acids are **less acidic** than most carboxylic acids and **less basic** than most amines.

* The acidic part of an amino acid is the -NH\({}_{3}\)* group.
* \(K_{\text{a}}\) of -NH\({}_{3}\)* \(<K_{\text{a}}\) of -COOH The basic part of an amino acid is the -COOH- group.
* \(K_{\text{b}}\) of -COOH- \(<K_{\text{b}}\) of -NH\({}_{2}\)

### Acidic and basic groups in amino acids

* Amino acids are **amphoteric** (i.e. having both acidic and basic properties) since they contain both acidic and basic groups.
* Consider an aqueous solution of an amino acid.

* Consider the **protonated form of 2-aminopropanoic acid (i.e. protonated alanine)**. It is considered to be a dibasic acid with two **p**K\({}_{\text{a}}\) values of 2.3 and 9.7. It can donate two protons during its complete titration with a solution of a base.

The graph below shows the titration curve for protonated alanine. The p_K\({}_{a1}\)_ and p_K\({}_{a2}\)_ of protonated alanine are sufficiently far apart such that two equivalent points can be seen in the titration curve.
* The first equivalence point corresponds to the completion of Step 1 above while the second equivalence point corresponds to the completion of Step 2 above.

### **Condensation reaction with acid chloride**

* The amine group in amino acids can react with an acid chloride, e.g. ethanol chloride, to form amide.

### **Condensation reaction with alcohols**

* This reaction is fundamentally similar to the reactions of carboxylic acids, with the exception that the mineral acid catalyst ultimately reacts with the -NH\({}_{2}\) group.

### Peptide formation

* Having both an \(-\)NH\({}_{2}\) group and a \(-\)COOH group, an amino acid is ideally suited to form an amide linkage. Under the **proper conditions**, the \(-\)NH\({}_{2}\) group of one molecule condenses with the \(-\)COOH group of another to form an amide bond.
* Consider the formation of a **dipeptide**.
* The product is an amide called a **dipeptide** because it consists of two amino acid residues.
* The amide linkage (i.e. \(-\)CO\(-\)NH\(-\) structural unit) between the amino acid residues is called **a peptide bond**.
* A **peptide bond** (or peptide linkage) is the special name given to the amide bond (or amide linkage) formed between the alpha \(-\)NH\({}_{2}\) group of an \(\alpha\)-amino acid and the alpha \(-\)COOH group of another \(\alpha\)-amino acid.

### Peptides and Proteins

* A **peptide** is a compound containing two or more amino acid residues linked by peptide bonds between the \(\alpha\)-amino group of each amino acid and the \(\alpha\)-carboxyl group of the neighbouring amino acid.
* Each amino acid unit in the peptide is called an **amino acid residue**.
* **Note:** Any number of amino acids can undergo condensation to form a peptide.
* In living systems, amino acids undergo condensation reaction to form polypeptides and proteins with the aid of enzymes that form peptide bonds (i.e. amide linkages or amide bonds) between the \(\alpha\)-amino group of one amino acid to the \(\alpha\)-carboxyl group of another.
* In general
* **Note:** Proteins are polyamides. Proteins are condensation polymers. Proteins are biopolymers of \(\alpha\)-amino acids (i.e. 2-amino acids). Proteins are macromolecules consisting of one or more polypeptide chains. Proteins are polypeptides that have some biological function. Proteins are naturally occurring polypeptides made up of 40 to 4000 amino acids.
* Proteins play a central role in biological systems and are essential for life in all living organisms. They serve many functions in living systems as shown in the table below. 
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|} \hline
**Type of protein** & **Function** & **Example** \\ \hline Enzymes & \begin{tabular}{l} Catalyse metabolic processes which produce energy, \\ build up new cell structures or destroy old ones. \\ \end{tabular} & \begin{tabular}{l} Proteases such as _pepsin_, _t trypsin_, \\ _chymotrypsin_ \\ \end{tabular} \\ \hline Transport proteins & \begin{tabular}{l} Move metabolites around the cell or around the whole \\ organism. \\ \end{tabular} & \begin{tabular}{l} _Haemoglobin \& myoglobin_ \\ - transport and store oxygen \\ \end{tabular} \\ \hline Structural proteins & \begin{tabular}{l} Provide the framework which defines the shape and \\ size of cells. \\ \end{tabular} & \begin{tabular}{l} _Keratin_ in hair and fingernails \\ Collagen in cartilage \\ \end{tabular} \\ \hline Contractile proteins & Invoke in muscle and cell movement and contraction & \begin{tabular}{l} _m myosin_ and _actin_ in muscles \\ \end{tabular} \\ \hline Hormones or & \begin{tabular}{l} Control the level and type of cell functions including \\ regulatory proteins \\ \end{tabular} & 
\begin{tabular}{l} _Insuin - to control blood sugar_ \\ metabolism and reproduction. \\ \end{tabular} \\ \hline Immunoproteins & Invoke in the functioning of immune system & Antibodies \\ \hline \end{tabular}
* Regardless of their function, all proteins have a fundamentally similar structure and are made up of many amino acids linked together in a long chain. However, each protein differs from another protein in the number, type and sequence of constituent amino acids.

### Enzymatic hydrolysis

* For peptides containing more than 50 residues, the use of chemical hydrolysis is generally not practical because unwanted side products may accumulate and interfere with the results.
* Enzymatic hydrolysis using enzymes known as proteases/peptidases (e.g. trypsin, chymotrypsin and pepsin) is usually employed as these enzymes selectively hydrolyse specific peptide bonds.
* For example, trypsin only catalyses the hydrolysis of the peptide bond at the carboxyl end of the basic amino acids, arginine and lysine.
* By using a variety of proteases, multiple overlapping fragments are formed and this can be used for primary sequence determination of proteins.

### Exercise 3

Partial hydrolysis of a hexapeptide gives the following fragments:

Gly-Pro-Arg, Arg-Ala, Pro-Leu-Gly.

What is the structure of the hexapeptide?
