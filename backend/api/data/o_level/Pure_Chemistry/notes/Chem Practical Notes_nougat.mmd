## Notes on Qualitative Analysis

In the practical examination, candidates are usually provided with unknown substance(s) and the necessary experimental procedures. They are expected to carry out tests according to the given procedures, record all observations and deduce the nature of the unknown substance(s).

The following are some notes that could be of great help to candidates when performing a qualitative experiment.

1. If candidates are given the following instruction: 1. "Carry out the following experiments and record all your observations and deductions of the unknown substance \(\mathbf{W}\)." Such instruction implies that candidates are expected to identify the unknown with the results of the experiments. For example: \(\mathbf{W}\) is copper(II) nitrate. 2. "You are not required to identify the unknown substance \(\mathbf{W}\) but you must describe all that you observe, identify any gas evolved and state any conclusions you draw from the experiments." In this case, candidates are expected to state the action of the unknown substance \(\mathbf{W}\) with other reagents or certain identifiable products produced by \(\mathbf{W}\). For example: \(\mathbf{W}\) is an acid or alkali in nature or \(\mathbf{W}\) is reducing or oxidizing in nature. 3. "You are required to identify the anion of the sodium salt and the metal of the oxide by carrying out tests of your own in addition to those described. Positive tests only are required." In this case, candidates are required to design and perform confirmatory tests to identify the substance given. The details of the tests should be clearly described. 2. Candidates are advised to record all observations immediately after performing a test. Recordings should be brief but complete. Phrases should be used instead of sentences for recording changes observed. Negative results should also be recorded as deduction may sometimes be drawn from them. Chemical formulae could be used instead of spelling out the chemical name in full. 3. "Observations" refer to changes that are seen by candidates during experiments. Some of the common visible changes include: 1. changes in colour, 2. formation of a precipitate, 3. evolution of gases, 4. absorbing or giving out heat. Candidates should bear in mind that if there is no visible change observed after performing a test, the phrase "No visible reaction" should be recorded under the Observation Column rather than leaving it blank.

Gases that are produced due to the addition of reagents must not be recorded as observations. For example, the use of aqueous ammonia as reagent is always associated with evolution of ammonia gas. This is not a change, hence should not be regarded as an observation.
5. It will be easy to distinguish and identify gases if candidates learn in advance their colours, odours and effects on moist litmus paper. The flowchart below illustrates the basic approach for distinguishing and identifying gases.
6. Candidates should bear in mind the following when making a deduction: 1. A deduction must be specific. Statement, such as "W contains Cu++", should be written instead of using statement like "Copper or Cu++". 2. The identity of a gas should not be given as a deduction. Such information should be regarded as an observation. Instead, the identity of the substance that is responsible for the gas to give off should be regarded as part of the deductions. 3. The recording of a deduction should be made as soon as an observation is recorded for such deduction will serve to provide an immediate source of information for subsequent tests.
7. In experiments where conclusions about the identity or the nature of the unknowns need to be drawn, candidates may simply combine all deductions recorded during the experiment. For instance, if substance **W** was found containing Copper(II) ions from one test and sulphate(VI) ions from another, the conclusion may be made as: "W is copper(II) sulphate".
