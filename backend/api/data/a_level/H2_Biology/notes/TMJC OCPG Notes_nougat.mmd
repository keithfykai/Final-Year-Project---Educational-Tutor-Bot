## Narratives

An understanding of _Genetics and Inheritance_ that would help make sense of the transition from molecular to organismal level. _Genetics and Inheritance_ provides the molecular basis to the understanding of how variations in populations arise and this is important in the study of biological evolution. At the cellular level, expression of genes involves cellular structures such as the nucleus, endoplasmic reticulum and ribosome. Many essential products of gene expression are enzymes involved in biochemical pathways which control physiological functions. As such, mutation of genes may give rise to dysfunctional proteins which in turn could result in diseases. Sickle cell anemia and cancer are raised as examples of a monogenic and a multi-genic disease respectively.

The following questions should help students frame their learning:

* How does the genetic make-up of an organism influence its appearance, behavior and survival?
* How can we ensure continuity of human as a species?

_Heritable information, in the form of DNA (and in some cases RNA), provides for continuity of life_

Genetic information is stored in an organism's DNA; expression of genes results in the synthesis of functional products, such as rRNA, tRNA and proteins. These products play a role in intra- and extra-cellular biochemical pathways and influence the physiological processes in organisms.

Genomes contain heritable information necessary for continuity of life at all levels: cell, organism and system. This information is stored and passed on to subsequent generations via DNA. Reproduction can occur at the cellular or organismal level; each progeny needs to receive heritable genetic information from its parents.

An understanding of how eukaryotic, prokaryotic and viral genomes are organized has implications on how gene expression in organisms is controlled. The genome of prokaryotes typically comprises a large circular chromosome and smaller plasmids. Generally, structural genes, which code for proteins essential for bacteria survival, are found in the main chromosome while genes that confer advantages to bacteria survival in stressful environments are found in the plasmids. Prokaryotes reproduce by binary fission. In addition, genetic material can be transferred between bacteria through transformation, transduction and / or conjugation. This transfer of genetic material gives rise to genetic variation within a bacteria population.

## 1 Structure and Organisation of Bacterial Genome

**Core idea 2B-**Candidates should be able to:**

* Describe the structure and organisation of viral, prokaryotic and-eukaryotic genomes (including DNA/RNA, single-/double-stranded, number of nucleotides, packing of DNA, linearity/circularity and presence/absence of introns)

### 1 Structure of Bacterial Genome

**Key Concept 1:**

Prokaryotic cells lack membrane-bound organelles. All bacteria contain cytoplasm, ribosomes, a plasma membrane and a nucleoid containing DNA. Almost all bacteria have cell walls.

* Dimension of bacteria:
* 10 **um**, as compared to eukaryotic cells with diameter of 10-100 **um**.
* Bacteria **do not** have a nucleus; they have a **nucleoid** region (i.e. not membrane-bound) where chromosomal DNA is found (Fig. 1a).
* Chromosomal DNA is a **single**, **circular**, **double-stranded DNA.**
* Consists approximately **5 x 10\({}^{6}\) base pairs** and of length 1 mm (NOTE: bacterial genome differs in length between various species). This is considerably less than eukaryotic cells but more than that of viruses.
* Contains a **single origin of replication.**
* Some bacteria may have one or more extrachromosomal DNA called **plasmids** (Fig. 1a). They are smaller **circular**, **double-stranded DNA**.
* Plasmids **replicate independently** from the bacterial chromosome.
* Plasmids may contain a few **beneficial**, **but non-essential genes.**
* Different types of plasmids have different functions.
* **F (fertility) plasmids** carry genes coding for sex pilus (Refer to section 3.3 on Conjugation)
* **R (resistance) plasmids** carry antibiotic resistance genes (eg. code for proteins that break down \(\beta\)-lactam in antibiotic penicillin)

**Figure 1a: Bacterial chromosomal DNA is found in the nucleoid region. Exthromosomal DNA called plasmids may be found in some bacteria.**

### Organisation of Bacterial Genome

* Due to the small size of bacteria (diameter of 1 \(\mu\)m, length of \(0.1-10\)\(\mu\)m), bacterial genomes have very compact genome organization and very little space between the genes.
* For the chromosomal DNA to fit into the cell, chromosomal DNA needs to be folded or coiled. This process of DNA packing is called chromosomal compaction. It involves **DNA binding proteins** (nucleoid-associated proteins) that help to form initial **loops**, followed by the **supercoiling** of DNA (Fig. 1.1b).
* Some features of the prokaryotic genome are:
* **Absence of introns*
* in prokaryotic genes. Each gene consists of a continuous coding sequence.
* **Few repetitive sequences*
* **Shorter sequence of genes*
* (2/3 the length of eukaryotic genes)
* **Related genes*
* (e.g. genes involved in regulating same metabolic pathway) are organized into an **operon**, and are controlled by a **single promoter*
* _(Refer to: Section 4.1)_.

Figure 1.1b: Bacterial chromosomal DNA compaction. The chromosomal DNA changes from the open circle, relaxed form to the supercoiled, looped form.

## 2. **Asexual Reproduction by Binary Fission**

_Core idea 2B- Candidates should be able to:_

Outline the mechanism of asexual reproduction by binary fission in a typical prokaryote and describe how transformation, transduction and conjugation (including the role of F plasmids but not Hfr) give rise to variation in prokaryotic genomes.

**Key Concept 2:**

Bacteria can reproduce quickly by binary fission to form genetically identical daughter cells.

 Bacterial cells reproduce by **binary fission** (Fig. 2.1a), which is a form of **asexual reproduction**. [NOTE: binary fission is NOT mitosis! Why?]

 Significance: Many cycles of binary fission produce a **colony of bacteria** that are **genetically identical** to the **parent cell** (i.e. no genetic variation).

### 2.1 Process

**Step 1: Duplication of Chromosome**

**DNA replication** occurs at **a single origin of replication** to produce 2 origins.

 Both strands of DNA act as templates to produce **double amount of DNA** via **semi-conservative replication.**

**Step 2: Cell Elongation**

(a) While chromosome is replicating, the bacterium **elongates** and continues to **grow**. (b) FtsZ proteins move to the midpoint between chromosomes to form a ring. (c) The ring directs the formation of a septum that divides the cell. Plasma membrane and cell wall materials accumulate.

**Step 3: Division into two cells**

After the septum is complete, the cell separates into two, forming **two genetically identical daughter cells.**

**Step 4:**

## 3 Genetic variation in Bacteria

**Core idea 2B- Candidates should be able to:**

**d**: Outline the mechanism of asexual reproduction by binary fission in a typical prokaryote and describe how transformation, transduction and conjugation (including the role of F plasmids but not Hfr) give rise to variation in prokaryotic genomes.

**Key Concept 3:**

Mutation and genetic recombination give rise to genetic variation in prokaryotes.

Unlike eukaryotes, bacteria cannot achieve genetic variation via crossing over during meiosis or through fertilization. Instead, **genetic variation** in bacteria is generated by **mutations** and **genetic recombination**.

**Mutations** can increase genetic variation in bacteria quickly as bacteria have **rapid reproduction rate** (e.g. _E.coli_ can reproduce in 20 minutes).

Genetic variation can also arise from **genetic recombination** i.e. **exchange of genetic material between homologous DNA regions of different bacterial cells**.

Genetic variation in bacterial populations allows bacteria to adapt to and survive in different environments.

Genetic recombination can occur through 3 different processes:

**Transformation** (Section 3.1)

**Transduction** (Section 3.2)

**Conjugation** (Section 3.3)

Genetic recombination usually **involves homologous recombination** (Fig. 3.1a):

**Homologous DNA** sequence contains the **same type of gene** but **different alleles**.

**Pairing** of two homologous chromosomes occurs.

One **donor DNA strand** is nickel, which then displaces a **recipient DNA strand** at the same region. This results in an **exchange of genetic material** between the two strands of DNA, and new phosphodiester bonds are formed between the donor strand and recipient DNA.

Subsequently, the donor DNA strand may act as a template for the synthesis of its complementary strand in the recipient DNA, thereby completing the process (not shown). The cell is now a **recombinant**: Its chromosome contains DNA from **two different cells.**

Figure 3.1a: Left: Homologous recombination between homologous regions of DNA from two different bacterial cells. Right: An example of homologous recombination, resulting in an exchange of A’ allele for A’ allele.

### Transformation

* **Transformation** is the **incorporation** of **naked DNA** (fragments of DNA) from the **environment** into the **recipient cells** to alter the **bacterial genotype**.
* A bacterial cell that is capable of transformation is called a **competent cell**.
* Bacterial transformation can occur via 2 modes, namely:
* Natural transformation (in some species of bacteria) - This is a random process which occurs by chance in nature.
* Artificial transformation - This is induced in the laboratory by scientists.

#### Natural Transformation (Fig. 3.1b)

1. The DNA of the donor bacterium is **fragmented** and **released** into the environment.
2. One of the fragments is taken up by a **competent** recipient bacterium. The competent cell has **DNA binding proteins** on the **outer surface of the cell wall** to bind to exogenous DNA from closely related species and transport it into the cell.
3. **Homologous recombination** occurs and the **donor DNA is incorporated into the DNA genome of recipient cell.

Figure 3.1b: Natural transformation.

#### Artificial Transformation (Fig. 3.1c)

1. The bacterial cells are first mixed with calcium chloride (CaCl\({}_{2}\)) and kept at 0\({}^{\circ}\)C. \(\circ\) Significance: The addition of calcium ions serves to **neutralize** the repelling **interaction between** the **negatively-charged DNA** and the **poly-anions** (**negatively-charged ions**) of the **membrane**. CaCl\({}_{2}\)** increases the competence of bacterial cells to take up DNA.
2. The foreign DNA (eg. plasmid containing ampicillin resistance gene) to be transformed into the bacterial cells are added to these bacterial cells and incubated at 0\({}^{\circ}\)C for about 30 min. \(\circ\) Significance: **stabilize** the lipid **membrane** and allow for increased interactions between calcium ions and the negative poly-anions of the membrane.
3. The mixture is subjected to **60s** of **heat shock** treatment at **42\({}^{\circ}\)C. \(\circ\) Significance: Heat shock **creates transient pores** on the bacterial cell surface membrane, **allowing DNA to enter the cells**. Bacterial cells which have taken up exogenous DNA are said to be **transformed. \(\circ\) Note: **transformation efficiency is usually very low (less than 1%)**. In another words, out of 1000 bacterial cells, less than 10 will take up the exogenous plasmid.
4. The mixture is kept at 0\({}^{\circ}\)C for about 2 min. \(\circ\) _Significance: 'Recovery' stage. Allows the pores to close._
5. The bacterial cells are incubated at 37\({}^{\circ}\)C overnight. \(\circ\) _Significance: Allows binary fission to take place to produce bacteria colonies._

Figure 3.1c: Artificial transformation.

### 3.2 Transduction

* **Transduction** is the **transfer of bacterial DNA by bacteriophages** (viruses that infect bacterial cells) **between bacterial cells**.
* There are two types of transduction:
* Generalized transduction (Section 3.2.1)
* Specialized transduction (Section 3.2.2)

#### 3.2.1 Generalised Transduction (Fig. 3.2a)

* Generalized transduction occurs during the **lytic life cycle** of a virulent phage such as **T4 phage**.

1. During the adsorption phase, the **virulent phage attaches** to and **infects** a host bacterial cell by **injecting phage DNA** (shown in light blue) into the host cell.
2. The host **bacterial DNA** (shown in black) is hydrolys / **degraded** into pieces by phage enzymes.
3. During the synthesis phase, **phage** particles **replicate** by using bacterial cell's DNA polymerase and ribosomes to make new viral DNA and proteins.
4. **Assembly** of the phage particles occur when the **viral DNA** is **packaged inside** the **capsids** (protein coat of the virus).

**Occasionally**, during encapsidation of viral DNA, a small piece of the **degraded bacterial DNA** is **randomly packaged within a capsid**, forming a **generalized transducing phage particle** (carries only bacterial DNA).
5. When this generalized transducing phage particle **infects another bacterium** (i.e. second round of infection), it **injects bacterial DNA from the previous host** into its new bacterial host.
6. Some of this bacterial DNA can subsequently replace the homologous region of the new host's cell by **homologous recombination**.

The recipient bacteria will have a **recombinant DNA** that is derived from **two bacterial cells**.

#### Specialised Transduction (Fig. 3.2b)

Specialized transduction occurs during the **lysogenic life cycle** of a temperate phage such as **lambda phage**.

1. When **temperate phage** recognizes, **attaches** and **infects** a **bacterial** host cell, the **viral DNA** (shown in light colour) is **integrated** into the **bacterial chromosome** (shown in black). The integrated phage DNA is known as a **prophage**.
2. Environmental factors (e.g. UV light) can induce a switch in the phage replication mode from **lysogenic to lytic**. When this occurs, the **prophage** is **excised** from the bacterial chromosome to initiate a lytic cycle.

Occasionally, this **excision** is **imprecise** causing a small region of **adjacent** bacterial DNA to be excised with it. This **prophage** **with adjacent bacterial genes** are **packaged** into a **capsid** forming a **specialized transducing phage particle** (carries a hybrid of viral and bacterial DNA).
3. When this specialised transducing phage particle **infects another bacterium** (i.e. second round of infection), the **bacterial DNA from the previous host** and the phage genome is **injected** into its new bacterial host.

Some of this **bacterial DNA** can subsequently **replace** the **homologous region** of the **new host's cell** by **homologous recombination**.
4. The recipient bacteria will have a **recombinant DNA** that is derived from **two bacterial cells**.

Note: Specialized transduction _only_ transfers bacterial genes **near** the **prophage** integration site on the bacterial chromosome.

Fig. 3.2b: Specialized transduction

## Chapter 3 Experimental results

Figure 3.2c: Comparison between generalized and specialized transduction.

Note that the recombinant bacterium as a result of generalized transduction contains only bacterial DNA, while the recombinant bacterium after specialized transduction contains both bacterial DNA (the new allele A\({}^{+}\)) and prophage DNA.

3. \(\mathsf{F}\) plasmid replicates by the rolling-circle mechanism. (Fig. 3.3c) 1.

F plasmid DNA begins to **unwind** with the help of **relaxosome**.
4. The \(\mathsf{5}^{*}\)**P end of the nicked DNA strand** is then transferred with the help of **tranferosome** to the recipient cell.
5. **Un-nicked DNA strand** is used as a **template** where DNA polymerase adds deoxyribonucleotides to the **free 3'OH end to synthesize a complementary DNA strand**.

## 4 Control of Gene expression in Prokaryotes

_Core idea 2C- Candidates should be able to:_

**a)**: Explain how gene expression in prokaryotes can be regulated, through the concept of simple operons (including _lac_ and _trp_ operons), including the role of regulatory genes; and distinguish between inducible and repressible systems. (Attenuation of _trp_ operon is not required)

Evidence for the mechanism of gene regulation in prokaryotes was first obtained from studies into control of enzyme synthesis in _E. coli._ Of the 800 enzymes synthesized by _E.coli,_ some are synthesized continuously, while others are synthesized only in the presence of an inducer compound.

Since then many operons have been discovered and the two commonly known examples of operons in _E. coli_ are the _Lac_ Operon (codes for proteins required to import and digest the disaccharide, lactose), and the _Trp_ Operon (codes for proteins required for the synthesis of an amino acid, tryptophan).

### Concept of Operon

**Key Concept 4:**

**a**: Bacterial genes are organized into operons which allow bacteria to respond/adapt quickly to their environment.

**a**: In prokaryotes, transcription is the most important control point of gene expression.

#### 4.1.1 Structure of Operon

**a**: An **operon** is a single unit of genetic function that consists of three elements (Fig. 4.1a):

1. A **single promoter** region
2. Where **RNA polymerase binds to** and **initiates transcription**
3. Transcription gives rise to **one** long **mRNA**, which is then **translated into several different proteins** (i.e. the **mRNA is polycistronic**).
4. This is possible because the **mRNA is punctuated with start and stop codons** that signal where the coding sequence for each polypeptide begins and ends (Fig. 4.1b).
5. In contrast, **eukaryotic mRNA is monocistronic** i.e. the eukaryotic mRNA is **translated into one protein**.
2. **Structural genes** These are genes that code for proteins with **structural or enzymatic functions.** In bacteria, structural genes in an operon are **clustered together** and transcribed as one mRNA molecule.
3. These genes **code for a series of functionally related proteins** that are involved in **a single biochemical pathway**.
4. e.g. in _Lac_ operon, all the structural genes required for the synthesis of enzymes involved in the catabolism of lactose - _lacY_, _lacZ_, _lacA_ are clustered together under a single promoter.
5. An **operator** region
6. Situated **between the promoter and the structural genes** Consists of a specific nucleotide sequence of the DNA where the **repressor protein binds** to. This **blocks** the access of RNA polymerase to the promoter, thus inhibiting mRNA synthesis
7. When bound by a repressor protein, **all the structural genes** in the operon are **simultaneously repressed**.

#### Advantages of Operons

* In operons, **genes that function together or have similar functions** are **regulated together**.
* As prokaryotes are simple unicellular organisms, organizing their genome into operons can allow them to **respond to changes in the environment** (eg. composition of growth medium) **more quickly.**
* Operons ensure that the **cell does not waste energy** synthesizing unneeded enzymes or other proteins. E.g.: \(\circ\) The _lac_ operon is transcribed only when the substance to be broken down (i.e. lactose) is present. \(\circ\) The _trp_ operon is transcribed only when the substance required by the cell (i.e. tryptophan) is absent.

Figure 4.1: General structure of an operon

Figure 4.1: Polycistronic mRNA in prokaryotes vs. monocistronic mRNA in eukaryotes.

Note the multiple start codons (red short arrows) and multiple stop codons (blue long arrows) in prokaryotic mRNA.

#### Regulatory Gene (Fig. 4.1c)

* A regulatory gene **codes for*
* a specific protein product that **regulates the expression of structural genes in a particular operon**.
* E.g. For the _lac_ operon, the regulatory gene _lacl_ codes for a _lac_ repressor protein
* E.g. For the _trp_ operon, the regulatory gene _trpR_ codes for a _trp_ repressor protein
* E.g. The regulatory gene that codes for _cyclic AMP receptor protein (CRP)_
* It may be situated **some distance** from the operon it controls.
* Each regulatory gene has its own promoter.

What is the difference between a structural gene and a regulatory gene?

#### Relationship between Operon and Regulatory Gene coding for repressor protein (Fig. 4.1d)

* Depending on the operon being regulated, the regulatory gene coding for repressor can **either** code for an **i**nactive repressor protein, or **j**) **active repressor** protein
* Only the **active repressor** protein can **bind to the operator.** (Why?)
* Thus there **are 2 possible scenarios**: **I. Regulatory gene codes for an inactive repressor*
* (e.g. _trp_ operon)
* Inactive repressor **will not*
* bind to operator.
* Thus, the operon is switched **on.*
* The repressor has to be **activated*
* via the binding of a small allosteric molecule known as a **co-repressor.*
* The activated repressor can bind to the operator.

**II. Regulatory gene coding for active repressor** (e.g. _lac_ operon) * Active repressor **will** bind to operator. * Thus, the operon is switched **off.** * The repressor can be **inactivated** via the binding of a small allosteric molecule known as an ** inducer.** The inactivated repressor thus will not bind to the operator.

Fig. 4.1c: _Lac_ operon and its regulatory gene. (**NOTE:** A regulatory gene and an operon each has its own promoter).

### Regulation of Operon

* Operons can be controlled by positive and/or negative gene regulation.

#### Negative Control

* Operons are **switched off** by the **active form** of a **repressor**. The repressor is encoded by a **regulatory gene**.
* Eg. of negative control of genes
* Regulation of _lac_ operon: The _lac_ operon is **switched off*
* when the **active _lac_ repressor binds to the **operator**. The repressor is coded for by _lacl_ gene, and is normally produced in the active form.
* Regulation of _trp_ operon: The _trp_ operon is **switched off*
* when the **active _trp_ repressor binds to the **operator**. The repressor is coded for by _trpR_ gene, and is normally produced in the inactive form.

#### Positive Control

* The **rate of transcription** of structural genes is **increased** in the presence of an active **activator**. The activator is encoded by a **regulatory gene**.
* Eg. of positive control of genes
* Regulation of _lac_ operon: When the activator **cyclic AMP receptor protein (CRP)*
* is in its **active*
* form, it can bind to a **specific CRP-binding site*
* upstream of the _lac_ promoter to **increase the rate of transcription*
* (Refer to Section 4.3.2). Note: CRP is also known as **catabolite activator protein (CAP)**.

Figure 4.1: A regulatory gene codes for a protein product that regulates the transcription of structural genes in a particular operon.

### 4.3 Lac Operon - an inducible operon

**Key Concept:**

* _Lac_ operon is an inducible operon. It is involved in the transport and metabolism of lactose in bacteria.
* The initiation of transcription of the _lac_ operon is controlled by the availability of lactose and glucose in the bacterial environment.

#### 4.3.1 Context

* Bacteria such as _Escherichia coli (E.coli)_ regulate gene expression in response to changes in environmental conditions.
* Normally in the natural environment of _E.coli_ (E.g. in the human gut), glucose from digesting carbohydrates/starch is available. **Glucose** is utilized by bacteria as an energy source, as they are **respiratory substrates** for the energy-producing glycolytic pathway.
* Lactose is not a common component in the human gut. However, when there is little or absence of glucose and lactose is present, lactose will be metabolized into its constituents.
* The _lac_ operon is involved in the transport and metabolism of lactose (a disaccharide).
* The _lac_ operon consists of **3 adjacent structural genes _lacZ, lacY,_ and _lacA_**, controlled by a **single promoter and operator*
* (Fig. 4.3a).
* These genes code for **enzymes*
* involved in the **hydrolysis of lactose*
* into **glucose*
* and **galactose*
* (Fig. 4.3b). Glucose can then be utilized by _E.coli_ as a respiratory substrate. Galactose can also be further converted to glucose.
* The _lac_ operon is an inducible operon.
* Most of the time, the _lac_ operon is not expressed / switched off, and the enzymes for lactose utilization are not synthesized.
* If **lactose becomes available, the lac operon is switched on (induced)*
* and all the 3 genes are expressed together, resulting in a coordinated synthesis of lactose-utilizing enzymes.
* This ensures that the bacterium **does not synthesize the enzyme until it is needed.*
* i.e. when substrate **induced*
* is present.
* Such **inducible operons** usually function in **catabolic** pathways (breakdown of substances).

#### Structure of the _Lac_ operon

* The _lac_ operon (Fig. 4.3a) contains
* Three structural genes
* _lac Z gene_ - codes for an enzyme \(\beta\)-galactosidase (Fig. 4.3b) that **catalyses*
* the hydrolysis of lactose to glucose and galactose. \(\beta\)-galactosidase is also responsible for the **conversion of lactose*
* to an isomer, **allolactose.*
* _lac Y gene_ - codes for enzyme **permease**, a membrane protein that **transports lactose into the bacterial cell*
* (Fig. 4.3b).
* _lac A gene_ - codes for **transacetylase**, whose function in lactose metabolism is still uncertain.

Figure 4.3: The _lac_ operon and the _lac_ regulatory gene (upstream).

Figure 4.3: A diagrammatic illustration of the functions of \(\beta\)-galactosidase and permease in lactose metabolism

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:28]

#### 4.3.3 _Lacl_ regulatory gene

* The _lac_ regulatory gene, _lacl_, (Fig. 4.3a) is not part of the _lac_ operon, but is located **upstream** of _lac_ operon.
* It is responsible for the negative control of the _lac_ operon.
* The _lacl_ gene **continuously*
* codes for an **active*
* repressor protein.
* This active repressor binds to the **operator*
* and **blocks RNA polymerase from binding to the promoter.*
* This **prevents mRNA synthesis**.

#### 4.3.4 Control of the _lac_ operon

* The _lac_ operon is under dual control: **negative control*
* by the **lac repressor protein**, and **positive control*
* by the **activator protein**, **cyclic AMP receptor protein (CRP)**.
* Negative control: In the **absence of lactose**, enzymes involved in the hydrolysis of lactose are **not synthesized**. This is because the **active lac repressor protein*
* is bound to the **operator*
* to ensure that the _lac_ operon is switched off.
* Positive control: In the **absence of glucose**, active CRP complex (**activator**) binds to the **CRP binding site**, thus increasing the rate of transcription of genes that encode proteins for lactose utilization.

Figure 4.3a: The amount of cAMP and the rate of transcription of the _lac_ operon are inversely related to the concentration of glucose.

#### 4.3.5 Mechanism of _Lac_ Operon

Scenario 1: Glucose is present. Lactose is absent -

_Lac_ operon switched off (Fig. 4.3f)

When **glucose is present**, glucose will be taken up for cellular respiration to provide energy for the bacteria.

1. In the **absence of lactose**, **no allolactose (inducer) is present** to bind to the active repressor.
2. _Lac_ repressor remains active and hence able to **bind to the operator.**
3. **RNA polymerase cannot bind to the promoter.** Hence, **transcription of the structural genes** (_lacZ_, _lacY_ and _lacA_) is prevented.
4. The _lac_ operon is thus switched off**. This helps the bacteria to conserve its resources and energy, since enzymes for the lactose metabolism are not required.

Figure 4.3f: Lactose absent, thus allolactose is absent. Repressor remains active and binds to operator; operon is switched off. Note that the presence of inactive CRP here does not affect the level of transcription.

* In _E. coli,_ **glucose** is the **preferred source of carbohydrate** as it is the **major substrate for cellular respiration.** Therefore, if lactose and glucose are both present, the cell will **utilize all the glucose before the _lac operon is turned on._

1. Lactose taken up by the cell is converted to its isomer, **allolactose (inducer),** which **binds to the active repressor.** * _Note: The binding of repressors to operators is reversible. Thus, a small amount of the enzyme \(\beta\)-galactosidase remains in the cell which can convert lactose to its isomer allolactose._
2. This **inactivates the repressor** and **prevents** it from **binding to the operator**.
3. This allows **RNA polymerase to bind to the promoter** to initiate **low level of transcription** (also known as _basal level transcription_).
4. **Presence of glucose in the cell** * **Inhibits the synthesis of cAMP** and **stimulates the transport of existing cAMP out of the cell.** * **A low level of cAMP** results in a **low level of activated cAMP receptor protein (CRP)**, as CRP can only be activated when complexed to cAMP. Low level of active CRP binds to the CRP binding site.
5. **RNA polymerase binds less efficiently to the promoter,** thus there is only a **low level of transcription** (this is known as the _glucose effect_ in some textbooks).

Figure 4.3g: Lactose present, thus allolactose is present. However, glucose is present, thus cAMP level is low: low level of transcription.

1. Lactose taken up by the cell is converted to its isomer, **allolactose (inducer)**, which **binds to the active repressor.**
2. This **inactivates the repressor** and **prevents** it from **binding to the operator**.
3. This allows **RNA polymerase** to **bind to the promoter** to initiate **low level of transcription**.
4. **Absence of glucose in the cell** allows bacterial cell to **synthesize cAMP**.
5. Accumulation of cAMP allows cAMP to complex with CRP to form **high level of activated cAMP receptor protein (CRP).** Activated CRP binds to the **CRP binding site** and causes **DNA to bend**. This **facilitates the binding of RNA polymerase to the promoter** and **upregulates transcription**.
6. **High level of transcription** results in _lacZ_, _lacY_ and _lacA_ genes being **transcribed** and the resulting mRNA **translated** to produce _B-galactosidasease_, _permease and transacetylase_ respectively.

Figure 4.3: Lactose is present, thus repressor becomes inactive. Operon is switched on. Glucose is absent, thus active CRP increases rate of transcription of the _lac_ operon.

1. Since lactose is unavailable, the operon is switched off via the mechanism described in **Scenario 1**. This conserves energy and resources as the proteins encoded by the _lac_ structural genes are not required by the cell.
2. If there are no other energy sources, the cell dies.

2. What type of biological molecules are these?

* Repressor -
* Operator -
* CRP-binding site -
* CRP -

3. What are the two important conditions required for high levels of transcription of the _lac_ structural genes?

Figure 4.3: Lactose is absent, thus allolactose is absent. Repressor remains active and binds to operator: operon is switched off. Note that even with the active CRP bound (because glucose is absent), transcription is not upregulated.

#### 4.3.6 Summary on Regulation of Lac operon

### 4.4 Trp Operon - a Repressible Operon

**Key Concept 6:**

* _Trp_ operon is a repressible operon. It is involved in the synthesis of tryptophan in the bacteria.
* The initiation of transcription of the _trp_ operon is controlled by the availability of tryptophan in the environment.

#### 4.4.1 Context

* Bacteria such as _Escherichia coli (E.coli)_ regulate gene expression in response to changes in environmental conditions (e.g. growth medium).
* Normally, **tryptophan** (an amino acid) is **absent** or present in low levels in the cell. Hence, the bacteria will synthesize tryptophan by **switching on the operon** that is involved in tryptophan synthesis. This sustains the life of the bacteria.
* However, if **tryptophan is present** in the environment, the synthesis of tryptophan is not required. Hence, the **operon is switched off.**
* The _Trp_ operon
* Consists of **5 adjacent structural genes _TrpE, TrpD, TrpC, TrpB,_*
* and _TrpA,_*
* controlled by a single promoter and operator (Fig. 4.4a).
* These genes code for **enzymes involved in the synthesis of tryptophan**.
* The _Trp_ operon is a **repressible operon.*
* Most of the time, the _trp_ operon is **expressed / switched on**, and the enzymes for tryptophan synthesis are produced.
* If tryptophan becomes available, the _trp_ operon is **switched off / repressed**. Hence, tryptophan functions as a **co-repressor*
* to switch off the operon, via feedback inhibition / end-product inhibition.
* This **ensures that the bacterium does not synthesize the enzyme until it is needed*
* (i.e. when product is absent).
* Such **repressible operons** usually function in **anabolic** pathways (production of substances).

#### Structure of the _Trp_ operon

* The _trp_ operon (Fig. 4.4a) contains
* Five **structural genes (_TrpE_ to _TrpA_)
* A specific DNA sequence where **RNA polymerase binds to*
* and **initiates transcription*
* of the _Trp_ genes.
* A specific DNA sequence where the **active repressor protein can bind to*
* and **block RNA polymerase from binding to promoter.*
* This prevents mRNA synthesis.

#### _TrpR_ regulatory gene

* The **regulatory gene** of the _trp_ operon, _trpR_, **continuously** codes for an **inactive** repressor protein.
* Hence, **RNA polymerase can bind to the promoter** and **initiate transcription** of structural genes of the operon.
* These structural genes code for **enzymes** involved in the **formation of tryptophan.**

#### Control of the _Trp_ operon

* The _trp_ operon is under **negative control*
* by the _trp_ repressor protein.*
* In the **presence of tryptophan**, **enzymes*
* involved in the synthesis of tryptophan are **not synthesized**. This is because the **active**_trp_ repressor protein is bound to the **operator*
* to ensure that the _trp_ operon is switched off.
