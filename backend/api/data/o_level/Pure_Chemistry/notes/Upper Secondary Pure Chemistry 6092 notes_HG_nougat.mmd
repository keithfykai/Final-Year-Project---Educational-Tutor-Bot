- Condition: UV light (MUST BE PRESENT)

- Products: organic compound (alkane) + Hydrogen Chloride (HCl)

- Usually use Bromine and Chlorine (Fluorine too reactive, iodine react too slow)

Ozone layer Where it is found Ozone is harmful in the atmosphere because...

1) Ozone can cause eye and respiratory tract irritation, leading to breathing difficulties

2) When inhaled, causes chest pain and headaches

3) Ozone slows down photosynthesis in plants, damages crops

Ozone is useful in the ozone layer / stratosphere because...

It absorbs harmful UV radiation, reducing the amount of UV radiation that reaches the Earth's surface

Harmful UV radiation causes sunburn, skin cancer, premature ageing and cataracts in the eyes

Depletion of Ozone layer

(CFCs) - found in aerosol propellants, refrigerants, and certain plastics

1) UV radiation from the sun breaks up the CFC molecules in the stratosphere into chlorine atoms

2) Chlorine atoms react with ozone to form oxygen and chlorine oxide. Chlorine oxide continues to break up another molecule. Chlorine atom is released and continue to attack ozone

molecules in chain reactions

3) Holes in the ozone layer start to form

- A set of processes that regulate the amount of carbon dioxide in atmosphere

Absorb carbon dioxide: photosynthesis, Ocean uptake (ocean and other large bodies of water absorb carbon dioxide)

Release carbon dioxide: Combustion, Decomposition, Respiration
