### Introduction

We think of waves as a "bulk phenomenon" - it happens on a larger scale and are made up of adjacent smaller units (such as water molecules, gas molecules, rope segments) individually exhibiting _oscillations_.

Waves can result in energy (but _not_ matter) being moved from one point to another OR energy can also be confined to a region in space without transfer. In this topic, we will focus on the former: progressive waves.

### Types of Waves

In our A-Levels journey we will encounter 3 main types of waves:

Mechanical waves e.g. water waves, sound waves and seismic waves (earthquakes).

They obey Newton's laws of motion, and can only exist within a material medium (correspondingly liquid water, air, rock).

Electromagnetic waves do not need a material medium to exist. They travel through vacuum at a speed of \(c=3.00\times 10^{8}\) m s\({}^{-1}\).

Visible light ranges from 400 nm to 700 nm. Take note of the order of magnitude of EM wavelengths:

Before continuing it is useful to introduce wavefronts.

A wavefront is an imaginary line that joins all the points on a wave that are at the same phase. It helps to visualize how a wave propagates _spatially_.

### 11.2 Quantities of Wave Motion

Let's compare some terms against those introduced under H210 Oscillations:

\begin{tabular}{|c|l|l|} \hline  & describe oscillation & describe waves \\ \hline displacement & distance in a specified direction & distance in a specified direction \\ \(x\) & from equilibrium position of & from equilibrium position of \\  & _oscillating mass_ & _particle or point on the wave_ \\ \hline period & time taken for one complete oscillation of & time between adjacent wavefronts \\ \(T\) & the oscillating mass & \\ \hline frequency & number of complete to-and-fro motions & \\  & made by the oscillating mass & \\ \(f\) & per unit time & \\  & \(f=\frac{1}{T}\) & \\ \hline \end{tabular}

Two types of graphical representations are commonly used to describe waves:

\begin{tabular}{|c|l|} \hline variation of displacement with **distance** & variation of displacement with **time** \\ \hline \end{tabular}

\begin{tabular}{|c|l|} \hline  & \multicolumn{1}{c|}{} & \multicolumn{1}{c|}{} \\ \end{tabular}

Shows displacements of _all_ the particles / segments in a wave and how they vary with distance from the source _at a particular instant in time_. \\ \hline \end{tabular}

Since it is a spatial freeze-frame of the wave, it is like a photograph of the oscillations.

#### Speed and Wavelength

The speed of a progressive wave is the speed at which energy is transferred. \(\nu\) : speed of wave (m s-1) \(f\) : frequency of wave (s-1) \(\lambda\) : wavelength of wave (m) The speed of a progressive wave can also be seen from the speed of the wavefront. **The speed of oscillation of any individual particle or wave segment \(\nu=\pm\omega_{0}\sqrt{x_{0}^{2}-x^{2}}\) is different from the speed of wave profile \(\nu=f\lambda\).**

The wavelength \(\lambda\) of a wave is the minimum distance between two points with the same phase.

**Example 1**

Use the definitions of wavelength and frequency to deduce the relationship between \(\lambda\), \(f\) and \(\nu\), the speed of a wave.

**Solution**

Frequency is the number of wavefronts passing a point per unit time. wavelength is the minimum distance between two points with the same phase; in other words: wavelength is also the distance moved by a wavefront in the time for a complete oscillation of source

\[\nu=\frac{\text{distance moved by wavefront in a period}}{\text{one time period}}=\frac{\lambda}{T}=f\lambda\]

**Example 2**

A wave is represented by the graphs shown. Find the speed of the wave.

**Solution**

\[\nu=f\lambda\] \[= \left(\frac{1}{T}\right)\left(\lambda\right)\] \[= \left(\frac{1}{0.2}\right)\left(0.4\right)\] \[= 2.00\text{ m s}^{-1}\]

**Example 3**: A sound wave travels through a gas. The gas molecules oscillate with simple harmonic motion. Each gas molecule is of mass 5.3\(\times\)10-26 kg, vibrates at a frequency of 835 Hz, and has an vibration amplitude of 60 nm. The variation with time \(t\) of the vibrational kinetic energy _E_x of a molecule is shown below. Find the

1. period of oscillations,
2. time interval \(\left(t_{2}-t_{t}\right),\) and
3. maximum speed \(\nu_{\max}\) for one vibrating molecule.
4. By reference to the speed of sound in a gas at room temperature, comment on \(\nu_{\max}\).

**Solution**

1. period \(T=\dfrac{1}{f}=\dfrac{1}{835}=0.00120\) s
2. time interval \(\left(t_{2}-t_{t}\right)=\dfrac{T}{2}\) \[=\dfrac{1}{2f}\] \[=0.000599\) s
3. maximum oscillation speed \(\nu_{\max}=\pm\omega\sqrt{x_{0}^{2}-x^{2}}=\pm\omega\sqrt{x_{0}^{2}-0}\) \[=\omega x_{0}\] \[=\left(2\pi f\right)x_{0}\] \[=\left(2\pi\left(835\right)\right)\left(610\times 10^{-9}\right)\] \[=0.00320\text{ ms}^{-1}\]
4. speed of propagation of sound waves in gas at room temperature is about 330 ms-1, which is about 5 orders of magnitude larger than maximum speed of oscillation of a gas molecule. Propagation of sound energy does not involve transfer of medium (mass), so can be greater than the maximum speed of vibration of individual particles in the medium.

## Example 4

A sound wave of frequency 400 Hz travels in air at a speed of 320 m s\({}^{-1}\). Find the phase difference between two points on the wave that are 0.20 m apart in the direction of travel.

## Solution

\[\nu=f\lambda\] \[\lambda=\frac{\nu}{f}\] \[=\frac{320}{400}=0.800\text{ m}\] \[=\frac{\pi}{2}\text{ rad}\] \[=90.0^{\circ}\]

## Example 5

The graphs below show the variation of displacement with time of 2 waves of the same frequency as received by a detector. Find the phase difference between the 2 waves.

## Solution

\[\text{phase difference}\ \Delta\phi=(2\pi)\frac{\Delta t}{T}\] \[=(2\pi)\frac{\frac{1}{4}T}{T}\] \[=\frac{\pi}{2}\text{ rad}\] \[=90.0^{\circ}\]

#### 11.3 Transverse Wave vs Longitudinal Wave

A **transverse wave** is one where the oscillations are normal to the direction of energy propagation.

In both illustrations above involving the slinky above, the arm is the source of oscillation of the progressive waves.

Energy from the arm moves to the right - the _wave front_ or _wave profile_ is moving to the right even though there is no net movement of the slinky; the _medium_ through which the energy is propagated.

Conventionally, rightwards is taken to be the positive direction. For the longitudinal wave, the neighbouring particles before point P have positive displacement - they are displaced to the right of their average positions towards P. The reverse is true for points beyond P, so P is a region of compression.

#### Variation of displacement with time

Note that for a displacement-time graph, we track the displacement of a _single particle_ across time.

Each of the particle illustrated on the graphs here is akin to a single frame of a continuous video.

P is _not_ a region of compression.

P tells of the time taken for half the period, and also gives directional information, that the particle has negative velocity at the time of P.

#### Pressure variations of Sound Wave

Recall that there is acceleration associated with oscillatory vibrations - so there has to be _force(s)_ acting across the _area_ of the thin sheet of material. **Sound waves are pressure waves**. We hear sound due to the variations of pressure with time at our eardrums.

We should take note:

* at regions of maximum pressure (e.g. Q) the particle has no displacement but its "neighbours" have been displaced towards it
* at regions of minimal pressure (e.g. R) the particle has no displacement but its "neighbours" have been displaced away from it
* a phase difference of \(\frac{\pi}{2}\) or \(90^{\circ}\) between the displacement and the pressure-variation graph
* both the displacement and pressure-variation graph can give us the wavelength of the sound \(\circ\) the wavelength is the distance between adjacent compressions or rarefactions

### Use a Cathode Ray Oscilloscope (c.r.o.) to measure Frequency of Sound

Regard a cathode ray oscilloscope (c.r.o.) as a voltmeter that can display a rapidly varying voltage. It accepts a changing voltage signal as input - this changing voltage shows up on the \(y\)-axis of the screen.

The c.r.o. then "sweeps" the vertically changing signal horizontally across the x-axis at a steady speed to display the wave form.

To measure the frequency of sound waves:

1. Use a microphone to convert the sound wave into a varying voltage which is of same frequency as the sound wave.
2. Connect the microphone to the input of a c.r.o.
3. Adjust the time-base and input sensitivity to display complete waveforms on the c.r.o. screen.
4. Read the period of the waveforms \(T\).
5. Frequency is given by \(f=\dfrac{1}{T}\)

Nowadays, the function of a CRO can be easily replicated by a voltage sensor connected to a datalogger.

In both cases, the measurement we get is from the variation of voltage with time graph.

### Waves Transfer Energy from a Source to a Receiver

Recall that a progressive wave is one in which energy is transferred from the _source of disturbance_, through surrounding regions.

At the "micro" perspective, the oscillating particles in a wave transfers its energy from one particle to the next. To quantify the energy at a "macro" level, we typically discuss the

* source power,
* geometry (shape) of how a wave spreads in space,
* intensity of the wave at different distances from the source, and
* received power.

#### Intensity of a Wave

The **intensity** of a wave is the rate of energy flow per unit area that is perpendicular to the direction of wave propagation.

\[I=\frac{P}{A}\]

Intensity \(I\) is given by \(\frac{\text{power}}{\text{area}}\), therefore the units for intensity \(I\) is W m\({}^{2}\).

This _per unit_ area here is imaginary - as a way of comparing the energy passing through that region.

We previously referred to this concept of using ratios (_per capita_, _per_ dm\({}^{3}\), _per_ unit mass) for comparing quantities in Gravitational Field:

#### Intensity and Amplitude

Recall from H210 Oscillations that the total energy (kinetic energy and potential energy) of an oscillating system is directly proportional to the square of the amplitude: \(E_{\text{total}}=\left[\frac{1}{2}\,m\omega^{2}\right]\chi_{0}^{2}\).

Since a wave comprises of many oscillating particles, for waves of the same type and frequency,

\[I =\frac{P}{A}=\frac{1}{A}\left(\frac{E_{\text{total}}}{t}\right)\] \[I \propto\chi_{0}^{2}\] intensity \[\propto(\text{amplitude})^{2}\]

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:16]

## 10 Example 10

A wave is produced on the surface of a liquid. At one particular time, the variation of the vertical displacement \(\gamma\) with distance \(x\) along the surface of the liquid is shown.

The wave has energy density \(I_{1}\) at distance \(x=2.0\) cm and energy density \(I_{2}\) at distance \(x=10.0\) cm. Find the ratio \(\frac{I_{2}}{I_{1}}\). Hence, suggest if the wave is a circular wave.

## 11 Solution

intensity \(\propto\) (amplitude)\({}^{2}\)

\[\frac{I_{2}}{I_{1}}= \left[\frac{\left(\text{amplitude}\right)_{2}}{\left(\text{ amplitude}\right)_{1}}\right]^{2}\] \[= \left(\frac{0.5}{0.9}\right)^{2}=0.309\]

Assuming that the source of the wave is a point source, the waves are confined to the liquid surface and travel uniformly via circular wave fronts, the energy density should be inversely proportional to the distance travelled:

if \[I\propto\frac{1}{r}\] \[\frac{I_{2}}{I_{1}}= \frac{r_{1}}{r_{2}}\] \[= \frac{2}{10}\] \[= 0.200\]

As the value obtained is \(0.200\) which is different from the value of \(0.309\) obtained previously, we can tell that it is likely not a circular wave. This means that the wave may be directed towards a sector of the circle and is not a circular wave.

**Example 11**: A point source emits sound waves uniformly in all directions. The loudness of the sound waves is initially measured at a distance of 7.0 m away from it. The power of the source is then halved. Find the new distance from the point source where the loudness is perceived to be the same as before.

**Solution**

loudness is a measure of intensity:

\[I=\frac{P}{A}=\frac{P}{4\pi r^{2}}\]

\[\frac{\mathcal{P}}{\mathcal{A}\left(7\right)^{2}}=\frac{\frac{1}{2}\mathcal{P }}{\mathcal{A}\left(r_{\text{\tiny{new}}}\right)^{2}}\]

\[r_{\text{\tiny{new}}}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(7)\]

\[=4.95\text{ m}\]

**Note:** Logic check: the power is reduced so to hear the same loudness we need to be nearer the source.

### Polarisation of a transverse wave

In a polarised wave, the

oscillations are along one direction only,

in a single plane that is

normal to the direction of energy transfer of the wave

Conversely, an unpolarized wave heading towards you will look like the

_planes of polarization_ are all random and changing:

As polarisation deals with oscillations along directions that are _normal_ to the direction of

Only transverse waves can be polarised

propagation, longitudinal waves cannot exhibit polarisation.

We can pass an unpolarised wave through a (linear) polarizer to get a _linearly polarised_ wave or a _plane polarised_ wave. A polariser only allows polarization along 1 specific direction to pass through.

We can imagine a stretched rope and a slit as a mechanical analogy. This means that if we stack 2 ideal linear polarisers at right angles to each other, we can cut out the waves.

Figure 19: 23

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:20]

#### Malus' Law in terms of Amplitude of Waves

The oscillations of a wave exhibit _displacement_, which is a vector quantity and so can be resolved into components.

When **polarised** light reaches a polariser, the component of the displacement that is

* parallel to the transmission axis is allowed to pass,
* perpendicular to the transmission axis is absorbed by the polariser

So Malus' Law, when expressed as _amplitudes_ (maximum displacement) reads as

\[X_{\text{transmitted}} =X_{\text{before polariser}}\;\cos\theta\] \[\text{since}\;\;\;\text{intensity} \propto\;\left(\text{amplitude}\right)^{2}\] \[I_{\text{transmitted}} \propto\;x_{\text{transmitted}}^{2}\] \[\propto\left(X_{\text{before polariser}}\;\cos\theta\right)^{2}\] \[\propto\;\cos^{2}\theta\]

**Example 13**: A narrow, parallel beam of unpolarised light is directed towards three ideal polarising filters. The beam exits the first filter with its plane of polarisation vertical. The plane of polarisation of the second filter is at angle of 45\({}^{\circ}\) to the first filter. The beam emerges from the second filter with amplitude \(\dfrac{A}{\sqrt{2}}\). The third filter has its plane of polarisation at 90\({}^{\circ}\) to the first filter as shown. Find the emergent intensity in terms of intensity after the first filter \(I\).

**Solution**

Let the region between 1st and 2nd polariser be region P and the region between 2nd and 3rd polariser be region Q.

Consider amplitudes before and after 2nd polariser:

\[A_{\text{o}} =A_{\text{p}}\,\cos\theta\] \[\dfrac{A}{\sqrt{2}} =A_{\text{p}}\,\cos(45^{\circ})\] \[A_{\text{p}} =A\]

Consider amplitudes before and after 3rd polariser:

\[A_{\text{emergent}} =A_{\text{o}}\,\cos\theta\] \[=\dfrac{A}{\sqrt{2}}\,\cos(45^{\circ})\] \[=\dfrac{A}{2}\]

**SO**: \[\dfrac{I_{\text{emergent}}}{I} =\biggl{(}\dfrac{A_{\text{mergent}}}{A_{\text{p}}}\biggr{)}^{2}= \biggl{(}\dfrac{A/2}{A}\biggr{)}^{2}\] \[=\dfrac{1}{4}\]

**Note**: In this H211 Waves, be sure to distinguish between \(A\) for amplitude of waves and \(A\) for the area when considering wave intensity. Also, we could have applied Malus' Law twice to solve this question: \(I_{\text{emergent}}=I_{\text{o}}\,\cos^{2}\bigl{(}90^{\circ}-45^{\circ}\bigr{)} =I\,\cos^{2}\bigl{(}45^{\circ}\bigr{)}\cos^{2}\bigl{(}90^{\circ}-45^{\circ} \bigr{)}=I\,\cos^{4}\bigl{(}45^{\circ}\bigr{)}\)
