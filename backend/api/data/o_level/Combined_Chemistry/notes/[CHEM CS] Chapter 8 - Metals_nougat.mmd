## Physical Properties of Metal

1) Metals are **ductile** (able to be stretched into wires without losing toughness).

2) Metals are **malleable** (able to be bent into different shapes without breaking).

3) Metals are **good conductors of electricity and heat**.

4) Metals have **high melting and boiling points** and generally are solids at room temperature.

5) Metals have **high density**.

6) Metals are generally **strong and shiny**.

### Exceptions:

- Mercury has a low melting point (-39 "C) and exists as a liquid at room temperature.

- Group I metals such as lithium, sodium and potassium have low densities and float on water.

## Preventining RUSTING

**Surface Protection**

**Paint, oil, plastic and metal plating** are some commonly used protective layers that would prevent air and water from coming into contact with iron (or steel) under the protective layer.

**Sacrificial Metals**

If iron is in contact with a **more reactive metal** like magnesium or zinc, then the rusting of iron is greatly minimised. These reactive metals would be diminished in place of iron.

**S stainless Steel**

S stainless steel is an **iron alloy** that consists of iron and chromium or nickel.

It does not rust easily, as these metals would react with the oxygen in the air to produce a **stable metal oxide layer**.

## Extraction of **Methods**

The method chosen to execute given model from its code depends on the feasibility of the model and the stability of the model codes.

In general, very reactive models can only be constructed using actuators, which are constructed by control with actuators/regorgor.

Electrophysical is the most powerful extraction method. Due to the high usage of electricity, it is a highly expensive process.

Hence, electrolysis would only be utilised for the **most reactive metals** like potassium, sodium, calcium, magnesium and aluminium.

## Reduction by Carbon

Metals that can be extracted by this method are **zinc, iron, tin and lead**.

Lead(II) oxide is reduced by carbon to become pure lead metal,

**PDO (s) + C (s) + Pb (s) + CO (g)**

**REODUCTION BY HYDROGEN**

Metals that can be extracted by this method from their oxides are **iron**,

**copper and lead**.

CuO (s) + H\({}_{2}\)(g) + Cu (s) + H\({}_{2}\)(g)**
