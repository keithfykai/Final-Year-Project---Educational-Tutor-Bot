## 1 Introduction

Gases tend to have the following physical properties:

* Gases have much lower density than solids or liquids.
* Gases assume the volumes and shapes of their containers.
* Gases are highly compressible, and their volumes change greatly when a pressure is applied.
* Gases exert pressure equally in all directions

## 2 The Gas Laws

* state and use the general gas equation \(pV=nRT\) in calculations, including the determination of \(M_{t}\)

Some of the first quantitative investigations were conducted in the 17\({}^{\text{th}}\) - 18\({}^{\text{th}}\) century to study the behaviour of gases. The relationship between the different macroscopic properties of gases (volume, temperature and pressure) are expressed via the different gas laws.

### Boyle's Law

* The volume \(V\) of a fixed mass of gas at a **constant temperature** is **inversely proportional** to the pressure \(p\) of the gas.

\[V\propto\frac{1}{p}\] \[pV=k\] where \[k\] is a constant
* In other words, for a fixed mass (or amount) of gas at **constant temperature**, when its volume **increases**, its pressure **decreases**, and vice versa.
* Hence, for a given mass of gas under two different sets of conditions at constant temperature,
### Charles's Law

* The volume \(V\) of a fixed mass of gas at a constant pressure is directly proportional to its temperature \(T\) (in kelvin). \[\begin{array}{c}V\propto T\\ \frac{V}{T}=k\end{array}\quad\text{ where $k$ is a constant}\]
* In other words, for a fixed mass (or amount) of gas at **constant pressure**, when its volume **increases**, its temperature **increases**, and vice versa
* For a given mass of gas under two different sets of conditions at constant pressure, \[\begin{array}{c}\frac{V_{1}}{T_{1}}=\frac{V_{2}}{T_{2}}\end{array}\]

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:5]

The Gaseous State

### Avogadro's Law

Under the **same conditions of temperature and pressure**, equal volumes of all gases will contain equal numbers of molecules.

\(V\propto n\) where \(n\) is the amount (in moles) of gas present

For example, the number of O\({}_{2}\) molecules in 1 dm\({}^{3}\) of O\({}_{2}\) gas = the number of CO\({}_{2}\) molecules in 1 dm\({}^{3}\) of CO\({}_{2}\) gas.

At constant temperature and pressure,

\(\dfrac{V_{1}}{n_{1}}=\dfrac{V_{2}}{n_{2}}\)

Graphically, Avogadro's Law can be represented as:

\(n\)

At constant \(T\) and \(p\),

\(V=kn\)

(Resembles \(y=mx\) graph)

### The Ideal Gas Equation

Combining Boyle's law, Charles's law and Avogadro's law,

\(V\propto\dfrac{nT}{p}\)

therefore, \(PV=nRT\) where \(R\) is the molar gas constant (\(R=8.31\) J K\({}^{-1}\) mol\({}^{-1}\))

An ideal gas is one whose behaviour follows the ideal gas equation exactly under any pressure and temperature.

_Important:_ When using the ideal gas equation, each quantity needs to be expressed in its

**S.I. unit**The Gaseous State

Example 26

Calculate the molar volume of an ideal gas at 0 \({}^{\circ}\)C and 1 bar (i.e. under standard temperature and pressure, s.t.p.).

Example 27

A sample of gas was heated from 25 \({}^{\circ}\)C until both its pressure and its volume doubled. What was the new temperature?

Using the ideal gas equation, the relative molecular mass of the gas can be determined,

\[\begin{array}{ll}\boxed{\begin{array}{ll}\mbox{Since}&n=\frac{m}{M},\\ \rho V=\frac{m}{M}RT&\mbox{where $m$ is the mass of the gas}\\ &M\mbox{is the relative molecular mass of the gas}\end{array}}\end{array}\]The Gaseous State

The volume occupied by 0.10 g of a gas is found to be 83.1 cm\({}^{3}\) (measured at 1.0 x 10\({}^{5}\) Pa and 27 \({}^{\circ}\)C). Assuming that the gas behaves ideally, what is the relative molecular mass of this gas?

The Gaseous State

### Dalton's Law of Partial Pressures

LO (d) use Dalton's Law to determine the partial pressures of gases in a mixture

In a mixture of gases that do not react with one another, each gas behaves as if it was the only gas present.

**Dalton's Law** states that in a mixture of gases which do not react chemically, the total pressure is the sum of the partial pressures of the components.

\[p_{\text{total}}=p_{\text{A}}+p_{\text{B}}+p_{\text{C}}+\cdots+p_{\text{N}}= \sum_{i=\text{A}}^{i=\text{N}}p_{i}\]

where \(p_{i}\) is the partial pressure of any component, \(i\), in the mixture

The **partial pressure** is the pressure that would be exerted if the gas was alone in the container. We can determine the partial pressure of each component gas using its **mode ratio**.

Assuming a non-reacting mixture of gas **A** and gas **B** contained in a volume, \(V\), at temperature, \(T\), partial pressure of gas **A**: \(p_{\text{A}}=\dfrac{n_{\text{A}}RT}{V}\) partial pressure of gas **B**: \(p_{\text{B}}=\dfrac{n_{\text{B}}RT}{V}\) total pressure, \(p_{\text{total}}=p_{\text{A}}+p_{\text{B}}=\dfrac{n_{\text{A}}RT}{V}+\dfrac{n_{ \text{B}}RT}{V}\) \(=\dfrac{\left(n_{\text{A}}+n_{\text{B}}\right)RT}{V}\)

The Gaseous State

**Mole Fraction and Partial Pressure**

* The **mode fraction** of a component A, \(\chi_{A}\), in a mixture is the ratio of the number of moles of A to the total number of moles of all components present in the mixture. Mathematically, this is shown as: \[\chi_{A}=\frac{\text{amount of component A}}{\text{total amount of all components in mixture}}=\frac{n_{A}}{n_{total}}\]
* If there is a non-reacting mixture of gas A and gas B in a container, then: \[\frac{p_{A}}{p_{\text{total}}} =\frac{n_{A}RT}{V}+\frac{(n_{A}+n_{B})RT}{V}\] \[=\frac{n_{A}}{n_{A}+n_{B}}\] \[=\chi_{A}\text{ }\left(\text{where }\chi_{A}\text{ is the mole fraction of gas A}\right)\]
* The **partial pressure** of gas A is thus: \[p_{A}=\chi_{A}\times p_{\text{total}}\]

A mixture of 0.5 mol of helium, 2.0 mol neon and 2.5 mol of argon has a total pressure of 100 kPa. What is the partial pressure of each gas in the mixture?The Gaseous State

## 3 The Kinetic Molecular Theory of Gases

LO (a) state the basic assumptions of the kinetic theory as applied to an ideal gas.

The ideal gas equation was obtained using an _empirical_ approach by combining the experimentally determined gas laws (Boyle's Law, Charles's Law, Avogadro's Law). While it enables us to determine what happens to a gas when conditions change, it does not tell us what is happening at the molecular level, and why.

In the 19th century, a group of scientists including Ludwig Boltzmann and James Clerk Maxwell developed the **kinetic molecular theory of gases** to try to explain gas behaviours as described by the gas laws and the ideal gas equation. This theory is based on a model that assumes that:

1. The **gas particles have no volume**, _i.e._ they are point masses.
2. There are **no forces of attraction between gas particles**.
3. When the particles collide, the **collision is perfectly elastic**. i.e., the particles bounce apart after they collide with **no loss of kinetic energy**.
4. The gas particles are in **constant random** motion.

As a result, the average kinetic energy of the particles is proportional to the **temperature (in Kelvin)**.

A Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution curve shows how energy is distributed among the particles in a system. The total area under a Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution curve is proportional to the total number of particles present. At a given temperature, the particles have a range of kinetic energies.

When temperature increases from 298 K to 500 K, the particles have a larger range of kinetic energy and the average kinetic energy of the gaseous particles increases. As such, the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution curve at the higher temperature broadens and flattens out.

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:13]

### Effect of Low Temperature

For a constant amount of a real gas, in this case, CO\({}_{2}\), at varying temperatures:

* At low temperatures, kinetic energy of the gas particles decreases and the particles move slower. This causes the intermolecular forces of attraction between the particles to be significant (assumption 2 is no longer valid). The number of collision and force exerted on wall of container will decrease, \(\rho V\) is smaller than that of an ideal gas. Hence at lower temperatures, there will be greater deviation from ideality.

### Effect of Strong intermolecular Forces

* Under the same conditions, different gases deviate from ideal gas behaviour to different extents due to differences in the strengths of the intermolecular forces of attraction.
* Strong hydrogen bonds exist between H\({}_{2}\)O molecules while weak instantaneous dipole-induced dipole interactions exist between H\({}_{2}\) and CO\({}_{2}\) molecules.
* The hydrogen bonds between H\({}_{2}\)O molecules are stronger as compared to the instantaneous dipole-induced dipole interactions between H\({}_{2}\) and CO\({}_{2}\) molecules (assumption 2 less valid for H\({}_{2}\)O). Hence H\({}_{2}\)O deviates more from ideality compared to H\({}_{2}\) and CO\({}_{2}\) at low pressures.
* However, at high pressures, CO\({}_{2}\) deviates more from ideality compared to H\({}_{2}\) and H\({}_{2}\)O as volume of the CO\({}_{2}\) molecule is larger than that of H\({}_{2}\) and H\({}_{2}\)O molecules (assumption 1 less valid for CO\({}_{2}\)).

See Appendix 3 for further discussion on deviations from the ideal gas laws.

## Appendix 0.2

Using the Kinetic Molecular Theory of Gases to explain the behaviour of gases

### 0.2.1 Gas Pressure

Gas molecules are in constant random motion within the container that the gas is in and collide with the walls of the container. When they do so, they exert a force which results in pressure being set up \(\left(\text{pressure}=\frac{\text{force}}{\text{area}}\right)\).

### 0.2.2 Boyle's Law

When the volume of the gas decreases, the distances between the gas molecules and the walls of the container are shorter. Hence, molecules collide with the walls more **frequently**, leading to greater pressure being exerted _by_ the gas.

When the pressure exerted _on_ the gas increases, gas molecules are forced closer together, leading to a decrease in volume.

### 0.3.3 Charles' Law

When temperature of the gas increases, the gas molecules have higher kinetic energy and move faster. They hit the walls of the container more frequently and with greater force, resulting in greater pressure being exerted by the gas. This results in the walls of the container moving outwards (i.e. increase in volume) until constant pressure is restored.

### 0.4.4 Avogadro's Law/ Dalton's Law of Partial Pressure

The pressure exerted by the gas depends on the number of collisions per second, which is in turn proportional to the number of gas molecules present.

## Appendix 3 Trend of the _pV-p_ graph for a real gas

As we have discussed in the previous sections, the behaviours of real gases do not always obey the ideal gas equation, _pV = nRT_.

In 1873, Dutch physicist Johannes van der Waals successfully accounted for the behaviour of real gases by introducing two additional terms to the ideal gas equation, resulting in the **van der Waals equation**:

The constants \(a\) and \(b\) differ for different gases: \(a\) correlates with the strength of the intermolecular forces between the gas particles, while \(b\) correlates with the size of the molecules. The smaller the constants are for a real gas, the more ideal it is. The van der Waals constants for some gases are listed in the table below:

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|} \hline
**gas** & _a / Pa m\({}^{6}\) mol\({}^{-2}\)_ & _b / 10\({}^{-5}\) m\({}^{3}\) mol\({}^{-1}\)_ \\ \hline water vapour & 0.5537 & 3.049 \\ \hline ammonia & 0.4225 & 3.713 \\ \hline carbon dioxide & 0.3658 & 4.286 \\ \hline carbon monoxide & 0.1472 & 3.948 \\ \hline nitrogen & 0.1370 & 3.87 \\ \hline hydrogen & 0.02453 & 2.651 \\ \hline helium & 0.00346 & 2.38 \\ \hline \end{tabular}
