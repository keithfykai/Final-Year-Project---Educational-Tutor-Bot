Ecology: study of interactions between organisms and environment Ecosystem: consists of all organisms; biotic factors and abiotic factors Biotic factors: refers to all living organisms (e.g. plants, bacteria) within an ecosystem and the interactions between them (e.g. predation, competition for resources) Abiotic factors: non-living, chemical and physical factors in the environment that the community interacts with (e.g. air composition like oxygen content, light intensity, temperature)
\begin{tabular}{p{142.3pt} p{341.4pt}}  & **Non-cyclic/ linear/ one-directional energy flow:** \\ \end{tabular}

In any ecosystem, the ultimate source of energy is the Sun. Light energy from the sun is absorbed by chlorophyll in producers and converted into chemical energy during photosynthesis \\ Plants make its own food via photosynthesis and contain carbon in the form glucose, sucrose, starch \\ Energy is passed from one trophic level to another when primary consumer feed on the producers and so on \\ \end{tabular}

**Efficiency of energy transfer:**

Organisms at each trophic level pass on about 10% energy to the next trophic level compared to what they receive \\ Hence organisms in the lower trophic level have more energy available to them compared to those in higher trophic levels \\ Energy losses: Energy is lost at every trophic level as heat in respiration, \\ uneaten organism parts and through excreted and eegested waste material. \\ This lost energy cannot be recycled. \\ Faeces, excretory products and dead organisms contain trapped chemical energy. This energy is released through the activity of decompayers. Decomposers use some of this trapped chemical energy for their needs, releasing CO2. The rest of the energy is lost as heat.

**- A pyramid of numbers shows the relative population size/**

**number of each trophic level in a food chain at a particular time**

**- Pattern: Usually, the number of producers at the base is the largest, as they are needed to feed the next level. The number of consumers gradually decreases towards the top**

**- Disadvantage: It is not an accurate estimate of the amount of energy at each trophic level because the population number does not always correspond to the amount of energy it can transfer to the next trophic level, e.g. a single tree can support a large population of caterpillars*** A pyramid of biomass shows the dry mass of organisms at each trophic level in a food chain.
* Dry mass: mass of an organism after moisture is removed
* **Pattern:** The biomass of the producer is the largest as it supplies all the energy for the resumers. Biomass is lost along the food chain due to loss of energy (to respiration, heat, waste etc.)
* **-Disadvantages:** Dry mass cannot be easily obtained from every animal e.g. human beings, large animats like tigers. It is also destructive as it involves drying the organism at 100 \({}^{\circ}\)C, which will affect the food chain/ food web.

(e) Describe how carbon is cycled within an ecosystem and outline the role of forests and oceans as carbon sinks* Ensures there is a continuous supply of carbon dioxide for plants to carry out photosynthesis.
* Allows photosynthesis to convert light energy from the Sun into chemical energy in food, which non-photosynthetic organisms can feed on to stay alive.
* Enables energy to flow through the ecosystem. Carbon compounds carry the stored energy from organism to organism in the food chains of an ecosystem.
* Maintains the correct concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.

(f) Describe how human activities, such as deforestation and use of fossil fuels, cause an increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration, leading to global warming Human activities as carbon sources, leading to global warming

Fossil fuels are burnt to release energy so as to generate electricity for human uses.

**Combustion of fossil fuels release large amount of carbon dioxide, increasing level of atmospheric carbon dioxide**

Deforestation, purposeful clearance of forest, is done for reasons such as urbanisation or agriculture.

When trees are "slash and burnt" / cut down, they release stored carbon as atmospheric carbon dioxide and there are lesser trees to photosynthesis, increasing level of atmospheric carbon dioxide

Carbon dioxide causes more heat to be absorbed and reflected back to earth, increasing greenhouse effect, leading to global warming- the rise in earth's temperature (g) Discuss how human actions can reduce

the effects of global warming 

**Ways to reduce global warming:**

\(\bullet\) Utilise renewable energy sources like solar or wind energy

\(\bullet\) Opt for electric vehicles, public transport and carpooling

\(\bullet\) Save electricity: turn off appliances when not in use,

switch to energy-efficient appliances

\(\bullet\) Enforce laws to reduce carbon dioxide emissionsAddress deforestation:

* Regulate rate of logging
* Selective logging: do not cut down
* young trees
* Designating land as forest reserves
* ReforestationEffects of pollution caused by

savage in water

* Untreated sewage contains high concentrations of nitrates and phosphates
* If released into water, this results in eutrophication: entry of nitrates and phosphates in into waters
* Minerals would cause population explosion of native bacterial and algal species, leading to algal bloom: excessive algae growth, forming thick opaque layer on water surface
* Algal bloom would block entry of sunlight into the waters
* Submerged plants, or aquatic plants living beneath the water surface cannot photosynthesize and will die
* Decomposers will consume oxygen to break down dead algae and aquatic plants
* This deprives fishes and other aquatic organism of oxygen to respire, who will subsequently die.
* Loss of marine life overall leads to loss in biodiversity and habitat Effects of pollution caused by

Plastic wastes in the marine environment

Most plastics are non-biodegradable. They will remain in the environment for a prolonged period, posing risks to marine life when discarded into waters.

Ingestion: Pieces of plastic may be mistakenly eaten by marine organisms, which can cause internal injuries and kill them.

Entanglement: Marine animals become tangled in plastic debris and live fishing lines. This may cause injuries and even suffocation.

Habitat degradation: Plastic can damage certain ecosystems' habitats such as coral reefs

# Effects of pollution caused by insecticides

###### Abstract

Environmental contamination: insecticides may accumulate in soil, waters and vegetation, contaminating the environment and aquatic ecosystems

Unintended harm: insecticides may destroy non-target organism as well, killing other insects, birds and animals. This disrupts ecosystems and reduces biodiversity

Bioaccumulation and biomagnification

Insecticides contain inorganic and non-biodegradable chemicals that are toxic at high concentrations

When organisms consume producers laced with insecticides, toxic insecticides is transferred to the organism

Organisms are unable to digest these insecticides

Instead, insecticides are stored in the tissues of organisms

This results in bioaccumulation: a buildup of inorganic compounds in organism body overtime

Organisms at higher trophic levels would need to consume multiple organisms at lower trophic levels due to inefficient energy transfer

This results in biomagnification: an increase in concentration of inorganic compounds in organism at higher trophic level as larger amounts of insecticides are being transferred to organisms at higher trophic level(I) Discuss how the conservation of species and sustainable use of natural resources contribute to the maintenance of biodiversity and a balanced ecosystem (e.g. coral reef, tropical rainforest, mangrove)

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:25]

conservation

Conservation is the protection and perseveration of species, their habitats and entire ecosystems from extinction.

Importance of conservation:

Maintaining a large gene pool is important as many wild plants and animals possess favourable genes. By cross-breeding the different varieties of wild plants and animals, we can improve agricultural produce such as improving yield and quality of organisms

Preserves the existence of rich variety of species for us and future generations to appreciate and enjoy

Many tropical plants are of great importance as they are sources of medicinal drugs.

Economical value

Tropical rainforests provide raw materials such as timber, cotton and rubber for industries

Ecotourism is a source of income for several countries such as Costa Rica, Madagascar, and Kenya.

Marine life, tropical rainforests provide food sources such as seafood and maize

Stable and balances

This prevents disruption of natural cycles such as carbon cycles
