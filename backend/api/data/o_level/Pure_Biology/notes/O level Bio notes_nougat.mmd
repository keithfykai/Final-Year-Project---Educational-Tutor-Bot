## Movement of Substances

1. Diffusion 1. Diffusion is the net movement of particles from a region of higher concentration to a region of lower concentration, down a concentration gradient. 2. Condition(s): There must be a concentration gradient. 3. Can assume that movement of one type of particle is unaffected by the presence of other types of particles.
2. Osmosis Osmosis is the net movement of water molecules from a solution of higher water potential to a solution of lower water potential, through a partially permeable membrane, down a water potential gradient. Condition(s): p.p.m; water potential gradient. 1. Template 1. Compare wp. There is a higher wp in the ___ than in the ___. 2. Describe movement 3. There is a net movement of water molecules from ___ to ___ by osmosis. 3. Result 4. Know how osmosis causes bending 1. If one group of cells is unable to shrink or expand due to a waxy cuticle or is hardened, then there will be uneven expansion/contraction resulting in bending 2. Examples: guard cells have wall thicker on one side; cutting of strips) 3. Sources of error for osmosis experiments 1. Epithelial layers can _interfere (do NOT use vague language! If there is an effect, state the effect and why it occurs)_ with results - e.g. affects mass measured 2. Evaporation (DODGY) - e.g. using test tube vs petri dish - larger exposed surface area using petri dish, solution will evaporate faster 3. Dilution effects (DODGY) water moving out of the potato strips will affect the concentration of the solution - better way is to use larger volumes using larger containers 4. Different parts of the organ may have different compositions in the tissue, leading to different results 5. Active transport 1. Active transport is the process in which energy is used to move the particles of a substance across a **membrane** (not p.p.m/cell membrane) against its concentration gradient. 2. Requires energy (from respiration, which requires oxygen) - show this understanding in explanations2. Lower concentration to higher concentration - however, active transport happens when the body needs to absorb important substances, even when it is down a concentration gradient, so that these substances can be absorbed more quickly (e.g. selective reabsorption of glucose from glomerular filtrate; absorbing ions to create a concentrated cell sap; absorption of glucose, amino acids and fatty acids and glycerol from small intestine; absorption of potassium ions by guard cells, etc)
3. Active transport does not require a p.p.m, by definition (but in the syllabus, you'll usually see active transport happening across a living p.p.m since active transport requires energy)
4. Comparison

Diffusion

Does not require p.p.m

Movement of any type of particles

Movement of water molecules

Higher concentration to lower concentration

Higher water potential to lower water potential

Similarities (diffusion & osmosis):

1. Both passive processes - no energy required
2. Both can occur across a p.p.m
3. Both involve the movement of substance from higher concentration of that substance to a lower concentration of that substance until dynamic equilibrium is reached (DODGY)

## 1 Nutrients

1. Water 1. Transport medium 2. Medium for chemical reactions 3. Key component of many secretions & bodily fluids 4. Lubricates surfaces 5. Used in hydrolytic reactions 6. Controlling body temperature: 1. Water in sweat evaporates from skin surface--latent heat lost--cool body 6. Maintains temperature of the body since it has high heat capacity 2. Fibre 1. Provides roughage; adds bulk to food so that the alimentary canal can propel food along more easily through peristalsis, reducing the risk of constipation and allowing food to pass through the digestive system faster 3. Carbohydrates 1. Made up of C, H and O 2. Made up of monosaccharide units (glu, gal, fru) joined by glycosidic bonds to form disaccharides (maltose - glu-glu, lactose - glu - gal, sucrose - glu-fru) and polysaccharides (starch, glycogen, cellulose) through condensation reactions 3. Monosaccharides 1. Glucose: found in plants and animals 2. Fructose: common in plants, rare in animals 3. Galactose: present in milk sugar of mammals 4. Disaccharides 5. Sucrose: found in plants, not in animals, sucrose = glucose + fructose 6. Maltose: occurs in germinating grains, maltose = glucose + glucose 7. Lactose: occurs in milk of mammals, lactose = glucose + galactose 7. Polysaccharides 1. Starch: storage form of carbohydrates in plants; can be digested to glucose for aerobic respiration to release energy 2. Cellulose: found in cell walls, which protect plant cells from injury; cannot be digested in intestines of humans; enzyme that breaks down cellulose: 3. Glycogen: storage form of carbohydrates in mammals; can be digested to glucose for aerobic respiration to release energy 4. Properties that make starch and glycogen suitable storage of carbohydrates 1. Insoluble in water: does not affect the water potential in cells; if a cell stores soluble monosaccharides, the monosaccharides will dissolve in the water of the cytoplasm of the cell--lowering the water potential of the cytoplasm of the cell, causing osmosis of water into the cell--if it is an animal cell, cell may expand and burstLarge molecule: does not diffuse through the cell membrane as it is too big; will not be lost from cell
3. Compact: more glycogen or starch can be stored in a given space
4. Easily hydrolys to glucose: can be used easily, can respire aerobically to release energy quickly

Condensation reaction: chemical reaction in which two simple molecules are joined together to form a larger molecule with the removal of one water molecule Hydrolysis/hydrolytic reaction: reaction in which a water molecule is needed to break up a complex molecule into smaller molecules

## Enzymes

1. Biological catalysts that are protein in nature that increase the rate of biological reactions by decreasing the activation energy.
2. Enzyme activity is 1. Highly specific 3-D shape of active site of an enzyme only complementary to shape of substrate of the reaction catalysed (one enzyme one substrate - will usually test this by showing diagram of enzymes and substrates + shape of the active site) 2. Temperature dependent (at low temp it is inactive, at optimum temp its activity is max, and above optimum temp it is denatured) 3. pH dependent (at optimum pH its activity is max, and above and below optimum pH it is denatured) 4. Affected by substrate concentration (higher concentration, higher rate until the active sites start becoming fully occupied) 5. Enzymes remain chemically unchanged at the end of reactions and can be reused, so they are required in small amounts 1. Enzymes are **inactive at low temperatures** since their **kinetic energy levels are low** and the **frequency of effective collisions** between substrate and enzyme molecules is **low**. 2. Enzyme activity increases with temperature. **For every 10oC rise in temperature, the rate of enzyme reaction doubles** until optimum temperature is reached. Raising the temperature **increases the kinetic energy levels** of the molecules, and hence more enzyme and substrate molecules have **energy levels equal to or greater than activation energy.** The **frequency of effective collisions** between enzyme and substrate molecules increases and the chances of the substrates fitting into the active sites of the enzymes increase. Thus, the **rate of formation of enzyme-substrate complexes increases**. 3. At the optimum temperature, the enzyme is the **most active** and the rate of reaction is the highest. 4. Beyond the optimum temperature, **enzyme activity decreases.** The high temperature **breaks the hydrogen bonds** that keep the enzyme protein in shape. The **active site** of the enzyme **loses its original shape** and the shape of the substrate is **no longer complementary** to that of the active site, and can no longer fit into it. The enzyme is **denatured.** 1. As the substrate concentration increases, the **rate of reaction increases** as the **frequency of effective collisions** between substrate and enzyme molecules **increases**. Thus, the chances of the substrates fitting into the active sites of the enzymes increases and the **rate of formation of enzyme-substrate complexes increases**. 2. However, after a certain point, increasing the substrate concentration no longer increases the rate of the reaction any further, since at any given instant, all the **active sites** of the molecules are being **binded to the substrate molecules**. The enzyme molecules are **saturated**. The number of products formed per unit time remains the same. Enzyme concentration is now the limiting factor.

\begin{tabular}{|p{142.3pt}|p{142.3pt}|} \hline
**1.** & At the optimum pH, enzyme activity is the greatest. \\
2. & Beyond and below its optimum pH, the enzyme is **denatured**. \\
3. & The active site of the enzyme **loses its original shape** and the shape of the substrate is **no longer complementary** to that of the active site, and can no longer fit into it. \\ \hline \end{tabular}

## Nutrition in Humans

1. Digestion a. Types i. Physical: break up large pieces/droplets of food into smaller pieces/droplets to increase surface area to volume ratio for more efficient digestion by enzymes ii.

3. Absorption

### 1.

Whitters

Glucose and amino acids

Glycerol and fatty acids diffuse

Water is absorbed by diffusion

diffuse into the epithelium of

villi

combine to form minute fat

globules when they enter the

absorbed in the ileum

lacetWhen there is a lower concentration of glucose and amino acids in the lumen of the small intestine than in the blood capillaries, glucose and amino acids are absorbed by active transport

b. Adaptations

**Adaptation**

**Function**

1. Inner surface of the small intestine is folded faster absorption of digested food substances

2. Folds bear numerous willi, whose epithelial cells have numerous microvilli

Villi have one-cell thick epithelium Decrease diffusion distance of digested food substances

Rich supply of blood capillaries Allow continual transport of digested food substances to maintain a steep concentration gradient

Very long (~7m) Provide sufficient time for absorption of digested food substances

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:17]

* Fats are absorbed into lacteals (lymphatic capillaries), which then join to form larger lymphatic vessels
* These lymphatic vessels discharge fats into the bloodstream
* Fats are used to build protoplasm, when there is sufficient supply of glucose.
* When there is insufficient glucose, fats are broken down to release energy
* Excess fats are stored in adipose tissues beneath the skin and around the heart and the kidneys. Adipose tissues protect these organs by acting as shock absorbers.

4. Liver
* should only use this point when desperate for the role of the liver
* Regulation of blood glucose concentration (refer to _Homeostasis_)
* Iron storage
* Worn-out red blood cells are destroyed in the spleen, releasing haemoglobin, which is brought to the liver
* The liver breaks down the haemoglobin
* The iron released in the process is stored in the liver for synthesis of new red blood cells
* Bile pigments are also released
* Deamination of excess amino acids
* Excess amino acids are deaminated in the liver. The amino groups of the excess amino acids are removed and converted to ammonia, which is toxic to cells and is then converted to urea, which is non-toxic and excreted in urine.
* The carbon residues of excess amino acids are converted to glucose, which is converted to glycogen and stored in the liver and muscles

* Liver produces alcohol dehydrogenase
* Alcohol dehydrogenase catalyses the breakdown of alcohol into acetaldehyde
* Acetaldehyde can be broken down further to compounds that can be used in respiration to release energy for cellular activities
* Protein synthesis
* Liver synthesises proteins found in the blood plasma, including prothrombin and fibrinogen, which are essential for blood clotting

5. Effects of excessive alcohol consumption

* Short term effects
* Slower reactions (longer reaction times)
* Poorer coordination
* Slower speech
* Lowered inhibitions
* Long term effects

### Nutrition in Plants

* Light-dependent stage:
* Photolysis of water: light energy absorbed by chlorophyll is used to split water into hydrogen and oxygen atoms
* The oxygen atoms combine to form oxygen gas
* Other high-energy molecules are generated for use in the light-independent stage to convert carbon dioxide into glucose
* Light-independent stage:
* Hydrogen produced in photolysis is used to reduce carbon dioxide to glucose
* The chemical energy stored during the light reactions as high-energy molecules is used in this process
* Other note(s):
* In the light-dependent stage, 12 molecules of water are split up to yield 6 molecules of oxygen and 24 atoms of hydrogen.
* All the oxygen gas released during photosynthesis comes from water.
* As the rate of photosynthesis increases, more oxygen is produced. The volume of oxygen produced thus indicates the rate of photosynthesis.
* In the light-independent stage, the hydrogen released during photosynthesis is used to reduce 6 molecules of carbon dioxide. As a result, 1 molecule of glucose is formed.
* Several enzymes are involved in the light-independent stage.
* Overall equation:
* Chemical equation:
* Word equation:
* light energy
* glucose + oxygen
2. Limiting factors of photosynthesis a. Limiting factors are factors that directly affect a process if its quantity is changed. b. Limiting factors are factors that would increase the rate of photosynthesis when they are increased. If reducing a factor reduces the rate of photosynthesis, it PROVES NOTHING. (When you reduce it, it proves that it HAS been limiting, but it doesn't mean that it WAS limiting.)

When increasing light intensity or carbon dioxide concentration no longer increases the rate of photosynthesis, then light intensity or carbon dioxide concentration is no longer the L.F. Some other factors could be causing the plateau of the graph.

In the entire rate of photosynthesis-temperature graph, temperature is the L.F except for the point at the optimum temperature.

*notes: Carbon dioxide concentration affects, since carbon dioxide is a substrate; light intensity provides the energy for photosynthesis to occur. Humidity may affect photosynthetic rate.

3. Fate of glucose a. Respiration b. Converted to cellulose to form cell walls c. Excess glucose stored as starch in leaves d. Converted to sucrose by combining it with fructose to be transported to other parts of the plant e. Reacts mineral salts to form to form amino acids in leaves i. Amino acids are used to form proteins for the synthesis of new protoplasm in leaves ii. Excess amino acids are transported to other parts of the plant for synthesis of new protoplasm or for storage as proteins f. Forms fats: i. for storage ii. for cellular respiration iii. for synthesis of new protoplasm

4. Graphs of photosynthesis * At point B, there is a decrease in oxygen uptake and an increase in oxygen release. The rate of photosynthesis increases. **Photosynthesis starts at point B**, as soon as the plant starts to release oxygen. This is because oxygen used up per unit time is lower, meaning that some of the oxygen used up by respiration is being offset by small amounts of oxygen produced by photosynthesis.
* At C, the amount of oxygen released is equal to the amount of oxygen absorbed. This suggests that the rate of photosynthesis is equal to the rate of respiration. (Note: "rate of p/s is the same as rate of r/s")
* Photosynthesis experiments

### Factors necessary for photosynthesis

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|} \hline \hline Step & Action & Purpose \\ \hline

### Factors necessary for photosynthesis

Experiment 2: Test for starch in a leaf:

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|} \hline \hline Step & 
\begin{tabular}{c} Action \\ \end{tabular} & Purpose \\ \hline
1 & Plant containing P1 was placed in a dark room & To destarch the plant so that any starch \\  & for 48 hours. & present in P1 later is only formed during \\  & & the experiment. \\ \hline

* P1 was removed from the hot water and placed into a boiling tube containing ethanol. The boiling tube is then placed into a beaker of boiling water.
* P1 was removed from the boiling water using a forcep and placed back into hot water.
* P1 was stained with iodine solution on a white tile.

Observation: The iodine solution turns from yellowish brown to blue-black.

Conclusion: Starch is present in the leaf.

* Destarch a potted plant by placing it in the dark for two days.
* Remove one leaf. Test it for starch as described in Experiment 1.
* Sandwich a leaf, which is still attached to the plant, between two pieces of black paper. Each paper has a certain pattern cut out from it. Fasten the papers with paper clips. Place the plant in strong sunlight.
* After a few hours, remove the leaf and test it for starch.
* Make a drawing of the leaf to show the regions that are stained blue-black.
* Before the treatment of the leaf with iodine solution, the leaf must be **de-starched**. This is to ensure that the formation of starch from excess glucose occurred during the experiment.
* When iodine solution is applied to the parts exposed to light, the iodine solution changes from yellowish-brown to blue-black. (Reason: The chlorophyll in the chloroplasts absorb light energy for photosynthesis, producing **excess*
* glucose which is converted to starch for storage.)
* When iodine solution is applied to the parts that were covered by the black paper, the iodine solution remains yellowish brown. (Reason: The chlorophyll in these parts were not exposed to light, so light energy cannot be absorbed by chlorophyll for photosynthesis to occur.)

**Experiment 2**: Test if light is necessary for photosynthesis:

* Destarch a potted plant by placing it in the dark for two days.
* Remove one leaf. Test it for starch as described in Experiment 1.
* Sandwich a leaf, which is still attached to the plant, between two pieces of black paper. Each paper has a certain pattern cut out from it. Fasten the papers with paper clips. Place the plant in strong sunlight.
* After a few hours, remove the leaf and test it for starch.
* Make a drawing of the leaf to show the regions that are stained blue-black.
* Before the treatment of the leaf with iodine solution, the leaf must be **de-starched**. This is to ensure that the formation of starch from excess glucose occurred during the experiment.
* When iodine solution is applied to the parts exposed to light, the iodine solution changes from yellowish-brown to blue-black. (Reason: The chlorophyll in the chloroplasts absorb light energy for photosynthesis, producing **excess*
* glucose which is converted to starch for storage.)
* When iodine solution is applied to the parts that were covered by the black paper, the iodine solution remains yellowish brown. (Reason: The chlorophyll in these parts were not exposed to light, so light energy cannot be absorbed by chlorophyll for photosynthesis to occur.)

**Experiment 3**: Test if chlorophyll is necessary for photosynthesis:1. Destarch a plant with variegated leaves by placing it in the dark for two days.
2. Expose the plant to strong sunlight for a few hours.
3. Remove one leaf. Make a drawing to show the distribution of the green parts, i.e. the parts that contain chlorophyll.
4. Decolourise the leaf and test it for starch.
5. Make a drawing of the leaf to show the distribution of the blue-black colour. Compare this with your drawing in step 3. 1. Before the treatment of the leaf with iodine solution, the leaf must be **de-starched**. This is to ensure that the formation of starch from excess glucose occurred during the experiment. 2. When iodine solution is applied to the green parts of the leaves, the iodine solution changes from yellowish-brown to blue-black. (Reason: Only those parts containing chlorophyll will absorb light energy and photosynthesis occurs, which produces **excess** glucose, which is converted to starch for storage, so starch is present.) 3. When iodine solution is applied to the non-green parts of the leaves, the iodine solution remains yellowish-brown. (Reason: Chlorophyll is absent in these parts of the leaves, hence, light energy cannot be absorbed and photosynthesis does not occur, so no glucose is produced. Thus, this does not give rise to excess glucose converted to starch for storage, so starch is absent.)

Experiment 4: Test if carbon dioxide is necessary in photosynthesis:

1. Destarch two potted plants by placing them in the dark for two days.
2. Enclose the pots in polythene bags. Secure the bags to the plant stems.
3. Place one pot in the bell jar. The plant does not have a supply of carbon dioxide from the air because soda lime and potassium hydroxide solution rapidly absorb carbon dioxide. Leave the whole apparatus in strong sunlight for a few hours.

Set up a control using pebbles and water in place of soda lime and potassium hydroxide solution respectively. Leave the control apparatus in strong sunlight for a few hours.

Notes:

1. Chemicals used: 1. The soda lime serves as a "filter". The soda lime absorbs carbon dioxide from the atmospheric air that enters the bell-jar. 2. The sodium hydroxide serves to remove the remaining carbon dioxide in the bell-jar. 3. The soda lime and sodium hydroxide hence ensure that there is no carbon dioxide present in the bell-jar.
2. The soil is covered with a polythene bag: 1. To prevent water loss by evaporation of water in the soil. 2. To prevent the contribution of carbon dioxide into the air in the set-up by microorganisms living in the soil that respire. 3. When iodine solution is applied to the leaf exposed to air with carbon dioxide, the iodine solution changes from yellowish-brown to blue-black. (Reason: Carbon dioxide is required in photosynthesis. It is reduced by hydrogen to glucose. The excess glucose formed in photosynthesis is converted to starch for storage, so starch is present.) 4. When iodine solution is applied to the leaf exposed to air without carbon dioxide, the iodine solution remains yellowish-brown. (Reason: Carbon dioxide is required in photosynthesis. It is reduced by hydrogen to glucose. Without carbon dioxide, no photosynthesis occurs, so no glucose is produced. Thus, this does not give rise to excess glucose converted to starch for storage, so starch is absent.)

2. **Factors affecting the rate of photosynthesis**

Experiment 1: Effect of light intensity on the rate of photosynthesis:

1. Set up the apparatus as shown above with the cut end of the water plant positioned upwards.

2. Air bubbles are given off from the cut end of the plant. Allow some time for the plant to adapt to the conditions provided before taking readings.
3. When the bubbles are produced at a regular rate, count the number of bubbles over a period of 5 minutes. Repeat this a few times to obtain the average rate
4. Repeat step 3 with the light source closer to the plant, e.g. 80 cm, 40 cm, 30 cm, 20 cm, 15 cm and 10 cm. The nearer the light source is to the beaker, the higher the light intensity that the plant is exposed to.
5. Record your results in a table. Plot a graph to show the rate of bubbling per minute against the distance between the lamp and the plant.

* Some time is allowed for the rate of bubbling to stabilise.
* Observation: The rate of bubbling increases as the distance of the lamp from the plant decreases.
* The dilute sodium hydrogencarbonate solution serves as a source of dissolved carbon dioxide.
* In some experiments, sodium bicarbonate is used. Sodium bicarbonate solution spontaneously decomposes to form carbon dioxide.

The cut end of the plant faces upwards to allow bubbles containing oxygen to rise. A bubbler may be used in this experiment to serve the following purposes:

1. To ensure that all the bubbles are **of the same size.** 2. Acts as an **electronic counter.** 3. To slow down bubbling to make it **more visible** for the counting of bubbles to be more accurate.

The bubbles produced contain oxygen gas, **a product of photosynthesis**. Thus, the greater the number of bubbles produced, the higher the rate of photosynthesis. The rate of gas production is **proportional** to the rate of photosynthesis.

The rate of photosynthesis measured by this method may be lower than expected as:

1. Some of the oxygen gas in the bubbles might have dissolved in the water as oxygen gas is slightly soluble in water, hence the number of oxygen bubbles counted may be lower.
2. Some oxygen is used during respiration while the plant is photosynthesis.

Experiment 2: Effect of temperature on the rate of photosynthesis:1. Set up the apparatus as shown above with the cut end of the water plant positioned upwards.
2. Place a lamp 10 cm away from the plant. Keep this distance constant throughout the experiment.
3. Add ice-cold water to the water bath to keep the temperature at 5 \({}^{\circ}\)C. Allow some time for the plant to adapt to the conditions provided before taking the readings.
4. Count the number of bubbles over a period of 5 minutes. Repeat this a few times to obtain an average rate.
5. Repeat step 4 at different temperatures, e.g. 15\({}^{\circ}\)C, 25\({}^{\circ}\)C, 35\({}^{\circ}\)C, 45\({}^{\circ}\)C, 55\({}^{\circ}\)C, 65\({}^{\circ}\)C and 75\({}^{\circ}\)C.
6. Record your results in a table. Plot a graph to show the rate of bubbling per minute against the temperature.

* Notes: The experiment starts off using cold water. This is to check if temperature is a limiting factor. If the water is too warm, the enzymes in the leaf may be denatured.
* It is observed that the rate of bubbling increases as the temperature is increased. The reactions in photosynthesis are enzyme-dependent.
* At low temperatures, enzymes are inactive.
* At extreme temperatures higher than optimum temperatures, enzymes are denatured.

Experiment 3: Effect of carbon dioxide on the rate of photosynthesis:1. Set up the apparatus as shown above with the cut end of the water plant positioned upwards.
2. Place a lamp 10 cm away from the plant. Keep this distance constant throughout the experiment.
3. Conduct the experiment at room temperature.
4. Use different concentrations of sodium hydrogencarbonate solutions, e.g. 0.01 mol/dm\({}^{3}\), 0.02 mol/dm\({}^{3}\), 0.03 mol/dm\({}^{3}\), 0.04 mol/dm\({}^{3}\), 0.05 mol/dm\({}^{3}\), up to 0.1 mol/dm\({}^{3}\). (These are proportional to the carbon dioxide concentrations in the solution.)
5. When the bubbles are coming out at a regular rate, measure the rate of bubbling for each concentration of the sodium hydrogencarbonate solution.
6. Plot a graph to show the rate of bubbling against the concentration of the solution.

* Different concentrations of sodium hydrogencarbonate solutions are used.
* It is observed that the rate of bubbling increases as the concentration of the sodium hydrogencarbonate solution is increased.

* Cuticle on the upper epidermis: **Prevents** water vapour loss through transpiration, as it is impermeable to water.
* Cuticle on the lower epidermis: **Reduces** water vapour loss through transpiration, as it is impermeable to water.
* Transparent for light to penetrate into the mesophyll layers.
* "Focuses" light onto the mesophyll layers.
* Protects the epidermis.

Upper epidermis

* Epidermal cells do not contain chloroplasts and are transparent to allow light to penetrate into the inner layers of the leaf.
* Has fewer stomata to reduce water loss by transpiration.

Lower epidermis

* Has numerous stomata. (Note: However, water plants are an exception. They have more stomata on the upper epidermis of their leaves, to **allow air to enter** and **allow excess water to be lost by transpiration.**)
* will test)

* Open in the presence of light, allowing carbon dioxide epidermal layers

* Largest concentration of chloroplasts (feature) as they receive the most sunlight so that they can maximise light absorption (important) for photosynthesis

* If question is to "support the plant..." \(\rightarrow\) photosynthesis \(\rightarrow\) produce glucose, which is used for...(other purposes) \(\rightarrow\) point on photosynthesis can be developed further

* Cells are not as compact as those in the palisade mesophyll layer.
* Cells have fewer chloroplasts than those in the palisade mesophyll layer.
* Irregularly-shaped cells and their loose arrangement allow for large intercellular air spaces to occur around them to allow rapid diffusion of carbon dioxide and oxygen into and out of mesophyll cells.
* Cells are covered with a thin film of moisture * 7. Regulation of the size of stomata (potassium ion theory)
* 1. Under the presence of light
* 1. Guard cells photosynthesis, converting light energy to chemical energy.
* 2. The chemical energy is used to pump potassium ions into the guard cells from neighbouring epidermal cells by active transport.
* 3. Potassium ion concentration in the cell sap of the guard cells increases and its water potential decreases.
* 4. Water molecules from neighbouring epidermal cells enter the guard cells by osmosis, down a water potential gradient.
* 5. The guard cells expand a little and become turgid.
* 6. The guard cells have a thicker cell wall on one side, causing the swollen guard cells to become more curved and pull the stoma open.
* 2. Under the absence of light
* 1. The potassium ions that have accumulated in the guard cells when light is present diffuse out of the guard cells.
* 2. Potassium ion concentration in the cell sap of the guard cells decreases and its water potential increases.
* 3. Water molecules leave the guard cells by osmosis, down a water potential gradient.
* 4. The guard cells become flaccid and the stoma closes.
* 8. Movement of carbon dioxide through a leaf
* 1. Under the presence of light, carbon dioxide in the leaf is used up rapidly for photosynthesis.
* 2. Carbon dioxide concentration in the leaf becomes lower than that of atmospheric air. Carbon dioxide diffuses from the surrounding air into the air spaces in the leaf, down a carbon dioxide concentration gradient.
* 3. The surfaces of the mesophyll cells are covered by a thin film of moisture so that carbon dioxide can dissolve in it.
* 4. The dissolved carbon dioxide diffuses into the cells.

### Transport in Humans

A

Antibody b

B

Antigen B

Antibody a

AB

Antigens A and B

No antibodies

O

No antigen

Antibodies a and b *antibody a binds with antigen A, antibody b binds with antigen B

* During blood transfusion, the effect of the recipient's plasma on the donor's red blood cells is considered.
* Blood type O is the universal donor: there are no antigens on the donor's red blood cells, so the antibodies in the recipient's plasma will not bind to the red blood cells
* Blood type AB is the universal acceptor. There are no antibodies in the plasma. Hence, no agglutination of red blood cells in the donor's blood will occur.

3 Functions of blood

* Transport function

* **Substances transported** **Carried from** **Carried to** **Digested food** **Intestines** **-** Other parts of the body -glucose, amino acids, dissolved mineral salts, fats, vitamins -** Excess dissolved mineral salts are transported to the kidneys for excretion

Excretery products: Nitrogenous wastes (urea, uric acid, creatinine)

Excretery products: All parts of the body **Lungs, where the hydrogencarbonate ions are hydrogencarbonate ions in plasma)** **converted to carbon dioxide and expelled**

* **Hormones** **Glands** **Target organs**

* **Heat** **Respiring body tissues** **All parts of the body to maintain uniform body temperature * Protective function i. Blood clotting:
* 1. **Damaged tissues and thrombocytes release thrombokinase.*
* 2. **Thrombokinase catalyses the conversion of inactive prothrombin to active thrombin*
* in the presence of calcium ions.*
* 3. **Thrombin catalyses the conversion of soluble fibrinogen to insoluble fibrin threads.*
* 4. **Insoluble fibrin threads entangle blood cells to form a clot, sealing the wound and preventing further blood loss and entry of pathogens into the bloodstream.*
* 2. **Heparin, an anti-clotting substance, prevents blood in undamaged blood vessels from clotting. Thromokinase neutralises the action of heparin for clotting to occur.*
* 3. **When blood clots, serum is left behind. Serum has the same composition as plasma except that it lacks clotting factors.*
* 4. **Leucocytes Lymphocytes arrive at the site of infection and recognise the antigens on the bacteria. Lymphocytes produce antibodies specific to the bacteria's antigen. The antibody binds to the antigens and causes the bacterial membrane to rupture and its organelles to leak out. The bacteria die. Antibodies that bind to the antigens on the bacteria cause agglutination of the bacteria, which are ingested and digested by phagocytes as a whole during phagocytosis.*
* 4. **Circulatory system a. Adaptations*
* **wall of capillaries is a one-cell-thick endothelium to decrease the diffusion distance for substances to diffuse quickly through capillary walls*
* **capillaries branch repeatedly to increase the surface area to volume ratio, decreasing blood pressure and slowing down blood flow for more time for exchange of substances between the blood and tissue cells*
* **have valves to prevent backflow of blood*
* **large, wide lumen to reduce resistance to blood flow back to heart*
* **relatively thinner, less elastic and less muscular wall for deoxygenated blood to flow slowly through the lungs at a lower pressure for sufficient time for gaseous exchange*

* **thicker, more muscular and more elastic walls to withstand high pressure of the blood directly from the heart**
* **elastic walls enable the artery walls to recoil to help to push blood in spruts along the artery, which also gives rise to the pulse.**

* **chordae tendineae: consists of three flaps that point downwards to allow easy blood flow from the atrium into the ventricle**The median septum

Purpose: To keep the oxygenated blood in the left side of the heart from mixing with the deoxygenated blood from the right side of the heart.

Problem: If there is a hole in the median septum, then there will be mixing of oxygenated and deoxygenated blood, resulting in the blood going round the body being less oxygenated. Less oxygen is transported to the cells of the body, so there is less energy available from respiration, so the person feels tired more easily. Pressure in the left ventricle is also greater, so if the blood mixes, then the pressure of the blood in the right ventricle will be greater, resulting in high blood pressure in the lungs, damaging the blood vessels in the lungs over time. The blood in the lungs would also be partially oxygenated so there is a lower concentration gradient, and be moving at a higher speed so there is less time for absorption of oxygen by diffusion.

Coronary Artery Disease (CAD)

It is the building up of fatty deposits in the coronary arteries, resulting in restricted blood flow to the muscle cells downstream.

Lifestyle factors such as smoking, a diet high in saturated fats, a sedentary lifestyle, stress and being overweight can result in the formation of these deposits, which hardens these arteries and makes them less elastic (atherosclerosis).

CAD may lead to heart attacks (myocardial infarctions). They usually occur when a blood clot forms in the coronary arteries, blocking blood flow to sections of the heart. Oxygen is unable to reach the muscles, which are unable to respire, and die. The heart becomes unable to pump blood effectively, leading to the symptoms of a heart attack.
1. Muscles of the atria contract, causing atrial pressure to be higher than ventricular pressure and **artiventricular valves open**, allowing blood to flow from the **atria to the ventricles.
2. Muscles of the ventricles contract, causing **ventricular pressure to be higher than atrial pressure** and **artiventricular valves close** to **prevent backflow of blood from the ventricles into the atria**. This produces a loud "lub" sound.
3. As ventricular systole continues, **pressures in the right ventricle and left ventricle** are higher than **pressures in the pulmonary arch** and **aortic arch** respectively. **Semilunar valves open**, allowing blood to flow from the **ventricles into the arches**.
4. During ventricular systole, atrial diastole happens. Muscles of the atria relax. The **right atrium receives blood from the verae cavae** while the **left atrium receives blood from the pulmonary veins**.
5. During ventricular diastole, muscles of the ventricles relax, causing **pressures in the right ventricle** and the **left ventricle** to **decrease** until they are **lower than pressures in the pulmonary arch and aortic arch** respectively. **Semilunar valves close** to **prevent backflow of blood from the two arches into the ventricles**. This produces a softer "dub" sound.
6. Eventually, **ventricular pressure** decreases until it is **lower than atrial pressure**, causing the **artiventricular valves to open**, allowing **blood to flow from the atria into the ventricles**. Muscles of the atria contract and the cycle repeats.

e. Blood flow
1. **Deoxygenated blood** from other parts of the body is returned to the **right atrium** by the **venae cavae**.
1. Muscles of the right atrium contract, causing **pressure in the right atrium to be higher than that in the right ventricle**. The **tricuspid valve opens**, allowing blood to flow from the right atrium into the right ventricle.
2. Muscles of the right ventricle contract, causing **pressure in the right ventricle to be higher than that in the right atrium**. The **tricuspid valve closes** to **prevent backflow of blood** from the right ventricle into the right atrium**. The **pressure in the right ventricle is also higher than that in the pulmonary arch, causing the pulmonary valve to open, allowing blood to flow from the right ventricle into the pulmonary arteries. The pulmonary arteries transport blood to the lungs.
3. **Oxygenated blood** from the lungs is transported to the **left atrium** by ** pulmonary veins**.
4. Muscles of the left atrium contract, causing **pressure of the left atrium to be higher than that of the left ventricle**. The **bicuspid valve opens**, allowing blood to flow from the left atrium into the left ventricle.
5. Muscles of the left ventricle contract, causing **pressure in the left ventricle to be higher than that in the left atrium**. The **bicuspid valve closes** to **prevent backflow of blood** from the left ventricle into the left atrium** The **pressure in the right ventricle is also higher than that in the aortic arch**, causing the **aortic valve to open**, allowing blood to flow from the left ventricle into the aorta.
6. The aorta transports blood to all parts of the body (except the lungs).

f. Double circulation

Blood passes through the heart twice in one circuit round the body.

1. Pulmonary circulation:

The flow of (deoxygenated) blood from the right ventricle of the heart into the pulmonary artery and into the lungs, and the flow of (oxygenated) blood from the lungs down the pulmonary vein into the left atrium of the heart
2. Systemic circulation:

The flow of (oxygenated) blood from the left ventricle of the heart into the aorta and onto the rest of the body, and the flow of (deoxygenated) blood back into the vena cava and into the right atrium of the heart
3. Advantages:

1. Blood entering lungs is at lower pressure than blood leaving heart, ensuring that blood flows more slowly through the lungs more slowly, allowing sufficient time for blood to be well-oxygenated before being returned to heart

2. Heart pumps oxygenated blood at high pressure to rest of body so

oxygenated blood is distributed to body tissues more quickly, helping to maintain high metabolic rate in mammals
5. Coronary heart disease

- Atherosclerosis is the accumulation of fatty

**deposits** on the **inner wall of coronary**

**arteries**, which harden to form **plaque**.

1. **narrowed lumen** and **reduced blood flow** to heart tissue.
2. narrowed lumen of arteries causes

**blood pressure to increase**, causing the arteries to develop a **rough inner surface**, increasing the risk of formation of a **thrombosis** (a blood clot), which reduces blood flow to the heart 

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:39]

*xylem is made up of dead cells at maturity, sieve tube elements are dead while companion cells are alive in phloem

2. Arrangement of vascular tissue (focus is on dicots)

a. Leaf

- Xylem vessels are found neared to the top of the leaf (further from stomata to reduce rate of water vapour loss by evaporation + closer to palisade mesophyll cells & spongy mesophyll cells for these cells to obtain water more easily for photosynthesis)

- Phloem vessels are found nearer to the bottom of the leaf

b. Stem

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:41]

- Epidermis/piliferous layer: outermost layer of cells; cuticle absent
- Endodermis: innermost layer of cortex
- Cortex: stores food such as starch
- Root hair: each root hair is a tubular outgrowth of an epidermal cell to increase the surface area to volume ratio of the root hair cell for faster absorption of water and dissolved mineral salts
* Translocation is the transport of manufactured food substances such as sucrose and amino acids from the leaves to the other parts of the plant through the phloem.

If the phloem is punctured with a hollow tube, sap oozes out. This shows that there is high pressure (compression) inside the phloem.

If the xylem is punctured, air is sucked in. This shows that there is low pressure (tension) inside the xylem.

The results show that water and dissolved mineral salts are pulled up in the xylem, while sap is pushed down the phloem.

The removal of phloem prevents the translocation of sugars to the region below the ring. The accumulation of sugars in the region just above the ring lowers the water potential of the cells in that region. Water enters the region by osmosis, causing the swelling.

Study 3: Aphid stylets experiment

Study 4: Radioactive carbon isotope

Steps:

S1: Supply radioactive carbon (carbon-14, \({}^{14}\)C) to an intact leaf enclosed in a sealed chamber.

S2: Allow photosynthesis to occur.

S3: Cut a section of the stem and expose it onto an X-ray photography film.

Radioactivity would be detected in the phloem. When the plant is exposed to carbon dioxide containing radioactive carbon, the glucose made by the leaves would be radioactive (since carbon dioxide is reduced by hydrogen into glucose during the light-independent stage). Glucose is then combined with fructose to form sucrose to be transported in the phloem.

## 4 Transpiration

* Study of pathway of water
* 1. Allow a plant to stand in a dilute red ink solution.
* After a few hours, cut a transverse section of the stem and a transverse section of the root that was not immersed in ink. Results: Xylem would be stained red. Explanation: Transpiration removes water from the xylem vessels, causing a suction force that pulls water containing the red ink against gravity. Hence, the red ink enters the stem and up the xylem vessels.
* Movement of water into root hairs
* The concentrated cell sap of root hair cells has a lower water potential than the soil solution. Water molecules enter the root hair cells from the soil solution by osmosis.
* The entry of water dilutes the root hair cell's cell sap, which now has a higher water potential than the next cell. Water molecules move by osmosis from the root hair cell to the inner cell.
* Water molecules move from one cell to another by osmosis until water molecules enter the xylem vessels.
* Water that reaches the xylem will be transported away up the plant immediately (to maintain a low water potential of the root hair cells).
* Movement of water through a leaf
* Water that moves out of mesophyll cells by osmosis forms a thin film of moisture around the cells.
* Water evaporates from the thin film of moisture. The water vapour moves into the intercellular air spaces and accumulates in the sub-stomatal spaces.
* Water vapour diffuses through the stomata to the drier air outside (transpiration).
* Movement of water out of mesophyll cells to replace the thin film of moisture that has evaporated decreases the water potential of the cell sap of the cells.
* Water molecules from cells deeper in the leaf move by osmosis into the mesophyll cells.
* Water molecules, in turn, move from xylem vessels into these cells.
* This results in a suction force that pulls the column of water in the xylem vessels up.
* Entry of ions and dissolved mineral salts into root hairs
* By diffusion, when concentration of ions is higher in the soil solution that in the root hair cells
* By active transport, when concentration of ions is lower in the soil solution than in the root hair cells
- Each root hair is a tubular outgrowth of a RHC, making the root hair cell long and narrow, increasing the SAVR of the RHC for faster absorption of water and dissolved mineral salts.
- The vacuoles in RHC contain cell sap, which is a concentrated solution of sugars and dissolved mineral salts. This creates a lower water potential than the soil solution and thus a steep water potential gradient for water to enter the root hairs more quickly.
- The presence of a cell membrane prevents leakage of the concentrated cell sap to maintain the steep water potential gradient.
- RHCs contain many mitochondria to carry out aerobic respiration at a higher rate to release energy for the active transport of ions and dissolved mineral salts into the cells.
- The presence of a cell membrane prevents leakage of the concentrated cell sap to maintain the steep water potential gradient.
- RHCs contain many mitochondria to carry out aerobic respiration at a higher rate to release energy for the active transport of ions and dissolved mineral salts into the cells.
- Moving water against gravity Name of process Root pressure/guttation Capillary action Transpiration

Definition Root pressure: pressure resulting from the constant entry of water up inside very narrow tubes (capillary tubes) aerial parts of the plant, mainly through the stomata of leaves

Process - Living cells around xylem vessels in the roots use active transport to transport to pump ions into the vessels, the vessels, - Depends on forces lowering the water potential in xylem vessels - Water moves action also applies to transport of dissolved mineral salts (As water moves up by capillary action, it carried the salts up with it)

g. Importance of transpiration

- Transpiration pull draws water and dissolved mineral salts from the roots to the aerial parts of the plant Evaporation of water from the thin film of moisture on mesophyll cells removes latent heat of vaporisation, which helps to cool the plant - Water transported to the leaves is: 1. used in photosynthesis 2. to keep cells turgid to keep the leaves spread out widely to trap light energy for photosynthesis h. Factors affecting rate of transpiration Factor Explaination

Potassium ion theory: 1. As light intensity increases, the rate of photosynthesis in guard cells increases. 2. The guard cells convert more light energy into chemical energy. More chemical energy is available to pump potassium ions into the guard cells from neighbouring epidermal cells by active transport. 3. As the potassium ion concentration in guard cells increases, the water potential of the cell sap of the guard cells decreases. This causes the net movement of water molecules from adjacent epidermal cells into the guard cells by osmosis. 4. The guard cells expand and little and become turgid, causing the stomata to become wider and the rate of transpiration to be higher.

\begin{tabular}{c c} Humidity & 1. As humidity increases, the water vapour concentration in the air surrounding the plant increases. 2. The water vapour concentration gradient between the air surrounding the plant and the intercellular air spaces in the leaf becomes less steep. 3. Water vapour diffuses out of the leaf less quickly and the rate of transpiration decreases. \\ Temperature & 1. As the temperature increases, the rate of evaporation of water from the thin film of moisture around mesophyll cells increases. 2. There is a higher water vapour concentration in the intercellular air spaces. 3. This causes the water vapour concentration gradient between the air surrounding the plant and the intercellular air spaces in the leaf becomes steeper. 4. Water vapour diffuses out of the leaf more quickly and the rate of transpiration increases. \\ \end{tabular}

1. When there is a higher wind speed, the wind blows away the water vapour that accumulates outside the stomata more quickly.
2. This causes the water vapour concentration in the air surrounding the leaf to decrease.
3. This maintains a steep water vapour concentration gradient between the intercellular air spaces in the leaf and the air surrounding the leaf.
4. Water vapour diffuses out of the leaf more quickly and the rate of transpiration increases.

How the potometer can be used to measure the rate of water loss from the leafy shoot:

As leafy shoot loses water (through the aerial parts of the plant by transpiration),

water is taken in by transpiration pull (through the xylem vessels)

resulting in the air bubble moving to the left.

The distance moved by the air bubble to the left represents the amount of water taken in,

(and, by extension, the water lost).

Purpose of waterproof seal:

It prevents water loss from the sides of the apparatus through evaporation

reducing error and ensuring that any water loss from the apparatus is only through

transpiration in the leaf.

Purpose of water reservoir:

It is used to replenish the water in the tube and

pushes the air bubble back to the right, resetting the apparatus.

Purpose of cutting the shoot underwater:

To ensure that no bubbles are formed.

Assumption:

The rate of water absorption is proportional to the rate of transpiration. (However, some water is also used in photosynthesis, so amount of water lost < amount of water absorbed.

Hence, a potometer is used to directly measure the rate of absorption of water by the plant and NOT the rate of transpiration.)

j. Writing

- Loss of typidity in plant tissues

Figure 5:

Caused by rate of water loss by transpiration and other processes (such as photosynthesis) being greater than the rate of water uptake in the roots. -

Wilting causes leaves to droop so they have lower exposed surface area so water loss decreases since less photosynthesis occurs, and less light is absorbed so less water evaporates from the leaves. Loss of turgidity causes the stomata to close, reducing transpiration rate and preventing excess water loss. -

However, water becomes LF and as the stomata close, the intake of carbon dioxide decreases and carbon dioxide becomes LF as well. When the leaves droop, there is reduced surface area and the rate of absorption of light energy is lower. Hence, the rate of photosynthesis decreases.

## 1.3 Respiration

1. Types of respiration 1. Aerobic respiration is the breakdown of food molecules in the presence of oxygen, resulting in the release of a large amount of energy and giving off carbon dioxide and water as waste products. 2. Chemical equation: C6H12O6+6O2-6CO2+6H2O+energy 3. Word equation: glucose + oxygen \(\rightarrow\) carbon dioxide + water + large amount of energy released 2. Energy-consuming processes: 1. Synthesis of new protoplasm for growth & repair 2. Synthesis of proteins from amino acids 3. Active transport in the absorption of digested food substances by small intestine 4. Muscular contractions such as heartbeats & respiratory movements (both voluntary & involuntary) 5. Transmission of nerve impulses 6. Cell division 7. Anaerobic respiration 8. Anaerobic respiration is the breakdown of food molecules in the absence of oxygen, releasing less energy than aerobic respiration. 9. Alcoholic fermentation (in yeast): 1. Yeast respires aerobically in the presence of oxygen, but respire anaerobically in the absence of oxygen. The glucose is only partially broken down and the ethanol produced still contains energy 2. Chemical equation: C6H12O6-2C2H5OH+2CO2+energy 3. Word equation: glucose \(\rightarrow\) ethanol + carbon dioxide + small amount of energy released 10. Lactate fermentation (in humans): 1. Chemical equation: C6H12O6-2C3H6O3+energy 2. Word equation: glucose\(\rightarrow\)lactic acid + small amount of energy releasedExercise:

1. & Rate of aerobic respiration increases: \\ Muscles in the body require **more energy** to **contract and relax more vigorously.** The **rate of aerobic respiration increases** to increase the amount of energy released. **More oxygen** needs to be inhaled to be used by respiring cells while **more carbon dioxide** needs to be expelled. \\
2. & Breathing rate and depth increases: \\ As such, **breathing rate and depth increases** to facilitate efficient gaseous exchange. **Rate of blood flow to the lungs increases** to release carbon dioxide more quickly. \\
3. & Heart rate increases: \\ Muscles in the body require more glucose and oxygen to respire aerobically at a higher rate. So, **muscles of the heart contract more forcefully and rapidly to pump oxygenated blood around the body faster,** thus **increasing heart rate.** Also, more blood is transported to the muscles, lungs and liver and less blood is transported to other organs in the body so that there is sufficient glucose and oxygen for working muscles and organs. \\ During exercise & \\ \hline

* Chronic bronchitis: Cause: Prolonged exposure to irritant particles
* Epithelium lining of airways becomes inflamed
* Excessive mucus is secreted by the epithelium.
* Cilia on the epithelium are paralysed. Mucus and dust particles cannot be removed.
* Airways become blocked, making breathing difficult.
* Persistent coughing is needed to clear air passages, in order to breathe. This increases the risk of getting lung infections.
* Emphysema: Cause: Persistent and violent coughing due to bronchitis
* Partition walls between alveoli break down due to persistent and violent coughing. This decreased surface area for gaseous exchange.

## 5 Structure of a nephron6. [6] Ultrafiltration a. Blood flows from the branches of the renal artery into the glomeruli in the renal corpuscles. Most of the blood plasma is forced out of the glomerular blood capillaries into the Bowman's capsule. b. The afferent arteriole that brings blood into the glomerulus is wider than the efferent arteriole. This creates a high hydrostatic blood pressure in the glomerulus, c. which forces small molecules such as water, glucose, amino acids, dissolved mineral salts and nitrogenous waste products out of the glomerulus through the partially permeable basement membrane into the Bowman's capsule, forming the glomerular filtrate. Large molecules such as blood cells, platelets, proteins and fats are retained in the glomerular capillaries.
7. Selective reabsorption a. At the proximal convoluted tubule, most of the dissolved mineral salts and, in a healthy person, all of the glucose and amino acids are reabsorbed through the walls of the tubule into the surrounding blood capillaries by diffusion and active transport. Most of the water in the filtrate is reabsorbed by osmosis here. b. At the loop of Henle, some of the water is reabsorbed.

At the distal convoluted tubule, some water and dissolved mineral salts are reabsorbed. d. At the collecting duct, some water is reabsorbed. Excess water, excess dissolved mineral salts and metabolic waste products such as urea, uric acid and creatinine pass out of the collecting duct into the renal pelvis as urine.
8. Structural adaptations of the kidney tubule in selective reabsorption 1. The epithelial cells of the walls of the proximal convoluted tubule (PCT) have numerous mitochondria to carry out aerobic respiration to release energy for the selective reabsorption of glucose and amino acids by active transport. b. The PCT and DCT are coiled to increase the surface area to volume ratio for faster reabsorption of essential substances. c. There are numerous microvilli on the walls of the kidney tubule to increase the SAVR for faster reabsorption of essential substances. d. The kidney tubule has a one-cell-thick wall to decrease the diffusion distance of essential substances.
9. Osmoregulation (elaborated in _Homeostasis)_
10. Dialysis
11. Blood is drawn from the vein in patient's arm and is pumped through tubing in dialysis machine. b. Small molecules such as urea and other metabolic waste products diffuse out of the tubing into the dialysis fluid. Blood cells, platelets and other large molecules remain in the tubing. c. Blood is then returned to the vein in the patient's arm 
Dialysis fluid contains same concentration of essential substances as healthy blood

Ensures that these substances do not diffuse out of the blood and into the dialysis fluid.

If person lacks these substances, these substances will diffuse from the dialysis fluid into the blood.

Dialysis fluid does not contain any metabolic waste products

such as urea, uric acid and creatinine, and excess water and dissolved mineral salts to diffuse out of the tubing into the dialysis fluid.

Tubing is narrow, long and coiled

Increases surface area to volume ratio to increase rate of exchange of substances between patient's blood and dialysis fluid by diffusion.

Direction of blood flow is opposite to direction of flow of dialysis fluid (concurrent flow)

Small molecules such as urea and other metabolic waste

products can diffuse out of the tubing into the dialysis fluid,

while large molecules such as blood cells and plasma

proteins are retained.

Fresh dialysis fluid is continuously

Maintains a low concentration of waste products in the

supplied

dialysis fluid compared to that in the blood plasma.

3. Regulation of blood glucose level

* Blood glucose level rises above normal,
* stimulating the islets of Langerhans in the pancreas to secrete more insulin into the bloodstream.
* Insulin is transported by the blood to the liver and muscles.
* Insulin increases the permeability of the cell membranes of the liver cells and muscle cells to glucose,
* causing glucose to be absorbed more quickly by the cells.
* Insulin stimulates the liver to convert excess glucose to glycogen, which is stored in the liver and muscles.
* Blood glucose level decreases,
* providing a feedback to the islets of Langerhans to secrete less insulin into the bloodstream.
* Blood glucose level decreases back to normal.
* Blood glucose level falls below normal,
* stimulating the islets of Langerhans in the pancreas to secrete more glucagon into the bloodstream.
* Glucagon is transported by the blood to the liver and muscles.
* Glucagon stimulates the liver and muscles to convert stored glycogen to glucose, which enters the bloodstream.
* Blood glucose concentration increases,
* providing a feedback to the islets of Langerhans to secrete less glucagon into the bloodstream.
* Blood glucose level rises back to normal.
* Regulation of blood water potential (osmoregulation)
* Blood water potential rises above normal,
* stimulating the hypothalamus to stimulate the pituitary gland to secrete less anti-diuretic hormone (ADH) into bloodstream.
* This decreases the permeability of cells in the distal convoluted tubules (DCT) and the collecting ducts in kidneys tubules to water
* Less water is reabsorbed into bloodstream.
* A larger volume of more dilute urine is produced.
* Blood water potential decreases back to normal.
* Blood water potential falls below normal,1. stimulating the hypothalamus to stimulate the pituitary gland to secrete more ADH into the bloodstream.
2. This increases the permeability of cells in the DCT and collecting ducts in the kidney tubules to water.
3. More water is **reabsorbed** into bloodstream.
4. A smaller volume of more concentrated urine is produced.
5. Blood water potential increases back to normal.

5. Thermoregulation - Thermoreceptors in **hypothalamus** detect **temperature of blood** - Thermoreceptors in **skin** detect **temperature from environment** a. Surrounding temperature increases, 1. thermoreceptors in the skin detect rise in temperature and send nerve impulses to brain. 2. Hypothalamus is stimulated and sends impulses to relevant body parts. 3. Vasodilation occurs. Arterioles in skin dilate, shunt vessels constrict so that more blood flows through blood capillaries in skin, increasing heat loss by conduction, convection and radiation. 4. Sweat glands become more active and more sweat is produced. As more water in sweat evaporates from skin surface, more latent heat of vaporisation is lost. 5. Hair erector muscles relax and hairs lie down, trapping less air to retain less body heat. 6. Metabolic rate decreases to reduce the amount of heat released within the body. 7. Body temperature decreases back to normal.

b. Surrounding temperature decreases, 1. thermoreceptors in the skin detect drop in temperature and send nerve impulses to brain. 2. Hypothalamus is stimulated and sends impulses to relevant body parts. 3. Vasoconstriction occurs. Arterioles in skin, shunt vessels dilate so that less blood flows through blood capillaries in skin, decreases heat loss by conduction, convection and radiation. 4. Sweat glands become less active and less sweat is produced. As less water in sweat evaporates from skin surface, less latent heat of vaporisation is lost. 5. Hair erector muscles contract and hairs are raised to trap air, which helps to retain more body heat. 6. Metabolic rate increases to increase the amount of heat released within the body. 7. Shivering occurs if the above reactions are insufficient to prevent a further drop in body temperature. The spasmodic contraction of skeletal muscles increases the amount of heat released. 8. Body temperature rises back to normal.
The role of nervous system:

1. Help the body to adjust rapidly to any changes in the environment
2. Enable the various parts of the body to coordinate with one another quickly
3. Control involuntary actions, automatic actions that cannot be consciously controlled, such as heartbeat, peristalsis, vasoconstriction and reflex actions
4. Control voluntary actions, actions that are consciously controlled

Human nervous system

Central nervous system (CNS) consists of the brain and spinal cord
2. Peripheral nervous system (PNS) consists of cranial nerves (from the brain), spinal nerves (from the spinal cord) and sense organs

Nervous tissue * Nervous system is made of nervous tissue, which is made of neurones (nerve cells)
* Nerve is a bundle of neurones that transmit nerve impulses. They may contain: 1. Sensory nerve fibres only
* Motor nerve fibres only
* spinal nerves contain mixed fibres)
* Parts of a neurone: 1. Cell body: Contain the nucleus and organelles
* Dendrons: Nerve fibres that transmit nerve impulses towards the cell body.
* Axons: Nerve fibres that transmit nerve impulses away from the cell body.
* Dendrites: Nerve fibre branches at the terminal ends of axons and dendrons. Where the axon is connected to muscles, these branches are also known as motor end plates.
* Myelin sheath: Layer of fatty substance enclosing many nerve fibres; surrounded by a thin membrane called the neurilemma; insulates the nerve fibres
* Node of Ranvier: Region where the myelin sheath is absent; speed up transmission by allowing impulses to 'jump' from node to node
* Synapse: Junction between two neurones or a junction between a neurone and an effector
* Three types of neurones: 1. Sensory neurone: Transmits nerve impulses from receptors to CNS
* Relay neurone: Transmits nerve impulses from sensory neurone to motor neurone; found within CNS
* Motor neurone: Transmits nerve impulses from CNS to effectors

## 3 Photoreceptors in the retina

- Photoreceptors in the retina consist of rods and cones.

- The photoreceptors are connected to the nerve endings from the optic nerve.

a. Cones:

- Enable us to see colours in bright light.

- Three types of cones: Red, blue, and green (RBG) that allow us to see a wide variety of colours by containing different pigments which absorb light of different wavelengths.

- Do not work well in dim light.

b. Rods:

- Enable us to see in dim light, but only in black and white.

- Sensitive to light of low intensity as they contain pigment called visual purple.

- When the eye is exposed to bright light, all the visual purple is bleached. Visual purple must be reformed for a person to see in the dark. Therefore, it takes awhile for one to see in dark after being in a bright environment as time is taken for visual purple to reform.

- Formation of visual purple requires vitamin A.

## 4 How we see

a. When light falls on an object, light rays are reflected from the object.

b. Light rays are refracted through the cornea and the aqueous humour onto the lens.

c. The lens causes further refraction and the rays are brought to a focus on the retina.

d. The image on the retina stimulates the photoreceptors, either the rods or cones, depending on the light intensity.

e. Nerve impulses are produced by the photoreceptors and transmitted to the Brian by the optic nerve. The brain interprets the impulses and the person sees the object.

5. Accomodation: the adjustment of the lens of the eye so that clear images of objects at different distances are formed on the retina. 1. Distant object: 1. Light rays reflected off distant objects are nearly parallel and enter the eyes. 1. Ciliary muscles relax, causing suspensiony ligaments to become taut and pull on the edge of the lens. 1.

## Hormones

1. Definition Hormones are chemical messenger molecules usually protein in nature secreted by endocrine glands in minute amounts directly into the bloodstream and carried by the blood to one or more specific target organs and affect their cellular processes until destroyed by the liver
2. Types of glands 1. Endocrine glands: Ductless glands; secrete their products directly into the bloodstream 2. Exocrine glands: Glands that secrete their products via ducts
3. Hormones 1. Insulin/Glucagon: homoeostatic control of blood glucose - Produced in the islets of Langerhans in the pancreas - When there is a lack of secretion of insulin, 1. Glucose cannot be stored or used by cells, so blood glucose level rises; some glucose is lost in urine (diabetes mellitus) 2. Muscle cells have no reserves of glycogen, so body grows weak + loses weight continuously 3. Body oxidises fats instead of glucose to release energy; results in production of ketones which are poisonous and excreted in urine (ketonuria) - When there is over-secretion, 1. Abnormal decrease in blood glucose level 2. Results in shock 3. Coma and death may follow
2. Anti-diuretic hormone (ADH): homeostatic control of blood water potential Produced in hypothalamus, stored and secreted by the pituitary gland.
3. Adrenaline - Released when a person is in danger. - Produced in the adrenal glands (situated above kidneys) - Function: Produces the fight or flight response - Increases heart rate (increase transport of blood to muscles) - Increases respiratory rate (increase oxygen absorption) - Stimulates the liver and skeletal muscles to convert glycogen to glucose (increase blood glucose concentration) - Blood flow is shunted away from digestive system by constricting arterioles to gut (increase transport of blood to muscles) - Blood flow is shunted away from skin by constricting arterioles in skin - Increases rate of blood clotting - Increases metabolic rate (release more energy during respiration)These changes increase the transport of oxygen and glucose to the muscles so that there is an increase in the rate of cellular respiration, which makes more energy available for muscular contraction. So that the person is more able to fight or run. Other effects: -  Sweat glands release more sweat, in preparation to cool down the body due to heat that is about to be produced in physical activity. -  Pupils dilate to allow more light to enter the eye.
4. Diabetes Types: 1. Type I (juvenile or early onset diabetes) - caused by genetic factors 1. Islets of Langerhans are unable to secrete sufficient insulin. Treatment is regular insulin injections. 2. Type II (late-onset diabetes) - caused by genetic and lifestyle factors such as obesity, smoking, lack of exercise, too much stress, not enough sleep. Target cells do not respond well to insulin. Treatment is medication and for late stages, regular insulin injections. Lifestyle modification is often necessary to prevent further progress of the disease and to control the condition. 3. Symptoms 1. Excessive thirst 2. Frequent urination 3. Glucose in urine 4. High blood glucose 5. Weight loss 6. Fatigue 7. Wounds take a longer time to heal 8. Kidney/eye damage Insulin injection and insulin pills: 1. Insulin is injected into a diabetic patient rather than taken orally because insulin, being a protein, can be digested by proteases in the alimentary canal 2. Insulin pills also take some time to pass through the digestive system to reach the small intestine, where it is absorbed into the bloodstream. Administering insulin via injection allows the insulin to be released into the bloodstream more quickly, allowing a quicker effect on the liver and muscles to reduce blood glucose levels in a shorter time.
5. Nervous control vs Endocrine control Similarities: - Both are means of coordination within the body - A stimulus causes transmission of a message to effector which carries out response **Endocrine control** **Nervous control** Involves hormones (chemical substances) Involves nerve impulses (electrical signals) Hormones are transported by the blood Impulses are transmitted by neurones Usually slow responses Usually quick responses

## Cell Division

### Mitosis

* Mitosis is a form of **nuclear division** that produces **genetically identical daughter** **nuclei** containing the same number of chromosomes as the parent nucleus
* Stages

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|} \hline Interphase & Cell absorbs nutrients and synthesises new organelles \\  & Centrioles replicate and divide **in animal cells** \\  & Each chromatin thread replicates, producing two identical chromatin threads joined at a centromere, forming sister chromatids and DNA doubles \\ \hline Propbase & Chromatin threads condense and coil to form chromosomes \\  & Spindle fibres form \\  & Asters form around centrioles \\  & Centrioles move to opposite poles of the cell \\  & Nucleous and nuclear envelope disappear \\ \hline Metaphase & Chromosomes line up along equatorial plane of the spindle \\  & Centromere of each chromosome is attached to both sides of a spindle fibre \\ \hline Anaphase & Centromeres divide \\  & Spindle fibres shorten to pull the sister chromatids apart to opposite \\  & poles of cell to form daughter chromosomes \\ \hline Telophase & Spindle fibres break down \\  & Nuclear envelope and nucleolus reform around each nucleus \\  & Chromosomes **decondense** and **lengthen** to form chromatin threads \\ \hline Cytokines & Cleavage of furrows appear in cytoplasm of animal cells \\  & Furrows deepen and the cytoplasm divides \\  & Two identical daughter cells produced \\ \hline \end{tabular}

## Human Reproduction

* [1] Male reproductive system a. Testedes i. [2] Produces sperms (male gametes)2. Produce male sex hormones e.g. testosterone. Male sex hormones are responsible for development and maintenance of secondary sexual characteristics.
3. Sperm cell 1. Around 60 \(\mu\)m long 2. Head 1. About 2.5 \(\mu\)m wide 2. Contains a large nucleus with small amounts of cytoplasm. 3. The nucleus carries a haploid number of chromosomes. (22 chromosomes + 1 X or Y chromosome) 4. Acrosome contains enzymes that break down part of the egg membranes so that the sperm can penetrate the egg during fertilisation.
3. Middle piece 1. Contains numerous mitochondria, which provides energy for the sperm to swim towards the egg.
4. Tail (flagellum) 1. Carries out beating movement to swim towards the egg 2. Sperm is motile 5. Quantity 1. Numerous sperms produced throughout lifetime from puberty onwards 2. Large number of sperms released per ejaculation b. Epididymis 1. Where inactive sperms are stored c. Scrotum 1. Testedes are held in the scrotum, which are pouch-like sacs outside the body. This allows the scrotum to be at a **slightly** lower temperature than body temperature, which is essential for sperm production d. Sperm ducts / Vas deferens 1. Transport sperms from the epididymis to the urethra. e. Glands (Prostate gland, seminal vesicle and Cowper's gland) 1. Secrete fluid that is mixed with sperms to make semen 2. The fluids contain nutrients and enzymes which nourish and activate the sperm, allowing them to swim actively f. Urethra 1. A tube which passes from the bladder 2. Passage for urine and semen to pass out of the body g. Penis 1. An erectile organ, containing erectile tissue, which allows the spaces within the tissue to be filled up with blood 2. When filled with blood, the penis becomes erect and hard, allowing it to enter the vagina of a woman during sexual intercourse to deposit semen 
* Release mature eggs called ova (singular: ovum) into the oviduct
* Produce female sex hormones e.g. estrogen and progesterone. Female sex hormones are responsible for development and maintenance of secondary sexual characteristics.
* About 120 um - 150 um wide in diameter
* Has a large nucleus containing a haploid set of chromosomes (22 chromosomes + 1 X chromosome)
* Has abundant cytoplasm which may contain a small amount of yolk
* Surrounded by a plasma membrane and an outer membrane
* Passive movement of egg along the oviduct is due to action of cilia in oviduct and peristalsis of oviduct wall
* Only one egg is released per month
* Both ovaries together release 500 ova
* Narrow muscular tube where ovary releases the ovum into and leads to uterus
* Cilia on the inner lining help move the ovum to the uterus.
* Where fertilisation happens
* A thick muscular organ.
* Lined by uterine lining or endometrium
* Endometrium is richly supplied with blood vessels. It is the site of implantation of the embryo post-fertilisation.
* Uterus is where foetus develops during pregnancy
* A circular ring of muscle that opens into the vagina
* Enlarges during birth to allow the passage of the foetus
* Opening of cervix allows menstrual blood to flow out into the vagina during menstruation
* Birth canal through which the baby is born
* Where penis is injected and sperm is deposited during sexual intercourse

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:90]

* [leftmargin=*]
* Corpus luteum secretes progesterone and some oestrogen.
* Progesterone maintains the uterine lining by causing it to thicken further and be richly supplied with blood capillaries, preparing it for the implantation of an embryo.
* Progesterone inhibits ovulation and FSH secretion.

The egg breaks down. LH production is inhibited by high concentration of progesterone in the blood. The drop in LH level causes the corpus luteum to break down. When the corpus luteum breaks down, no progesterone is secreted. Without progesterone, the uterine lining cannot be maintained, so it breaks down. The lining flows from the uterus together with some blood through the vagina and menstruation occurs. The cycle repeats.

The fertilised egg becomes a zygote, which develops into an embryo. The embryo implants itself in the uterine lining. The embryo secretes a hormone which prevents the corpus luteum from breaking down until a placenta is formed. The corpus luteum continues to secrete progesterone and oestrogen until the placenta is able to take over the production of progesterone and oestrogen.

## 4 Fertilisation

* The acrosome of the sperm releases an enzyme to disperse the follicle cells and break down part of the egg membranes.
* As soon as one sperm enters the egg, the membrane of the egg changes so that no other sperms can enter.
* The haploid sperm nucleus fuses with the haploid egg nucleus, forming a diploid zygote.
* The remaining sperms which do not fertilise the egg eventually die.

* Development of embryo
* Cilia lining the inner surface of the oviduct sweep the zygote along the oviduct. Peristaltic movements in the oviduct wall also help move the zygote to the uterus.
* The zygote divides by mitosis to form an embryo.
* It takes about 5 days for the embryo to reach the uterus. The embryo may float freely in the uterus for about 2 days.
* Eventually, the embryo becomes embedded in the uterine lining.
* Implantation occurs about 7 days after fertilisation.
* Development of placenta
* Villi begins to grow from the embryo into the uterine lining. They contain the blood capillaries of the embryo.
* The Willi and the uterine lining in which the villi are embedded make up the placenta.
* An umbilical cord attaches the embryo to the placenta.
* Development of amniotic sac/amnio1. The amniotic sac encloses the embryo in the amniotic cavity, which is filled with amniotic fluid d. Functions of placenta i. Provide nutrients such as glucose, amino acids and mineral salts and oxygen from maternal blood to the embryo ii. Remove waste materials such as urea and carbon dioxide from the foetus iii. Allows protective antibodies to diffuse from maternal blood into embryonic blood iv. Provides a barrier preventing the mixing of maternal blood and embryonic blood because 1. Maternal blood pressure is much higher than embryonic blood pressure and would damage vital tissues 2. The embryo might have a different blood group, which can resulting in agglutination when blood is mixed which is fatal v. Produces progesterone which maintains the endometrium during pregnancy e. Functions of umbilical cord i. Attaches the embryo to the placenta ii. One umbilical vein transports oxygenated blood and food substances from the placenta to the foetus iii. Two umbilical arteries transport deoxygenated blood and metabolic waste products from the foetus to the placenta f. Functions of amniotic fluid i. Acts as a cushion to absorb shock and protect the foetus against mechanical injury ii. Allows foetus a certain degree of movement, which promotes muscular development iii. Acts as lubricating fluid for the passage of the baby during birth
6. Spread of HIV a. Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) are transmitted through the following means: i. Through semen when it comes into contact with the mucous membrane in the vagina ii. Through fluid in the vagina when it comes into contact with the mucous membrane of the urethra iii. When blood from an infected person gets into the bloodstream of an uninfected person b. Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) is caused by Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), which destroys the body's immune system c. Symptoms i. Chronic fever ii. Severe diarrhoea lasting for months iii. Pneumonia iv. Cancer of blood vessels d. Modes of transmission of HIV i. Sexual intercouse with an infected person ii. Sharing hypodermic needles with an infected person * Blood transfusion from an infected person
* During pregnancy, the virus may pass from the infected mother to the foetus
* Prevention and control
* Keep to one sex partner or do not have sex
* Use of condoms
* Do not share instruments that are likely to break the skin and be contaminated with blood

- Both parents are homozygous.
* Parent showing dominant trait is heterozygous.
* Both parents must be heterozygous. (The heterozygous parents each contributed a recessive allele to produce a homozygous recessive offspring.)
* Probability Due to probability, the larger the sample size, the more closely the actual numbers should match the expected ratio. _(Since the sample size is small, the actual ratio may differ significantly from the expected ratio due to the laws of probability.)_

Human Sex Determination

i. Humans have 23 pairs of chromosomes. 22 of them are made up of homologous pairs. **The last pair is NOT homologous** (has the same genes). XX genotype produces females, XY produces males. ii. Human cells contain 22 pairs of autosomal chromosomes and a pair of sex chromosomes. iii. During gamete production, the female eggs contain an X chromosome each. iv. Males will produce two types of sperm - one containing an X chromosome, and the other containing the Y chromosome.

5. Multiple alleles and co-dominance

a. Co-dominance

i. Co-dominance occurs when both alleles are equally expressed in the heterozygous condition. ii. The human ABO blood group system displays co-dominance. b. Multiple alleles is a term used for a gene that exists in more than two alleles. c. When there is more than one dominant allele, we say that they are codominant. There are two types of "codominance" - **incomplete dominance** and **codominance**.

The human ABO blood group system displays co-dominance and has multiple alleles

The IA allele codes for the A phenotype.

The IA allele codes for the B phenotype.

7. Mutation* Mutation is a sudden random change in the structure of a gene or in the chromosome number.
* Causes of mutation:
* Exposure to radiation
* Exposure to chemicals called carcinogens
* Gene mutation
* Change in the structure of DNA
* Produces variation between individuals as it results in new alleles of genes
* Albinism (gene mutation)
* Individuals who are homozygous for the albinism alleles are albinos.
* Albino individuals do not have pigments in the skin, hair and eyes, but instead have reddish-white skin and white hair.
* Since the iris does not contain any pigment, it appears red because of the colour of blood vessels in it.
* Albinos are very sensitive to sunlight and their skin is easily sunburnt.
* Sickle-cell anaemia (gene mutation)
* The gene controlling haemoglobin production is mutated. It produces haemoglobin S (HbS), which is almost the same as the normal haemoglobin A (HbA) except in one amino acid.
* This causes a change in the three-dimensional shape of the haemoglobin molecule. HbS molecules clump together, making the cell sickle-shaped.
* The mutated gene is only expressed in the homozygous recessive condition.
* When the oxygen concentration in the blood of homozygous recessive individuals decreases, their red blood cells become sickle-shaped.
* Malaria and sickle-cell anaemia
* Individuals who are heterozygous for the sickle-cell allele are more resistant to malaria than individuals who have two copies of the normal haemoglobin allele.
* Individuals who are homozygous for the sickle-cell allele have shorter life spans.
* Heterozygous individuals have a better chance of surviving and reproducing in regions where malaria is prevalent since they do not fully contract either disease. This ensures that the recessive allele persists in the population.
* Chromosome mutation Down's syndrome
* Humans normally have 46 chromosomes in each of their body cells
* People with Down's syndrome have 47 chromosomes - an extra copy of chromosome 21
* Mutation causes chromosome 21 to not separate during gamete formation, resulting in an egg with 2 copies of chromosome 21. After fertilisation, the zygote would have 3 copies of chromosome 21.
* Mutagenic agents Mutagenic agents (mutagens) greatly increase the rate of mutation.

### Evolution by natural selection

* Variation and competition lead to differential survival of, and reproduction by, those organisms best fitted to the environment
* Environmental factors that act as forces of natural selection: Predation, food shortage, disease

* "The variation"
* Individuals with (so-and-so) traits are **more likely to survive longer,*
* resulting in a **higher rate of reproduction*
* and are more likely to pass on the genes for that trait to their offspring,
* resulting in **increased genetic variation*
* The offspring that **inherit the beneficial traits*
* are able to **adapt*
* to the environment and will be more likely to survive and reproduce.
* This process repeats itself over many generations, leading to a population with **a higher proportion** of individuals with (so-and-so) traits.

B.g. 2. Spontaneous mutation of genes from common ancestor W would have produced birds with various peak lengths. Competition for food would have resulted in survival of the fittest. The birds with the longest beaks would have been naturally selected since they are able to get food more easily. These birds reproduce and pass on their favourable allele to offspring while other birds with shorter beaks are outcompeted and die out. This results in long beaked birds becoming the dominant species on the island over time.

### Mutation by artificial selection (selective breeding)

* In artificial selection, those with traits that are desirable to humans are **selected to reproduce.*
* They are **more likely to pass on the genes*
* for that trait to their offspring.
* The offspring that have the traits will be **more likely to be selected to reproduce.*
* Over many generations, the organism will have **more of the selected trait.**

E.g. 1: Cows that produce more milk are selected for breeding, so they produce more offspring than those that do not. And more likely to pass on the genes for that trait to their offspring. The offspring that produce more milk are also selected for breeding. Over many generations, the **cows of that breed become better at producing more milk.

E.g. 2: For antibiotic resistance, populations of bacteria that are resistant to an antibiotic are more likely to survive and reproduce when exposed to antibiotics. They are more likely to pass on the genes for that trait to their offspring. The offspring that have the traits will be more likely to be selected to reproduce. Over many generations, the populations of bacteria will be more antibiotic resistant.

The amino acids are joined together by **peptide bonds**. 4. The chain elongates until it reaches the stop codon. 5. At the end of the mRNA strand, the ribosome detaches from the mRNA, and the polypeptide is released.
3. Genetic engineering

1. Isolate the desired gene: Obtain the DNA fragment containing the desired gene in the chromosome by cutting the gene at the restriction site of the gene at its two ends using restriction enzymes (RE) to produce sticky ends 2. Insert the gene into the vector DNA: Restriction enzymes that were used to cut the desired gene are used to cut the vector DNA (e.g. plasmid of bacteria) to produce complementary sticky ends 3. Mix cut out plasmid with cut out gene: Both the plasmid and gene are mixed together with DNA ligase to to allow the gene to bind to the plasmid by complementary base pairing between their sticky ends to form a recombinant plasmid 4. Insert the recombinant plasmids into bacteria: Mix recombinant plasmids with bacteria and apply temporary heat **or** electric shock to open up the pores in the cell membranes of the bacteria for the plasmids to enter 5. Transgenic bacteria formed
2. Transferring the human insulin gene into bacteria 1. Type 1 diabetes is caused by the inability of the islets of Langerhans to produce sufficient insulin 2. Mass production of transgenic bacteria to produce insulin is carried out using fermenters* Advantages: 1. Does not induce allergic response in the patient as the insulin produced is identical to human insulin 2. Easier and cheaper to produce insulin in large quantities 3. Less risk of contamination by disease-causing microorganisms as compared to insulin obtained from pancreases of animals 4. Ethical concerns of vegetarians or religious groups can be overcome

### Ecology

1. Energy flow 1. Energy transfer is non-cyclic 1. Light energy from the Sun is absorbed by chlorophyll and converted into chemical energy by producers during photosynthesis, producing and storing glucose 2. Glucose is used to synthesise molecules such as starch, fats and cellulose 3. Energy from producers is passed from one trophic level to another by feeding 4. The flow of energy in an ecosystem is non-cyclic as energy is lost in uneaten parts, dead bodies, faeces and egestion and excretion of consumersEnergy released from glucose during respiration is used for various life processes such as muscular contraction, nerve impulse transmission, and anabolic reactions such as protein synthesis

Heat released during respiration is lost to the surroundings and cannot be returned to the producers or the Sun. Only **around 10%** of the energy consumed is passed on to the next trophic level
2. Food chains and food webs 1. A food chain represents energy transfer in an ecosystem 2. Each link/position in a food chain is called a trophic level 3. Hierarchy of trophic levels 1. First trophic level: Producers 1. They are USUALLY green plants that produce their own food by photosynthesis and so do not depend on other organisms for their energy needs 2. Consumers do not produce their own food, and depend on other organisms for their energy needs 1. Primary consumers feed on producers 2. Secondary consumers feed on primary consumers 3. Tertiary consumers feed on secondary consumers 3. Organisms may occupy multiple trophic levels in a food web. They usually only occupy one trophic level in each food chain in a food web. 4. In food webs, a change in population of any trophic level will affect the trophic levels above or below it. The amount of change on the affected trophic levels is dependent on the availability of other interconnected food chains. For example 1. If the tadpole population has a drastic decrease due to disease, then there will be fewer tadpoles to feed on the hydrilla, so the hydrilla population would increase. 2. This would result in more food (and thus energy) being available to the duck population, so the duck population would eventually increase. (This is a second order change, so we would rarely ask for it. We would NOT ask for a third order change). 3. There will be less prey available for the dragonfly nymph, the great diving beetle and the water boatman, so their populations would decrease. 4. If there is a decrease in the population of the small fish, the population of the larger fish would decrease, but not by much as it is also able to feed on blood worms.
3. Efficiency of energy transfer 1. Energy transfer in an ecosystem is inefficient. Only ABOUT 10% of energy in a trophic level is transferred onto the next trophic level. AROUND 90% is lost as heat, used in respiration and lost as waste such as faeces. 1. There are very few food chains that have more than 4 trophic levels in nature. This is because only ABOUT 10% of energy in a trophic level is transferred onto the next trophic level. AROUND 90% is lost as heat, used in respiration and lost as waste such as faeces. After four trophic levels, very little energy is available to support the energy needs for another trophic level. ii. Humans should eat from lower trophic levels Humans usually farm primary consumers for meat. Humans should be more vegetarian in order to be more sustainable. Only ABOUT 10% of energy in a trophic level is transferred onto the next trophic level. AROUND 90% is lost as heat, used in respiration and lost as waste such as faeces. So if humans eat from a lower trophic level, more energy is available for their energy needs, so less farmland is needed to grow crops to provide for them. b. Principal energy source for food chains is the sun, NOT producers. c. Decomposers i. They neither feed on producers nor consumers directly. ii. Get their energy from waste that is usually written off as waste in a typical food chain iii. Sometimes they appear as primary consumers with the waste or dead material in the "producer" position. We do NOT consider the waste as producers, and will avoid talking about the dead matter's position.
4. Ecological Pyramids a. Pyramid of Numbers i. The width of the bar is proportional to the size of the population. ii. Since energy transfer in an ecosystem is inefficient, it GENERALLY takes a larger population of organisms of a lower trophic level to provide for the energy needs of a higher trophic level. iii. If a lower trophic level has a narrower bar, it suggests that the smaller population will not be able to sustain the energy needs of the trophic level above it. iv. This would result in an unstable ecosystem where the population of organisms above it would decrease eventually. v. A pyramid of numbers with a smaller population of a lower trophic level organism CAN be stable if the lower trophic level organism is much larger in size compared to the organisms it is providing the energy for. "The tree is much larger in size compared to the caterpillars, so it is able to provide for the energy needs of a much larger population of caterpillars." _This kind of situation is resolved using pyramids of biomass/energy._ b. Pyramid of Biomass i. The width of the bar is proportional to the biomass of the population. Eg. If each tree has a biomass of 1000 kg and there are only 5 trees in that population, the biomass of the population is 5000kg. ii. Since energy transfer in an ecosystem is inefficient, it GENERALLY takes a larger biomass of organisms of a lower trophic level to provide for the energy needs of a higher trophic level. iii. If a lower trophic level has a narrower bar, it suggests that the smaller biomass will not be able to sustain the energy needs of the trophic level above it. iv. This would result in an unstable ecosystem where the population of organisms above it would decrease eventually. v. A pyramid of biomass with a smaller biomass of a lower trophic level organism CAN be stable if the lower trophic level organism is much faster in reproduction rate compared to the organisms it is providing the energy for. "The phytoplankton has a very high reproductive rate and is thus able to generate enough biomass to provide for the energy needs of the zooplankton above it." _(Not likely to appear.)_
5. Carbon cycle a. During photosynthesis, plants absorb carbon dioxide and use it to synthesise carbohydrates. Some of the carbohydrates are converted to proteins and fats. b. Animals obtain carbon compounds by feeding on plants or other animals. Plants and animals respire, releasing carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. c. Decomposers break down dead organic matter and release carbon dioxide. d. Dead bodies of organisms buried in the Earth for millions of years are subjected to high pressure, gradually forming fossil fuels such as coal, natural gas and oil. e. Fossil fuels such as coal are extracted from the ground by mining and undergo combustion in industries, releasing carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. f. Carbon sinks are places where carbon is stored indefinitely (_on pause with no time limit. Not destroyed, just not in circulation_). i. Forests 1. Plants in forests absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere during photosynthesis, producing carbohydrates. These carbohydrates can be stored in the plants for a long time. 2. When plants and animals in the forest die, they are sometimes buried deep underground, and not decomposed. These dead organisms undergo fossilisation over millions of years. The carbon in these fossils could be stored underground for a long period of time. ii. Oceans 1. Carbon dioxide dissolves in ocean water to form bicarbonate ions. Bicarbonate ions are absorbed by sea creatures to form shells and skeletons such as corals (shells are mainly calcium carbonate) 2. Marine organisms, such as phytoplankton, algae and water plants take in carbon dioxide during photosynthesis, producing carbohydrates. These carbohydrates can be stored in the plants for a long time. 3. When these organisms die, their bodies could sink to the bottom of the ocean and undergo fossilisation for millions of years. The carbon in these fossils can be stored in the seabed for a long period of time. Carbon can also be stored in the shells of shellfish, which accumulates at the bottom of the ocean.

## Our Impact on the Ecosystem

1. Effects of Man on the Ecosystem a. Water pollution by sewage and by inorganic waste (eutrophication) i. Fertilisers that are not absorbed by crops may be washed by rainwater into nearby rivers or lakes. ii. Nitrates and phosphates in untreated sewage or fertilisers are used in the synthesis of proteins and nucleic acids. This leads to increased growth and multiplication of algae and floating water plants.

* [iii] Overgrowth of algae and floating water plants prevent sunlight from reaching submerged plants.
* [iv] Submerged algae and water plants are unable to receive sufficient light energy for photosynthesis and die. The dead algae and water plants are decomposed by bacteria and fungi.
* [v] As the bacteria feed on decaying organic matter, they grow and multiply rapidly, using up the dissolved oxygen in the water.
* [vi] At night, when plants and animals respire only, there can be lack of oxygen for respiration causing animals and plants to suffocate. Eventually the dead plants and animals will also use up more oxygen in the water as they decay, causing further population decline.
* [vii] Eventually, dilution from other water sources, and the decay of organic matter into simpler or harmless substances restores the water quality, and the ecosystem is able to recover.
* [v] Bioaccumulation and bioamplification/biomagnification
* [i] Pollutants are absorbed by organisms and **cannot be excreted**, so they build up in the **fatty tissues*
* of the organism. Over time, the **concentration*
* of these harmful substances **increases**. (Bioaccumulation)
* [ii] Each consumer trophic level will consume a much larger biomass from the trophic level below it. The concentration of these harmful substances will therefore increase by a lot up the food chain. (Bioamplification)
* [iii] At higher trophic levels, the concentration of these substances can become high enough to cause health problems that cause population decline.

### 2 Environmental biotechnology: sewage treatment (water reclamation plants)

### 3.1 Outline:

1. Primary treatment - to settle out solids
2. Secondary treatment - use of microbial biofilms and biomats to digest organic substances
3. Tertiary treatment - disinfection by UV, chlorination and ozonation

b. Process

1. Sewage is passed through **bar screens** to remove large, coarse materials.
2. Primary treatment:

The screened liquid is sent to the **primary settlement tank.**

The liquid flows through the tank very slowly to allow the solid suspensions to settle to the bottom of the tank as **primary sludge**.

The sludge is removed and fed into an **anaerobic digester**.

The top liquid from this tank flows into an **aeration tank**.

3. Secondary treatment:

1. **Activated sludge process** occurs.

In the **aeration tank**, the liquid is mixed with aerobic microorganisms.

Bubbles of compressed air are pumped into the liquid.

The dissolved oxygen is used by the microorganisms for aerobic respiration.

The microorganisms absorb and break down organic pollutants in the water into harmless substances.
2. The treated water, together with the microorganisms, is channelled into the **final settlement tank**.

In the **final settlement tank**, the microorganisms settle to the bottom of the tank as sludge.

A portion of this sludge is returned to the **aeration tank** for reuse.

The **excess** sludge is sent to the **anaerobic digester**.

The clean water at the top of the tank is discharged as effluent into nearby rivers, streams or lakes.
4. Anaerobic digester No oxygen is supplied to the anaerobic digester. Anaerobic bacteria decompose the sludge, producing **biogas**, mainly methane. The biogas is used as a fuel to generate electricity for the functioning of the reclamation plant. The remaining solid material is removed from the tank. It may be used as fertiliser or burnt in an incinerator.
5. Tertiary treatment The treated water is disinfected by chlorination, UV and ozonation.

3. Conservation a. Reason for conservation of species: To maintain biodiversity i. Maintenance of a large gene pool: cross-breeding different varieties of wild plants and animals with favourable genes can improve agricultural produce ii. Maintenance of a stable and balanced ecosystems: prevents disruption of natural cycles such as carbon cycles and reduces the effects of global warming b. Methods for conservation: i. To reduce eutrophication 1. Control the amount of fertilisers we use in agriculture, and also have proper water management techniques. 2. Sewage needs to be treated before discharged into rivers (water reclamation plants). ii. To reduce overfishing and overharvesting: 1. Ban the use of drift nets 2. Limit period of fishing in fishing grounds 3. Raise endangered species of fish in hatcheries iii. To reduce pollution from factories 1. Ensure that discharges are treated iv. To conserve forests 1. Manage timber production through enforcement of laws that ensure that trees felled for timber are cut down selectively and at a regulated rate (young trees are not felled) 2. Carry out reforestation 3. Designate lands as forest reserves
