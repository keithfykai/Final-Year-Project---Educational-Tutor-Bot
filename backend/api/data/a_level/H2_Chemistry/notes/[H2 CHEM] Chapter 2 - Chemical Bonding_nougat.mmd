## Chapter 1 Introduction

### 1 Non-Polar Covalent Bonds

* Occur when two atoms of the same electronegativity (the tendency to attract electrons) form a covalent bond, there is an equal sharing of the bonding electrons between the two nuclei.

### 2 Polar Covalent Bonds

* Occur when two atoms of different electronegativity form a covalent bond, the bonding electrons is not equally shared and the bond becomes polar and is said to possess ionic characteristic whereby the atom of greater electronegativity now carries a _6- charge while the atom of lower electronegativity carries a _6+ charge_.

* The degree of polarity of the bond is measure by its dipole moment -, with the arrow pointing towards the more electronegative atom
## Chapter 1 Introduction

### 1. Bond Order

Bond order refers to the number of covalent bonds between 2 bonded atoms

Multiple bonds stronger than single bonds as more electrons shared hence stronger electrostatic forces of attraction

### 2. Bond Length

Bond length is the distance between the nuclei of the two atoms involved in the covalent bond. Smaller atoms form shorter bond length as overlap between valence orbitals are more effective

Hence stronger electrostatic forces of attraction from nucleus resulting in stronger bond strength 

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:9]

Due to their oppositely charged nature, the attraction of the valence shell electrons of the anion to the cation result in distortion (polarisation) of the electron cloud of the anion. This results in partial electron sharing resulting in the covalent characteristic.

Referred to as **polar covalent compounds**

They have polar covalent bonds **AND** the dipole moment from the polar covalent bonds does not cancel out (net dipole moment).

This occur when the **polar bonds** are arranged in a non-symmetrical arrangement, thus unable to cancel out one another.

Intermolecular forces of attraction are electrostatic in nature and are form **between molecules.** They are **generally weaker** than intramolecular bonds formed within the molecules.

## 5.1 Instantaneous dipoles: dipole\(-\) involved

Exist for **all** covalent molecules.

## 5.2 Instantaneous dipoles

### 5.2 Instantaneous dipoles

The formation of **intermolecular** H-Bond between molecules result in **dimerisation of compounds** (eg: carboxylic acid).

Melting & Boiling Point of a substance is the temperature that measure the amount of energy required to overcome the bonds BETWEEN the particles to break down the regular arrangement of atoms.

Steps to Compare Melting/Boiling Point of Molecules;

Step 1: Identify the structure and type of attractions present in the molecules

Step 2: Compare the difference in strength of attractions present

Step 3: State the degree of energy required (large/small amount) to take in to overcome the forces of attraction and hence link to the melting/boiling point.

### 6.1. **Metallic Compounds**

1. **Number of delocalised electrons**

* The more delocalised electrons a metal have, the stronger their electrostatic attraction to the metal cation and thus the stronger the metallic bond.
2. **Charge density of metal cation**

* Charge density \(\propto\)

1. **Charge of the ions**

* The higher the charge of the ions, the stronger the electrostatic attraction to each other and hence the stronger the ionic bond
2. **Size of the ions**

* The smaller the size of the ions, the **shorter the distance** is between each other and hence resulting in a **stronger electrostatic attraction** between the oppositely charged ions and thus a stronger ionic bond

_Note: The charge factor is a more important factor than the size factor_

## 1 Metallic Compounds

Hard, but not Malleable & Ductile (not brittle)Hard: Metals do not deform easily under physical stress/force due to their strong metallic bonds Malesuke & Ductile: The "sea" of delocalised electrons prevent repulsion (between cations) and allow the formation of new bonds between the cation and electrons when layers of metal cations slide past each other. This enable the metallic bonding to remains intact even as a force is applied.

## 2 Ionic Compounds

Hard & Brittle

Hard: Ionic compound do not deform easily under physical stress/force due to their strong ionic bonds

Brittle: As the ions are arranged in an orderly lattice structure, ions of similar charges might come together during the displacement of the layers of ions when a force is applied. Repulsion between the like-charges will thus result the two portions of the lattice structure to fall apart.

**Octet Rule** is use as a guiding principle in drawing dot-and-cross diagrams whereby the **octet structure of 8 valence electrons** is achieved whenever possible

**Ionic Compounds**

**Step 1:** Identify the cation and anion and their respectively charges

**Step 2:** Use an empty shell to represent the loss of electrons in the cation and bracket it.

**Step 3:** Write its charges outside the brackets.

**Step 4:** Identify the number of valence electrons of the anion and draw it.

**-** The number of valence electrons corresponds to the group of the element in the Periodic Table.

_-_ Note: we will usually draw the electrons in a NSEW direction for the first 4 electrons_

**Step 5:** Draw the newly added electrons from the cation with another symbol and write its charges outside the brackets for the anion.

**Step 6:** Draw both ions together

**Covalent Compounds**

**Step 1:** Identify the central atom

The central atom is usually the element present in lower number **OR** has the lowest electronegativity

**Step 2:** Determine the number of valence electrons of each atom

The number of valence electrons corresponds to the group of the element in the Periodic Table.

**Step 3:** Determine the number of bonds (hence the number of electrons)

each atom needs to form in order to achieve octet structure (valence electron of 8)

**Step 4:** Draw out the valence electrons including those not involved in bonding.

**:** Bond Pair: the electron pair that is shared between the bonded atom

**:**:**: _Lone Pair: the electron pair that is not shared between the bonded atom

**:**: _Note: Alternative symbol is use to represent electrons from different element_.

**Step 5:** Check that the central atom and surrounding atoms achieve octet structure.

If octet structure cannot be achieved by normal covalent bond, consider datue bonding.

**:**: _Recap: There are two types of covalent bonds, (1) normal covalent bond (both singly occupied with an electron); (2) drive covalent bond (one is filled with a pair of electrons while the other is an empty orbital)_

_Note:_ _Date bonding is represented by -- from the donor atom to the acceptor atom or by both electrons_

**Step 1:**

For cations, electrons are generally lost from the less electronegative atom

For anions, electrons are generally gained by the more electronegative

**Step 2:** Follow the steps as per drawing a covalent compound

**Step 3:** The overall charge on the ion must be included and written outside

the brackets

**Step 4:**

## 1. Electron Deficient Species

Usually occur when the central atom have less than 8 electrons in the valence shell but yet no valence electrons are available to be taken in from the neighboring atom

Examples: \(\text{Secl}_{\text{E}}\), \(\text{Br}_{\text{3}}\), \(\text{AC}_{\text{3}}\)

## 2. Radicals

Usually occur with atoms of odd number electrons, forming one unpaired non-bonding electron.

Examples: NO, \(\text{NO}_{\text{2}}\)

## 3. Expanded Octet Structure

Only occur for elements in Period 3 and above as such element can also use 3d subsulsed to form covariant bonds. Therefore they are able to expand its octet structure to take in more than 8 valence electrons (usually for the central atom).

Examples: \(\text{PC}_{\text{1}}\)

## Appendix A Practical Genetions

Question: Determine which atom is the donor atom and which is the acceptor atom in the formation of dative bond between NH\({}_{4}\).

_Answer: N is the donor atom as it has a lone pair of electrons and H is the acceptor atom as it has an empty 1s orbital._

Question: Draw the polar covalent bond present (if any) in H\({}_{2}\) or HCl. Explain your answer.

_Answer: H\({}_{2}\) does not contain polar covalent bond as both H atoms have the same tendency to attract the bonding electrons. Therefore, the shared electron-pair is equidistant between both atoms. HCl contains a polar covalent bond due to the difference in electronegativities between hydrogen and chlorine. Cl has a stronger tendency to attract electrons than H and hence the shared electron-pair is closer to the Cl atom, H--Cl._

Question: Determine which of the following are polar or non-polar compounds: CO\({}_{2}\), CCl\({}_{4}\), CHCl\({}_{3}\), PF\({}_{3}\), H\({}_{2}\)O

_Answer: Polar compounds: CHCl\({}_{3}\), PF\({}_{3}\), H\({}_{2}\)O_

_Non polar compounds: CO\({}_{2}\), CCl\({}_{4}\)_

## Appendix A Practical Questions

Question: Which metal has the strongest metallic bond strength?

A: Be B. Mg C: Ca D : Sr

_Answer: D_

Question: Which have a higher melting point, MgO or NaCl. Explain your answer.

_Answer: Both compounds are ionic compounds with ionic bonding, MgO has a higher melting point than NaCl, Both MgO and NaCl have giant ionic lattice structure. The charge of MgO\({}^{2}\) is greater than that of Na\({}^{+}\), while the charge of O\({}^{2}\) is greater than that of O\({}^{2}\) is greater than that of O\({}^{2}\) is greater than that of O\({}^{2}\). The ionic radius of Mg\({}^{+}\) is smaller than Na\({}^{+}\), while the ionic radius of O\({}^{2}\) is smaller than Cr. This indicates that the electrostatic attractions between Mg\({}^{+}\) and O\({}^{2}\) are stronger. Therefore, a larger amount of energy is required to overcome the stronger ionic bonds in MgO, hence resulting in a higher melting point._

Question: Explain the reason for the difference in boiling point between HF, NH\({}_{3}\) and H\({}_{2}\)O.

_Answer: All three molecules are polar simple covalent structures and are able to form H-Bonds between the molecules. H\({}_{2}\)O has the highest boiling point as it is able to form the most number of H-Bond per molecule. Hence larger amount of energy is required to overcome the higher number of H-Bonds present, resulting in highest boiling point. If the first higher boiling point that H\({}_{3}\), as the H-F bond has greater magnitude of the dipole moment as compared to N-H bond. Hence larger amount of energy is required to overcome the stronger H-F bond as compared to the N-H bond._

## Appendix A Practical Questions

Explain the difference in the boiling point of the three simple covalent molecules.

_Ans: At three molecules are non-polar simple covalent structures and have i-d-d interactions present between the molecules. Hexane has a larger electron cloud size as compared to the other two molecules, hence is electron cloud is more polarisable. Hence more energy is required to overcome the stronger i-d interactions between hexane molecules, thus hexane has the highest boiling point._

_Pennae has a higher boiling point than 2.2-dimethylpropane due to the linear structure of pentane as compared to the branched structure of 2.2-dimethylpropane. Therefore pentane has a larger surface area for contact, forming more extensive i-d interactions between its molecules. More energy is thus required to overcome the stronger i-d interactions between pentane molecules as compared to between 2.2-dimethylpropane molecules, resulting in a higher boiling point for pentane as compared to 2.2-dimethylpropane._
