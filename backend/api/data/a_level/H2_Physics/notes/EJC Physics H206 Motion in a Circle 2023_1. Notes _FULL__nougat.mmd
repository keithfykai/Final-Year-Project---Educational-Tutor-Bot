#### Uniform Circular Motion

Uniform circular motion occurs when an object moves round a circle with the **same speed**. The time it takes to complete one revolution is called the _period T_ within which the angular velocity is \(\omega=\frac{\mathrm{d}\theta}{\mathrm{d}t}=\frac{2\pi}{T}=2\pi f\). \(f\) is the frequency of the rotation: the number of rotations per unit time, \(T=\frac{1}{f}\).

#### Relationship between Angular Velocity \(\omega\) and Linear Velocity \(\nu\)

\begin{tabular}{c c c c c} \hline  & quantity & linear & angular & relation \\ \cline{2-5} rate of change with & displacement & \(s\) & \(\theta\) & \(s=r\theta\) \\ respect to time\(\downarrow\) & velocity & \(\nu\) & \(\omega\) & \(\nu=r\omega\) \\ \hline \end{tabular}

An object in uniform circular motion travels a full circumference in a period:

\[\nu=\frac{\mathrm{circumference}}{\mathrm{period}}=\frac{2\pi r}{T}=r\frac{2 \pi}{T}=r\omega\]

\begin{tabular}{c c c} \hline \(V=r\omega\) & \(\nu\) : linear velocity _or_ tangential velocity (m s\({}^{\text{-1}}\)) \\ \(r\) : radius of the circular path (m) \\ \(\omega\) : angular velocity (rad s\({}^{\text{-1}}\)) \\ \hline \end{tabular}

**Example 1**:

Points A, B and C lie on the second hand of an analogue watch.

**(a)**: State and explain the point which has the largest

**(i)**: angular velocity \(\omega\),
**(ii)**: linear speed \(\nu\).
**(b)**: Point C is 2.0 cm from the centre of the face, calculate the

**(i)**: angular velocity of point **C**,
**(ii)**: linear velocity of point **C**.

**Solution**

**(a)(i)** all 3 points have same angular velocity as they lie on the same radius and is swept through the same rate of change of angular displacement

**(a)(ii)**: \(\nu=r\omega\) so linear velocity is directly proportional to distance from centre of circular motion. C is furthest away so has largest linear velocity

### Centripetal Acceleration and Centripetal Force

Centripetal means "centre-seeking". In circular motion, the force (also acceleration) is directed towards the centre of the circular path.

[MISSING_PAGE_POST]

* Centripetal force \(F_{\mathrm{c}}\) is a _resultant_ force \(F_{\mathrm{c}}\) is the "leftover" net force resulting from _real forces_ such as contact, tension, weight etc. Therefore **do not draw centripetal force** in a free body diagram.
* For uniform circular motion, constant linear speed implies zero tangential force. The centripetal force only changes the direction of motion but not the speed.

* The string were to snap suddenly, by Newton's 1st Law, the ball will tend to continue in its state of constant velocity just before the string snaps: Ball will continue moving off tangential to the original circular motion.

* Explain why is there no work done during circular motion by a centripetal force.

* **Solution [direction]** Force* that provides centripetal force for the object to undergo uniform circular motion is always perpendicular to the direction of motion of the object

* **[w.d. definition]** Hence no displacement in the direction of the force and therefore no work done.

* **Note:** need to specify the type of _real_ force when answering such questions to demonstrate the knowledge that centripetal force is a resultant force and not a new type of force. e.g. "tension provides the centripetal force" / "gravitational force provides the centripetal force " etc.

**Example 4**: The Stanford Torus is a proposed design for a space habitat. It is suggested that gravity be simulated in the habitat by means of circular motion by rotating a "donut"-shaped ring of 1.8 km diameter, 1 revolution per minute (RPM). Determine the magnitude of the gravity being simulated.

**Solution**: \[\alpha_{\rm e} =r\omega^{2}=\left(\frac{d}{2}\right)\left(\frac{2\pi}{T}\right)^{2 }=\left(\frac{1.8\times 10^{3}}{2}\right)\left(\frac{2\pi}{60}\right)^{2}\] \[=9.87\ \rm m\ s^{-2}\]

### General Approach to Solving Problems relating to Circular Motion

1. Draw a free body diagram showing all the forces acting on the body.
2. Determine the centre of the circular path.
3. Resolve the forces in the direction towards the centre of the circle and the perpendicular direction.
4. Identify the force(s) that provide(s) the centripetal force and write down the statement. e.g. **Friction provides the centripetal force.**
5. Apply Newton's Second Law: \[F_{\rm net}=mr\omega^{2}=\frac{mv^{2}}{r}\]

#### Uniform circular motion along a horizontal plane

**Example 5**: A race car of mass 800 kg speeds along a track shaped like the arc of a circle. The maximum friction between all tyres and road is 12 000 N.

**(a)**: Explain which force provides the centripetal force.
**(b)**: Find the maximum speed if the curve has a radius of 30 m
**Solution**: **(a)**: friction acts laterally on a car's tyres to provide centripetal force. the force is constant in magnitude and acts normal to the car's forward velocity.
**(b)**: friction on tyres provides centripetal force

\[F_{\rm friction} =\frac{mv^{2}}{r}\] \[\nu =\sqrt{\frac{F_{\rm friction}r}{m}}=\sqrt{\frac{\left(12000\right) \left(30\right)}{800}}=21.2\ \rm m\ s^{-1}\]

**Note:** the magnitude of friction can vary up to a maximum value (see H204 Forces). For a same circular path, the radius \(r\) of the path is fixed-a higher speed will need a higher force of friction to provide the centripetal force, failing which the car skids.

#### 6.3.2 Circular motion along a vertical plane

When an object moves along a vertical circular path, there is a natural tendency for the speed of the object to vary. The object will:

* accelerate when moving down
* slow down when moving up

because of the effects the role of weight in the conservation of energy (converting gravitational potential energy into kinetic energy).

Therefore, if an object shows _uniform_ circular motion when moving vertically, there is a cyclic input of energy (to do work against gravity) and dissipation of energy (to "brake" when moving down).

It is hence common to apply conservation of energy when solving circular motion questions with vertical circular motion.

**Example 10**

A car moves with constant speed \(\nu\) over a road hump shaped as a circular arc of radius \(r\). Find the expression for \(\nu\) when the car just loses contact from the top of the hump.

**Solution**

vector sum of normal force and weight provides centripetal force

\[W-N=\frac{m\nu^{2}}{r}\]

\[N=W-\frac{m\nu^{2}}{r}\]

For the car to stay in contact with the hump,

\[N\geq 0\]

\[W-\frac{m\nu^{2}}{r}\geq 0\]

\[\nu\leq\sqrt{pg}\]

\[\nu_{\max}=\sqrt{pg}\]

**Note:** it is "easier" for a car to lose contact for a small radius, making for an uncomfortable "bump". This is why larger, flatter speed bumps are more forgiving than very small and rounded ones.

**Example 11**

Water is spun vertically in a bucket attached to a string. Find the minimum speed such that the water stays in the bucket.

**Solution**

vector sum of normal force & weight provides centripetal force

\[W+N_{\text{on\ water by bucket}}=\frac{mv^{2}}{r}\]

\(N\geq 0\) for water to stay (in contact with bucket)

\[mg\leq \frac{mv^{2}}{r}\] \[\sqrt{pg}\geq v\] \[\nu_{\text{mn}}=\sqrt{pg}\]

**Note:** the faster the bucket is swung, the more likely the person doing the experiment stays dry.

The general relationships for an object in vertical motion swung along a string:

\[T-mg\ \cos\theta=\frac{mv^{2}}{r}\]

in general, \[T=\frac{mv^{2}}{r}+mg\ \cos\theta\]

at bottom, \[T=\frac{mv^{2}}{r}+mg\ \cos(0)\]

at top, \[T=\frac{mv^{2}}{r}+mg\ \cos(180^{\circ})\]

\[=\frac{mv^{2}}{r}-mg\]

**Example 12**

The Battestar Galactic roller coaster ride in Universal Studios Singapore was shut down for 11 months in 2010. It had been reported that one of the seats was detached from the frame during a routine test. The seats are attached to the frame by means of a rod under stress as indicated.

Determine if the rod is subject to greater stress at the top of a vertical loop or at the bottom.

**Solution**

Consider the combined weight of passenger and chair:

\[\begin{split} F_{\text{top}}+W&=\frac{mv^{2}}{r} \\ F_{\text{top}}&=\frac{mv^{2}}{r}-mg\\ &=m\bigg{(}\frac{v^{2}}{r}-g\bigg{)}\end{split}\]

Rod is under tension \(F_{\text{bottom}}\) at bottom of loop.

Resultant force of \(F_{\text{bottom}}\) and weight provides centripetal force:

\[F_{\text{bottom}}-W =\frac{mv^{2}}{r}\] \[F_{\text{bottom}} =\frac{mv^{2}}{r}+mg\] \[=m\bigg{(}\frac{v^{2}}{r}+g\bigg{)}\]

Rod is subject to more force at bottom of loop for the same speed.

**Example 13**: In a particular ride in an amusement park, a cart of mass \(m=55\) kg reaches the top of a circular frictionless track of diameter 14 m at a speed of \(v=20\) m s\({}^{-1}\), as shown in the diagram below.

**(a)**: Draw a labelled diagram of the forces acting on the cart at the top of the track.
**(b)**: Find the magnitude of the force exerted by the cart on the track at the top of the track.
**(c)**: Find the velocity of the cart at the bottom of the track.
**(d)**: Find the magnitude of the normal force on the cart at the bottom of the track.

**Solution**: (a)

**(b) Resultant force of normal force by track on cart and weight provides centripetal force:**

\[N_{\text{top}}+W =\frac{mv^{2}}{r}\] \[N_{\text{top}} =\frac{mv^{2}}{d}-mg=m\Bigg{(}\frac{2v^{2}}{d}-g\Bigg{)}\] \[=\big{(}55\big{)}\Bigg{(}\frac{2\big{(}20\big{)}^{2}}{14}-9.81 \Bigg{)}\] \[=2600\text{ N}\]

**By Newton's 3\({}^{\text{rd}}\) Law, the normal force on track by cart is 2600 N upwards**

**(c) By principle of conservation of energy, loss in GPE = gain in KE:**

\[mg\Delta h =\frac{1}{2}mv_{\text{bottom}}^{2}-\frac{1}{2}mv_{\text{top}}^{2}\] \[\nu_{\text{bottom}} =\sqrt{2gd+v_{\text{top}}^{2}}=\sqrt{2\big{(}9.81\big{)}\big{(}1 4\big{)}+\big{(}20\big{)}^{2}}\] \[=26.0\text{ m s}^{-1}\]

**Note: recall that you do not feel your weight, but perceive the sensation through the normal contact force. The large magnitude of normal force at the bottom of the loop is the "squashed" sensation at the bottom of a roller coaster loop. The reduced magnitude of normal force gives the "dropping" sensation.**

**Example 14**: A marble rolls down a smooth track from the height as indicated. It did not loop-the-loop successfully. Find the height from which the marble can be dropped so that it can loop-the-loop successfully.

**Solution**

To loop-the-loop, the marble must be in contact with the track at the highest point.

Consider the force diagram at the top of the loop:

Resultant force of normal contact force _by track on marble_ and weight provides centripetal force:

\[N+W=\frac{m\nu^{2}}{r}\]

For the marble to be in contact with the track:

\[N\geq 0\]

\[\frac{m\nu^{2}}{r}-mg\geq 0\]

\[\nu^{2}\geq rg\]

Hence, min velocity at the top of the loop:

\[\nu_{min}\geq\sqrt{rg}\]

By Conservation of Energy:

Initial total energy = final total energy at top of loop

\[E_{p,n\text{final}}+E_{k,n\text{final}} = E_{p,n\text{final}}+E_{k,n\text{final}}\] \[mgh+0 = mg\left(2r\right)+\frac{1}{2}m\nu_{\min}^{2}\] \[mgh+0 = mg\left(2r\right)+\frac{1}{2}m\left(rg\right)\] \[h = \frac{5}{2}r\]
