## 1 Magnetic Field

The idea of a field is a theoretical concept used by scientists to explain how objects interact with one another without physically touching each other. Field lines (flux patterns) are imaginary lines which aid visualization and quantification of the field.

A magnetic field is a region of space in which a magnetic material, a current-carrying conductor or a moving charge located in it may experience a force.

Magnetic field lines are lines of force as they indicate the direction of the force acting on a magnetic North pole. If the lines of force are parallel, the field is uniform. This means that the number of lines passing perpendicularly through unit area at all cross-sections in a magnetic field is the same. If the lines of force are closer together, the field is said to be stronger.

Magnetic field lines do not intersect as there can only be one direction for the field at any point.

**Convention in Representing Field Directions:**

1. [label=1)]
2. Field lines around a magnet is represented by lines of force leaving the North pole and entering the South pole
3. Field lines directed in and out of a page are represented by dot and cross diagrams.

A magnetic field is a region of space in which a magnetic material, a current-carrying conductor or a moving charge located in it may experience a force.

Magnetic field lines are lines of force as they indicate the direction of the force acting on a magnetic North pole. If the lines of force are parallel, the field is uniform. This means that the number of lines passing perpendicularly through unit area at all cross-sections in a magnetic field is the same. If the lines of force are closer together, the field is said to be stronger.

Since magnetic field lines do not intersect, they interact to produce a resultant line of force at each point. Field lines are not rigid but can be deformed and give way to each other as shown in the diagrams above.

### Magnetic Flux Pattern due to a Current-carrying Conductor

When there is a current in a conductor, a magnetic field will be set up around it. The magnetic flux pattern consists of concentric circles, radiating outwards from the conductor.

**Right Hand Grip Rule** is useful in determining the direction of magnetic field lines. For a current-carrying conductor, the thumb points along the direction of the current while the fingers point in the direction of the magnetic field around the conductor.

The magnetic flux density \(B\) at a perpendicular distance \(d\) due to current \(I\) in a long straight wire placed in vacuum of permeability \(\mu_{o}\)is given by the expression

\[B=\frac{\mu_{o}I}{2\pi d}\]

### Magnetic Flux Pattern due to Two Current-carrying Conductors

Two straight current-carrying conductors can be placed near to one another. Since each conductor creates its own magnetic field, the two magnetic fields will overlap each other and form a resultant magnetic field. The resultant magnetic field can be obtained by the vector addition of individual magnetic field lines. Regions with no resultant magnetic field (neutral points) may also result as indicated by an X.

Case 1: Current in the same direction 

### Magnetic Flux Pattern due to Flat Circular Coil

For a flat circular coil, the Right Hand Grip Rule can also be used to deduce the flux pattern. The thumb points along the direction of the current while the fingers point in the direction of the magnetic field around the coil.

The magnetic flux density \(B\) at the center of a flat circular coil with \(N\) turns of radius \(r\) due to current \(I\) in placed in vacuum of permeability \(\mu_{o}\)is given by the expression

\[B=\frac{\mu_{o}NI}{2r}\]

### Magnetic Flux Pattern due to a Long Solenoid

A solenoid consists of many flat circular coils stacked together side by side. The resultant magnetic field can be obtained by the vector addition of magnetic field due to individual flat circular coils.

The magnetic flux density \(B\) inside a long solenoid with \(n\) number of turns per unit length along its axis due to current \(I\) in placed in vacuum of permeability \(\mu_{0}\)is given by the expression

The magnetic field is uniform and the magnetic field lines are parallel along the axis of the solenoid

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:7]

The direction of the force \(F\) is given by Fleming's Left Hand Rule where the magnetic force experienced by the conductor is always perpendicular to both \(B\) and \(I\).

### Magnetic Flux Density

Magnetic flux density is a measure of the strength of the magnetic field in a region of space. Its direction is at right angles to the force and current as indicated by Fleming's Left Hand Rule.

**Symbol: B Unit: Tesla, T**

Definition of Magnetic Flux Density, B

**Magnetic flux density is defined as the force acting per unit length per unit current on a conductor carrying current placed at right angles to the magnetic field.**

\[B=\frac{F}{IL}\,,\,\theta=90^{o}\]

Definition of the unit Tesla, T

**One tesla is defined as the magnetic flux density of a magnetic field in which a force per unit length of one newton per metre acts on a conductor which is carrying a current of one ampere in a direction perpendicular to the field.**

Comparing units:

\[1T=\frac{1N}{1A\times 1m}\,,\theta=90^{0}\]

**Example 2**

A straight horizontal rod, of mass 50 g and length 0.50 m, is placed in a uniform horizontal magnetic field of flux density 0.20 T perpendicular to the rod. Determine the current in the rod if the force acting on it just balances its weight.

Taking upwards as positive

\[\sum F = ma\] \[F_{B}-mg = ma\] \[BIL\sin\theta-mg = ma\] \[I = \frac{ma+mg}{BL\sin\theta}\] \[= \frac{50\times 10^{-3}\times 0+50\times 10^{-3}\times 9.81}{0.20 \times 0.50\times\sin 90^{0}}\] \[= 4.9\text{ A}\]

**Example 3**

The diagram below shows a typical d.c. motor. The flux density due to the magnet is 25 mT. The coil has 50 turns of copper wire and carries a current of 200 mA. Calculate the torque produced by the magnetic force at this position. Indicate on the left diagram the direction of the torque.

\begin{tabular}{l l} Force on 1 coil & \(BIL\sin\theta\) \\  & \(=25\times 10^{-3}\times 200\times 10^{-3}\times 8.0\times 10^{-2}\times\sin 90^{0}\) \\  & \(=4.0\times 10^{-4}\) N \\ Force on 50 coils & \(=50\times 4.0\times 10^{-4}\) \\  & \(=2.0\times 10^{-2}\) N \\ Torque & \(=2.0\times 10^{-2}\times 4.0\times 10^{-2}\) \\  & \(=8.0\times 10^{-4}\) N m Anti-clockwise \\ \end{tabular}

#### 2.2.1 Determination of Magnetic Flux Density using Current Balance

Part of a rectangular coil is placed inside a solenoid and the current is allowed to flow in the coil such that it experiences a downward magnetic force \(F_{B}\).

A rider of known mass is hung at the opposite end of the coil.

The pivot is shifted until the coil is in rotational equilibrium.

Let the distances from the pivot be \(d_{i}\) and \(d_{2}\) respectively.

In rotational equilibrium, taking moments about the pivot,

\[F_{B}d_{i} = mgd_{2}\] \[Blld_{i} = mgd_{2}\] \[B = \frac{mgd_{2}}{ILd_{i}}\]

**Example 4**

In the current balance below, the wire frame rests on two knife edges at A and B, which are exactly at the middle of the frame. Lengths AB and CD are 0.15 m while lengths CB and DA are 0.20 m. There is a current of 6.0 A which enters the left-hand side of the frame by means of the knife edge. A separate current is supplied to the solenoid to create a field which has a flux density of 3.5 mT.

(a) Explain why there is no magnetic force on AD and CB.

(b) Indicate the direction of the magnetic field in the diagram.

(c) Calculate the force acting on CD.

(d) Calculate the mass needed to be placed on the wire frame in order to restore equilibrium

(e) If the laboratory environment has a background magnetic field in the horizontal direction that may interfere with the setup, suggest and explain how the effect due to the background magnetic field may be reduced.

(a) Since direction of current is parallel to that of magnetic field, using \(F\) = _BILsine_, there is no magnetic force on AD and CB.

(b) Current in wire frame is in direction BCDA. The magnetic field exerts a downward force on on CD which is balanced by the mass placed on FE. Hence, the field is pointing in the direction parallel to CB or DA.

(c) F = BILsin0

= (3.5 x 10\({}^{-3}\))(6)(0.15)

= 3.15 x 10\({}^{-3}\) N

(d) By Principle of Moments, taking moments about the pivot,

\(\rm F_{B}\,x\,L_{DA}=W\,x\,L_{AE}\)

(3.15 x 10\({}^{3}\)) = m (9.81)

m = 3.20 x 10\({}^{-4}\) kg

(e) Align the wire section CD such that it is parallel to the horizontal background magnetic field. This ensures that no force (and hence no torque) acts on section CD to disturb the equilibrium.

**Example 5**

Two long, straight, parallel wires carry current of 1.0 A and 2.0 A respectively.

Which diagram shows the directions and relative magnitudes \(F_{t}\) and \(F_{2}\) of the forces per unit length on each of the wires?

**Example 6**

The diagram shows three parallel wires X, Y, and Z that carry currents of equal magnitude in the directions shown. The resultant force experienced by Y due to the current in X and Z is

**A**

perpendicular to the plane of the paper

**B**

to the left

**C**

to the right

**D**

zero

**Example 7**

Three long vertical wires pass through the corners of an equilateral triangle **PQR**. They carry equal currents into or out of the paper in the directions shown in the diagram.

Which direction shows the direction of the resultant force F on the wire Q?

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:15]

\[\sum F = ma\] \[F_{\rm B} = \frac{mv^{2}}{r}\] \[Bqv = \frac{mv^{2}}{r}\] \[r = \frac{mv}{Bq}\]

From the equation, we can deduce that for particles entering the magnetic field with the same velocity, the radius is proportional to its mass-to-charge ratio (i.e. _m/q_).

Since magnetic force is always perpendicular to the velocity of the particle, there is no work done on the particle by the magnetic force. Thus the speed and kinetic energy of the particle remains constant as it moves in along the circular path in a magnetic field.

**Example 8**

An electron enters a magnetic field of flux density \(B_{1}\) at right angles with speed 1.0 x 10\({}^{5}\) m s\({}^{\text{-1}}\) and makes a circular path of radius 0.50 m. The flux density is changed to \(B_{2}\) such that a proton with speed 7.5 x 10\({}^{4}\) m s\({}^{\text{-1}}\) enters the field and makes a circular path identical to that of the electron. Determine the ratio of \(B_{1}\). Comment on the directions of \(B_{1}\) and \(B_{2}\).

\[Bqv = \frac{mv^{2}}{r}\] \[B = \frac{mv}{qr}\] \[B_{1} = \frac{mv}{qr}\]

\[B_{2} = \frac{m_{e}v_{e}}{er_{e}m_{p}v_{p}}\] \[= \frac{0.50\times 9.11\times 10^{-31}\times 1.0\times 10^{5}}{0.50 \times 1.67\times 10^{-27}\times 7.5\times 10^{4}}\] \[= 7.27\times 10^{-4}\]

\(B_{1}\) and \(B_{2}\) are in opposite direction.

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:17]

**Example 9**

Indicate with an arrow the direction of the resultant force on the proton in each of the cases shown below.

**Example 10**

Electrons of speed \(2.0\times 10^{5}\) m s\({}^{\text{-1}}\) emerge from the crossed fields shown below undeflected. If the flux density of the field is 0.50 mT, calculate the potential \(V\). Also deduce the speed of alpha particles that will emerge from the crossed fields undeflected.

\(F_{B}=F_{E}\)

\(B\,q\,v=q\,E\)

\(E=B\,v=0.50\times 10^{3}\times 2.0\times 10^{5}=1.0\times 10^{2}\) N C\({}^{\text{-1}}\)

\(E=\Delta V/d=\Delta V/0.080\)

\(\Delta V=8.0\) V

The upper plate must be at a lower potential than the lower plate, thus _V_= - 8.0 V

For undeflected particles

\(v=E/B\) (independent of mass and charge)

Alpha particles (or any other particles) of the same speed (\(2.0\times 10^{5}\) m s\({}^{\text{-1}}\)) will not be deflected.

## Appendix A Hall Probe

Measuring electricity is really easy--we're all familiar with electrical equipment like voltmeter, ammeter and ohmmeter. But measuring magnetic flux density is a little bit harder. The Hall probe uses a clever bit of science discovered in 1879 by American physicist Edwin H. Hall (1855-1938) which was years ahead of its time--20 years before the discovery of the electron--and no one really knew what to do with it until decades later when semiconducting materials such as silicon became better understood. Let's take a closer look at how the Hall probe works!

When an electric current \(I\) flows through a conductor placed perpendicular to a magnetic field of flux density \(B\), the magnetic field exerts a force on the moving charge carriers which tends to push them to one side of the conductor.

This buildup of charges at the either sides of the conductor produces an electric field. At steady current, the resulting electric force balances the magnetic force. The measurable potential difference between the two (transverse) sides of the conductor is the hall voltage \(V_{H}\).

\(F_{B}=Bev_{d}\)\(F_{E}=Ee\)\(F_{B}=F_{E}\)\(Bev_{d}=Ee\)\(E=V_{tr}/w\)\(Bev_{d}=(V_{tr}/w)\)\(e\)\(V_{H}=Bv_{d}\)\(V_{d}=Bv_{d}\)\(V_{d}=I/nAe\)\(V_{H}=B\)\((I/nAe)\)\(w=B\)\((I/nAe)\)\(w=B\)\((I/nAe)\)\(w=B\)\((I/nAe)\)For the same sample of conductor at steady current, the hall voltage is proportional to the magnetic flux density, \(B\). It is important to place the hall probe perpendicular to the magnetic field in order to measure the flux density accurately.

## Appendix B: Aurora Borealis

The northern lights, or aurora borealis, offer an entrancing, dramatic, magical display that fascinates all who see it -- but just what causes this dazzling natural phenomenon?

Solar winds stream away from the sun at speeds of about 1 million miles per hour. When they reach the earth, some 40 hours after leaving the sun, energetic charged particles within the solar winds enter the earth's atmosphere. These particles are channelled toward the poles by the magnetic force which causes them to spiral around the magnetic field lines of the earth.

In section 2.4, we learned about the circular motion of a charged particle when the magnetic field is aligned perpendicularly to the velocity of the particle. In the case of charged particles from the solar winds, the particles enter at an angle to the magnetic field. Resolving the velocity into components, The component of velocity perpendicular to the field causes the circular motion while the component of the velocity parallel to the field is unaffected, since the magnetic force is zero for motion parallel to the field. This produces helical motion rather than a circular motion.

You might be amazed to know that auroral displays can even make sounds! People have reported hearing claps and crackles during an aurora, and this has been verified by microphones placed by scientists. It is time to add them to your bucket list!
