## 6 Common

AIR POLLUTANTS

## 5 SULEUR DIOXIDE

Sulfur is a **type of impurity present in fossil fuels.** When fossil fuels undergo combustion, sulfur would react with the oxygen in air to form sulfur dioxide.

Large volumes of sulfur dioxide can also produced during **volcano eruptions.**

**Harmful.Effects:**

- Causes respiratory difficulties

- Causes formation of acid rain, which results in erosion of buildings and environmental damages.

Under very high temperatures, nitrogen and oxygen in air

reads to form nitrogen monoxide (NO).

Nitrogen monoxide can continue reacting with oxygen in air to form nitrogen dioxide (NO).

NNO is usually produced in **vehicle engines**, power stations, factories and incinerators which are high temperature environments.

NNO is can also be produced during **thunderstorms and forest fires** as well.

**Harmaful Effects:**

- Causes irritation to our lungs

- Causes the formation of acid rain, which results in erosion of buildings and environmental damages

- NO may react to produce harmful ozone in the presence of sunlight

**Acid rain** is formed when acidic oxides (e.g. **sulfur dioxide and nitrogen dioxide**) react with oxygen and water in the atmosphere to form acid.

25O2 (g) + O2 (g) + 2H,O (l) + 2H,SO2 (aq) 4NO2 (g) + O2 (g) + 2H,O (l) + 4iNO3 (aq)

**Harmful Effects:**

Add rain causes **corsorsion to buildings** and **status** that are built using materials containing limestone, cement or **metallic structures** as acids react with metal.

Add rain disrupts the pH balance of the soil, making it **acidic**, making it less optimal for the growth of plants and trees.

Add rain decreases the **pH of lake water**, causing it to be unsuitable for aquatic organisms to survive.

**Ways to reduce harmful effects of acid rain:**

**Refrain from using fuels containing sulfur, like coal or oil.**

**Cleansing the air that contains pollutants like sulfur dioxide and nitrogen dioxide before releasing it.**

Neutralise the high acidity in soils by using **slaked lime** (calcium hydroxide) or **m limestone** (calcium carbonate).

Global Warning Global Warning Global warming refers to the Earth heating up and experiencing an increase in temperature.

CARBON CYCLE

Methane, carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases trap heat from the Sun, resulting in the increase in temperature on Earth, which leads to global warming.

Harmful Effects:

Melting of polar ice caps causes rising sea levels which causes flooding of low-lying lands. Higher rainfall in equatorial climates, while countries in the Northern hemisphere (United States and Europe) are likely to experience more droughts. Food shortages will happen as **certain crops will struggle to grow** in such bad conditions.

How to reduce the effect of global warming:

Switch from using non-renewable sources of energy (e.g. fossil fuels) to using renewable sources of energy (e.g. wind and solar energy)

Switch to electric or hydrogen powered vehicles
