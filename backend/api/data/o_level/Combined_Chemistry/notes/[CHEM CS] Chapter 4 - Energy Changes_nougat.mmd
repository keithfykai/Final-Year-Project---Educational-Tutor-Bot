## 5 Experiment

An exothermic reaction occurs where energy is expelled out to the surroundings.

Examples of exothermic processes would include **condensation** and **freezing** as heat is expelled out to the surroundings to lower the units' temperature.

**- Combustion reactions** are also exothermic. Burning a hydrocarbon in the presence of oxygen will produce heat and raise the temperature of the surroundings.

\(\mathrm{C_{}}\)H\({}_{4}\) (g) + 3 O\({}_{2}\) (g) + 2 CO\({}_{2}\) (g) + 2 H\({}_{2}\)O (h) + heat

**- Neutralisation reactions** are also exothermic. Heat is produced when H\({}^{+}\) ions undergo bond forming with OH\({}^{+}\) ions to form water.

H\({}^{+}\) (aq) + OH\({}^{+}\) (aq) + H\({}_{2}\)O (l) + heat

## Chapter 5 Endothermic Reaction

An endothermic reaction occurs when energy is absorbed from the surroundings.

Examples of endothermic process are **melting and boiling** where heat energy is absorbed to change states.

**- Dissoking ionic salts in water** is endothermic. For example, dissolving sodium chloride in water causes the temperature of the solution to decrease.

NaCl (s) + heat -> NaCl (aq)

**- Thermal decomposition** is an endothermic process as heat is required for most compounds to be decomposed.

PbCO\({}_{3}\) (s) + heat -> PbO (s) + CO\({}_{2}\) (g)

**- Electrolysis** is an endothermic reaction which occurs without absorbing heat energy. Instead, electrolysis occurs by **absorbing in electrical energy** for a reaction.
