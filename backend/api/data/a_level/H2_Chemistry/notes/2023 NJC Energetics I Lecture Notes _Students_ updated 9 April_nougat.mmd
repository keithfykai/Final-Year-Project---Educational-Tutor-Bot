## 1 Introduction

**Success Criteria:**

* Explain that most chemical reactions and physical processes are accompanied by changes in heat energy which is a result of the breaking and forming of chemical bonds; \(\Delta H=H_{\text{heat}}-H_{\text{heat}}\)
* When there is a net release in energy, the reaction is exothermic (\(\Delta H\), negative)
* When there is a net absorption in energy, the reaction is endothermic (\(\Delta H\), positive).
* Use the sign in \(\Delta H\) to deduce whether the reactant or product is more stable (lower in enthalpy (H)).
* Calculate change in heat energy using the relationship \(\textit{heat change}=\Delta H\times\eta_{\textit{limiting agent}}\) _if \(\Delta H\) is known_

The study of energy changes which take place during chemical reactions is called chemical energetics or thermochemistry.

### _Enthalpy Change_, \(\Delta H\)

The following are concepts and terms related to understanding of enthalpy change:

**Enthalpy**, \(H\)

* A measure of energy content in any species, given the symbol \(H\).
* Forming stronger bonds (stronger forces of attraction) reduces energy content (smaller value of _H_) >> greater stability.

**Enthalpy Change**, \(\Delta H\)

* Enthalpy change refers to the overall energy absorbed or released in a chemical reaction for 1 mole of a particular substance or molar quantities indicated in a written equation. Its units is usually expressed in kJ mol\({}^{-1}\).

In all chemical reactions, bonds are broken and formed.

**(a)** bond breaking absorbs energy (i.e. endothermic)

**(b)** bond forming releases energy (i.e. exothermic)

* released during bond breaking
* \(\Delta H\) is either determined experimentally by measuring the temperature change or via application of Hess' law.

**Heat Change**, \(q\)

Heat change refers to the overall energy absorbed or released in a chemical reaction. Its units is usually expressed in J or kJ

Heat change, \(q\) = \(\Delta H\) x no. of moles of limiting reagent

_Note:_

* \(T\Delta S\), refer to Energetics II).
* Reactions which are energetically feasible **may still not take place** because the reaction is **too slow** i.e. such reactions are kinetically not feasible due to high activation energy (energetically feasible VS kinetically feasible).

### Thermochemical Equation

\begin{tabular}{p{142.3pt} p{142.3pt}|p{142.3pt}} _Note:_

\(\Delta H\) is defined differently for different type of reaction. & Example: \\ \hline CH\textless{}(g) + 2O\textless{}(g) \longrightarrow\textless{} CO\textless{}(g) + 2H\textless{}O(l) & \(\Delta H\) = -890.4 kJ mol\({}^{-1}\) \\ \hline \end{tabular}

_Worked Example 1_

**Given the following reaction:**

\[\mbox{Fe}_{2}\mbox{O}_{3}(\mbox{s})+3\mbox{CO}(\mbox{g})\longrightarrow 2\mbox{Fe}( \mbox{s})+3\mbox{CO}z(\mbox{g})\qquad\qquad\Delta H=-27\mbox{ kJ mol}^{-1}\]

**Calculate the amount of heat released, q, when**

**(a) 1 mol each of CO(g) and Fe\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{3}\)(s) are added together.**

CO is the limiting agent.

According to the above written equation, when 3 moles of CO react, 37 kJ of heat energy is released.

\(\lambda\) for 1 mole of CO, heat energy released = 27 + 3 = 9 kJ

**(b) 4 mol of Fe(s) is formed.**

According to the above written equation, when 2 moles of Fe is formed, 37 kJ of heat energy is released.

\(\lambda\) for 4 mole of Fe, heat energy released = 27 \(\times\) 2 = 54 kJ

### Standard Conditions for \(\Delta H\)

**Note:**

Standard conditions for energetics # standard temperature and pressure for gases (273 K, 1 bar)

_Note:_

Enthalpy level of elements in their standard states = zero

_Note:_

C(s) in the form of diamond is not the most stable allotropic form of carbon at standard conditionsNational Junior College

### Magnitude and sign of \(\Delta H\)

\begin{tabular}{c c c}  & sum of energy & sum of energy \\ \(\Delta H=\) & absorbed during & - & released during \\  & bond breaking & bond forming \\ \end{tabular}

* Types and number of moles of each type of chemical bonds broken and formed can only be deduced from a written thermochemical equation.

Therefore, the following affects the value of \(\Delta H\).

**(a) Amount of substance**

If we multiply both sides of a thermochemical equation by a factor \(n\), then \(\Delta H\) (energy change **per molar quantity of a written equation**) must change by the same factor.

\[\begin{array}{ll}\mbox{CH}_{4}(\mbox{g})+2\mbox{O}_{2}(\mbox{g})\longrightarrow \mbox{CO}_{2}(\mbox{g})+2\mbox{H}_{2}\mbox{O}(l)&\Delta H_{1}=-890.4\mbox{ kJ mol}^{-1}\\ 2\mbox{CH}_{4}(\mbox{g})+4\mbox{O}_{2}(\mbox{g})\longrightarrow 2\mbox{CO}_{2}( \mbox{g})+4\mbox{H}_{2}\mbox{O}(l)&\Delta H_{2}=2\times(-890.4)\mbox{ kJ mol}^{-1}\\ \end{array}\]

**(b) Physical states of reactants and products**

\(\Delta H\) (energy change **per molar quantity of a written equation**) will change when they physical states of reactants and products change.

\[\begin{array}{ll}\mbox{CH}_{4}(\mbox{g})+2\mbox{O}_{2}(\mbox{g})\longrightarrow \mbox{CO}_{2}(\mbox{g})+2\mbox{H}_{2}\mbox{O}(l)&\Delta H_{2}=-890.4\mbox{ kJ mol}^{-1}\\ \mbox{CH}_{4}(\mbox{g})+2\mbox{O}_{2}(\mbox{g})\longrightarrow\mbox{CO}_{2}( \mbox{g})+2\mbox{H}_{2}\mbox{O}(\mbox{g})&\Delta H_{2}=-802.4\mbox{ kJ mol}^{-1}\\ \end{array}\]

**(c) \(\Delta H\) of forward and backward reactions**

\begin{tabular}{c c c}  & Same magnitude but opposite in sign. i.e. \(\Delta H_{\rm backward}=-\Delta H_{\rm forward}\) \\ \(\mbox{CH}_{4}(\mbox{g})+2\mbox{O}_{2}(\mbox{g})\longrightarrow\mbox{CO}_{2}( \mbox{g})+2\mbox{H}_{2}\mbox{O}(l)&\Delta H=-890.4\mbox{ kJ mol}^{-1}\\ \mbox{CO}_{2}(\mbox{g})+2\mbox{H}_{2}\mbox{O}(l)\longrightarrow\mbox{CH}_{4 }(\mbox{g})+2\mbox{O}_{2}(\mbox{g})&\Delta H=+890.4\mbox{ kJ mol}^{-1}\\ \end{array}\)

**Checkpoint 1**

## 2 Definitions of Important Standard Enthalpy Changes

**Success Criteria:**

* Explain and use the terms, _enthalpy change of reaction_ and _standard conditions_ (298 K and 1 bar), with particular reference to: formation; combustion; hydration; solution; neutralisation; atomisation.
* Explain that _bond energy_ is endothermic (\(\Delta H\) positive) as it is defined as the amount of energy required to break one mole of covalent bonds. (refer to chemical bonding notes)
* Explain that _lattice energy_ of an ionic lattice is exothermic (\(\Delta\)H negative) as it is a bond forming process where the gaseous ions of opposite charges attract each other electrostatically to form the solid lattice.
* Explain, in qualitative terms, the effects of ionic charge and ionic radius on the numerical magnitude of lattice energy. i.e. \(|L.E|\propto|\frac{\theta_{+}\times\theta_{-}}{r_{+}+r_{-}}|\).
* standard enthalpy change of neutralisation according to the strength of the acid and alkali used.
* standard enthalpy change of hydration, according to \(|\Delta H^{*}_{hyd}|\propto|\frac{\textbf{charge of ion}}{\textbf{ ionic radius}}|\)

In order to write the thermochemical equations that represent the different reactions taking place at 298 K and 1 bar, you need to remember the various definitions of standard enthalpy changes.

The various definitions of standard enthalpy change has the following format:

The standard enthalpy change of **(name of process)** is the energy **(released/ absorbed/ change)** when one mole of **(specific substance with state symbols)** is **(describe process)** at 298 K and 1 bar.

### Standard enthalpy change of reaction, \(\Delta H^{*}_{r}\)

The standard enthalpy change of reaction is the _energy change_ when _molar quantities_ of reactants as stated in the balanced stoichiometric equation react together at 298 K and 1 bar.

(\text{Nz}(\text{g})+3\text{Hz}(\text{g})\longrightarrow 2\text{Nh}(\text{g})\)\(\Delta H^{*}_{r}=-92\) kJ mol-1

92 kJ of energy is released when 1 mole of nitrogen gas reacts with 3 moles of hydrogen gas to produce 2 moles of ammonia gas at 298 K and 1 bar.

### Standard enthalpy change of formation, \(\Delta H_{f}^{\bullet}\)

The standard enthalpy change of formation is the _energy change_ when one mole of a substance is _formed_ from its constituent elements in their standard states at 298 K and 1 bar.

Mg(s) + \(\frac{1}{2}\)O\({}_{2}\)(g) \(\rightarrow\) MgO(s) \(\Delta H_{f}^{\bullet}=-602\) kJ mol-1

602 kJ of energy is released when 1 mole of magnesium oxide is formed from oxygen gas and magnesium in their standard states at 298 K and 1 bar.

_Worked Example 2_

Given that the equation that represents the standard enthalpy change of formation of solid copper: Cu(s) \(\rightarrow\) Cu(s)

Explain why the value of \(\Delta H_{f}^{\bullet}\) solid copper is 0 kJ mol-1

The initial and final states are the **same**, hence **no change** in energy level.

**More about \(\Delta H_{f}^{\bullet}\):**

* \(\Delta H_{f}^{\bullet}\) of all elements in standard states = 0 kJ mol-1
* Enthalpy changes of formation are often theoretical. Such reactions may not take place in practice. E.g. C\(\pm\)HsOH cannot be formed by just mixing C, H\({}_{2}\) and O\({}_{2}\).
* For elements that can exist in several allotropic forms, only the most stable form under standard conditions is given zero standard enthalpy change of formation.
* E.g. C (graphite) \(\rightarrow\) C (graphite) \(\Delta H_{f}^{\bullet}\) (graphite) = 0 kJ mol-1
* C (graphite) \(\rightarrow\) C (diamond) \(\Delta H_{f}^{\bullet}\) (diamond) = +2 kJ mol-1

### Standard enthalpy change of combustion, \(\Delta H_{c}^{\bullet}\)

The standard enthalpy change of combustion is the _energy released_ when _one mole_ of a substance is _completely burnt_ in excess oxygen at 298 K and 1 bar.

### C(s) + O\({}_{2}\)(g) \(\rightarrow\) CO\({}_{2}\)(g) \(\Delta H_{c}^{\bullet}=-393\) kJ mol-1

393 kJ of energy is released when 1 mole of carbon (graphite) is burnt in excess oxygen under standard conditions of 298 K and 1 bar.

* Even though substantial amount of energy is absorbed to overcome the C-C bonds in graphite, energy absorbed to overcome O=O is significantly less than energy released from formation of C=O bonds in carbon dioxide. Hence there is a net release of heat energy. \(\Delta H_{c}^{\bullet}\) is always negative.

### Ionisation Energy, _I.E._

First ionisation energy (1\({}^{\rm st}\) _I.E._) of an element is the energy absorbed to remove one mole of most loosely held electrons from one mole of gaseous atoms to form one mole of gaseous single positively charged cations.

\begin{tabular}{l l} E.g. & Mg(g) \(\longrightarrow\) Mg\({}^{+}\)(g) + e\({}^{-}\) & 1\({}^{\rm st}\) _I.E._ of Mg = +736 kJ mol\({}^{-1}\) \\ \end{tabular}

Second ionisation energy (2\({}^{\rm nd}\) _I.E._) of an element is the energy absorbed to remove one mole of most loosely held electrons from one mole of gaseous single positively charged cations to form one mole of gaseous double positively charged cations.

\begin{tabular}{l l} E.g. & Mg\({}^{+}\)(g) \(\longrightarrow\) Mg\({}^{+}\)(g) + e\({}^{-}\) & 2\({}^{\rm nd}\) _I.E._ of Mg = +1450 kJ mol\({}^{-1}\) \\ \end{tabular}

### Electron Affinity, _E.A._

First electron affinity (1\({}^{\rm st}\) _E.A._) of an element is the energy released when one mole of gaseous atoms gain one mole of electrons to form one mole of gaseous single negatively charged anions.

\begin{tabular}{l l} E.g. & O\({}^{-}\)(g) + e\({}^{-}\)\(\longrightarrow\) O\({}^{2-}\)(g) & 2\({}^{\rm nd}\) _E.A._ of O = +790 kJ mol\({}^{-1}\) \\ \end{tabular}

Second electron affinity (2\({}^{\rm nd}\) _E.A._) of an element is the energy change when one mole of gaseous single negatively charged anions gain one mole of electrons to form one mole of gaseous double negatively charged anions.

\begin{tabular}{l l} E.g. & O\({}^{-}\)(g) + e\({}^{-}\)\(\longrightarrow\) O\({}^{2-}\)(g) & 2\({}^{\rm nd}\) _E.A._ of O = +790 kJ mol\({}^{-1}\) \\ \end{tabular}

### Lattice Energy, _I.E._

Lattice energy (_I.E._) of an ionic compound is the energy released when one mole of ionic solid is formed from its constituent gaseous ions.

\begin{tabular}{l l} E.g. & Na\({}^{+}\)(g) + C\({}^{+}\)(g) \(\longrightarrow\) NaC(s) & _I.E._ (NaC/) = -776 kJ mol\({}^{-1}\) \\ \end{tabular}

**Recall:** & \(|L.E|\propto|\frac{\theta_{+}+\theta_{-}}{r_{+}+r_{-}}|\) \\ \end{tabular}

The larger the charge of the cation and anion, the more exothermic the lattice energy. The smaller the ionic radii of the cation and anion, the more exothermic the lattice energy

### Standard Enthalpy Change of hydration, \(\Delta H^{*}_{hyd}\)

_Note:_

Hydration process is always exothermic because it is a bond forming process.

The standard enthalpy change of hydration is the _energy_ released when _one_ mole of gaseous ions is hydrated to form an infinitely dilute solution at 298 K and 1 bar.

E.g. Na*(g) + aq \(\longrightarrow\) Na*(aq) \(\Delta H^{*}_{hyd}\)(Na*) = -390 kJ mol-1 C f(g) +aq \(\longrightarrow\) C f(aq) \(\Delta H^{*}_{hyd}\)(C f) = -381 kJ mol-1 Assuming that the number of water molecules interacting with an ion is the same,

The higher the \(|\frac{charge\ of\ ion}{lonic\ radius}|\) ratio or charge density,

stronger the ion-dipole interactions between the ions and water molecules,

larger the magnitude of \(\Delta H^{*}_{hyd}\) value,

more exothermic the \(\Delta H^{*}_{hyd}\).

### Standard Enthalpy Change of solution, \(\Delta H^{*}_{sol}\)

The standard enthalpy change of solution is the _energy_ change when _one_ mole of substance is _completely dissolved_ in a solvent to form an indefinitely dilute solution at 298 K and 1 bar.

E.g. NaC(s) + aq \(\longrightarrow\) Na*(aq) + C f(aq) \(\Delta H^{*}_{sol}\)(NaC f) = +5 kJ mol-1 E.g. LiC(s) + aq \(\longrightarrow\) Li*(aq) + C f(aq) \(\Delta H^{*}_{sol}\)(LiC f) = -32 kJ mol-1

**Checkpoint 2**

Write thermochemical equations that represents the following standard enthalpy changes.

State whether \(\Delta H\) is < 0, > 0 or depends on considering the energy absorbed to overcome chemical bonds and energy released from forming chemical bonds.

(a) standard enthalpy change of combustion of CO

(b) standard enthalpy change of formation of C2H3OH(_f_)

(c) standard enthalpy change of neutralisation between HC f and NaOH.

(d) standard enthalpy change of reaction for 1 mole of H2SO4 when it reacts with excess NaOH.

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:12]

* units: J or kJ

Calorimetry is thus the measurement of \(\Delta T\) so that heat change can be deduced.

A calorimeter is a well-insulated vessel in which a chemical reaction is carried out. It is insulated to minimise heat exchange between the reaction system and the surrounding air so that the heat change for the reaction can be measured accurately.

* **General steps to determine enthalpy change of a reaction by calorimetry:**

For reaction between reactants **A** and **B**,

* Known quantities of **A** and **B** are added into a polystyrene cup and stirred.
* Temperature change, \(\Delta T\), of the reaction mixture is measured.
* When the reaction is exothermic:
* \(\Delta H=-\)ve \(\equiv\) heat is released by the reaction \(\equiv\) Surrounding temp \(\Delta\) (\(\Delta T=+\)ve)

When the reaction is endothermic:
* \(\Delta H=+\)ve \(\equiv\) heat is absorbed by the reaction \(\equiv\) Surrounding temp \(\Delta\) (\(\Delta T=-\)ve)

The enthalpy change can then be determined using the following equations:

* **Note:**
* 1 \({}^{\circ}\)C change = 1 K change where.
* **\(m\) -** mass of solution in g (ignore mass of any solid added)
* initial temp)
* \(n\) -** amount of specific substance (as per definition in Section 2) (e.g. For \(\Delta H\), \(n\) is the amount of substance burnt.) (e.g. For \(\Delta H\), \(n\) is the amount of water formed.) (e.g. For \(\Delta H\), \(n\) is the amount of ionic compound dissolved.)
* **Note:**
* Specific heat capacity of solution, defined as the amount of heat required to raise the temperature of 1 g of solution by 1 K. Unit is J g-1 \({}^{\circ}\)K-1 or J g-1 \({}^{\circ}\)C-1.
* **\(C^{-1}\) is given in the Data Booklet**The enthalpy change of reaction, which is dependent on the stoichiometry of the balanced equation, is determined using the following equations:

\[\Delta H_{\text{r}}=-\frac{mcAT}{n_{limiting reagent}}\times coefficient\;of\;limiting\; reagent\]

* Enthalpy changes that cannot be measured by calorimetry can be obtained indirectly by applying Hess' Law (See Section 3.2).

Assumptions made in calorimetry experiments:

1. There is negligible heat loss to the surrounding as the calorimeter is well-insulated.
2. The density of the solution, unless otherwise stated, is the same as that of water, at 1.00 g cm\({}^{-3}\). This is a reasonable assumption when the solution is dilute.
3. The specific heat capacity of the solution, unless otherwise stated, is the same as that of water, at 4.18 J g\({}^{-1}\) K\({}^{-1}\) or 4.18 J g\({}^{-1}\)\({}^{-1}\).

Method to account for heat exchange with the surrounding in calorimetry experiments:

\begin{tabular}{|p{142.3pt}|p{142.3pt}|} \hline
1. & Mixing of reactants occurs at 3 minutes. \\
2. & Temperature rises due to heat released from reaction. \\
3. & When reaction ends, cooling occurs as no more heat is released by the reaction, but heat is slowly lost to the surrounding air. \\
4. & Extrapolation of graph after maxima to the time of mixing gives \(T_{\text{max}}\). \\
5. & Calculate \(\Delta\)T where \(\Delta\)T = \(T_{\text{max}}-T_{\text{i}}\) \\
6. & Use the \(\Delta\)T to calculate heat change and \(\Delta\)H. \\ \hline \end{tabular}

1. Mixing of reactants occurs at 4.5 minutes.
2. Temperature drops due to heat absorbed by reaction.
3. When reaction ends, temperature starts to rise as no more heat is absorbed by the reaction, but heat is gained slowly from the surrounding air.
4. & Extrapolation of graph after minima to the time of mixing gives \(T_{\text{min}}\). \\
5. & Calculate \(\Delta\)T where \(\Delta\)T = \(T_{\text{min}}-T_{\text{i}}\) \\
6. & Use the \(\Delta\)T to calculate heat change and \(\Delta\)H. \\ \hline \end{tabular}

#### 3.1.2 Determination of enthalpy change of combustion of liquid fuel using calorimetry

A spirit burner containing liquid fuel is used. Weighing the spirit burner before and after burning gives the mass of fuel used for combustion.

A known volume of water is placed in a copper calorimeter and its temperature taken.

The wick is lighted and the water in the calorimeter is stirred with the thermometer. When the temperature has risen by about 10 "C, the flame is put out and the spirit burner is reweighed immediately.

The experimental value obtained for the enthalpy change of combustion of methanol using the above setup is **less exothermic** (**smaller** in **magnitude**) than the actual (true) value due to the following reasons:

\begin{tabular}{|p{113.8pt}|p{113.8pt}|} \hline Reasons & Effect on \(\Delta H_{\text{c}}\left(\propto\frac{mc\Delta T}{n_{\text{rewhatance burst}}}\right)\) \\ \hline The assumption that methanol undergoes complete combustion to form CO\({}_{2}\) and H\({}_{2}\)O may not always be true. & \\ When inadequate oxygen is supplied, some methanol undergoes incomplete combustion to form carbon monoxide or carbon (soot). & \\ Thus, for the same mass of fuel burnt, less energy is released. & \(\Delta T\) measured will be smaller than expected and thus the magnitude of \(\Delta H_{\text{c}}\) calculated is smaller than actual. \\ \hline \end{tabular}

Significant amount of heat is lost to the surrounding air from the spirit lamp flame.

Some heat is also absorbed by the copper calorimeter.

Difference in the mass of methanol and spirit burner before and after combustion # mass of methanol burnt.

Evaporation of volatile methanol from the hot spirit burner cause additional loss in mass.

Burning of wick can also cause additional mass loss after combustion.

Mass of methanol burnt recorded is larger than the actual mass burnt.

Heat change is divided by a larger than expected amount of methanol, resulting in a smaller magnitude of \(\Delta H_{\text{c}}\) calculated.

_Note:_

There is no need to determine the limiting agent in a combustion reaction. By definition, combustion has to be carried out under excess oxygen.

_Note:_

Do not use the mass of the methanol being burnt in _heat change = mc\(\Delta\)T._

The above set-up was used to determine the enthalpy change of combustion of methanol, CHsOH. The following results were obtained:

The enthalpy change of combustion is the _heat released_ when _one mole of a substance is completely burnt_ in excess oxygen.

#### 3.1.3 Determination of enthalpy change of combustion using heat capacity of calorimeter

A bomb calorimeter can be used to determine enthalpy change of combustion more accurately.

**a.**: The fuel is placed in the crucible and the "bomb" filled with oxygen at a high pressure. High pressure of oxygen is used so that sufficient amount of oxygen is supplied for complete combustion to take place.
**b.**: The "bomb" is then placed in an insulated calorimeter containing a known mass of water.
**c.**: The fuel is ignited by an electric current and the temperature change of the water heated up by the combustion reaction is measured.
**d.**: To eliminate heat losses to the surroundings, the calorimeter is placed in controlled temperature water jacket, whose temperature is raised with an electric heater so that it continuously matches the temperature of the water in the calorimeter.
**e.**: \(\Delta H=-\frac{\mathit{CAT}}{n}\), where heat capacity (C) of calorimeter, is defined as the amount of heat required to raise the temperature of **both the water and the reaction vessel** by 1 K. Unit is J K\({}^{-1}\) or J "C\({}^{-1}\).
**f.**: The heat capacity (C) of the calorimeter is first calibrated by calculating the theoretical amount of heat energy required, from combustion of benzoic acid (\(\Delta H_{e}^{2}=-3230\)kJ mol\({}^{-1}\)), to raise the calorimeter by 1K.
**g.**: The resulting enthalpy change of combustion values obtained experimentally by this method is found to be highly accurate.

_Work Example 6a [N2017/ll/6(b)(iii)-modified]_

A chemist burned a sample of benzoic acid in the bomb calorimeter so that the heat capacity of the calorimeter could be determined. The results are shown in the table below.

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|} \hline mass of benzoic acid/ q & initial temperature/ \({}^{\circ}\)C & highest temperature/ \({}^{\circ}\)C \\ \hline
6.10 & 25.0 & 54.7 \\ \hline \end{tabular}

The reference value for the energy change of combustion of benzoic acid is -3230 kJ mol\({}^{-1}\).

Calculate the heat capacity of the calorimeter from appropriate data in the table above. State its units.

Assume that all the energy released from the combustion process is converted into heat and none is lost to the surroundings.

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|} \hline \(\Delta H=-\frac{c\Delta r}{n}\) & \(-3230\) = \(-\frac{C(54.7-25.0)}{0.0500}\) \\ \(C=5.38\) kJ \({}^{\circ}\)C\({}^{-1}\) & \\ \hline \end{tabular}

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|} \hline Limitations of the spirit burner (pg 19) & How does a bomb calorimeter overcome the limitations and accurately determine \(\Delta H_{b}\)? \\ \hline \end{tabular}

The controlled temperature water jacket ensures that there is no temperature gradient between the water jacket and the water in the steel 'bomb'. As there is no temperature gradient, there is no heat transferred and hence, no heat loss to the surrounding.

An experiment was carried out as follow to determine the standard enthalpy change of combustion of butane (C\({}_{4}\)H\({}_{10}\)) contained in the gas cylinder of a camping gas stove.

A large beaker of water was placed on the stove and heated by combusting butane completely in excess oxygen. The temperature rise was recorded. The cylinder was weighed before and after the experiment to determine the mass of gas used. The following results were obtained.

\begin{tabular}{|l|c|} \hline mass of butane used/ g & 3.4 \\ \hline mass of water heated/ g & 500 \\ \hline temperature rise/ \({}^{\circ}\)C & 44 \\ \hline \end{tabular}
**(i)**: Write a thermochemical equation for the combustion of butane.

\[\text{C}_{4}\text{H}_{10}(\text{g})+\frac{13}{2}\text{O}_{2}(\text{g}) \longrightarrow 4\text{CO}_{2}(\text{g})+5\text{H}\text{O}(\text{I})\qquad\qquad \Delta H_{e}^{\circ}<0\]
**(ii)**: Use the data given to calculate the enthalpy change of combustion of butane.

\[\text{heat change}=m\text{$\Delta T$=(500)(4.18)(44)}=+91960\text{ J}\]

\[\text{amount of butane burnt}=\frac{mass\text{ of butane}}{M_{e}\text{ of butane}}=\frac{3.4}{4(12.0)+10(1.0)}=5.862\text{ x }10^{-2}\text{ mol}\]

\[\text{$\Delta H$=-\frac{m\text{$\Delta T$}}{m_{butane}}=-\frac{91960}{5.862 \times 10^{-2}}=-1570\text{ kJ mol}^{-1}$}\]
**(iii)**: The true value of \(\Delta H\) of butane is -2877 kJ mol\({}^{-1}\).

Suggest a reason for the difference in magnitude between this true value and your calculated value in **(ii)**.

Only a portion of heat released from combustion is absorbed by water. Some heat are lost to the surrounding air and the container.

OR

\[\text{Incomplete combustion has taken place, hence less heat is released from reaction.

\(\Delta T\) measured is lower than actual. \(\text{$\cdot$}\Delta H\) calculated is of smaller magnitude. (less exothermic)
**(iv)**: State one precaution you should observe when carrying out this experiment in order to get more accurate results.

Use a windshield to keep draught at bay so that there would be minimal heat loss from the flame.

Determine the heat capacity of the beaker and 500 g of water so that heat lost to the beaker can be accounted for.

### Indirect methods of determining enthalpy changes

**Success Criteria:**

* Construct an energy cycle and an energy level diagram from a given set of data.
* Calculate the enthalpy change of a reaction by applying Hess' Law with or without an energy cycle/ energy level diagram.
* \(\sum\ m\ \Delta H_{r}^{e}\) (reactants)
* Calculate enthalpy change of reaction involving simple covalent molecules using relevant bond energy data from Data Booklet. i.e. \(\Delta\ H_{r}^{e}=\ \sum\ BE\)(bonds broken) + \(\sum\ BE\)(bonds formed)
* bond energy from _Data Booklet_ being average values, and
- bonds involved in the reactions not in gaseous state.

The standard enthalpy changes of reactions which **cannot be determined by calorimetry** can be **calculated by applying Hess' Law**.

#### 3.2.1 Hess' Law

Using the principle of law of conservation of energy, Hess' law is derived. **Regardless of the route** by which the chemical change occurs from initial state A to final state C, the **overall energy change** is always the **same as long as the initial and final states are the same.

Two possible approaches when applying Hess' law:

(i) Drawing energy cycles or energy level diagrams.

(ii) Using mathematical formulae

6. Apply Hess' Law to calculate value for the unknown enthalpy change. & By Hess' law: \\  & -111 + \(\Delta H_{c}^{e}\) CO(g) = -393 \\  & : \(\Delta H_{c}^{e}\) CO(g) = -393 - (-111) = - 282 kJ mol\({}^{-1}\) \\ \hline \end{tabular}

When the values of **standard enthalpy change of formation** of the products and reactants are given, the following formula can be used:

\(H_{r}^{\bullet}=\sum n\Delta H_{f}^{\bullet}\) (products) - \(\sum m\Delta H_{f}^{\bullet}\) (reactants)

where \(n\) and \(m\) refer to the stoichiometric coefficients of the products and reactants respectively in the balanced chemical equation.

This formula can be derived and observed from the construction of the energy cycle or the energy level diagram in method **1a** and **1b** respectively.

This mathematical formula can be used if energy cycle is not required as part of working.

CO(g) + \(\gamma_{2}\)O\({}_{2}\)(g) CO(g) \(\Delta H_{c}^{\bullet}\) CO(g) =?

standard enthalpy change of formation of carbon dioxide

C(s) + O\({}_{2}\)(g) CO(g) \(\Delta H_{f}^{\bullet}\) CO\({}_{2}\)(g) = -393 kJ mol\({}^{-1}\)

standard enthalpy change of formation of carbon monoxide

C(s) + \(\gamma_{2}\)O\({}_{2}\)(g) CO(g) \(\Delta H_{f}^{\bullet}\) CO(g) = -111 kJ mol\({}^{-1}\)

\(\Delta H_{c}^{\bullet}\) CO(g) = \(\sum n\Delta H_{f}^{\bullet}\) (products) - \(\sum m\Delta H_{f}^{\bullet}\) (reactants)

\(\Delta H_{c}^{\bullet}\) CO(g) = [1 \(\times\Delta H_{f}^{\bullet}\) CO\({}_{2}\)(g)] - [1 \(\times\Delta H_{f}^{\bullet}\) CO(g)] = -393 - (-111) = -282 kJ mol\({}^{-1}\)

**Note:** If the question does not specify how the enthalpy is to be calculated, formula like this one or those discussed later can be used without drawing any energy cycle or energy level diagram.

However, if the question specifically requires the use of an energy cycle or energy level diagram, then they must be drawn out.

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:27]

When the values of **standard enthalpy change of combustion** of the products and reactants are given, the following formula can be used:

\[H_{r}^{\sigma}=\sum n\,\Delta H_{c}^{\sigma}\,\,\text{(reactants)}-\sum m\,\Delta H _{c}^{\sigma}\,\,\text{(products)}\]

where \(n\) and \(m\) refer to the stoichiometric coefficients of the products and reactants respectively in the balanced chemical equation.

This formula can be derived and observed from the construction of the energy cycle or the energy level diagram in method **1a** and **1b** respectively.

This mathematical formula can be used if energy cycle is not required as part of working.

\(2\)C(s) + \(3\)H\({}_{2}\)(g) + \(\frac{1}{2}\)O\({}_{2}\)(g) \(\longrightarrow\) C\({}_{2}\)H\({}_{c}\)OH(l) \(\Delta H_{r}^{\sigma}=?\)

\(H_{r}^{\sigma}=\sum n\,\Delta H_{c}^{\sigma}\,\,\text{(reactants)}-\sum m\,\Delta H _{c}^{\sigma}\,\,\text{(products)}\)

\(H_{r}^{\sigma}=[2\times\Delta H_{c}^{\sigma}\,\,\text{C(s)}+3\times\Delta H_{c }^{\sigma}\,\,\text{H}_{d}(g)]-[1\times\Delta H_{c}^{\sigma}\,\,\text{(C${}_{2}$H${}_{5}$OH(l)}]\)

\(=[2(-393)\,\,+3(-286)]-[-(1368)\)

\(=-276\) kJ mol\({}^{-1}\)

**Note:** There is no need to consider \(\Delta H_{c}^{\sigma}\,\,\text{O}_{2}\)(g) in the above calculation since oxygen gas is used in combustion and not combusted.

**Note:** If the bond energy is not given in the question, the data can be obtained from the _Data Booklet_.

**Method 1: By drawing energy cycle**

**Method 2: By using mathematical formulae given bond energy data**

When the values of **bond energies** of all the covalent bonds in the products and reactants are given (either in the question or in the _Data Booklet_), the following formula can be used:

\[\mbox{\bf\boldmath$H${}^{\mbox{\scriptsize e}}$}=\sum\mbox{\bf BE}\mbox{\bf of bonds broken in reactants -}\sum\mbox{\bf BE}\mbox{\bf of bonds formed in products}\]

This formula can be derived and observed from the construction of the energy cycle in method 1.

This mathematical formula can be used if energy cycle is not required as part of working.

**Note:** For this formula to be used, **all the reactants and products** in the chemical reaction has to be in **gaseous state**. This is because the definition of bond energy is based on covalent bonds broken in gaseous molecules.

### Magnitude of Lattice Energy

#### 4.2.1 Factors affecting the magnitude of lattice energy

The magnitude of lattice energy is affected by:

(i) product of charge on the ions (\(q\), x \(q\)-)

(ii) Interionic distance (\(r_{+}\), \(r\)) between the ions:

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|} \hline  & \(|L.E|\propto|\frac{q_{+}\times q_{-}}{r_{+}+r_{-}}|\) \\ where, & \(q_{+}=\) charge of cation \\  & \(q_{-}=\) charge of anion \\  & \(r_{+}=\) radius of cation \\  & \(r_{-}=\) radius of anion \\ \hline \end{tabular}

#### 4.2.2 Comparison of theoretical and experimental values of lattice energy (_L.E._)

* Theoretical values of lattice energy are calculated using the above formula.
* Experimental values of lattice energy are obtained using the Born-Haber cycle as \(\Delta H\) of the other stages in formation of the ionic solid can be experimentally determined.
* Generally, theoretical _L.E._ deviates experimental _L.E._
* Reason: Theoretical _L.E._ is calculated using a model where ions are assumed to be spherical. (i.e. electron cloud of ions are evenly distributed.) However, this model is not entirely true for a real ionic lattice.
* Percentage difference between the theoretical _L.E._ and experimental _L.E._ therefore serve as reflection of the extent a polarised ionic bond deviates from the model of spherical ions.

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|} \hline  & Theoretical Lattice Energy / kJ & Experimental Lattice Energy / kJ \\  & mol\({}^{-1}\) & mol\({}^{-1}\) \\ \hline NaCl\(I\) & \(-\)766 & \(-\)776 \\ \hline NaBr & \(-\)731 & \(-\)742 \\ \hline NaI & \(-\)686 & \(-\)699 \\ \hline AgC\(I\) & \(-\)768 & \(-\)890 \\ \hline AgBr & \(-\)759 & \(-\)877 \\ \hline AgI & \(-\)736 & \(-\)867 \\ \hline \end{tabular}

* From NaCl to NaI, their theoretical and experimental lattice energy values of are within a difference of 1-2%.
* From AgC\(I\) to AgI, the magnitude of their experimental lattice energy values is 15% greater than that of their theoretical lattice energy values.
* This shows that ions in AgC\(I\) to AgI compounds deviates more significantly from the model of spherical ions compared to ions in group 1 metal halides.

Reason:

The silver ion is an ion of a d block element. Such ions have a **greater polarising power** compared to the main group metal cations of the same charge because their nuclei are poorly shielded by the d electrons (To be learnt in Transition Elements).

Therefore for the same halide anion, Ag\({}^{+}\)**distorts the electron cloud of the anion to a **greater extent** compared to Na\({}^{+}\). Hence, the ions in silver halide deviate from the model of spherical ions by a larger extent.

### **Enthalpy changes involved in dissolution of an ionic compound**

The dissolution of an ionic compound (e.g. sodium chloride) is represented by the following equation:

\[\text{NaC(s) + aq }\longrightarrow\text{Na^{*}(aq) + C\emph{f}(aq)}\qquad\Delta H^{*}_{sol}=+5.0\text{ kJ mol^{-1}}\]

The following energy cycle shows an alternative route of dissolving ionic solid in water; a sequence of two theoretical processes where :
