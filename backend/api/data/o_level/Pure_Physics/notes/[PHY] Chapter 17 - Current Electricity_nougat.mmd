## 6. Current

In order words, the amount of charges flowing in the circuit per second.

### Visualisation

_The whole process of pitchau going around the circuit is really quick, in milliseconds._

_Furthermore, multiple pliochus can be released to go around the circuit at the same time._

_Current measures the number of pliochus going around the circuit every second!_

_Another analogy is_ **ERP**_. The amount of cars passing through the ERP per second, is the rate of flow of cars._

_Current is the rate of flow of charges!_
## Appendix A COMPLETE CIRCUIT

The amount of electrical energy the battery provides to each charge **depends on the amount of components** in the circuit.

So if there are 3 light bults, the battery must provide **sufficient energy** to the charge to go past all the components and be able to **complete a full circuit**.

This is also known as electromotive force, referring to how **much energy the source provides** to each charge.

### Potential Difference

Before the charge enters the component, it will possess a certain amount of electrical energy. After it passes through it, it will have a lesser amount of energy.

The **difference between before and after** is known as potential difference, referring to how **much electrical energy is consumed** per charge by the component.

Both emf & P.D have the same formula,

**emf = Work Done / Charge**

**P.D = Work Done / Charge**

But I prefer to remember it as,

**Voltage = Energy per Charge**

## Definition

Ohm's law states that a **current** through a metallic conductor is **directly proportional** to the **potential difference** across the ends of the conductor, provided the temperature and other physical conditions remain constant.

A resistor that has constant resistance is called an **ohmic conductor**.

We can check whether a resistor is ohmic by observing the I-V graph.
