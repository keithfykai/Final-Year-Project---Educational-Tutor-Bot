Diffusion

* Diffusion is the **net movement** of **molecules** from **a region of higher concentration** to a region of **lower concentration**, down a concentration gradient.
* it is a **passive process** as energy is not required
* When the molecules have reached **equilibrium** between the two regions, the concentrations are the same and there will be **no net movement** of molecules.

**ROLE OF DIFFUSION IN LIVING ORGANISMS**

* Its role in **nutrient uptake** and **gaseous exchange** in plants and humans
* Diffusion enables living organisms, unicellular or multicellular, to survive by allowing the exchange of nutrients such as glucose, amino acid and fats, gases such as oxygen and waste substances such as carbon dioxide and urea

* **diffusion is a extremely relevant concept in future chapters**Diffusion

FACTORS THAT AFFECT RATE OF DIFFUSION

1. Temperature

* 1 in temperature, 1 in kinetic energy of molecules

Slide A represents a steeper concentration gradient and will allow you (the molecules)

to move down faster

B

## 3 Size of molecules

* Heavier molecules move more slowly than light molecules

## 4 Diffusion distance

* Molecules do not have to travel far thus rate of diffusion is faster

## Effect of osmosis on animal cells

When an animal cells is immersed in a solution with a higher water potential relative to its cytoplasm,

Water moves into the cell by osmosis.

Animal cells **do not have cell walls** to protect the cells from overexpression. As more water enters the cell, it swells to such an extent that it **bursts**.

**CYTOLVSIS /** the cell is lysed

When an animal cell is immersed in a solution with a lower water potential, relative to its cytoplasm,

Water moves out of the cell by osmosis.

The cell shrinks and become dehydrated. In red blood cells, little spikes appear on the cell surface membrane.

**CRENATION /** the cell is created

## Chapter 5 Effect of osmosis on plant cells

When a plant cell is immersed in a **solution of higher water potential** relative to its cell sap,

Water molecules enter the cell by osmosis.

The vacuole increases in size

The cellulose cell wall of a plant cell is rigid and exerts an opposing pressure on the cell contents, preventing the entry of more water. This prevents the cell from overexpanding and bursting.

At this point, the plant cell is very **turgid. TURGOR PRESSURE** provides mechanical support for many non-woody plants

When a plant cell is immersed in a **solution with a lower water potential** relative to its cell sap,

Water moves out of the cell into the solution by osmosis.

The vacuole decreases in size and the cell is flaccid

If more water leaves the cell, the vacuole and cytoplasm shrink to such an extent that the **cell surface membrane pulls away from the cell wall**

**PLASMOLYSIS /** the cell is plasmolyse
