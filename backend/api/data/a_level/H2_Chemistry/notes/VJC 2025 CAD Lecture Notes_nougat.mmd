## 2 Physical Properties

### Boiling Point

* The lower members are liquids with pungent odours.
* Example: ethanoic acid (vinegar), butanoic acid (rancid butter, human sweat)

* **Fun Fact:** Body odour begins with secretions from the apocrine glands, located mostly in the armpits. Skin bacteria use these secretions to produce energy and waste products, among which is 3-methyl-2-hexenoic acid, CH3CH2CH2C(CH3)=CHCO2H, which is largely responsible for body odour. Each individual's sweat glands also produce a characteristic blend of carboxylic acids which can be detected by the sensitive nose of a dog.
* Boiling point **increases** with increasing molecular size and number of electrons per molecule (Recall: Molecular size increases with \(M_{\text{r}}\)).

* \(M_{\text{r}}\) **boiling point / \({}^{\circ}\)C*
* 60 118
* CH3CH(CH2)2CO2H 88 164
* **Carboxylic acids are **less volatile** (higher boiling point) than alcohols of similar \(M_{\text{r}}\).

* \(M_{\text{r}}\) **boiling point / \({}^{\circ}\)C*
* 60 118
* CH3CH(OH)CH3 60 97
* **Carboxylic acids form **stronger hydrogen bonding** than alcohols because the O-H bond is more polarised due to the presence of electron-withdrawing inductive C=O group.
* **Furthermore, carboxylic acid molecules **dimerise** in the liquid state and in non-polar solvents, forming two hydrogen bonds between each pair of molecules.

* **However, in polar solvents such as water, the molecules exist as monomers and dissociate to some extent into H**+ **and RCO2**- **.

_Strength of carboxylic acids_

Consider the dissociation of a weak acid HA: \(\quad\)HA\(\xleftarrow{\bf H}^{+}\) + A\({}^{-}\)

When **A**- is more stable, there is a **greater** tendency for HA to dissociate. HA would then be a **stronger** acid. Thus, the strength of the carboxylic acid RCO\({}_{2}\)H depends on the **stability of RCO\({}_{2}\)**- ion.

An **electron-withdrawing inductive group** in RCO\({}_{2}\)- reduces the electron density of the negative charge on the carboxylate anion by **charge dispersal**. This **stabilises** the RCO\({}_{2}\)- and **increases** the **strength** of the acid.

An **electron-donating inductive group** does the reverse.

\(\bullet\)_pK\({}_{a}\) of some carboxylic acids_

\begin{tabular}{|c c|c c|} \hline
**formula** & _pK\({}_{a}\)_ & **formula** & _pK\({}_{a}\)_ \\ \hline HCO\({}_{2}\)H & 3.75 & C/CH\({}_{2}\)CO\({}_{2}\)H & 2.86 \\ CH\({}_{3}\)CO\({}_{2}\)H & 4.76 & C\(l_{2}\)CHCO\({}_{2}\)H & 1.29 \\ CH\({}_{3}\)CH\({}_{2}\)CO\({}_{2}\)H & 4.82 & C\(l_{3}\)CCO\({}_{2}\)H & 0.65 \\ CH\({}_{3}\)CH\({}_{2}\)CH\({}_{2}\)CO\({}_{2}\)H & 4.87 & FCH\({}_{2}\)CO\({}_{2}\)H & 2.60 \\ C\({}_{6}\)H\({}_{5}\)CO\({}_{2}\)H & 4.20 & N=CCH\({}_{2}\)CO\({}_{2}\)H & 2.50 \\ \hline \end{tabular}

Recall:

\(\bullet\) smaller _pK\({}_{a}\)\(\Rightarrow\)_ larger _K\({}_{a}\)\(\Rightarrow\)_ greater extent of acid dissociation \(\Rightarrow\) stronger acid

We need Example 1.

Why are carboxylic acids stronger acids than alcohols in general?

**Answer**:

RCO\({}_{2}\)H\(\xleftarrow{\bf H}^{+}\) + RCO\({}_{2}\)- --- (1)

ROH\(\xleftarrow{\bf H}^{+}\) + RO\({}^{-}\) --- (2)

In RCO\({}_{2}\)- ion, the.................. in the \(-\)CO\({}_{2}\)- group.................. with one another, allowing delocalisation and resulting in RCO\({}_{2}\)- ion having a.................. structure. This helps to disperse the negative charge on the O atom, hence.................. the RCO\({}_{2}\)- ion and.................. the strength of the acid RCO\({}_{2}\)H.

The RO- ion is.................. by.................. inductive effect of the **R** group, which causes the negative charge to be..................

The first equilibrium position lies greater to the.................. compared to the second.

Hence, RCO\({}_{2}\)H is a.................. acid than ROH.

**VICT2 Example 2**

Arrange the following carboxylic acids in order of increasing acid strength.

**I** butanoic acid CH3CH2CH2CO2H

**II** 2-chlorobutanoic acid CH3CH2CH2CH2H

**III** 2-bromobutanoic acid CH3CH2CH2HCO2H

**IV** 3-bromobutanoic acid CH3CH2CH2CO2H

Answer:

The more stable the **RCO2**, the greater the extent of acid dissociation and the stronger the acid.

Since the electronegative C_I_ and Br exert **electron-withdrawing inductive effect**, the corresponding RCO2 is stabilised by charge dispersal. Since C_I_ is **more electronegative**, CH3CH2CH2CH2CO2 is more stable than CH3CH2CH2HCO2.

Between CH3CH2CH2CH2HrCO2 and CH3CH2CH2CO2, CH3CH2CH2HrCO2 is more stabilised since the electron-withdrawing group is **closer** to the negative charge on the carboxylate ion.

Hence, the carboxylic acids in increasing acid strength:

**3** Laboratory Preparation

Students should be able to

_a)_ _Describe the formation of carboxylic acids from alcohols, aldehydes and nitriles_

### Oxidation of Primary Alcohols and Aldehydes

**Oxidation of primary (1o) alcohol to carboxylic acid**

Type of reaction: **Oxidation**

Reagents and conditions: K2Cr2O7(aq), H2SO4(aq), heat under reflux

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:8]

* The characteristic chemical behaviour of carboxylic acids is determined by the functional group, -CO\({}_{2}\)H.
* The C=O and -OH groups of the carboxyl group are in such close proximity that they modify each other's properties. Hence, carboxylic acids **do not** behave exactly like carbonyl compounds or alcohols.
* The reactions of carboxylic acids almost invariably involve the -OH group, which either undergoes the **loss of a proton** (acts as an acid) or is **substituted** by another atom or group; but does so in a way that is possible only because of the effect of the C=O group.
* The C=O group in carboxylic acids **does not** undergo **addition** reactions, e.g. with HCN, which are characteristic of aldehydes and ketones.

_Reason:_

**Lone pair of electrons** in p orbital in O of hydroxyl group interacts with the p orbital of the carbonyl C atom. This results in an increase in **delocalisation of electrons** and greater stability. This stability would be lost if a reagent is added the carbonyl group. Thus, carboxylic acids are more resistant to addition than aldehydes and ketones.

### Salt Formation (as an acid)

**Formation of carboxylate salt from carboxylic acid**

Type of reaction: **redox** (for Na) or neutralisation (for NaOH, NaHCO\({}_{3}\) & Na\({}_{2}\)CO\({}_{3}\))

Reagents and conditions: **Na or NaOH or NaHCO\({}_{3}\) or Na\({}_{2}\)CO\({}_{3}\)**

* Carboxylic acids react with carbonates and hydrogen carbonates to liberate CO\({}_{2}\). This **distinguishes** them **from phenols and alcohols**, which are unable to do so.
* Reaction with Na\({}_{2}\)CO\({}_{3}\) or NaHCO\({}_{3}\) is a **test for RCO\({}_{2}\)H**.

**Effervescence of CO\({}_{2}\)** is observed, which gives a **white precipitate** with limewater.

### Condensation to form Ester

**Condensation of carboxylic acid with alcohol to form ester**

Type of Reaction: **Condensation**

Reagents and conditions: R'OH with concentrated H\({}_{2}\)SO\({}_{4}\) as catalyst, heat

_(RECALL!: A condensation reaction is a reaction in which two molecules combine to form a single molecule with loss of a small molecule such as H\({}_{2}\)O, HCl etc.)_

e.g. CH\({}_{3}\)CO\({}_{2}\)H + CH\({}_{3}\)OH + CH\({}_{3}\)CO\({}_{2}\)CH\({}_{3}\) + H\({}_{2}\)O

e.g. CH\({}_{3}\)CO\({}_{2}\)H + CH\({}_{3}\)CH\({}_{2}\)CH\({}_{2}\)OH + CH\({}_{3}\)CO\({}_{2}\)CH\({}_{2}\)CH\({}_{2}\)CH\({}_{3}\) + H\({}_{2}\)O

_prop-1-ol_

_prop-1-yl ethanoate_

**Note:**

* The reaction is **reversible** as water can act as a nucleophile to attack the electron-deficient carbonyl carbon in the ester and reform the carboxylic acid.
* Notice that the **O** in the **R'OH** remained with the alkoxy part of the ester, while the O in the H\({}_{2}\)O originated from the RCO\({}_{2}\)H.
* Concentrated H\({}_{2}\)SO\({}_{4}\) is used as a **cataly** to speed up the reaction. It also acts as a dehydrating agent by removing H\({}_{2}\)O from the equilibrium and thereby shifting the position of equilibrium to the right to result in a greater yield of the ester.

### Conversion to Acyl Chlorides

**Conversion of carboxylic acid to acyl chloride**

Type of Reaction: **Nucleophilic (acyl) substitution**

Reagents and conditions: **SOC\(l_{2}\)**, heat**

_or_ **PCI\({}_{3}\)**, heat**

_or_ **PCI\({}_{5}\)**

**Note: White fumes of HC\(l\) is observed for SOC\(l_{2}\) and PCI\({}_{5}\). The reaction with SOC\(l_{2}\) is especially convenient ('cleaner') as the other two products are both gaseous and are easily removed from the reaction mixture.**

### Reduction to Primary Alcohols

**Reduction of carboxylic acid to primary (1\({}^{\circ}\)) alcohol**

Type of Reaction: **Reduction**

Reagents and conditions: **LiA/H\({}_{4}\)** in dry ether**

* **Note: Primary alcohols and aldehydes can be oxidised to carboxylic acids, but carboxylic acids can only be reduced back to primary alcohols and not aldehydes.*** Reduction is **more difficult** compared to aldehydes and ketones. Hence, catalytic hydrogenation (i.e. H\({}_{2}\) with Ni or Pt/Pd catalyst) and NaBH\({}_{4}\) in ethanol **does not** reduce RCO\({}_{2}\)H but it can reduce aldehydes and ketones. E.g. using NaBH\({}_{4}\) in ethanol, C\({}_{6}\)H\({}_{5}\)CH\({}_{2}\)**COCH\({}_{2}\)CO\({}_{2}\)H + 2[H]**\(\rightarrow\) C\({}_{6}\)H\({}_{5}\)CH\({}_{2}\)**CH**(OH)CH\({}_{2}\)**CO\({}_{2}\)H**
* Considering LiA/H\({}_{4}\) and NaBH\({}_{4}\) as the sources of the hydride anion, H-, LiA/H\({}_{4}\) is the stronger reducing agent of the two. This is due to the larger electronegativity difference between the H and the A\(I\) (as compared to between H and B), making the H more electron rich.

**Word Example 4**

Identify the organic product of the reaction between LiA/H\({}_{4}\) in dry ether and each of the following organic compounds.

### Decarboxylation to Alkanes

**Decarboxylation of carboxylic acid to alkane**

Type of Reaction: **Decarboxylation**

Reagents and conditions: **soda lime, heat**

_(soda lime (CaO/NaOH mixture) behaves chemically like NaOH)_

Step 1: RCO\({}_{2}\)H + NaOH \(\rightarrow\) RCO\({}_{2}\)-Na\({}^{*}\) + H\({}_{2}\)O

Step 2: RCO\({}_{2}\)-Na\({}^{*}\) + NaOH \(\rightarrow\) RH + Na\({}_{2}\)CO\({}_{3}\)

Overall: RCO\({}_{2}\)H + 2NaOH \(\rightarrow\) RH + Na\({}_{2}\)CO\({}_{3}\) + H\({}_{2}\)O

## 2 Physical Properties

### Boiling Point

* Acyl chlorides and esters **do not form intermolecular hydrogen bonds** as they lack a hydrogen atom attached directly to a highly electronegative oxygen atom. These **polar** molecules attract each other by weaker **permanent dipole-permanent dipole interactions**. Hence, they have lower boiling points, i.e. are more volatile, than the parent carboxylic acids.
* Amides have a -NH\({}_{2}\) group and possess a high degree of **intermolecular hydrogen bonding**. They have higher boiling points, i.e. are less volatile, than the other acid derivatives and exist as solids at room temperature.

### Solubility

* As a result of hydrogen bonding, lower amides are fairly soluble in water and virtually insoluble in hydrocarbon solvents.
* For esters, their solubility varies with the R groups. Generally, they have lower solubility in water than amides since they can form less extensive hydrogen bonds with water.
* For acyl chlorides, we do not mention solubility as it is very reactive in water.

## 3 Reactions

* Much of the chemistry of the acid derivatives involves the **conversion** from one into another, and into the parent carboxylic acid.
* These reactions typically proceed via **nucleophilic (acyl) substitution** at the carbonyl C atom.
* This type of reaction occurs readily because of the \(\delta\)+ on the carbonyl C atom, which attracts nucleophiles and the presence of good leaving group **Y**.

The **Y** group is replaced by a nucleophilic :**Z**, where **Y** = OH (carboxylic acid), OR' (ester), _CI_ (acyl chloride), NH\({}_{2}\) (amide).

### _Esters_

* Many esters occur naturally. Those of low molecular weight are fairly volatile, and many have pleasant odours.
* Esters often form a significant fraction of the fragrant oils of fruits and flowers. Hence, they are widely used in the food and perfumery industries.

**Fun Fact:** Simple esters such as 3-methylbutylethanoneoate can be used to give 'artificial' fruit-like aromas (banana in this case) in food. Natural aromas are usually far more complex. The natural aroma of an orange, for example, was found to contain 30 different esters, 10 carboxylic acids, 34 alcohols, 34 aldehydes and ketones, and 36 hydrocarbons!

#### 3.1.1 Hydrolysis

Students should be able to

_h)_ _Describe the acid and base hydrolysis of esters_

* The hydrolysis of esters by boiling with water alone occurs very slowly. This hydrolysis can be sped up by heating under reflux with aqueous acid or alkali.

**Acid hydrolysis of ester to form carboxylic acid**

Reagents and conditions: **H\({}_{2}\)SO\({}_{4}\)(aq)**, **heat**

_Acid hydrolysis is **reversible**.

**Base hydrolysis of ester to form carboxylate salt**

Reagents and conditions: **NaOH(aq)**, **heat**

During base hydrolysis, the carboxylic acid is obtained as its **salt**. The reaction is essentially **irreversible**, since a resonance-stabilised carboxylate anion shows little tendency to react with an alcohol.

**Fun Fact:** Alkalaine hydrolysis is often referred to as saponification (derived from the French word'sapon', meaning soap). Soap is made by the base hydrolysis of fats and oils.

### Acyl Chlorides

* Acyl chlorides are usually liquids that fume in moist air. Acyl chlorides are extremely reactive and open to attack by nucleophiles.

#### 3.2.1 Hydrolysis

Students should be able to

\(d\) _describe the hydrolysis of acyl chlorides_

\(f\) _explain the relative ease of hydrolysis of acyl chlorides, alkyl chlorides and aryl chlorides_

**Hydrolysis of acyl chloride to carboxylic acid**

Type of reaction: **Hydrolysis**

Reagents and conditions: H\({}_{2}\)O

\(\bullet\)

Acyl chlorides are hydrolys on contact with **water** at **room temperature**, giving white fumes of hydrogen chloride.

With cold water, ethanolyl chloride **reacts vigorously** but benzoyl chloride reacts only **slowly**.

Note: This is a nucleophilic substitution reaction where water is the nucleophile. It is better known as hydrolysis to be more specific.

* **Ease of Hydrolysis:**

**RCOC/ > RCH\({}_{2}\)C/ > C\(I\)**

* In RCOC/ (acyl chloride), the carbonyl C atom is **highly electron deficient** due to the **electron-withdrawing inductive effect** of the highly electronegative O atom, together with the C\(I\) atom, making it more susceptible to nucleophilic attack than RCH\({}_{2}\)C\(I\) (alkyl chloride) and C\({}_{6}\)H\({}_{5}\)C\(I\) (aryl chloride).
