## 6 Magnetism

### INDUCED MAGNETISM

When a piece of unmagnetised magnetic material touches or is brought near to the pole of a permanent magnet, it becomes a magnet itself.

This explains why a magnet can attract an unmagnetised magnetic material as the material becomes an induced magnet.

The end nearer the original magnet has an opposite polarity to the magnet and possesses induced magnetism to attract magnetic objects.

The strength of magnetism decreases as distance from the magnet increases.

*-Alternating current in a solenoid - Heating - HammeringMAGNETIC FIELD

MAGNETIC FIELD

Magnetic field is a region where a magnet will experience a magnetic force.

**Topics:**

- Magnetic field lines must never intersect or originate from the same point

- Closer magnetic field lines means the region's magnetic field strength is stronger

## Magnetic Effect of a Solenoid

Magnetic field is stronger in the region inside the solenoid as the field lines in the region inside the solenoid are parallel. (has same strength along most of the inner part of the solenoid)

Magnetic field lines outside the solenoid are similar to those of a bar magnet because the solenoid has poles.

To determine the polarity of the solenoid, use the **right hand grip rule**.

## CIRCUT BREAKER

Device designed to switch off the current in a circuit when the current exceeds a certain value.

When current is too high, electromagnet will be strong sufficiently magnetised to attract the contact. This will break the circuit.

Spring will then pull the springy metal to the right and separate the contacts to stop the current from flowing.

After the fault is repaired; the contacts can be pushed back by pressing the reset button on the outside of the circuit breaker box.

Magnetic Relay

A magnetic relay uses an electromagnet in one circuit to switch on another circuit.

A small current in the first circuit can be used to control a second circuit that requires a large current.

How it works

1) The first circuit is a simple electromagnet which requires only a small current.

2) The current flows and magnetise the soft iron core to attract the soft iron armature.

3) The top end of the armature is raised as it swings about the pivot, closing the switch contacts of the second circuit.

4) When the switch for the first circuit is open, the soft iron core is demagnetised and the armature will return to its original position.

This device enables circuits to be constructed more efficiently. Furthermore, it can also be attached to thermistors or LDRs which can run on low current.
