Electrochemistry is the study of interactions between chemical changes and flow of electrons.

There are two types of cells:

Electrochemical cells (or Galvanic / Voltaic cells)

chemical reaction - flow of electrons converts chemical energy from a spontaneous reaction to generate electrical energy

Note that in electrochemistry, we are dealing with **redox reactions**.

## II Electrode Potentials & Electrochemical Cells

The tendency of a substance to be oxidised or reduced can be measured by its **electrode potential**.

### (A) Electrode Potentials

When a metal rod (called the electrode) is dipped into a solution containing ions, M\({}^{n+}\), of the same metal (M), two possible electron transfer reactions can occur: oxidation and reduction

When the rates of oxidation and reduction are equal, **dynamic equilibrium** is established. At this point, there will be a constant negative charge on the metal, and a constant number of ions present in the solution around the metal.

This leaves a surplus of electrons on the metal rod and thus a **negative** charge on the Zn electrode. The negatively charged electrode attracts a layer of positive ions on the metal surface. This results in a separation of charges across the metal-solution interface, creating a **potential difference** between the metal and the solution. This potential difference is known as the absolute **electrode potential**, **E** of the metal.

### For metals that are less reactive (i.e. more readily reduced) e.g Cu

Position of **equilibrium lies more to the right**, meaning that the M\({}^{n+}\) ions in the solution tend to gain electrons from the metal rod and are thus deposited as metal atoms on the electrode. This results in a net deficit of electrons on the copper rod and thus a **positive** charge on the electrode.

### (B) Half-Cells

An electrochemical cell consists of two half-cells.

Half-cells are systems in which the oxidised state is in _equilibrium_ with the reduced state.

oxidised form + ne- reduced form

There are **three main types** of half-cells:

1 Metal and its ion Half-cell

e.g. Zn\({}^{2+}\)(aq) \(|\) Zn(s) half-cell

Zn\({}^{2+}\)(aq) + 2e- Zn(s)

The solid Zn metal acts as the electrode when dipped in a solution containing its ions.

An inert electrode (e.g. platinum electrode) dipped in a solution containing _CI\({}^{-}\)_ ions will develop an electrode potential when gaseous _CI\({}_{2}\)_ is bubbled into the solution.

Fe\({}^{3+}\)(aq) + e\({}^{-}\) Fe\({}^{2+}\)(aq)

It consists of an inert electrode (e.g. Pt) dipped into a solution containing ions of the same element in two different oxidation states.

Note: Platinum (Pt) is usually used as the **inert electrode** in half-cells that do not contain a metal.

**Reference half-cell: The Standard Hydrogen Electrode** (i.e. the H+/H\({}_{2}\) half-cell under standard conditions)

The electrode potential of half-cells are measured against a **reference half-cell** such as the **Standard Hydrogen Electrode.**

The Standard Hydrogen Electrode is arbitrary assigned a potential of **0.00 V** since the absolute electrode potential of H+/H\({}_{2}\) half-cell, like any other half-cell, cannot be determined.

It consists of an inert **platinum electrode** (coated with finely divided platinum) dipped into an aqueous solution of H+ ions at **1 mol dm\({}^{-3}\)**, with hydrogen gas bubbling in at a pressure of **1 bar** and **298 K**.

**H\({}_{2}\)(g) at 1 bar and 298 K**

**Diagram for standard hydrogen electrode (S.H.E.).**

Note: It is **not** possible to measure the absolute electrode potential (with a voltmeter) across the metal-solution interface in a half-cell because it is too narrow for viable electrical contacts to be made.

Hence, a way to overcome this problem is to connect the half-cell with a reference half-cell (i.e. Standard Hydrogen Electrode) to measure the potential difference between the two electrodes. This potential difference is known as the Standard Electrode Potential, (\(E^{\bullet}\)).

Note: The standard hydrogen electrode (S.H.E.) is the most commonly quoted reference half-cell. Other reference half-cells also exist e.g. Ag/AgCl half-cell (\(E^{\bullet}\) = +0.199 V) and calomel Hg/Hg\({}_{2}\)Cl\({}_{2}\) half-cell (\(E^{\bullet}\) = +0.244 V)

**(C) Standard Electrode (or Redox) Potentials, (\(E^{\bullet}\))**

_Definition_

The **standard electrode potential**, \(E^{\bullet}\), of a half-cell is defined as the potential difference between a **standard hydrogen electrode** and the **half-cell** in which the reacting species in the solution are at molar concentrations of **1 mol dm\({}^{-3}\)**, **298 K** and gaseous species at pressure of **1 bar**.

Note that the standard electrode potentials are measured under **standard conditions**.

Standard conditions are:

* temperature of **298 K** (or 25 \({}^{\circ}\)C)
* concentration of **1 mol dm\({}^{-3}\)** for **all** aqueous solutions
* pressure (if gases are involved) of **1 bar**
* **platinum** as the electrode when the half-cell system does not contain a metalWhy is it necessary to use standard conditions in measuring electrode potential?The electrode potential for a half-cell reaction can be affected by: nature of the element, concentration of ions in solution, temperature, pressure of gases (if any)We will elaborate further about the effects under section (G) Non-standard conditions.

### (D) Measuring standard electrode (or redox) potentials (E\({}^{\textbf{p}}\))

When a half-cell is connected to the standard hydrogen electrode (S.H.E.), electrons flow spontaneously from one electrode to the other due to the potential difference established between the two electrodes.

The standard electrode potential values of some half-cells are listed in the _Data Booklet_. Note that these values are measured against the standard hydrogen electrode and under standard conditions.

### Significance of electrode potential values

Electrode (or redox) potential of half-cells is a measure of how favourable the reduction process is.

All half-cell reactions (given in the _Data Booklet_) are written in the following format, with electrons on the left (i.e. with reduction as the forward reaction).

\[\textbf{oxidised form + ne}\]

\[\textbf{reduced form}\]

\[\textbf{E}^{\textbf{p}}\]

= standard electrode potentialStandard electrode potential, \[\textbf{E}^{\textbf{p}}\]

, may be positive or negative, depending on the position of equilibrium of the half-cell.

\[\bullet\]

The **more positive** the electrode potential \[\textbf{E}^{\textbf{p}}\]

, the **more likely reduction** will occur.

\[\bullet\]

The **more negative** the electrode potential \[\textbf{E}^{\textbf{p}}\]

, the **more likely oxidation** will occur.

\[\bullet\]

e.g. \[\text{Cu}^{2+}\text{(aq) + 2e}^{-}\]

\[\text{Cu(s)}\]

\[\textbf{E}^{\textbf{p}}\]

 = +0.34 V \[\text{Zn}^{2+}\text{(aq) + 2e}^{-}\]

\[\textbf{Zn}\text{(s)}\]

\[\textbf{E}^{\textbf{p}}\]

 = -0.76 V

It is easier to reduce Cu\({}^{2+}\) ions to Cu atoms than it is to reduce Zn\({}^{2+}\) ions to Zn atoms. Conversely, it is easier to oxidise Zn atoms to Zn\({}^{2+}\) ions than it is to oxidise Cu atoms to Cu\({}^{2+}\) ions.

How to measure standard electrode potentials, \(\textbf{E}^{\textbf{p}}\), of half-cells experimentally?

(Note that you need to learn to describe the method, and draw a diagram, to show how electrode potentials are measured.)

Method

1. Set up an **electrochemical cell** consisting of the given half-cell (e.g. M\({}^{n+}\)(aq)/M(s) and the standard hydrogen electrode (S.H.E.) as shown below under standard conditions (i.e. concentrations of all solutions = 1 mol dm\({}^{-3}\); temperature = 298 K and pressure of gases = 1 bar).
2. Connect the two half-cells via a '**salt bridge**', commonly made up of saturated potassium nitrate solution.
3. Measure the potential difference with a high-resistance **voltmeter**.

Since the standard hydrogen electrode is arbitrarily assigned a potential of zero, the potential difference between the two half-cells is the **standard electrode potential**, \(\mathbf{E^{\circ}}\), of the half-cell M**^**^**(aq)/M(s)**.

#### Key features of an electrochemical cell

1. The electrodes are connected by a **high resistance voltmeter** so that the current in the external circuit is virtually zero and the cell registers its **maximum** potential difference, which is called the electromotive force (e.m.f.) of the cell.
2. Flow of charges in the cell takes place in 2 ways: * **External circuit** > Flow of **ELECTRONS** between the 2 half-cells through the wire * **Electrons always** flow from the oxid**A**tion half-cell (called the **A**node) to the red**C**tion half-cell (called the **C**athode) * **Internal circuit** > Flow of **IONS** between the 2 half-cells through the **salt** bridge
3. **Polarity** of the electrodes (refer to page 3 of notes): * Negative electrode (-) : electrode with accumulation of negative charge (electrons) * Positive electrode (+) : electrode with a deficit of electrons
4. The **salt bridge** completes the entire circuit. (It consists of an inverted U-tube containing a saturated solution of a simple salt such as potassium nitrate (KNO\({}_{3}\)). Both ends are plugged with porous material.)

* It allows ions to move between the 2 solutions of the 2 half-cells
* It prevents build-up of charges in the 2 half-cells, which if allowed to occur, would eventually halt electron flow in the external circuit

(E) Writing a Cell Diagram / Cell Notation for Electrochemical cells (Recall) An **electrochemical cell** consists of two half-cells. Oxidation takes place in one half-cell and reduction takes place at the other half-cell.

Example of a fully labelled set-up of an electrochemical cell

As a convenient substitution for the above drawing, we use a **cell diagram** to show the parts of an electrochemical cell. A cell diagram is a **written notation** that represents the different components of an electrochemical cell.

1 A **cell diagram/cell notation** can be used to represent an electrochemical cell as follows:

oxidation half-cell II reduction half-cell

Cell diagram of example above is,

Cu(s) I Cu\({}^{2+}\)(aq) II Fe\({}^{3+}\)(aq), Fe\({}^{2+}\)(aq) I Pt(s) \(E^{5}_{\text{cell}}\) = +0.43 V

2 Common cell notations in cell diagrams are:

Note: State symbols must be included in a cell diagram

3 The half-cell with the **more positive \(E^{5}\)** value appears on the **Right** hand side of the cell diagram. **Reduction** occurs in this half-cell.

In the above example, \(E^{5}{}_{\text{c}}{}_{\text{c}}{}_{\text{2}}{}^{+}\)\({}_{\text{Cu}}\) = +0.34 V and \(E^{5}{}_{\text{Fe}}{}_{\text{3}}{}^{+}\)\({}_{\text{Fe}}{}_{\text{2}}{}^{+}\) = +0.77 V.

Hence, the Fe\({}^{3+}\)/Fe\({}^{2+}\) half-cell appears on the right hand side of the cell diagram. The two electrodes are Cu and Pt (inert electrode).

In a cell diagram

LHS half-cell (cell with more -ve \(E^{5}\) value)

RHS half-cell (cell with more +ve \(E^{5}\) value)

OxidAtion occurs

ReduCtion occurs

Anode

CuO

Cu\({}^{2+}\) + 2e\({}^{-}\)

2Fe\({}^{3+}\) + 2e\({}^{-}\) = 2Fe\({}^{2+}\)

**overall cell reaction**: 2Fe\({}^{3+}\) + Cu

2Fe\({}^{2+}\) + Cu\({}^{2+}\)

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:11]

2. _E\({}^{\bullet}\)_ values may be used to predict the direction of electron flow in an electrochemical cell

In the external circuit, **electrons flow from** the negative electrode (where **oxidAtion** occurs i.e. **A**node) **to** the positive electrode (where **reduCtion** occurs i.e. **C**athode).

E.g. For the electrochemical cell comprising 2 half-cells with

\(E^{\bullet}\) (Fe\({}^{3+}\)/Fe\({}^{2+}\)) = +0.77 V (Reduction half-cell)

\(E^{\bullet}\) (Zn\({}^{2+}\)/Zn) = -0.76 V (Oxidation half-cell)

Electrons flow from the zinc electrode in the Zn\({}^{2+}\)/Zn half-cell (i.e. oxidation half-cell; half-cell with more negative _E\({}^{\bullet}\)_ value) to the platinum electrode in the Fe\({}^{3+}\)/Fe\({}^{2+}\) half-cell (i.e. reduction half-cell; half-cell with more positive _E\({}^{\bullet}\)_ value) in the external circuit.

3. _E\({}^{\bullet}\)_ values may be used to calculate the _E\({}^{\bullet}\)_ cell value

The **standard cell potential (or e.m.f. of a cell)**, _E\({}^{\circ}\)_ cell, is the maximum potential difference between the two half-cells which are operated under standard conditions.

\(E^{\bullet}\)_ cell is calculated by:

Example:

If the Zn\({}^{2+}\)/Zn and Fe\({}^{3+}\)/Fe\({}^{2+}\) half-cells above are connected to form an electrochemical cell,

\(E^{\bullet}\) (Fe\({}^{3+}\)/Fe\({}^{2+}\)) = +0.77 V \(E^{\bullet}\) (Zn\({}^{2+}\)/Zn) = -0.76 V

\(E^{\bullet}\)_ cell = _E\({}^{\bullet}\)_ reduction - _E\({}^{\circ}\)_ oxidation = +0.77 - (-0.76) = +1.53 V_

Note that the **sign** and **units** must be included in the value of _E\({}^{\bullet}\)_ cell.

Important: We should **NOT** alter the value of _E\({}^{\bullet}\)_ when multiplying a half-equation by any factor!

e.g. \(\quad\)Fe\({}^{3+}\) (aq) + e\({}^{-}\)\(\quad\)Fe\({}^{2+}\)(aq) \(E^{\bullet}\) = +0.77 V \(2\)Fe\({}^{3+}\) (aq) + 2e\({}^{-}\)\(\quad\)Fe\({}^{2+}\)(aq) \(E^{\bullet}\) = +0.77 V \({}^{*}\)Not 2 x +0.77 V!

* the amount of energy obtained from one Coulomb of charge. When the half-cell equation is multiplied by any factor, the number of electrons will be greater : (greater Coulombic charge), but at the same time, the amount of energy obtained will also increase proportionally. Hence, the amount of energy per Coulomb remains the same (i.e. voltage is independent : of number of electrons in the equation)._

## Exercise 2

The two half-cells below are connected to form an electrochemical cell.

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|} \hline electrode reaction in half-cell & \(E^{\circ}\)/ V \\ \hline Cl\({}_{2}\) + 2e\({}^{-}\) & 2C/\({}^{+}\) & +1.36 \\ \hline Fe\({}^{3+}\) + e\({}^{-}\) & Fe\({}^{2+}\) & +0.77 \\ \hline \end{tabular}

(i) write down the cell diagram for the electrochemical cell formed

(ii) state the direction of electron flow in the external circuit

(iii) calculate the cell e.m.f.

(iv) write the overall cell reaction

\(E^{\circ}\) cell or \(E^{\circ}\) values may be used to predict the spontaneity of a redox reaction

Recall from _Thermodynamics_ that the spontaneity of a reaction is dependent on \(\Delta G^{\circ}\).

Similarly, in electrochemical cells, the change in Gibbs free energy for a redox reaction is related to the cell potential:

\(\Delta G^{\circ}\) = change in Gibbs free energy in \(J\) mol\({}^{-1}\)

\(n\) = number of moles of electrons transferred during the redox reaction

\(F\) = Faraday's constant, 96500 C mol\({}^{-1}\), i.e. total charge of a mole of electrons

Hence, under standard conditions,

when \(E^{\circ}\) cell > 0, \(\Delta G^{\circ}\) < 0 and the redox reaction is **spontaneous**

when \(E^{\circ}\) cell < 0, \(\Delta G^{\circ}\) > 0 the redox reaction is **NOT spontaneous**

## Exercise 3

(a) State, with reasons, whether the following reaction is spontaneous.

2Ag\({}^{+}\) + Zn & 2Ag + Zn\({}^{2+}\)

Ag\({}^{+}\) + e\({}^{-}\) & Ag +0.80 V & Zn\({}^{2+}\) + 2e\({}^{-}\) & Zn -0.76 V

\(E^{\circ}\) cell = +0.80 - (-0.76)

= +1.56 > 0 (hence reaction is spontaneous)

(b) Predict whether \(\Gamma\) can reduce Fe\({}^{2+}\)(aq) to metallic iron.

Fe\({}^{2+}\) + 2e\({}^{-}\) & Fe -0.44 V & I\({}_{2}\) + 2e\({}^{-}\) & 2I\({}^{-}\) & +0.54 V

\(E^{\circ}\) cell = -0.44 - 0.54 = -0.98 < 0 (hence reaction is not spontaneous). Hence, I - cannot reduce Fe\({}^{2+}\) to metallic iron.

(c) Calculate the e.m.f for the reaction of acidified aqueous hydrogen peroxide with aqueous iron(II) sulfate solution and hence, predict the products of the reaction. Hence, determine the \(\Delta G^{\bullet}\) of the reaction.

Approach:

Select half-cell reactions in the Data Booklet that contain the reactant species.

\(\Rightarrow\) Select the relevant pair of half-cell reactions, bearing in mind:

\(\circ\) one half-cell must undergo oxidation (reactant should be on the right of equilibrium)

and the other must undergo reduction (reactant should be on the left of equilibrium)

\(\circ\) the e.m.f. (or \(E^{\bullet}_{\text{cell}}\)) should be positive, \(E^{\bullet}_{\text{cell}}>0\)

Hence the relevant half-cell reactions are,

Note:

If the two half-cell reactions chosen are,

\(E^{\bullet}_{\text{cell}}=\)

Since \(E^{\bullet}_{\text{cell}}\)\(\bullet\) **0**, we can say that this reaction is

Then,

\(\Delta G^{\bullet}=-nFE^{\bullet}_{\text{cell}}=\)

Overall equation:

Products of reaction:

(G) Non-standard conditions - FYI

The electrode potential, \(E\), under _non-standard conditions_ can be related to standard electrode potential, \(E^{\bullet}\), by the **Nernst equation**:

\[E=E^{\bullet}-\frac{\text{RT}}{n\text{F}}\text{In }Q\]

where n is the no. of electrons transferred

F is the Faraday constant,

Q is the reaction quotient which describes the relative amount of reactants and products at

a particular point in time

Similarly, the Nernst equation for the cell potential is

\[E_{\text{cell}}=E^{\bullet}_{\text{cell}}-\frac{\text{RT}}{n\text{F}}\text{In }Q\]

From this, we can see that the value of \(E_{\text{cell}}\) is dependent on a few factors:

* temperature (as reflected in T)
* concentration or pressure (for gas) of reactants and products (as reflected in \(Q\))

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:15]

### Limitations of the standard electrode potential approach to determine spontaneity of reaction

Predictions on spontaneity of reaction **may not** always be true.

* \(E^{\text{\tiny{cell}}}>0\) (i.e. \(\Delta G<0\)) might not mean that a reaction will occur
* \(E^{\text{\tiny{cell}}}<0\) (i.e. \(\Delta G>0\)) might not mean that a reaction will not occur

Two possible reasons to explain this:

* Non-standard conditions
* High activation energy of some reactions

#### 1 Non-standard conditions

When determining \(E^{\text{\tiny{cell}}}\), all solutions have a concentration of 1 mol dm\({}^{-3}\) and a temperature of 298 K. The actual conditions for a reaction either in a lab or in the industry are unlikely to be standard. As such, the actual cell e.m.f. may not be the same as the calculated \(E^{\text{\tiny{cell}}}\).

\begin{tabular}{|l|} \hline
**Example** \\ MnO\({}_{2}\) + 4H\({}^{+}\) + 2e\({}^{-}\) & Mn\({}^{2+}\) + 2H\({}_{2}\)O & \(E^{\text{\tiny{e}}}=+1.23\) V \\ Cl\({}_{2}\) + 2e\({}^{-}\) & 2Cl\({}^{\text{\tiny{r}}}\) & \(E^{\text{\tiny{r}}}=+1.36\) V \\ MnO\({}_{2}\) + 4HC\(l\) & MnCl\({}_{2}\) + 2H\({}_{2}\)O + Cl\({}_{2}\) & \(E^{\text{\tiny{cell}}}=-0.13\) V \(<0\) assuming standard conditions \\ \end{tabular}

However, such a reaction actually occurs when conc. HC\(l\) is used instead of 1 mol dm\({}^{-3}\)HC\(l\).

Comments:

Since conc. HC\(l\) is used, [H\({}^{+}\)] and [Cl\({}^{\text{\tiny{r}}}\)] will be above 1 mol dm\({}^{-3}\).

Under such conditions, the \(E\) values _might_ be

\begin{tabular}{|l|} \hline MnO\({}_{2}\) + 4H\({}^{+}\) + 2e\({}^{-}\) & Mn\({}^{2+}\) + 2H\({}_{2}\)O & \(E=+1.40\) V \\ Cl\({}_{2}\) + 2e\({}^{-}\) & 2Cl\({}^{-}\) & \(E=+1.30\) V \\ \end{tabular}

giving \(E_{\text{\tiny{cell}}}=+1.40-(+1.30)\) V \(>0\) such that the reaction becomes spontaneous (as observed).

### High Activation Energy

Many reactions, particularly those involving gases and solutions, have high activation energy. Although the \(E^{\text{\tiny{cell}}}>0\), indicating that the reaction is spontaneous, it is so **slow** that no change is observed.

Reaction might have a **high activation energy** that is not overcome under standard conditions.

\begin{tabular}{|l|} \hline Example \\ 3HCHO + Cr\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{7}\)\({}^{2-}\) + 8H\({}^{+}\) & 2Cr\({}^{3+}\) + 3HCO\({}_{2}\)H + 4H\({}_{2}\)O & \(E^{\text{\tiny{cell}}}=+1.27\) V \\ \end{tabular}

Since \(E^{\text{\tiny{cell}}}>0\), acidified dichromate is expected to oxidise methanal to methanonic acid.

However, in practice, the reaction is _not_ observed at room temperature due to the high activation energy, i.e. the reaction is too slow. Heating is required for the reaction to occur.

\(E^{\text{\tiny{cell}}}\)**values do not give any information about the rate of the reaction**.

### (i) Types of Electrochemical (or Galvanic/Voltaic) Cells [SDL]

In electrochemical cells, a chemical reaction produces an electric current. There are three types: _primary_, _secondary_ and _fuel cells_.

\begin{tabular}{l l} (i) & Primary Cell \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular} stored chemical energy is simply used up \begin{tabular}{l} (ii) \\ \hline \end{tabular} stored chemical energy is simply used up \begin{tabular}{l} (iii) \\ \end{tabular} cannot be recharged because electrodes and electrolyte cannot be restored to their original states by an external electrical potential.

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:18]

2025JC2 H2 Electrochemistry  Advantages of the Fuel Cell [SDL]

1. **High efficiency** Electric current is produced directly from the reaction of hydrogen and oxygen without the inherently wasteful intermediate conversion of chemical energy to heat.
2. **No pollution / No Greenhouse Effect** Chemical product is water.
3. **High energy/mass ratio** compared to car batteries Smaller size, lower mass, higher voltage - more efficient :- used in space shuttles

Difference between fuel cell and other cells

**type of cell** **characteristics**

primary cell (dry) **limited capacity, discard when exhausted**

secondary cell (storage) **can be recharged, has storage capacity**

fuel cell **reactants (H2 & O2) continuously supplied, product (H2O) continuously removed, energy can be obtained "indefinitely" as long as supply of reactants is maintained.

## III **Electrolysis & Electrolytic Cells**

### (A) Electrolysis: An Introduction

**Electrolysis** is the process whereby an electric current is passed through an **electrolyte**, resulting in chemical reactions taking place at each of the **electrodes**. The cell in which electrolysis occurs is called the **electrolytic cell**.

Comparison of Electrochemical Cell and Electrolytic Cell

### (B) Factors affecting Selective Discharge of Substances

Before we can determine what chemical reaction takes place and hence what substances are formed at each electrode during an electrolysis, we need to know what **species/ions are present** at the electrode (e.g. positive ions migrate to the cathode, negative ions migrate to the anode, and for electrolysis of aqueous solutions, H\({}_{2}\)O will be present at both electrodes).

The **order in which ions or species are discharged** at the electrodes during electrolysis is determined by a number of factors including:

1. **state of electrolyte (molten or aqueous)**
2. **electrode potential**
3. **relative concentration of the ions**
4. **nature of the electrode**2025 JC2 H2 Electrochemistry

## 1 State of Electrolyte

Electrolysis of molten salts

In a molten electrolyte e.g. PbBr\({}_{2}\)(_I_), only one type of cation and anion is present.

Electrolysis of aqueous solutions

Unlike molten salts, for aqueous electrolytes, there will also be water present. Hence, we need to also consider H\({}_{2}\)O as a possible species to be discharged at EACH electrode.

E.g. in the electrolysis of PbBr\({}_{2}\)(**aq**),

**The electrolysis of aqueous solutions, the species that is preferentially discharged (or, selectively discharged) will depend on several factors, such the electrode potentials, relative concentrations of the ions and the nature of the electrode. These will be discussed in the following sections.

### (C) Industrial Processes involving electrolysis

1

Anodising of Aluminium

* Aluminium exposed to air acquires a protective layer of oxide.
* The protective layer can be enhanced by anodising.
* **Anodising** is the process of coating aluminium objects with aluminium oxide electrolytically.

**Anode**: **aluminium** object

At the anode where oxidation takes place,

\(E^{\text{n}}(\text{S}_{2}\text{O}\text{g}^{\text{-}}/\text{SO}\text{a}^{\text{-} })\)\(+\)2.01 V

\(E^{\text{n}}(\text{O}_{2}/\text{H}_{2}\text{O})\)\(+\)1.23 V (\(\nu\))

When a current is passed, H\({}_{2}\)O is discharged and is oxidised to O\({}_{2}\) at the anode.

\(2\text{H}_{2}\text{O}\)\(\xrightarrow{}\)\(\text{O}_{2}+4\text{H}^{\text{+}}+4\text{e}^{\text{-}}\) (1)

This is followed by oxidation of the A/ object (anodising) where the O\({}_{2}\) liberated at the anode reacts with the A/, forming A\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{3}\) which is then deposited on the surface. The surface oxide layer is artificially thickened.

\(4\text{A/}(\text{s})+3\text{O}_{2}(\text{g})\)\(\xrightarrow{}\)\(2\text{A}_{2}\text{O}_{3}(\text{s})\) (2)

**Overall reaction at the ANODE** (per mol of A\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{3}\)produced):

\(2\text{A/}(\text{s})+3\text{H}_{2}\text{O}(\text{g})\)\(\xrightarrow{}\)\(\text{A}_{2}\text{O}_{3}(\text{s})+6\text{H}^{\text{+}}(\text{aq})+6\text{e}^{\text{-}}\) (3)

(_To obtain the overall equation (3), multiply **(1) by 3** before combining the 2 equations to get \(4\text{A/}(\text{s})+6\text{H}_{2}\text{O}(\text{g})\)\(\xrightarrow{}\)\(2\text{A}_{2}\text{O}_{3}(\text{s})+12\text{H}^{\text{+}}(\text{aq})+12\text{e}^{\text{-}}\) Then divide throughout by 2 to get the simplified final equation (3))_

Advantages of anodising:

* Corrosion resistant
* allows aluminium utensils to be used in kitchens even for boiling acidic foods
* allows aeroplanes to survive flights through damp air
* protects overhead aluminium power lines, which are lighter and have higher conductivity than copper
* Decorative
* dyes can be added to electrolytic bath and are incorporated into the oxide

### (D) Faraday's Laws of Electrolysis

Faraday's First Law:

The **mass** of a substance produced at an electrode during electrolysis is **directly proportional** to the **quantity of electricity** passed.

\begin{tabular}{l l}  & m \(\propto\) Q \\ where & **Q = I x t** \\  & Q = quantity of electricity in coulombs (units: **C**) \\  & I = current in ampere (units: **A**) \\  & t = time in seconds, (units: **s**) \\  & m = mass deposited in grams, (units: **g**) \\ \hline \end{tabular}

The charge of a single electron is 1.602 x 10\({}^{-19}\) C (**e**)

The number of electrons in 1 mol is 6.023 x 10\({}^{23}\) electrons (**L**),

Hence, the **charge on 1 mol of electrons = charge of one electron x no. of electrons in 1 mol**

\(=1.602\) x 10\({}^{-19}\) C x 6.023 x 10\({}^{23}\) = 96 500 C

This amount of charge is referred to as 1 Faraday (**F**).

Hence the relationship:

\(\Leftrightarrow\) the total amount of charge (**Q**) required to discharge 1 mol of M\({}^{n+}\) ion

to form 1 mol of M(s) is **n\({}_{e}\) x F**. (where **n\({}_{e}\)** = no. of moles of electrons involved)

This leads us to:

Faraday's Second Law:

The **number of Faraday**s required to discharge one mole of an ion at an electrode is **equal to the charge** of the ion.

Example:

To discharge **1 mole** of It implies that

Pb\({}^{2+}\) requires **2F** (or 2 x 96500 C) of electricity

\begin{tabular}{l l}  & Pb\({}^{2+}\) + 2e\({}^{-}\) & Pb \\  & it requires 193 000 C to deposit 207 g Pb \\ \hline Br\({}^{-}\) requires **1F** (or 96500 C) of electricity & Br\({}^{-}\) & \(\nicefrac{{}}{{}^{2}}\)Br\({}_{2}\) + e\({}^{-}\) \\  & it requires 96 500 C to produce 79.9 g Br\({}_{2}\) \\ \hline Al\({}^{3+}\) requires **3F** (or 3 x 96500 C) of electricity & Al\({}^{3+}\) + 3e\({}^{-}\) & Al \\  & it requires 289500 C to deposit 27.0 g Al \\ \end{tabular}

Combining both Faraday's First and Second Law,

\begin{tabular}{l l}  & Q = It & and **Q = n\({}_{e}\)F** \\  & (where n\({}_{e}\) = no. of moles of electrons involved) \\ \end{tabular}

Hence, the number of moles of electrons (and eventually mass of a substance produced) during electrolysis depends on:

\begin{tabular}{l l}  & 1. magnitude of **current** passed (**I**) \\  & 2. **time** for which the current is passed (**t**) \\ \end{tabular}

The mass of substance produced does **NOT** depend on the concentration of the ions and _E\({}^{\text{n}}\)_ values.

### (IV) Summary

1. Redox reaction involves **reduction** and **oxidation** occurring simultaneously.
2. Reduction involves the gain of electron(s) with a decrease in oxidation number while oxidation involves the loss of electron(s) with an increase in oxidation number.
3. Comparison of electrochemical cell and electrolytic cell:
4. For electrochemical cell, 1. Steps involved in determining flow of electrons: 1. identify the species that must (or can only) be reduced / oxidised It will be very obvious, look out for common oxidising agents (MnO\({}_{\text{$\sim$}}\), Cr\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{7}\)\({}^{2\text{$\sim$}}\), elements existing in their maximum O.N. - e.g. Ag\({}^{+}\), Cu\({}^{2\text{$\sim$}}\)) or reducing agents (metals, halides). 2. the other will then undergo oxidation / reduction 3. write out the half-equation with the electrode potential for both the reduction and oxidation reactions as it appears in the _Data Booklet_ (**NO NEED** to reverse direction). After writing them down, check that the reactants given appear on OPPOSITE side of their respective equations 2. Steps involved in determining if a reaction between 2 given compounds is spontaneous: 1. calculate the \(\mathbf{E^{\text{*}}_{\text{cell}}}=\mathbf{E^{\text{*}}_{\text{reduction}}}-\mathbf{E^{ \text{*}}_{\text{oxidation}}}\) (use the electrode potentials as given in the _Data Booklet_) 2. if \(\mathbf{E^{\text{*}}_{\text{cell}}}>\mathbf{0}\), then \(\Delta\mathbf{G^{\text{*}}}<\mathbf{0}\). Hence, reaction is spontaneous (thermodynamically feasible) 3. write the reduction and oxidation half-equations and balance the no. of electrons on both equations before adding them together to get the balanced equation for the reaction 5. For electrolytic cell, 1. Terms used in electrolysis: 1. **discharged**: refer to the ions/H\({}_{2}\) 2. **deposited**: refer to solid product formed (usually metal) 3. **evolved**: refer to gaseous product formed
