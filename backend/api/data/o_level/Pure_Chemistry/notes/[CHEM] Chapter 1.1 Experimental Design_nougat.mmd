## Displacement of water

This method for collecting gases which are insoluble or slightly soluble in water.

As the gases does not dissolve in water, they would rise to the top of the gas jar.

Some examples of gases collected via this method includes **H2**, **O2**, **CO and CO2**.

DRYING OF GAS

To dry a sample of gas, we can pass it through drying agents like:

- **concentrated sulfuric acid**

- **quicklime (calcium oxide)**

- **fused calcium chloride (calcium chloride)*** 6. A gas turns moist red litmus paper blue, is soluble in water and is less dense than air. Which diagram shows a correct way of drying and collecting the gas? (N2019/P1/Q1)* 7. When an excess of dilute acid is added to a known quantity of sodium carbonate, the temperature of the mixture changes. An experiment is designed to measure the temperature change when all the carbonate reacts with the acid. In addition to a thermometer and measuring cylinder, the following pieces of apparatus are available. 1 gas syringe 2 stopwatch 3 balance 4 Styrofoam cup (N2020/P1/Q1)

Which pieces of apparatus are needed for this experiment? (N2020/P1/Q1)

* 1. 2, 3 and 4 only (D 3 and 4 only ( ))

### Answer:

* 7. D The use of a balance is necessary to determine if all the carbonate has reacted with the acid. A Styrofoam beaker is needed to minimise the heat loss to the surroundings since this is an experiment which measures temperature change.
