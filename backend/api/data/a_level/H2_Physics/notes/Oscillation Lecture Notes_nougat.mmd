## 1 Introduction

**(a)** **describe simple examples of free oscillations.**

An **oscillation** is a periodic motion of an object about a certain mean equilibrium position with a continuous interchange of kinetic energy and potential energy.

Periodic (or harmonic) motion refers to any motion that repeats itself in equal intervals of time.

Examples: vibration of tuning fork, boat bobbing at anchor, a child playing on a swing,

bells, pendulum of a grandfather clock, diaphragms in telephones and

speaker systems and surging pistons in engines of cars.

When an object is displaced from its fixed equilibrium position and is free to oscillate, it will oscillate about this position with the _natural frequency_ of the system. (We will go into more details of this natural frequency with a simple pendulum case study later.)

The object will oscillate forever under **free oscillations** as energy is conserved and quantities such as amplitude and period remain constant.

In real life, dissipative forces like air resistance and friction will cause the oscillations to fade with time, as we observed in our many practical exercises on oscillations. These oscillations are known as damped oscillations. **Damped oscillations** occur when there is a continuous transfer of energy to the surroundings such that the energy in the system decreases with time, hence the amplitude of the motion progressively decreases with time.

**Forced oscillations** are caused by continual input of energy by external source to an oscillating system to compensate the loss due to damping in order to maintain the amplitude of the oscillation.

### Describing Oscillations

**(c)** **understand and use the terms amplitude, period, frequency, angular frequency and phase difference and express the period in terms of both frequency and angular frequency.**

Consider displacement with time of a spring-mass oscillating in frictionless environment:

**(a).** _Equilibrium position (or neutral position)_ **is the position at which no net force acts on the oscillating mass.**

**(b).** _Displacement (x)_ **is the distance of the oscillating mass from its equilibrium position at any instant in a stated direction.**

**(c).** _Amplitude (x\({}_{o}\))_ **is the maximum displacement of the oscillating mass from the equilibrium position in either direction.**

**(d).** _Period (T)_ **is the time taken for one complete oscillation. Unit: second.**

**(e).** _Frequency (f)_ **is the number of complete to-and-fro cycles per unit time made by the oscillating object. Unit: Hertz. 1 Hz is equal to one cycle per second.**

**(f).** _Angular frequency (u)_ **of an oscillation is frequency** \(\times\) **2**\(\pi\)**. It is the angle in radians by which the phase of the motion changes per unit time.**

**(Unit: radian per second (rad s\({}^{-1}\)).**

**(g).** _Phase_ **is an angle in either degrees or radians which gives a measure of the fraction of a cycle that has been completed by an oscillating particle or by a wave.**

**(h).** _Phase difference_ **is a measure of how much one wave is out of step with another. It is measured in either degrees or radians.**

**(i).** _In-phrase, Out of Phase, Antiphase_

**In phase: phase difference is zero.**

**Out of phase: phase difference is not zero.**

**Antiphase: phase difference is 180 degrees or** \(\pi\) **radians.**

**Example 1**

A man standing at the dock was observing the bobbing motion of a speedboat on the seawater just below the dock. He estimated that the boat could reach two extreme positions which were 3.0 m and 4.0 m below the dock surface respectively. He also counted that the boat would bob on average 30 times in 15 seconds. Assume that the speedboat was executing free oscillation, determine its (a) amplitude, (b) period, (c) frequency, (d) vertical distance between the equilibrium position and the dock surface and (e) the angular frequency.

**Solution**

(a) \(x_{0}=\%\) (4.0 - 3.0) = \(\%\) (1.0) = **0.50 m**

(b) \(T=\dfrac{15}{30}=\underline{0.50\ \mathbf{s}}\)

(c) \(f=\dfrac{1}{T}=\dfrac{1}{0.50}=\underline{2.0\ \mathbf{Hz}}\)

(d) vertical distance = \(\%\) (4.0 + 3.0) = **3.5 m**

(e) \(\omega=\ 2\ \pi\ \mathrm{f}=2\ \pi\ \mathrm{f}=2\ \pi\ \mathrm{(2.00)}=4.00\ \pi= \underline{12.6\ \mathrm{rads}^{\mathrm{-1}}}\)

**Example 2**

A pendulum takes 31.7 seconds to complete 25 oscillations, if another similar pendulum is 1.70 seconds behind the first, what is the phase difference between the pendulums? Solution

31.7 + 25 = 1.268 = 1.27 s

The period is 1.27 s

Since the period of the pendulum is 1.27s, the actual time difference in the oscillation is \(\Delta\)t= 1.70 - 1.268 = 0.432 s

\(\phi\) = 2\(\pi\Delta\)t/T = 2.14 rad
```

The velocity time graph of the oscillating cart is shown below. Determine the

(a) Period (b) Frequency (c) Angular Frequency

(a) Period (b) Frequency (c) Angular Frequency

(a) 2.5 waves in 1.6 seconds, therefore period is 0.64 s

(b) \(\ell\) = 1/T = 1.56 Hz

(c) \(\omega\) = 2\(\pi\)f = 9.82 rad s-1 ```

_Food for thought_

_Is circular motion a type of oscillatory motion? Why? Can \(\omega\) be negative? Why?_

_Is Angular frequency = Angular velocity?_

## 2 Dynamics of Simple Harmonic Motion (SHM)

\begin{tabular}{l l} \hline
**(d)** & **recognise and use the equation** \(a=-\omega^{2}x\)**as the defining equation of simple harmonic motion. \\
**(e)** & **recall and use** \(x=x_{0}\sin\omega t\)**as a solution to the equation** \(a=-\omega^{2}x\)**.** \\ \end{tabular}

The example of the cart oscillating due to the spring is a classic case of simple harmonic motion. SHM is the simplest form of oscillatory motion. For SHM to take place, we assume that the objects are in free oscillation (no energy lost through resistive forces) and that there is a restoring force (i.e. Hooke's law) to bring the object back to the fixed (equilibrium) position O.

\begin{tabular}{l l} \hline
**Case 1** & \\ \hline The spring is compressed, the & \\ displacement is to the right while the & \\ spring exerts a pushing force to the & \\ left & \\ \end{tabular}

\begin{tabular}{l l} \hline
**Case 2** & \\ \hline The spring is stretched, the & \\ displacement is to the left while the & \\ spring exerts a pulling force to the & \\ right & \\ \end{tabular}

\begin{tabular}{l l} \hline
**Case 3** & \\ \hline The spring is in equilibrium position, & \\ there is no net force (but the cart can \\ be moving) & \\ \end{tabular}

As mentioned earlier, the direction of \\ the force (or acceleration) is in \\ opposite direction to the displacement, \\ hence \(a=\dfrac{d^{\,2}x}{dt^{\,2}}=-\omega^{2}x\).

\begin{tabular}{l l} \hline
**Enrichment (Not required to solve ODE for Exams)** \\ \hline
**Note:** & _Equations of the form_ \(\dfrac{d^{\,2}x}{dt^{\,2}}=-\omega^{2}x\) _are known as differential equations. Since we differentiate_ \(x\) _with respect to time twice, this is a second order ordinary differential equation (ODE). Mathematicians devised many methods in solving ODE which we will not be going through in details here. But the sine/cosine like behaviour of the harmonic oscillation gives us a hint that the solution to_ \(x\) _may be related to sine/cosine functions._ \\ \end{tabular}

_In order to find the equation of motion for simple harmonic motion, we will need to look for a function_ \(x\)_(t) that satisfy the differentiate equation of the form_ \(\dfrac{d^{\,2}x}{dt^{\,2}}=-\omega^{2}x\) _. Just like solving for the equation of motions for kinematics, we look at the displacement-time and velocity-time graph for inspirations. We could use the sine wave like displacement-time and velocity-time graph of the SHM to help us understand the problem better._ \\ \end{tabular}

_As smart physics students, let's assume that the function_ \(x\) _has the general form_

\(x=A\sin\,Bt\)__

_where_ \(A\) _and_ \(B\) _are constants to be solved._

**Enrichment (Not required to solve ODE for Exams)**

_Given that the angular frequency of the system is \(\omega\)=2\(\pi\)/T or 2\(\pi\) = T\(\omega\) = BT, we can deduce that constant \(B\) = \(\omega\) since the sine wave need to make one complete wave for every time interval T. We get_

\[x=A\sin\omega t\]

_If we let the maximum displacement of the oscillation be \(x_{0}\), then \(A\) = \(x_{0}\) since \(-1\leq\sin\omega t\leq 1\). We get_

\[x=x_{0}\sin\omega t\]

_This is the general solution for simple harmonic oscillation. The displacement of the object in SHM is given by the expression \(x=x_{0}\sin\omega t\) so we will know where our object is at any given point of time._

_Let's verify that the expression \(x=x_{0}\sin\omega t\) satisfies the equation \(\omega\)= \(\dfrac{d^{\,2}x}{dt^{\,2}}=-\omega^{\,2}x\)_

\[\dfrac{dx}{dt}=x_{0}\omega\cos\omega t\]

\[\dfrac{d^{\,2}x}{dt^{\,2}}=-x_{0}\omega^{\,2}\sin\omega t=-\omega^{\,2}(x_{0} \sin\omega t)=-\omega^{\,2}x\]

## IMPORTANTI

Therefore, the general equation **defining** simple harmonic motion is given by

\[a=-\omega^{\,2}x\]

_Food for Thought_

_If a body's motion is given by \(a\) = \(\omega^{\,2}x\), is the body undergoing SHM? Why?_

## DEFINITIONI

**Simple Harmonic motion (SHM)** is defined as oscillatory motion of a particle whose acceleration is directly proportional to its displacement from the equilibrium position and this acceleration is always in opposite direction to its displacement.

**Solution to SHM**

\(x=x_{0}\sin\omega t\) is a solution to \(a=-\omega^{\,2}x\)

_This equation is in the formula list_

_Food for Thought_

_If we start off with \(x=x_{0}\cos\omega t\) instead, we could obtain an alternative solution to the general equation of SHM, \(a=-\omega^{\,2}x\). Why? What is the difference between \(x=x_{0}\cos\omega t\) and \(x=x_{0}\sin\omega t\)? (Hint: Think of the starting position \(x\) of the object in SHM, if it starts at equilibrium position versus starting at maximum displacement)_

_The general solution for \(a=-\omega^{\,2}x\) is \(x=x_{0}\sin(\omega t+\phi)\), what is \(\phi\) denoted here?_

### Velocity of SHM

**(f)** & **recognise and use** \(v=v_{0}\cos\omega t,v=\pm\omega\sqrt{({x_{0}}^{2}-x^{2})}\) \\ \hline \end{tabular} Since we have shown that \(x=x_{0}\sin\omega t\), the velocity of the object in simple harmonic motion is simply given by the expression \\ \hline Therefore the velocity of the object at a given time \(t\) is \\ \(v=\frac{dx}{dt}=x_{0}\omega\cos\omega t=v_{0}\cos\omega t\), where \(v_{0}=x_{0}\omega\) \\ \(v=v_{0}\cos\omega t\) \\ _This equation is in the formula list_ \\ \hline \end{tabular}
**Food for Thought** In circular motion, the linear velocity is given by \(v=r\omega\), can you draw any similarities to the expression of \(v_{0}\) above? To get rid of the trigonometric functions, we can try to square the functions of \(x\) and \(v\), \(v^{2}=x_{0}^{2}\omega^{2}\cos^{2}\omega t\) -- Eqn (1) \\ \(x^{2}=x_{0}^{2}\sin^{2}\omega t\), \\ \(\omega^{2}x^{2}=x_{0}^{2}\omega^{2}\sin^{2}\omega t\) -- Eqn (2) \\ Adding Eqn (1) and Eqn (2) together, \\ \(v^{2}+\omega^{2}x^{2}=x_{0}^{2}\omega^{2}\sin^{2}\omega t+x_{0}^{2}\omega^{2} \cos^{2}\omega t\) \\ \(v^{2}+\omega^{2}x^{2}=x_{0}^{2}\omega^{2}\) \\ \(v^{2}=\omega^{2}(x_{0}^{2}-x^{2})\) \\ \(v=\pm\omega\sqrt{(x_{0}^{2}-x^{2})}\) \\ \hline \end{tabular}

We also know that \(mg=ke\), hence \(\frac{m}{k}=\frac{e}{g}\),

Therefore, Period \(T=2\pi\sqrt{\frac{e}{g}}\)

This is a commonly used expression when we conduct our oscillation experiment. Eventually, for a fixed mass, the period of oscillation for this experiment depends only on the amount of extension which in turn depends on the stiffness of the spring, as long as Hooke's law applies.

**Challenge**

Can you derive the same expressions above for a horizontal spring mass system?

**A Simple Pendulum**

Another case study that we can look into in details would be our simple pendulum. In this case, we hang a mass \(m\) on a non extensible light string of length \(l\) and set it to swing back and forth as shown in the diagram on the right. The restoring force in this case comes from gravity. To be exact, the restoring force is the \(W_{x}\) component of the weight as indicated.

\[W_{x}=W\sin\theta\]

For small angle \(\theta\), \(\sin\theta\approx\theta\) (In radians),

And arc length \(x=l\times\theta\)

Combining, we get

\[W_{x}=-\frac{xW}{l}=ma\]

Applying \(a=-\omega^{2}x\),

\[-\frac{xW}{ml}=a=-\omega^{2}x\]

Rearranging and substituting \(W=mg\)

Hence period T is

\[T=2\pi\sqrt{\frac{l}{g}}\]

This is another equation that we see in oscillation practical quite often. The only assumption in this case is that the angle of oscillation is small so that the small angle approximation holds. Therefore it is important to keep the amplitude of oscillation small for pendulum experiment so that the curved arc x is approximately straight. In this case, the period of oscillation depends on the length of the pendulum and the acceleration due to gravity. It is independent of mass!

Topic 9: OscillationsA Spring-Mass System

An object executing SHM in a spring-mass system interchanges three types of energies, namely **kinetic energy**, **gravitational potential energy and elastic potential energy**.

Kinetic energy (KE) depends on the speed of the object, which in turn depends on its displacement from the equilibrium position.

Gravitational potential energy (GPE) depends on the height of the object from an _arbitrary chosen point_, usually taken at the lowest point of the oscillation.

Elastic potential energy (EPE) depends on the extension of the spring from its original length and can be calculated by assuming Hooke's Law is valid.

Total energy (TE) is sum of the three energies and is constant throughout the SHM.

Note: PE = \(\nicefrac{{1}}{{2}}\) m \(\omega^{2}\)x\({}^{2}\) cannot be applied directly here because

PE = GPE + EPE and we did not set GPE + EPE = 0 at x = 0.

Damped Oscillations, Forced Oscillations and Resonance

**(i)** describe practical examples of damped oscillations with particular reference to the effects of the degree of damping and the importance of critical damping in cases such as a car suspension system.

The assumption that there is no resistance to motion is not valid in everyday situations. Some energy will always be lost by the system to overcome dissipative forces, e.g. friction, air resistance. As energy is used to overcome resistive forces, the amplitude of the oscillation decreases since total energy is directly proportional to the square of amplitude. Such oscillations are called damped oscillation.

**Damping** is a process where energy is taken from an oscillating system as a result of dissipative forces.

9646 Physics

Topic 9: Oscillations

**J**) **describe practical examples of forced oscillations and resonance.**

**Forced Oscillations and Resonance**

* As damping causes energy to be lost, an external energy source is required to maintain oscillations at constant amplitude.
* The external agent providing the energy is called the driving force.
* The oscillator is the driven system, which undergoes forced oscillations due to the driving force.
* **Forced oscillations** are caused by continual input of energy by external source to an oscillating system to compensate the loss due to damping in order to maintain the amplitude of the oscillation.
* Examples: 1. Engine vibrations cause bus windows to vibrate. 2. Spinning drum causes washing machine to vibrate.
* Any mechanical system that is free to move has a natural frequency \(f_{0}\) which depends on its dimensions and nature of material.
* A system undergoes forced vibrations when it is subjected to a driving force of a certain driving frequency \(f\), there is a transfer of energy.
* When the driving frequency \(f\) = natural frequency \(f_{0}\), the amplitude of vibration of the system becomes a maximum, and the system is set in resonance.
* **Resonance** occurs when the resulting amplitude of the system becomes a maximum when the driving frequency of external driving force equals to natural frequency of the system. At resonance, there is a maximum transfer of energy from the driving system to the driven system.

**Frequency Response (amplitude vs driving frequency graph)**

If the amplitude of oscillation is plotted against driving (forcing) frequency, the resulting graph is the _frequency response_ of the system.

Consider an oscillating system of natural frequency \(f_{o}\). When the external driving frequency, \(f\) is slowly increased from a small value, the amplitude of oscillation of the driven oscillating system will increase to a maximum value at the resonant frequency (where the driving frequency equals to the natural frequency of the system). Thereafter, as the driving frequency is increased further, the amplitude of oscillation of the driven system decreases.

The sharpness of the response depends on the damping forces involved. Theoretically, with no damping, the amplitude of oscillation of the driven system should tend to an infinitely large magnitude at the resonant frequency. This is because there is a continuous input of energy.

In practice, damping always exists and the amplitude and energy will increase until the rate of energy transfer is equal to rate of energy dissipation.

Notice that as the degree of damping is increased,

* the amplitude of the peak oscillation decreases.
* the peak becomes broader as it spreads over a wider range of frequencies (the response is less sharp).
* resonance occurs at a frequency smaller than the natural frequency.

\begin{tabular}{l l} \multicolumn{2}{c}{**Oscillation Definition List**} \\ \hline Oscillation & It is a periodic motion of an object about a certain mean equilibrium position \\  & with a continuous interchange of kinetic energy and potential energies. \\ \hline Forced oscillations & Forced oscillations are caused by continual input of energy by external source \\  & to an oscillating system to compensate the loss due to damping in order to \\  & maintain the amplitude of the oscillation. \\ \hline Damped simple harmonic & Oscillation in which there is a continuous transfer of energy to the \\  & surroundings due to dissipative force such that the energy in the system \\  & decreases with time, hence the amplitude of the motion progressively \\  & decreases with time. \\ \hline Equilibrium position & _Equilibrium position (or neutral position)_ is the position at which no net \\  & force acts on the oscillating mass. \\ \hline _Angular frequency (\(u\))_ & _Angular frequency (\(u\))_ of an oscillation refers to the constant which \\  & characterises the particular simple harmonic oscillator and is related to its \\  & natural frequency given by \(\omega=2\pi t\). \\  & Or \\  & The angle in radians by which the phase of the motion changes per unit time. \\  & Unit: radian per second (**rad s\({}^{-}\)**).** \\ \hline _Frequency (f)_ & Frequency is the number of complete to-and-fro cycles per unit time made by \\  & the oscillating object. \\  & Unit: Hertz. (1 Hz is equal to one cycle per second.) \\ \hline _Period (T)_ & _Period (T)_ is the time taken for one complete oscillation. \\  & Unit: second. \\ \hline Phase & Phase is an angle in either degrees or radians which gives a measure of the \\  & fraction of a cycle that has been completed by an oscillating particle or by a \\  & wave. \\ \hline Phase difference & Phase difference is a measure of how much one wave is out of step with \\  & another. It is measured in either degrees or radians. \\ \hline In-phase & phase difference is zero. \\ \hline Out of Phase & phase difference is not zero. \\ \hline Anti-phase & phase difference is 180 degrees or rt radians. \\ \hline Displacement & Displacement is the distance of the oscillating mass from its equilibrium \\  & position at any instant in a stated direction. \\ \hline Amplitude & Amplitude is the maximum displacement of the oscillating mass from the \\  & equilibrium position in either direction. \\ \hline Simple Harmonic motion (SHM) (2003, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009) & Defined as oscillatory motion of a particle whose acceleration is directly \\  & proportional to its displacement from the equilibrium position and this \\  & acceleration is always in opposite direction to its displacement. \\ \hline Damping & Damping is a process where energy is taken from an oscillating system as a \\  & result of dissipative forces. \\ \hline Light damping & Oscillations are maintained about the equilibrium position after the system has \\  & been displaced. The amplitude of oscillations decreases over a long time. \\ \hline Critical damping & No oscillations occur. The motion is brought to rest in the shortest possible \\  & time. \\ \hline Heavy damping & No oscillations occur about the equilibrium position when the damping force \\  & increases beyond the point of critical damping. The system takes a long time \\  & to return to the equilibrium position compared to critically damped system. \\ \hline Natural Frequency & Any mechanical system that is free to move has a natural frequency \(f_{0}\) which \\  & depends on its dimensions and nature of material. \\ \hline Resonance (2005) & Resonance occurs when the resulting amplitude of the system becomes a \\  & maximum when the driving frequency of external driving force equals to \\  & natural frequency of the system. At resonance, there is a maximum transfer \\  & of energy from the driving system to the driven system. \\ \hline \end{tabular}

* 19. A block of mass is attached to the end of a spring, with the block free to move on a horizontal frictionless surface. When the spring is neither stretched nor compressed, the block is at the equilibrium position, where \(x=0\), as shown in Fig. 1. When the block is pulled by a distance from the equilibrium position as shown in Fig. 1.2 and subsequently released, it oscillates back and forth about its equilibrium position. 1. Show, _from first principles_, that the motion of the object is simple harmonic motion. You may make use of Fig. 1.2 and Fig. 1.3 as part of your working. 2. Hence, derive the expression for the period of the simple harmonic motion in term of the spring constant \(k\) and mass of the block \(m\). 1.1

Challenging Question (Not in Syllabus, requires a bit of Calculus and Trigonometry)
* 20. The defining equation for SHM can be modified for forced oscillations with damping by considering Newton's 2\({}^{nd}\) Law. \[m\frac{d^{2}x}{dt^{2}}=-m\omega_{0}{}^{2}x\] where \(\omega_{0}\) is the frequency of a free oscillator. We can take the driving force \(F=F_{0}cos\omega t\), where \(F_{0}\) is a constant and \(\omega\) is the angular frequency of the force and the damping force \(f=\) -\(k\nu\), we get \[m\frac{d^{2}x}{dt^{2}}=-m\omega_{0}{}^{2}x-k\frac{dx}{dt}+F_{0}cos\omega t\] Given that the steady state solution of the damped forced oscillator is \[x=Acos(\omega t+\phi)\] 1.
