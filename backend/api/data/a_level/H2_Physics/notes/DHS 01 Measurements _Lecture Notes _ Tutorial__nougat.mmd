## 1 Physical Quantities and SI Units

Any scientifically measurable quantities are called physical quantities.

e.g. temperature, force, current, pressure, mass, energy, etc.

All physical quantities consist of a **numerical value** and a **unit**.

e.g. mass, m = 65.0 kg unit

Physical Quantity Numerical value

The Summary of some Quantities and Units used in the A-Level examination is given in Appendix 1.

In very much the same way that languages have developed in various parts of the world, different units of measurements have evolved. Just as languages can be translated from one to another, units of measurement can be converted between systems. For standardisation, it is much better to have just one system of units. Scientists use the **Systeme International (SI)** which is based on the metric system.

**LO(a)**: **recall the following base quantities and their units: mass (kg), length (m), time (s), current (A), temperature (K), amount of substance (mol).**

Physical Quantities

Base quantities are the seven physical quantities of the SI system by which all other physical quantities are defined.

They are: mass, length, time, temperature, amount of substance, electric current and luminous intensity.

The SI base units are a choice of seven well-defined units which by convention are regarded as dimensionally independent: kilogram (kg), metre (m), second (s), ampere (A), kelvin (K), mole (mol). Candela (cd) is not in the syllabus.

**LO (b) express derived units as products or quotients of the base units and use the named units listed in 'Summary of Key Quantities, Symbols and Units'1 as appropriate.**

Base units are the seven units of the SI system, related to the base quantities, whose magnitude is defined without referring to other units.

Derived units are units that are derived from base units and can be expressed in terms of products and quotients of base units.

Derived quantities are physical quantities that are derived from base quantities and can be expressed in terms of products and quotients of base quantities.

E.g. The physical quantity speed, \(v\), may be expressed in terms of the quantities distance \(x\) and time \(t\) by the defining equation \(v=x\ell\). \(x\) and \(t\) are base quantities, with SI base units metre m and second s respectively. Speed \(v\) is then a derived quantity, with the derived unit of speed metre-per-second, m s-1.

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:3]

Unit of \(\nu=\) m s\({}^{-1}\)

Unit of \(\nu^{2}=\) (unit of velocity)\({}^{2}=\) (m s\({}^{-1}\)) \({}^{2}=\) m\({}^{2}\) s\({}^{-2}\)

Unit of as\({}^{2}=\) m s\({}^{-2}\times\) m\({}^{2}=\) m\({}^{3}\) s\({}^{-2}\)

The equation is not homogeneous.

Checking the homogeneity of an equation using base units is a powerful way of establishing if the physical equation is reasonable. It narrows the numerous combinations that may exist.

_A physically correct equation must always be homogeneous. However, a homogeneous equation need not be physically correct. Why?_

There are two basic reasons:

(1) The value of the dimensionless factor may be incorrect.

e.g. \(E=3m\nu^{2}\) where \(E=\) kinetic energy

The coefficient 3 is incorrect! The value should be \(\frac{1}{2}\) instead.

(2) Missing or extra terms that may have the same unit.

e.g. \(E=\frac{1}{2}m\nu^{2}+mgh\) where \(E=\) kinetic energy

There is an extra term \(mgh\), which happens to have the same unit as kinetic energy. This is an extra term.

**Practice 2:**

The period \(T\) of a simple pendulum is thought to depend on its length \(l\), its mass \(m\) and the acceleration due to gravity \(g\) according to the equation \(T=k\,k^{\prime}\,m^{\prime}\,g^{\prime}\), where \(k\) is a dimensionless constant (i.e. a constant with no unit). Determine the indices \(x\), \(y\) and \(z\).

**Note that it is not possible to deduce the value of \(k\) through this analysis.*** **LOW(d)**: **show an understanding and use the conventions for labelling graph axes and table columns.**

**Conventions for Labelling Table Columns**

* **All readings or measurements should be tabulated in vertical columns;**

For example

* **For the column headings, use the standard notation of "quantity / unit"; it means "quantity divided by unit".**

**For example**

**Writing** \(t\) **=** 2.0 s** **as** \(t\) **/ s **=** 2.0**,**

**the expression becomes a pure number. The column with** \(t\) **/ s thus consists of just pure numbers with no units.**

* **The unit should be written in the index form, e.g. use m s**\({}^{-2}\) **and not m / s**\({}^{2}\)**.**
* **For columns that involve logarithms, either lg or ln, the unit of the variable must be stated.**

**For example, lg(**\(m\) **/ kg), ln(**\(T\) **/ s).**

**It should be noted that after taking lg or ln, the resulting values have no units.**

**Conventions for Labelling Graph Axes**

* **when plotting graphs, both axes must be labelled with the physical quantities and their associated units (e.g.** \(x\) **/ m and** \(t\) **/ s). Therefore, there is no need to write unit to every number label on the axes.**

We will cover these in greater detail during practical lessons.

**LO(e)**: **use the following prefixes and their symbols to indicate decimal sub-multiples or multiples of both base and derived units: pico (p), nano (n), micro (\(\mu\)), milli (m), centi (c), deci (d), kilo (k), mega (M), giga (G), tera (T).**

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|} \hline
**10\({}^{\text{n}}\)** & **Prefix** & **Symbol** & **Name** & **Decimal equivalent** \\ \hline
10\({}^{\text{-12}}\) & pico & p & Trillionth & 0.000,000,000,001 \\ \hline

10\({}^{\text{12}}\) & tera & T & Trillion & 1,000,000,000,000 \\ \hline \end{tabular}

Note:

\(\bullet\) Symbols are case-sensitive. Use "k" for kilo, not "K".

\(\bullet\) There is no space between prefix and the unit, e.g. write "km" not "k m".

**LO(f)**: **make reasonable estimates of physical quantities within the syllabus**.

All estimates are to be stated to 1 significant figure only, unless stated otherwise.

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|} \hline
**Mass** & **Approximately (kg)** & **Scientific notation (kg)** \\ \hline Ping pong ball & 0.003 & 3 x 10\({}^{\text{-3}}\) \\ \hline An apple & 0.2 & 2 x10\({}^{\text{-1}}\) \\ \hline Adult Asian man & 70 & 7 x 10\({}^{\text{1}}\) \\ \hline Car & 1000 - 1500 & 1 x 10\({}^{\text{3}}\) \\ \hline SBS bus & 20,000 & 2.x 10\({}^{\text{4}}\) \\ \hline Earth & 6 x 10\({}^{\text{24}}\) & 6 x 10\({}^{\text{24}}\) \\ \hline

## 2 Scalars and vectors

**LO (g) distinguish scalar and vector quantities and give examples of each.**

* Scalar is a quantity that has magnitude, not direction. It is completely specified by its numerical value and unit.
* Scalar quantities can be added or subtracted using rules of algebra. e.g. 10 kg + 12 kg = 22 kg
* Vector is a quantity having both magnitude and direction. It must be specified with its value, unit and direction.

* e.g.: 2.5 m s-1 due East direction

In print, a vector is often denoted by a letter in bold type, e.g. force \(F\). The magnitude is indicated as \(\mid\textbf{{F}}\mid\).
* A vector can be represented with an arrow whose length is proportional to the magnitude of the vector, is correctly orientated with respect to a reference direction.

The table below shows a list of scalar and vector quantities:

\begin{tabular}{|p{142.3pt}|p{142.3pt}|} \hline
**Scalar quantity** & **Vector quantity** \\ \hline distance & displacement \\ speed & velocity \\ \hline temperature & acceleration \\ \hline energy & force \\ \hline power & momentum \\ \hline mass & weight \\ \hline density & moment \\ \hline pressure & torque \\ volume & electric field \\ \hline time & magnetic flux density \\ \hline \end{tabular}

## LO (h) add and subtract coplanar vectors

### Equal vectors

Vectors are equal if they have the _same magnitude and direction_.

### Negative vector

The negative of a vector has the _same magnitude but opposite direction_.

Coplanar vectors are vectors that lie on the same plane (2-dimension).

Unlike scalar quantities, vector quantities cannot be added or subtracted using algebra. Instead a _vector diagram_ is needed.

### Vector Addition

_a. Triangle method_

Stack the vectors such that one vector has its tail placed at the tip of the previous vector.

The resultant vector is represented by the line with a _double arrow_ directed from the tail of the first vector to the tip of the last vector.

_b. Parallelogram method_.

Put the vectors to be added 'tail to tail'. Complete the parallelogram. The resultant vector is the diagonal from the tail of the two vectors to the other vertex of the parallelogram.

### Example

Evaluate the resultant displacement of a ship which travels 30 km due north then 40 km due east.

north 40 km end point north north 30 km R start point

**Practice 3:**

Two forces act at a point P as shown below. Determine (magnitude and direction of) the resultant of these two forces.

**P** 25 N

48 N

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:10]

### LO(i) represent a vector as two perpendicular components

Since two vectors can be added to give a resultant vector, any vector can be broken up (or resolved) into two vectors or components. It is more convenient to resolve a vector into two mutually-perpendicular components through the use of trigonometry and Pythagoras theorem. Mutually-perpendicular vectors are independent of each other.

Each of the vectors above is resolved into two perpendicular components. A vector can be resolved into infinite pairs of perpendicular components. The choice of directions depends on the problem at hand.

### Practice 5:

An object rests on the plane of an inclined slope as shown. The weight \(W\) acts vertically down. Draw components of the weight

1. parallel to the slope
2. perpendicular (normal) to the slope.

Label the magnitude of the two components in terms of \(W\) and \(\theta\)

#### Practice 6 (step-by-step guide to finding the resultant force)

The 5 forces shown act on an object. Find the resultant force due to them.

\(\bullet\)

Resolve the vectors into two mutually perpendicular components:

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|} \hline
**Vector/N** & **x-component /N** & **y-component /N (+\(\uparrow\))** \\ \hline
100 & & \\ \hline
27 & & \\ \hline
90 & & \\ \hline
80 & & \\ \hline
52 & & \\ \hline Resultant & & \\ \hline \end{tabular}

#### 1. Draw vector diagram to show the resultant vector
3. Indicate the direction with an angle with reference to a certain direction on the diagram and calculate the angle.
4. Write a complete statement to specify the magnitude and direction of the resultant vector.

## 3 Errors and Uncertainties

Uncertainty is the range of values on both sides of a measurement in which the actual value of the measurement is expected to lie.

_Uncertainties_ in measured quantities arise from:

limitations of the observer;

limitations of the measuring instrument used,

limitations of the method used (the experimental design).

### Experimental Errors

Error is the difference between the measured value and the 'true value'.

For example, if the accepted value of acceleration due to gravity \(g\) at a certain location is 9.8 m s\({}^{-2}\). If an experimental determination yields a result of 9.9 m s\({}^{-2}\), the error is +0.1 m s\({}^{-2}\).

### Types of Experimental Errors

**LO(i)**: **show an understanding of the distinction between systematic errors (including zero errors) and random errors.**

In assessing errors, whether human or instrumental, there are two types of errors:

(1) systematic errors and (2) random errors

**Systematic errors** are present when the measured values produced errors of the same magnitude and sign.

They cannot be eliminated by averaging. However, they can be eliminated by careful design of an experiment, and good experimental techniques. They have the same magnitude and sign.

_(2) Random errors_ are present when the measured values produced errors of different magnitudes and signs. These readings are scattered about the mean value with no fixed pattern.

Examples of Random Errors:

\begin{tabular}{|p{113.8pt}|p{113.8pt}|p{113.8pt}|p{113.8pt}|} \hline
**Error Sources** & **Descriptions** & **Corrections** \\ \hline - Due to apparatus & \(\bullet\) zero errors on the scales of instruments & \(\bullet\) correct all measured readings by negating the error accordingly. & \(\bullet\) the error all recently. \\  & \(\bullet\) poor calibration of instruments & \(\bullet\) calibrate the instrument properly before experiment \\ \hline - Due to poor experiment-al technique & \(\bullet\) consistent parallax error which affect all the readings in the same way, for instance, taking readings off a scale from a fixed angle. & \(\bullet\) adopt the correct way to take reading: ensure that the _line of sight_ is _perpendicular_ to the measuring scale. \\ \hline - Due to external factors & \(\bullet\) _background radiation_ causes the count rate of your radioactive sample to be consistently higher than the true reading. & \(\bullet\) Take the external factor(s) into account and adjust all readings appropriately. For instance, measure the count rate of background radiation and subtract it from the readings. \\ \hline \end{tabular}

_(2) Random errors_ are present when the measured values produced errors of different magnitudes and signs. These readings are scattered about the mean value with no fixed pattern.

Examples of Random Errors:

\begin{tabular}{|p{113.8pt}|p{113.8pt}|p{113.8pt}|p{113.8pt}|} \hline
**Error Sources** & **Descriptions** & **Methods to reduce error** \\ \hline - Due to inability of observer to repeat his action precisely. & \(\bullet\) inconsistent reaction time when using stop watch to measure the period of an oscillation. & \(\bullet\) To reduce the random errors, take the time of 20 oscillations then find the mean period. \\ \hline - Due to environmental conditions like pressure, temperature. & \(\bullet\) fluctuations in the measurement (of length, time, current, etc.) & \(\bullet\) Random errors can be reduced by taking average of repeated readings. \\ \hline - Due to the limited sensitivity of instruments. & \(\bullet\) Precision of metre rule: vernier calliper: micrometer screw gauge: 0.01 mm & \(\bullet\) To measure the thickness of a coin with only a metre rule, the random errors can be reduced by determining the mean thickness of a stack of 10 identical coins. (Use a micrometer screw gauge if it is available). \\ \hline \end{tabular}

### _Distinguish between systematic and random errors using illustrations._

The figure shows a spread of readings caused by random errors; these are approximately centred about a mean value which coincides with the _true value_. If a systematic error is present, the mean value will be shifted.

The effects of random errors and of systematic errors appear in graphs as illustrated below.

### Precision and Accuracy

LO(k) show an understanding of the distinction between precision and accuracy.

The **precision** of a measurement is how close the experimental values are to each other.

Precision is also a term used to describe the level of uncertainty in an instrument's scale. Good precision means the readings are mostly very _close to each other_, and is associated with small random errors.

_Accuracy_ is the closeness of a reading on an instrument to the true value of the quantity being measured.

Good accuracy means the reading or the mean of a set of readings is very close to the true value, and is associated with small systematic errors.

**Illustration**:

The first few decimal places of the true value for the mathematical constant \(\pi\) are 3.142, and the accepted value for the speed of light in a vacuum is 2.99792458 x 10\({}^{8}\) m s-1.

Thus, 3.14 is an _accurate_ value for \(\pi\) to three digits _precision_, and 3.0 x 10\({}^{8}\) m s-1 is an _accurate_ value for the speed of light in a vacuum to two digits _precision_.

**Practice 7**

Student A carried out a series of experiments to obtain the value of the Earth's gravitational acceleration \(g\). He was very careless and did not take into account the mass of the mass holder. This resulted in all recorded values of the mass being smaller than the actual mass. He obtained the following values of \(g\):

\begin{tabular}{|p{113.8pt}|p{113.8pt}|p{113.8pt}|p{113.8pt}|p{113.8pt}|} \hline
**Reading/ m s\({}^{2}\)** & 10.33 & 10.32 & 10.31 & 10.30 & 10.29 \\ \hline \end{tabular}

Given that the actual value of \(g\) = 9.81 m s\({}^{2}\), comment on the accuracy and precision for this experiment.

**Practice 8**

Student B measured the gravitational constant \(g\) a number of times and got the following results

**Reading/ m s\({}^{2}\)** & **12.20** & **9.81** & **7.42** & **9.99** & **9.63** \\ \hline \end{tabular}

How do these results compare to those of Student A in worked example 1?

### Absolute and Relative (Fractional and Percentage) Uncertainties

#### 3.4.1 Absolute Uncertainty in a scale reading

* A scale reading is the single determination of a value at one point on a measuring scale.
* Generally a scale reading can be estimated to _half_ of the smallest division on a measuring scale (Not always true: this depends on the instruments used. More details will be taught during the Practical Sessions).
* The (actual or absolute) _uncertainty_ in the reading of an instrument is thus taken as _half the smallest division_. In the above illustration, the _absolute_ uncertainty is 0.05 cm.
* To indicate the magnitude of uncertainty, R\({}_{1}\)=10.40 cm in the above illustration is written as R\({}_{1}\) = (10.40 \(\pm\) 0.05) cm. This means that R\({}_{1}\) can take values in the range between 10.35 cm to 10.45 cm.
* The absolute uncertainty 0.05 cm is also known as the _maximum uncertainty_ in the reading.
* The absolute uncertainty should always be **rounded off to 1 significant figure only.**
* In general, all readings can be recorded in the form \(R\pm\Delta R\) in which \(\Delta R\) is the absolute uncertainty. \(R\) should be rounded to the **same number of decimal places as the uncertainty \(\Delta R\)**.**

For example (10.0 \(\pm\) 0.1) cm should _not_ be written as (10 \(\pm\) 0.1) cm

**Relative Uncertainties**

The uncertainty of a measured value can also be presented as a percent or a simple fraction.

(a) The fractional uncertainty of \(R=\frac{\Delta R}{R}\)

(b) The percentage uncertainty of \(R=\frac{\Delta R}{R}\times 100\%\)

For example, the measurement (208 \(\pm\) 1) mm,

**Absolute uncertainty = 1 mm (1 s.f.)**

**Fractional uncertainty = \(\frac{1}{208}=0.0048\) (2 s.f.)**

**Percentage uncertainty = 0.0048 x 100% = 0.48% (2 s.f.)**

Note that the absolute uncertainty has units and always to 1 s.f., whereas fractional and percentage uncertainties are ratios and are dimensionless and always to 1 or 2 s.f.

While the absolute uncertainty is an indication of the scale sensitivity of the measuring instrument used, the percentage uncertainty is useful to compare whether the error is negligible or significant.

**Practice 9**

A metre rule has a precision to 1 mm, vernier callpers to 0.1 mm and a micrometer screw gauge to 0.01 mm. If these instruments were to be used to measure the diameter of a wire which is 2.5 mm, what would be the respective percentage uncertainties?

**Practice 10**

A student makes measurements from which he calculates the speed of sound as 327.66 m s\({}^{-1}\). He estimates that his result contains a percentage error of \(\pm\) 3%. Give his result reduced to the appropriate number of significant figures.

#### 3.4.2 Propagation of Uncertainties

**LO (I) assess the uncertainty in a derived quantity by addition of actual, fractional or percentage uncertainties, or numerical substitution (a rigorous statistical treatment is not required).**

The result of an experiment is seldom obtained by a single measurement; very often it is obtained by measuring a few related quantities. The overall estimate of uncertainty is called the **consequential uncertainty**.

There are established statistical rules for calculation of consequential uncertainty from individual pieces of information. The A-level course only requires a simplified version of the statistical treatment.

The guiding principle in all cases is to consider the maximum uncertainty i.e. the worst case scenario.

**Basic Rules of Consequential Uncertainties at a Glance**

Suppose \(A\) and \(B\) are measured independent quantities, \(\Delta A\) and \(\Delta B\) are the corresponding (actual) uncertainties.

Given that \(n\) and \(m\) are numerical constants, e.g. \(\gamma_{2}\), \(3\), \(\pi\).

_Addition_

If \(R_{i}=A+B\), then \(\Delta R_{i}=\Delta A+\Delta B\)

_Subtraction_

If \(R_{2}=A-B\), then \(\Delta R_{2}=\Delta A+\Delta B\)

**Product**

If \(R_{4}=A\,x\,B\)

\(\frac{\Delta R_{4}}{R_{4}}=\frac{\Delta A}{A}+\frac{\Delta B}{B}\)

**Quotient**

If \(R_{5}=\frac{A}{B}\)

\(\frac{\Delta R_{5}}{R_{5}}=\frac{\Delta A}{A}+\frac{\Delta B}{B}\)

**Some common situations:**

1. If \(Z=mA+nB\), then \(\Delta\,Z=|m|\Delta A+|n|\Delta B\) Note: \(m\), \(n\) are numerical constants
2. If \(Z=kA^{m}\,B^{n}\), where \(k\) is a numerical constant, then \(\frac{\Delta\,Z}{Z}=\left|m\,\middle|\,\frac{\Delta\,A}{A}+\left|n\,\middle| \,\frac{\Delta\,B}{B}\right.\)
3. Other functions: e.g. \(Z=\sin A\), \(Z=\ln A\)

Use the general approach: \(\Delta Z=\gamma_{2}\) (\(Z_{\max}-Z_{\min}\))

**Propagation Rules of Consequential Uncertainties - Explained.**

**Additional and subtraction:**

Suppose we need to add the measurements \(A\): (\(20\pm 2\)) cm and \(B\): (\(10\pm 1\)) cm

The best estimate for the sum of these two measurements is

The smallest possible sum in adding these two measurements is

The largest possible sum in adding these two measurements is

Therefore, the range of possible sum ranges

The sum can be expressed as

Instead of going through the tedious steps like the above, apply the short-cut ruled Verify the rule for subtraction!

**Multiplication and division:**

Suppose you need to multiply A: (\(20\pm 2\)) cm by B: (\(10\pm 1\)) cm.

The best estimate of the product is

The smallest possible value would be

The largest reasonable value would be

The product must be

Check this rule for division for yourself.

**Practice 11:**

A rectangle has a length \(l=(34.3\pm 0.6)\) cm and breadth \(b=(21.8\pm 0.5)\) cm.

Calculate the perimeter \(P\) and area \(A\) of the rectangle and express their values with their absolute uncertainties.

**Practice 12:**

The formula for the period of a simple pendulum is \(T=2\pi\sqrt{\frac{I}{g}}\). Such a pendulum is used to determine g. The fractional error in the measurement of the period \(T\) is \(\pm x\) and in the measurement of the length \(I\) is \(\pm y\). Assume there is no other sources error, what is the fractional error in the calculated value of \(g\)?

For complicated functions of Z, we can use the first principle method of numerical substitution to find the max and min values.

Absolute uncertainty = \(\%\) (maximum possible value of Z - minimum possible value of Z)

\(\Delta\mathbb{Z}=\%\) (\(Z_{\max}-Z_{\min}\))

Or simply,

Absolute uncertainty = maximum possible value of Z - Z

\(\Delta\mathbb{Z}=Z_{\max}-Z\)

The difference in methods may result in slightly different uncertainty results. All answers are acceptable as long as the method is logical.

**Practice 13:**

Consider S = \(x\) cos \(\theta\) for x = (\(2.0\pm 0.2\)) cm, \(\theta\) = (\(53\pm 2\)) \({}^{\circ}\). Find S with its uncertainty.

## Appendix A National Measurement System

National Metrology Centre (NMC) is the custodian of the national physical measurement standards in Singapore and is responsible for establishing and maintaining the nation's highest level of physical measurement standards. This can be traced to the International System of Units (SI) established under the Metre Convention, a worldwide diplomatic treaty on metrology.

The way the standards are defined can be changed and Singapore will want to keep track of this development to ensure we meet the national standards. An example is the change in the way 1 kg is being defined.

Singapore has one of the hundred or so pieces that nations have purchased from BIPM2 to date. And this precious piece is housed inside the NMC. Singapore's prototype kilogram is actually a replica of the world's official 1 kg, also known as Le Grand K (the grand kilogram).

Footnote 2: Bureau International des Poids et Mesures (BIPM), the Paris-based agency that acts as the international custodian for weights and measures.

Singapore bought the piece in 2003, and it was hand-carried here from Paris. Scientists at NMC handle it more carefully than they would a baby. They use only tongs to pick it up. They wear gloves because the slightest trace of oil from their fingers would add weight to this 1 kg. Scales at the NMC lab go down to the microgram, or a millionth of a gram, so every trace matters.

Singapore's prototype kilogram outweighs Le Grand K by about 340 micrograms. So it's almost impossible to cast metals down to one microgram. Apparently, even Le Grand K is no longer a "perfect" kilogram. Over the course of a century, it has actually shed a few micrograms.

This development worries scientists who require precise definitions of the kilogram for other measurements such as voltage. The kilogram is the only base unit defined by an artefact. To eliminate the uncertainty raised by the current definitions, scientists have been studying how to redefine 1 kg using a natural constant called Planck constant.

Such precision might seem to be relevant only to scientists, but it has its place in everyday tasks too. For instance, Singapore's definitive 1 kg and stainless steel replicas are used to calibrate weighing scales in the pharmaceutical and petrochemical industries.

Precision is important for business, trade and life in general. After all, we would want to know that our medicines and chemicals are safe, and we should get no less than what we pay for.

### Redefining the SI units

In November 2018, at the General Conference on Weights and Measures, the global metrology community agreed a revision to the SI. The decision means that, for the first time, all seven of the base units will be defined in terms of constants of nature - such as the speed of light, the Planck constant and the Avogadro constant. Using seven defining constants as the basis for the SI will mean that the definitions of all the base units will stay stable into the future. The revision will bring in new definitions of the ampere, kilogram, kelvin (and, consequently, degree Celsius) and mole.

From May 2019, all the base units of the SI will be defined in terms of constants of nature - the most stable quantities we have ever encountered.

The kilogram is defined by taking the fixed numerical value of the Planck constant \(h\) to be 6.626 070 15 \(\times\) 10\({}^{-34}\) when expressed in the unit J s, which is equal to kg m\({}^{2}\) s\({}^{-1}\), where the metre and the second are defined in terms of \(c\) and \(\Delta\nu\). [_c_: speed of light in vacuum; \(\Delta\nu\): caesium frequency.]
