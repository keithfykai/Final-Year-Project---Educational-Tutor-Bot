## 6 Conclusion of Solution

### 6.1 Dilution

Mixing of two separate solutions can also result in dilution of the chemical species present.

### 6.2 Dilution Factor

It is a measure of how much the solution is diluted, and is given by the ratio of the volume after dilution to the original volume.

**Titrations**

**(Volumetric Analysis)**

**STANDARD SOLUTION**

A solution of **known concentration**.

**EQUIVALENCE POINT**

It marks the end of the titration when **reactants have just**

**created with each other according to the stoichiometric ratio. _It is the theoretical value_.

**END POINT**

It marks the end of the titration when the indicator in the titration has just changed its colour. _It is the experimental value_.

## General Learning Points for Titration

1. Washing - with distilled water for conical flask, and ONLY solution of interest for buret and pipette and FUNNEI
2. Perform the titration on a white tile for better colour change
3. Tabulation table of results (write in volumes in PENCIL separately first - do 3 titrations for approximate result):

\begin{tabular}{l|l|l|l} \hline Final buret reading / cm\({}^{3}\) & 25.20 & 35.20 \\ Initial buret reading / cm\({}^{3}\) & 0.00 & 10.00 \\ Volume of FAI (SPECIFY) used / cm\({}^{3}\) & 25.20 & 25.20 \\ Selected readings (\(\prime\)) & \(\prime\) & \(\prime\) \\ \hline \end{tabular}

Selecting readings: as long as readings are within 0.10cm\({}^{3}\) of each other, select TWO readings and calculate average reading using \(\frac{25.20\cdot 25.20}{2}=25.20\)cm\({}^{3}\)
## 5 Redox Titration

Using known concentration of thiosulfate (tire) to determine no. of moles of l\({}_{2}\) liberated from oxidising agent mixed with l'

### Common questions:

* _Explain the colour changes in the titration of thiosulfate with l\({}_{2}\) produced: Solution first turns from deep purple to reddish brown as the oxidising agent is reduced with l\({}_{2}\) is produced as more thiosulfate is added. the brown \(l\), solution turns yellow as thiosulfate reduces \(l\), \(t\) to \(t\) (downless) and there is less \(s\), \(t\) in the metric. When starch is added, it forms a blue-black complex with l\({}_{2}\); remarkably turns colourless as all the l is reduced by thiosulfate
* _Suggest why the l\({}_{2}\) produced must be immediately titrated with thiosulfate: l\({}_{2}\) is a volatile compound and easily vaporizer out of the conical flask, resulting in decreased no. of moles of l\({}_{2}\) present_
* _Explain why it is not necessary to measure the volume of sulfuric acid accurately using a pipette: Sulfate acid in the experiment is used to provide an acidic medium and does not undergo a REDOX reaction / sulfuric acid in excess_
* _Reasons why excess acid in solution must be neutralise: Sodium thiosulfate reacts with acid to form sulfur and other products hence three volume of thiosulfate required would increase to more than expected_
