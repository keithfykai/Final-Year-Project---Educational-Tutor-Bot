Representation

A magnetic field can be represented by field lines drawn such that:

of a magnetic

field

the tangent to a field line at a point gives the direction of \(B\) at that point,

and

the number of lines per unit cross-sectional area is!proportional?to the magnitude of \(B\)! If the field is uniform, the field lines are evenly spaced.

the arrows point away from the!N-pole of a magnet toward the S-pole. This is because the direction of the field is given by the direction of the force that acts on the north magnetic pole of a magnet.

* The Earth's magnetic field is a weak magnetic field believed to be caused by electric currents circulating within the core of the Earth.
* The magnitude and direction of this field varies with position over the Earth's surface and changes gradually with time.
* It is known that the axis of the Earth's magnetic field is approximately tilted 11 \({}^{\circ}\) with respect to its rotational axis. Hence, the geographical North does not coincide exactly with the magnetic North.
* The field pattern is similar to that of a bar magnet embedded deep inside the centre of the Earth.
* The north of a compass needle points towards the Earth's magnetic North pole (because the north end of a compass needle is attracted to the south of a bar magnet).

* From the field pattern, it can be seen that, near the equator, the Earth's magnetic field, \(B_{\rm Earth}\), is almost horizontal.
* At all other positions, the \(B_{\rm Earth}\) is inclined at various angles (called the _angle of inclination,_\(\alpha\)) from the horizontal.

It is convenient to resolve \(B_{\rm Earth}\) into horizontal and vertical components.

* Instruments such as compass needles whose motion is confined in a horizontal plane are affected only by \(B_{\rm H}\).

Selenoids and Geotechnologies

A bar of iron can be magnetized by placing it inside a solenoid. When a current passes through the solenoid, it produces a magnetic field along its axis and the bar is magnetized accordingly. The resultant magnetic field is the sum of the field due to the current and that due to the iron core so that the magnitude of the resultant field can have a magnitude hundreds to thousands times that due to the current alone.

Fig. 12:

_Relay:_

This is a switch worked by an electromagnet. It is useful if we want a small current in one circuit to control another circuit containing a device such as a lamp, electric bell or motor which requires a large current.

The structure of a relay is shown in Fig. 13. When the controlling current flows through the coil, the soft iron core is magnetized and attracts the L-shaped soft iron armature. This rocks on its pivot and closes the electrical contacts in the circuit being controlled.

Fig. 13:The magnetic force is always perpendicular to the direction of the current and the direction of the magnetic field.

The relative directions of current, field and force are summarized by _Fleming's Left-Hand Rule_. It states that _if the thumb and first two fingers of the left hand are put mutually at right-angles,_

* _the first finger is pointed in the direction of the field_
* _while the second finger is in the direction of the current,_
* _then the thumb gives the direction of the force or motion._

If the wire is placed parallel to the field the force drops to zero. In the general case, if the conductor makes an angle \(\theta\) with the field (see Fig. 16(a)), the force can be regarded as due to the _component_ of the field _perpendicular_ to the current (\(B\)\(sin\)\(\theta\))_; the component parallel to the current produces no force.

Figure 17: A wire frame ABCD is balanced on 2 pivots through which a current \(I\) from a d.c. source enters from P and leaves from Q.

Figure 19: When a steady current passes through the coil, a magnetic force acts on sides PS and QR, which are at right angles to the field lines.

Using Fleming's Left Hand Rule, the force on PS is opposite to the force on QR. The 2 forces provide a torque (turning effect) on the coil. Hence, the coil is acted upon by a couple due to the magnetic force on both sides as shown in Fig. 19. This is the principle behind moving-coil meters and motors.

Let us take a closer look to determine an expression for the torque on a coil.

Fig. 20 shows the same coil PQRS placed in a uniform magnetic field \(B\) such that the vertical sides are \(90^{\circ}\) to the field while the horizontal sides make an angle \(\theta\) to the field. Assume the coil has \(N\) turns and its horizontal and vertical sides are of length \(x\) and \(y\) respectively.

When current flows in the coil, each side of the coil experiences a force.

The forces on the horizontal sides of the coil (PQ and SR) do not give rise to a turning effect but simply distort the coil.

The forces on the vertical sides (PS and QR), each of length \(y\), are opposite in direction and equal in magnitude, given by \(F\) = \(NBIy\).

Whatever the position of the coil, its vertical sides are at right angles to the magnetic field and so the force \(F\) remains constant in magnitude.

The forces constitute a(counter whose torque \(r\) is given by

(one force) \(\times\) (perpendicular distance between lines of action of forces)

\(=Fx\cos\theta\)

\(=NBIy\times\cos\theta\)

where \(A\) = area of the coil = \(xy\)

\(\tau\) is maximum when \(\theta\) = \(0^{\circ}\), i.e. when the plane of the coil is parallel to \(B\).

\(\tau\) is zero when \(\theta\) = \(90^{\circ}\), i.e. when the plane of the coil is perpendicular to \(B\).

 coil receives direction after half cycle = to provide continuous motion \(i.l\) direction, the current inside loop multi periodically reverse direction

Current leaving in opposite directions

Consider 2 infinitely long parallel vertical wires X and Y carrying currents \(I_{t}\) and \(I_{2}\) flowing in opposite directions, separated by a distance \(d\).

The current in X produces a magnetic field at wire Y given by

\[B_{X}=\frac{\mu_{o}I_{t}}{2\pi d}\]

At Y, the direction of the field due to X is perpendicular to Y (see Fig. 24 (a)). Using Fleming's Left-Hand Rule, the magnetic force on a length \(L\) of Y would be away from X and has a magnitude of

\[F_{X\,\text{on}\,Y}=B_{X}I_{2}L=\left(\frac{\mu_{o}I_{t}}{2\pi d}\right)I_{2}L \qquad\frac{\mu_{t}}{\text{Tr}}\,\text{corult}_{\text{max}}\]

Similarly, the magnetic force on a length \(L\) of X is away from Y and has a magnitude of

\[F_{Y\,\text{on}\,X}=B_{Y}I_{2}L=\left(\frac{\mu_{o}I_{2}}{2\pi d}\right)I_{2}L\]

By Newton's Third Law, \(F_{X\,\text{on}\,Y}\) and \(F_{Y\,\text{on}\,X}\) are equal and opposite forces. The 2 wires repel one another.

The force per unit length on each wire is given by

\[\frac{F}{L}=\frac{\mu_{o}I_{t}I_{2}}{2\pi d}\]
