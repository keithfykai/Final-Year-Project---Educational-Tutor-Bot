## Introduction to Organic Chemistry

* **What is Organic Chemistry?**
* It is the study of the chemistry of carbon compounds other than its oxides, metallic carbonates and related compounds.
* More than 6 million organic compounds have been identified. This ability of carbon to form so many stable compounds is because (i) strong bonds can be formed between two carbon atoms, e.g. C-C bond is much stronger compared to single bonds formed between atoms of other elements. This allows carbon to form long chains (catenation) and rings, resulting in a wide variety of possible molecules. (ii) carbon is tetravalent, which allows branching of carbon chains into side chains and formation of double or triple bonds, further increasing the number of carbon compounds which can be formed. (iii) carbon forms strong covalent bonds with other elements, e.g. H, N, O, S and the halogens.

## 2 Formulae of Organic Compounds

* **Empirical formula** shows the **simplest ratio** of the atoms of the different elements present in the compound. E.g. C\({}_{2}\)H\({}_{4}\)O
* **Molecular formula** shows the **actual number** of atoms of each element present in one molecule of the compound. E.g. C\({}_{4}\)H\({}_{8}\)O\({}_{2}\)
* **Constitutional formula (structural formula)** shows how the constituent atoms of a molecule are **joined together**. E.g. CH\({}_{3}\)CH\({}_{2}\)CH\({}_{2}\)CO\({}_{2}\)H and (CH\({}_{3}\))\({}_{2}\)CHCO\({}_{2}\)H have different structural formulae but the same molecular formula of C\({}_{4}\)H\({}_{8}\)O\({}_{2}\).
* **Displayed formula or full structural formula** is the detailed structure of a molecule showing the arrangement of the atoms and **all the bonds** between them.

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:8]

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:9]

**Note:**

Each carbon atom in C\({}_{6}\)H\({}_{6}\) forms three sigma and one pi bonds.

\(\%\) Number of hybrid orbitals: 3

\(\%\) Number of p orbitals: 1

\(\%\) Type of hybridisation: sp\({}^{2}\)

\(\%\) Shape: trigonal planar around each carbon atom, bond angle = 120\({}^{\circ}\)

Hence, benzene has a **planar** structure in which the six carbon atoms are bonded in a **regular hexagonal ring**.

\(\%\) Sigma bond formation: each C-H bond is formed by the head-on overlap of **sp\({}^{2}\) hybrid orbital of C with 1s orbital of H** and the C-C bond is formed by the head-on overlap of **sp\({}^{2}\) hybrid orbital of each C**

\(\%\) Pi bond formation: carbon-carbon pi bond is formed by the side-on overlap of **2p\({}_{2}\) orbital** of each C with the adjacent **2p\({}_{2}\) orbitals on either side of it**

This results in two continuous doughnut-shaped electron clouds, **one above and the other below the plane of the atoms**.

**Note:**

(i) The pi electrons move over a larger region of space in the actual structure of benzene, as compared to the Kekule structure. The **pi electrons** are said to be **delocalised around the whole ring** and this phenomenon is known as **resonance**.

(ii) Each C-C bond in benzene is a **partial double bond** and is **identical** to one another.

(iii) Structure of benzene is more accurately presented as \(\bigcirc\) where the circle represents the delocalisation of six pi electrons.

\(\bullet\) Ethyne, C\({}_{2}\)H\({}_{2}\)Displayed formula: H-C=C-H

Each carbon atom in C2H2 forms two sigma and two pi bonds.

Number of hybrid orbitals: 2

Number of p orbitals: 2

Type of hybridisation: sp

Shape: linear around each carbon atom, bond angle = 180\({}^{\circ}\)

Sigma bond formation: each C-H bond is formed by the head-on overlap of **sp hybrid orbital of C with 1s orbital of H** and the C-C bond is formed by the head-on overlap of **sp hybrid orbital of each C**

Pi bond formation: one carbon-carbon pi bond is formed by the side-on overlap of **2p\({}_{\gamma}\) orbital** of each C **laterally** and the other carbon-carbon pi bond is formed by the side-on overlap of **2p\({}_{z}\) orbital** of each C **laterally**

Pi electron cloud forms a cylindrical sheath around the axis joining the carbon atoms.

## 7 Reaction Mechanisms

### Types of Reagents

\begin{tabular}{|p{142.3pt}|p{142.3pt}|} \hline Candidates should be able to: & \\ (b) & interpret, and use the following terminology associated with organic reactions: & \\ (vi) & electrophile (Lewis acid), nucleophilic (Lewis base) \\ \hline \end{tabular}

* An organic reaction is usually conceptualised as follows. 

Depending on their nature, the **carbon atom of the functional group** of organic molecules are attacked by different types of reagents. There are three main classes of reagents.
* **Nucleophiles (Lewis bases)*
* are **electron-rich*
* species with a **lone pair of electrons*
* which can be **donated*
* to form a new bond.
* can be anions, e.g. OH, CN, C, Br, I or neutral molecules, e.g. NH3, H2O, RNH2, ROH.
* **Electrophiles (Lewis acids)*
* are **electron-poor*
* species capable of **accepting an electron pair*
* to form a new bond.
* can be cations, e.g. H+, Br+, Cl+, NO2+, R+ or neutral molecules, e.g. H-Cl, H-Br, H-I, H2SO4 (H and S atoms have \(\delta\)+ charge, which render the reagent electrophilic).
* **Free radicals*
* are species with an **unpaired*
* electron, e.g. *Cl, CH3 (methyl radical).
* are **highly reactive*
* species due to the presence of the unpaired electron.
* Organic molecules can undergo the following modes of attack. 

Organic reactant contains electron-poor centre, typically a **carbon bonded to an electronegative atom**. E.g. 

**All** organic compounds which contain C-H bonds. **Note:** While all organic compounds can be attacked by free radicals, this type of reaction is only of importance for **alkanes** which are relatively unreactive and hence cannot be attacked by other species.

Question: Can C_I_-_C_I undergo heterolytic cleavage?

Answer: Yes. When _C_I_\({}_{2}\) reacts with an alkene, it undergoes heterolytic cleavage.

Question: Can HC_I_ undergo homolytic cleavage?

Answer: Yes.

Question: How would I know if a bond can undergo homolytic or heterolytic cleavage?

Answer: If the right amount of energy is supplied for heterolytic cleavage, then the bond will not undergo homolytic cleavage and vice versa.

## 8 Factors Affecting Reactivity of Organic Compounds

Candidates should be able to:

(c)  interpret, and use the following terminology associated with organic reactivities:

(i)  delocalisation

(ii)  electronic effect (electron-donating and electron-withdrawing effect)

(iii)  steric effect (steric hindrance)

## 9 **Delocalisation of pi electrons (resonance effect)**

In molecules with **alternate double and single bonds**, it is possible for **three or more adjacent p orbitals** to overlap with one another. This allows the pi electrons to move over a greater region in space, i.e. the **pi electrons are delocalised**, and results in **extra stability** as more resonance structures exist. E.g. benzene

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:17]

* Strength of inductive effect increases with increasing number of groups present and decreases with increasing distance between the group and the charge.
* **Electron-donating** inductive effect of alkyl group **disperses positive charge** of carbocation, thus **stabilising** it.

As **more alkyl groups** are attached to C with positive charge, strength of inductive effect increases and charge is dispersed to a greater extent. Hence, **carbocation becomes more stable**.

* **Electron-withdrawing** inductive effect of -C_I_ **disperses negative charge** of carboxylate ion, thus **stabilising** it.

As **C_I_ **atom gets nearer to the negative charge, strength of inductive effect increases and charge is dispersed to a greater extent. Hence, **carboxylate ion becomes more stable**.

* **Making Thinking Visible**

* With reference to the above example, arrange CH\({}_{2}\)C/CH\({}_{2}\)CH\({}_{2}\)CO\({}_{2}\)H, CH\({}_{3}\)CHC/CH\({}_{2}\)CO\({}_{2}\)H and CH\({}_{3}\)CH\({}_{2}\)CHC/CO\({}_{2}\)H in increasing \(K_{\text{s}}\) value.
* Increasing \(K_{\text{s}}\) value: CH\({}_{2}\)C/CH\({}_{2}\)CH\({}_{2}\)CO\({}_{2}\)H < CH\({}_{3}\)CHC/CH\({}_{2}\)CO\({}_{2}\)H < CH\({}_{3}\)CH\({}_{2}\)CHC/CO\({}_{2}\)H The more stable the anion, the stronger is the acid, the greater the \(K_{\text{s}}\) value (or smaller the pK\({}_{\text{s}}\) value).
* **Steric effect (steric hindrance)**

This refers to the **steric hindrance** which occurs when **large groups** on a molecule 'get in the way' and thus hinder the reaction.

* 2,6-dimethylbenzoic acid is resistant to normal methods of esterification because of the steric hindrance of the adjacent methyl groups which hinders the reaction of CO\({}_{2}\)H group.

* reaction: It involves **reaction with water*
* and is usually catalysed by acids or bases. (Water molecule is broken up.)
* **Oxidation reaction: It involves a gain of oxygen or loss of hydrogen in a compound. E.g. CH\({}_{3}\)CH\({}_{2}\)OH + 2[O] \(\rightarrow\) CH\({}_{3}\)CO\({}_{2}\)H + H\({}_{2}\)O**
* **Reduction** reaction: It involves a **gain of hydrogen or loss of oxygen** in a compound. E.g. CH\({}_{3}\)CH\({}_{2}\)COCH\({}_{3}\) + 2[H] \(\rightarrow\) CH\({}_{3}\)CH\({}_{2}\)CH(OH)CH\({}_{3}\)

(e) **Factors affecting reactivity of organic compounds**

(i) **Delocalisation of pi electrons (resonance effect)**

The six p orbitals of the benzene carbon atoms overlap sideways with one another, causing the **pi electrons** to be **delocalised** over the whole ring and conferring **stability** on the molecule.

(ii) **Electronic effect (electron-donating and electron-withdrawing inductive effect)**

Electron-donating groups stabilise cations while electron-withdrawing groups stabilise anions.

**Strength** of inductive effect **increases with increasing number of groups and decreases with increasing distance** from atom with the charge.

Examples:

(1) **Stability of carbocations:**

(2) **Alkyl group exerts **electron-donating inductive effect**, hence **disperses positive charge** and **stabilises carbocations**. **Greater number** of alkyl groups attached to C with positive charge, hence **stronger** inductive effect exerted.

(3) **Stability of carboxylate ions:**

(iii) **Steric effect (steric hindrance)**

**Steric hindrance occurs when **large groups** on a molecule 'get in the way' and thus hinder the reaction. Steric effect refers to the effect on a molecule, a reaction, etc. due to the size of atoms or groups.

N2010/P1/Q19 (modified)

The bond lengths in propyne differ from those which might be expected.

The carbon-carbon bond length in ethane (CH\({}_{3}\)CH\({}_{3}\)) is 0.154 nm and in ethyne (CH\(\equiv\)CH) is 0.120 nm. The single C2-C3 bond in propyne, however, is shorter than the single bond in ethane: it is 0.146 nm.

What helps to explain this C2-C3 bond length in propyne?

AIt has a partial sp\({}^{2}\)-sp\({}^{2}\) character.

BIt is an sp-sp\({}^{3}\) overlap.

CThe sp\({}^{3}\)-sp\({}^{3}\) bonding is pulled shorter by a p-p (\(\pi\)-bond) overlap.

DThe electrons in the C3 carbon atom are attracted towards the \(\pi\)-bonds between C1 and C2.
