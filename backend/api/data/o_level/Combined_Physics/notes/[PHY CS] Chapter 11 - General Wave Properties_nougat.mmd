WAVE MOTION

WAVE MOTION

A wave motion is a method of transferring energy from one point to another, without any physical transfer of material.

The hand generates kinetic energy, hence it is the source.

The kinetic energy is transferred in the form of a wave motion to the other end of the rope.

Kinetic energy is transferred but the rope is unchanged.

There are two types of waves: **transverse waves & longitudinal waves.**

## Transverse Waves

Transverse waves are waves whose particles vibrate in a direction perpendicular to the direction of the wave motion.

_Examples:_

- Water waves

- Electromagnetic waves (_learn more in chapter "electromagnetic waves"_)

- Light waves

- Radio waves

-

*Please understand the particle **never** moved sideways.

(assuming transverse wave)

It only moves up and down. Over time, the graph captures that cycle.

Note how the particle is actually the **driver**

The wave, however, is travelling between.

Hence, the direction of condition of the particle is **s** representative to the wave travel.

## Displacement-distance graph

(_AKA as displacement-position graph_)

A displacement-distance graph shows the displacement of particles at one specific instance.

_It is like taking a photograph, capturing how the particles are all at different positions at one particular point in time. This long stream of particles arrange themselves in such a way, forming a wave motion._

_(Think of Kallang vowel The wave is formed by stream of people's varying postions.)_

## Key analysis:

You can identify the **wavelength** and the **amplitude** from displacement-position graphs.

* Remember that one wavelength is distance between 2 points in phase.

## 6 Bonus killer question review

The diagram show a water wave moving from a deep region to a shallow region. Why does the wavelength, \(\mathbf{\lambda}\), changes?

## 7 Explanation

As water waves moves from a deeper region to a shallower region, the wavelength changes.

As the water waves approach the **shallower region**, it experiences **more friction**.

As a result, the **wave speed, \(\mathbf{v}\), is reduced**.

Since,

\[\mathbf{v}=\mathbf{\beta}\]

When \(\mathbf{v}\) is lowered, the wavelength, \(\mathbf{\lambda}\), is also lowered.

Hence, **as water waves moves from a deep region to a shallower region, its wavelength shortens.**

*Please note that the frequency is unchanged as the frequency is dependable only on the source of the wave motion.
