#### Displacement and Distance

**Displacement** is the straight line distance from the start to the finish point in that direction.

We typically denote position vectors using \(s\) with respect to an origin. Then the displacement (or change in displacement) can be \(\Delta s=S_{\text{final}}-S_{\text{initial}}\).

**Example 1**

A car travels on a straight horizontal road. It starts moving at time \(t=t_{1}\) and comes to a stop momentarily at \(t=t_{2}\). It then reverses and comes to a stop again at \(t=t_{3}\).

Taking rightwards direction as positive, state the (a) total distance travelled, and (b) displacement of the car with respect to origin \(x=0\).

**Note:** It is quite conventional to take rightwards as positive for horizontal motion and upwards as positive for vertical motion. It is equally conventional to take the direction _normal_ and _away_ from an inclined surface as positive displacement from the surface. It is always clearer to include a sketch or a phrase of how you define your convention.

**Example 2**

From point A, a car travelled 300 m towards the east to point B. It then travelled 400 m north to point C. Calculate the total distance it travelled and its displacement from its starting position.

\begin{tabular}{l l} distance travelled & \(=\text{AB}+\text{BC}=300+400\) \\  & \(=700\) m \\ displacement & \(=\text{AC}=\sqrt{300^{2}+400^{2}}\) \\  & \(=500\) m \\ \end{tabular}

\begin{tabular}{l l} \(\text{tan}\theta=\dfrac{400}{300}\) \\ \(\theta=53.1^{\circ}\) \\ \end{tabular}

\begin{tabular}{l l} displacement of car is \\ **[magnitude]** 500 m, \\ **[direction]** 53.1\({}^{\circ}\) north of east (or bearing of 36.9\({}^{\circ}\)) \\ \end{tabular}

**Note**: Reminder to give both magnitude and direction for vector quantities such as displacement.

#### 2.1.2 Velocity and Speed

\begin{tabular}{l l} \(\text{Velocity}\) is & **Speed** is \\ the rate of change of & \\ displacement. & & the rate of change of \\ distance. & & Velocity is a vector quantity and so \\  & & has magnitude and direction. \\ \end{tabular}

\begin{tabular}{l l} \(\text{V}=\dfrac{ds}{dt}\) & \(s\) & : displacement (m) \\ \(t\) & : time (s) \\ \(\nu\) & : velocity (m s\({}^{\text{-1}}\)) \\ \end{tabular}

\begin{tabular}{l l} displacement \(s\) \\ \end{tabular}

\begin{tabular}{l l} \(\text{average speed}=\dfrac{\text{total distance travelled}}{\text{total time}}\) \\ \(\text{average velocity}\left\langle\text{v}\right\rangle=\dfrac{\Delta s}{ \Delta t}=\dfrac{\text{displacement}}{\text{total time}}=\dfrac{S_{\text{real}}-S_{\text{real}}}{ \Delta t}\) \\ \end{tabular}

The gradient of the tangent to the graph at \(t_{i}\) gives the instantaneous velocity.

When we refer simply to velocity, we generally mean the (instantaneous) velocity at that point in time.

#### 2.1.3 Acceleration

Acceleration is the rate of change of velocity. : velocity (m s\({}^{\text{-1}}\))

\(t\): time (s)

\(a\): acceleration (m s\({}^{\text{-2}}\))

Acceleration is a vector quantity and has direction.

Deceleration refers to decreasing speed, regardless of direction.

Average acceleration can be found by

average acceleration \(\left\langle a\right\rangle=\dfrac{\text{change in velocity}}{\text{time taken}}=\dfrac{\nu_{\text{real}}-\nu_{\text{radial}}}{\Delta t}\)The car speeds up whenever acceleration is in the same direction as the velocity. It slows down when its acceleration is opposite to its velocity.

**Example 6**: In the displacement-time graph as shown,

(a) Explain whether the object is at rest at \(t\) = 0.

(b) State the time when the object is at rest.

(c) Determine the velocity at \(t\) = 20.0 s.

**Solution:**

(a) No. Gradient represents velocity, gradient is not zero at \(t\) = 0 s.

(b) Gradient represents velocity, gradient is zero at \(t\) = 37.0 s.

(c) Gradient represents velocity

\(\nu_{t=20}\) s = \(\frac{s_{1}-s_{2}}{t_{1}-t_{2}}\)

\(=\frac{360-0}{36.0-6.5}\)

\(=12.2\) m s\({}^{-1}\)

**Note**: We read graphs accurate to half the smallest square.

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:9]

**Example 8**

Car A moves at a constant velocity of 20 m s\({}^{-1}\). At \(t=0\), A passes a Car B which is starting from rest and accelerating at 1.5 m s\({}^{-2}\) until it reaches and maintains a constant speed of 30 m s\({}^{-1}\).

B overtakes A subsequently. Both cars are moving in the same direction at all time.

Find how far A moves after it passes B and before it is overtaken by B.

**Solution:**

Let \(t_{\text{\tiny{caus}}}\) be the time B reaches its constant speed of 30 m s\({}^{-1}\), and

\(t_{\text{\tiny{pass}}}\) be the time that B overtakes A.

Gradient of velocity-time graph represents acceleration. Since acceleration is constant,

\(\alpha=\frac{\Delta\nu}{t_{\text{\tiny{caus}}}}\)

\(t_{\text{\tiny{caus}}}=\frac{\Delta\nu}{a}=\frac{30-0}{1.5}=20\) s

When B catches up with A, displacement of B = displacement of A area under graph B = area under graph A

\(\frac{1}{2}(t_{\text{\tiny{caus}}})(30)+\big{(}t_{\text{\tiny{pass}}}-t_{ \text{\tiny{caus}}}\big{)}(30)=\big{(}t_{\text{\tiny{pass}}}\big{)}(20)\)

\(\frac{1}{2}(20)(30)+\big{(}t_{\text{\tiny{pass}}}-20\big{)}(30)=\big{(}t_{ \text{\tiny{pass}}}\big{)}(20)\)

\(t_{\text{\tiny{pass}}}=30\) s

distance = (speed)(time) = (20)(30)

= 600 m

_Alternatively (using the formula for trapezium):_

\(\frac{1}{2}\big{[}\big{(}t_{\text{\tiny{pass}}}-20\big{)}+t_{\text{\tiny{pass }}}\big{]}\) 30 = 20t_{\text{\tiny{pass}}}\)

\(30t_{\text{\tiny{pass}}}\) - 300 = 20t_{\text{\tiny{pass}}}\)

\(\text{\tiny{pass}}=30\) s

Distance = \(20\times 30\) = 600 m

#### 2.2.3 Describing Motion Graphs

In general (within and beyond this topic), when approaching a graph:

\begin{tabular}{l l l} First, **segment** the graph & : & You can consider "cutting up" a graph \\ into different regions & * & where the quantity reaches 0 \\  & * & where the quantity reaches a turning point \\  & * & where the gradient of the quantity abruptly changes ("not \\  & & smooth" \\ Second, describe change & : & Is the value generally increasing or generally decreasing? \\ in the **y-values** \\ Third, & describe the & : & Is the graph increasing/decreasing _at an increasing/decreasing rate_? \\  & & What does the gradient represent? \\  & & e.g. gradient represents rate of change of velocity: acceleration \\ Fourth, & does **area under** & : & e.g. area under velocity-time graph gives displacement \\
**graph** represent anything & & \\ \end{tabular}

\begin{tabular}{l l l} **Time interval 1:** The object moves in the positive direction, with speed increasing uniformly. \\
**Time interval 2:** The object moves in the positive direction, with speed decreasing uniformly, until it comes to a momentary stop. \\
**Time interval 3:** The object moves in the negative direction, with speed increasing uniformly. \\
**Time interval 4:** The object moves in the negative direction, with constant speed. \\
**Time interval 5:** The object moves in the negative direction, with speed decreasing at an increasing rate. \\ \end{tabular}

#### 2.2.3.1 Motion Graphs of a Bouncing Ball

Consider a ball released from a height \(h\) above the floor that encounters no air resistance.

##### Buncing Ball undergoing Elastic Collisions with Ground

Elastic Collision implies that the kinetic energy after collision with the ground is the same as the kinetic energy before collision.

#### 2.2.3.1 Motion Graphs of a Bouncing Ball

Consider a ball released from a height \(h\) above the floor that encounters no air resistance.

##### Buncing Ball undergoing Elastic Collisions with Ground

Elastic Collision implies that the kinetic energy after collision with the ground is the same as the kinetic energy before collision.

When the ball is not touching the ground, it is in free fall. As the only force acting on the ball is its weight, it experiences a constant downwards acceleration of \(g\).

Since gradient of velocity-time graph is acceleration, the gradient is constant throughout free fall and acceleration-time graph has a constant magnitude.

The area of the v-t graph for the part when the ball travels upwards is the same as the part when it travels downwards since it is the same distance covered by the ball.

During the short time interval of contact with the ground, net force on ball becomes upwards, hence acceleration becomes positive.

### Equations of Motion

When a body undergoes constant acceleration and motion in a straight line, we can apply kinematics equations to work with its displacement, velocity, acceleration and time interval during its motion.

\(\nu=u+\alpha t\)\(\nu^{2}=u^{2}+2\alpha s\)\(s:\) displacement\(u:\) initial velocity\(\nu:\) final velocity\(s=\frac{1}{2}(u+\nu)t\)\(s=ut+\frac{1}{2}at^{2}\)\(t:\) time\(s:\) displacement\(u:\) initial velocity\(\nu:\) final velocity\(a:\) acceleration\(t:\) time\(s=\frac{1}{2}(u+\nu)t=\frac{1}{2}(u+\nu)\bigg{(}\frac{\nu-u}{a}\bigg{)}=\frac{1}{2a} \big{(}\nu^{2}-u^{2}\big{)}\)\(\nu^{2}=u^{2}+2\alpha s\)

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:18]

**Solution:**

Take upwards as positive,

(a) velocity is zero at maximum height

From A to B:

\(\nu=u+at\)

\(0=10.0+\big{(}-9.81\big{)}t\)

\(t=1.02\) s

\(a\)

(b) From A to B:

\(\nu^{2}=u^{2}+2as\)

\(0=10.0^{2}+2\big{(}-9.81\big{)}s_{\max}\)

\(s_{\max}=5.10\) m

(c) From A to C:

\(s=ut+\frac{1}{2}at^{2}\)

\(-20.0=10t+\frac{1}{2}\big{(}-9.81\big{)}t^{2}\)

\(t=3.28\) s or \(-1.24\) s (reject)

(d) From A to C:

\(\nu^{2}=u^{2}+2as\)

\(\nu=\sqrt{10.0^{2}+2\big{(}-9.81\big{)}\big{(}-20.0\big{)}}\)

\(=22.2\) m s\({}^{-1}\) or \(-\) 22.2 m s\({}^{-1}\)

speed = 22.2 m s\({}^{-1}\)

**Note:** For (d) we can quote the _speed_ as the magnitude found. However, if asked for velocity we should reject the positive value because the stone is falling towards the ground moving along the negative direction.

**Example 10 (cont'd)**

Hence, sketch the variation of displacement, velocity and acceleration with time of the stone.

**Solution:**

**Note: the displacement graph is symmetric about the highest height to \(s=0\).**

#### Solving 2D Kinematics (Projectile Motion)

Near the Earth's surface, gravitational force acts on all masses and at all times. In this uniform gravitational field, masses accelerate towards the centre of the earth with constant acceleration \(g=9.81\) m s\({}^{2}\).

When the only force acting on a mass is gravitational force (ignoring air resistance), the mass is said to be in free fall.

Also, if air resistance is negligible, then any horizontal velocity will remain constant, resulting in a parabola / parabolic path like that of Ball B.

The \(x\)**-direction** and \(y\)**-direction** motions of a projectile are **independent** of each other.

Projectile motion can be analysed by:

* Resolving displacement, velocity and acceleration vectors into their horizontal and vertical components
* Applying kinematics equations in each direction independently and separately
* In the horizontal direction, since there is no horizontal acceleration, the kinematics equation is reduced to only one equation: \(s_{x}=u_{x}t\)
* Exploiting symmetry in the parabolic path i.e. the angle \(\theta\) and speed will be the same for any two points which are at the same height of path
* Recalling that the time taken \(t\) is the same for both motion descriptions because they are describing the same motion path

**Example 11**

A basketball player 2.0 m tall is standing on the floor 10.0 m from the basket. The top of the basket is 3.05 m from the floor. He throws the ball at an angle of 40.0\({}^{\circ}\) above the horizontal.

Find the initial speed of the ball so that it scores without striking the backboard.

**Solution:**

Take upwards and rightwards as positive,

Take \(s_{y}=0\) at 2 m above ground

consider horizontal motion:

\(s_{x}=u_{x}t\)

\(t=\frac{s_{x}}{u_{x}}=\frac{10.0}{u\,\cos\left(40.0^{\circ}\right)}\)

consider vertical motion

\(s_{y}=u_{y}t+\frac{1}{2}a_{y}t^{2}\)

\(1.05=\left[u\,\sin\left(40.0^{\circ}\right)\right]\left(\frac{10.0}{u\,\cos \left(40.0^{\circ}\right)}\right)+\frac{1}{2}\left(-9.81\right)\left(\frac{10. 0}{u\,\cos\left(40.0^{\circ}\right)}\right)^{2}\)

\(u=10.7\) m s\({}^{-1}\)

**Note:** here we used the fact that time taken for both the horizontal and vertical motion is same.

**Some features about the graphs:**

1. _During the upwards motion, gradient of B is steeper than A_ * gravitational force and air resistance both acts downwards * downwards net force is larger than gravitational force so larger acceleration
2. _During the downwards motion, gradient of B is less steep than A_ * gravitational force acts downwards while air resistance acts upwards * downwards net force is smaller than gravitational force so smaller acceleration _Consequence of 1 & 2_:**

* for same vertical distance, upwards motion takes less time than downwards motion
3. _At maximum height (_vv_= 0), gradient of both graphs same at_ \(q\) = 9.81m s\({}^{-2}\) * magnitude of air resistance increases with relative speed of object. * at maximum height, the ball is momentarily at rest so no air resistance * net force equals gravitational force
4. _Area under graph (max height reached) for upward motion is smaller for B_ * with no air resistance all kinetic energy is converted to gravitational potential energy * with air resistance, some kinetic energy is lost as work done against air resistance \(\circ\) only some of initial kinetic energy is converted to gravitational potential energy \(\circ\) lower maximum height * area under v-t graph represents change in displacement \(\circ\) area P = area Q \(\circ\) smaller area under B represents lower maximum height reached
5. _Speed when ball returns to original height is smaller for graph B_ * Let body have an initial upwards speed * Without air resistance, the ball will have same speed on return to ground * With air resistance, some energy is lost throughout the journey as thermal energy \(\circ\) kinetic energy is less than initial so less speed on return

#### Projectile Motion of An Object With Air Resistance

**Example 15**: A ball is thrown from the ground at an angle to the horizontal as shown. Sketch the path (a) assuming no air resistance and label this path N, (b) under the influence of air resistance and label this path A. Explain the differences.

Lower vertical height and shorter horizontal range; air resistance opposes relative motion of the ball so average horizontal and vertical velocities of ball decreases, Path is asymmetric: ball's horizontal velocity decreases with time so horizontal displacement per unit time decreases with motion.

### Ending Notes

Kinematics can be very mathematical and therefore lends itself well to practice.

Do not lose yourself in doing so though, keep in mind how the principles of conservation of energy and the application of force considerations is intertwined in the motion.
