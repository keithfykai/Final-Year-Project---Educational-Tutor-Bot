#### Work done by an expanding gas

Consider a gas enclosed in a chamber of cross sectional area \(A\) and fitted with a light frictionless piston.

If the gas expands at constant pressure \(p\), such that the volume changes by an amount \(\Delta V\), the force exerted by the gas on the piston, \(F_{\text{gp}}\), is

\[F_{\text{gp}}=pA\]

and the displacement of the piston, \(\Delta x\), is given by

\[\Delta x=\frac{\Delta V}{A}\]

The work done by the gas on the piston, \(W_{\text{gp}}\), is

\[W_{\text{gp}} =F_{\text{gp}}x\] \[=(pA)(\frac{\Delta V}{A})\]

Hence,

\[W_{\text{gp}}=p\Delta V\]

**Determining work done by gas**

If the pressure is not constant, the work done by the gas is given by:

\[W_{\text{gp}}=\int p\ dV=\text{Area under }p\text{-}V\text{ graph}\]

**Graphical representation**

Graphically, \(W_{\text{gp}}\) is given by the area under the p-V graph.

_Note: as the gas does positive work on the piston in expanding, the atmosphere is doing negative work on the piston._

#### Work done and energy change

When work is done, energy is converted from one form to another as a result.

\begin{tabular}{|p{142.3pt}|p{142.3pt}|} \hline \multicolumn{1}{|c|}{**+_W, positive work done_**} & \multicolumn{1}{c|}{**-_W, negative work done_**} \\ \hline \(\bullet\) & Force is exerted on a body in the direction of its motion & Force is exerted on a body opposite to the direction of its motion (e.g. friction) \\ \(\bullet\) & **Positive work is done** on the body & **Negative work is done** on the body \\ \(\bullet\) & Body **gains energy**. & \(\bullet\) & Body **losses energy** \\ \hline \end{tabular} When body A does 100 J of work on body B, A loses 100 J of energy and B gains 100 J of energy. When body A does -100 J of work on body B, B loses 100 J of energy and A gains 100 J of energy.

**Example 3**: _Determine whether positive or negative work was done in each case._

Superman exerts a force of \(3.0\times 10^{4}\) N on a passenger jet to tow it down a runway at a _constant speed._ What is the work done on the passenger jet when Superman tos it a distance of 10 m?

Work done by Superman on the plane, \(W_{\mathrm{S\,on\,P}}\)

Superman has done J of work on the jet.

Superman energy and the passenger jet

Work done by friction on the plane, \(W_{\mathrm{f\,on\,P}}\)

Since passenger jet is being pulled at constant speed, \(F\cos 30^{\circ}=-f_{\mathrm{f\,on\,P}}\)

\(W_{\mathrm{f\,on\,P}}=(-f_{\mathrm{f\,on\,P}})\)s

\(=(-2.6\times 10^{4})(10)\)

\(=-2.6\times 10^{5}\) J

\(f\)

Friction has done J of work on the jet.

The passenger jet energy which is converted to heat energy due to friction.

### Energy

Energy is an indirectly observed property of a body; that means it cannot be _directly measured_ with any instrument, and must be determined from other measurements. It is the ability or capacity of the body to do work on another body (causing it to lose energy in the process).

Energy is a scalar quantity with no associated direction. Bodies in a system may possess the following types of energy.

#### 5.2.1 Potential Energy

A body possesses potential energy when it has the potential to do work. Potential energy can be either positive or negative; the point of zero potential energy is used as a reference and depends on the definition of the specific type of potential energy.

Hence, when analysing the change in energy of a body or system between two points, it is often more useful to talk about the **change** in potential energy rather than the value of potential energy.

##### 5.2.1.1 Elastic Potential Energy

When work is done by a force on an elastic body, it deforms and its shape changes. When the force is released, the deformation is restored. This allows the object to store **elastic potential energy** as a result of its **deformation**.

In a spring, the change in length caused by a force is known as the extension. Both compression and extension of the spring are able to store elastic potential energy. The elastic potential energy is given by

\[\begin{array}{|c|}\hline\text{Elastic }E_{p}=\text{Area under }F\text{ - }x\text{ graph}\\ =\frac{1}{2}Fx=\frac{1}{2}k\alpha^{2}\end{array}\]

(_More detail can be found in Chapter 4 Forces._)

**Example 4**: _Shade the area which represents the work done on the spring in each case._

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|} \hline Work done by external force & Work done by spring in returning \\ to stretch a spring by extension \(x\) & \\ \hline \end{tabular}

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|} \hline Work done on spring: positive & Work done on spring: negative \\ Work done by spring: negative & Work done by spring: positive \\ Energy gained by spring: positive & Energy gained by spring: negative \\ \hline \end{tabular}

#### 5.2.1.2 Gravitational Potential Energy Near Surface (\(E_{p}=mgh\))

For a body to gain gravitational potential energy but not kinetic energy, it must move away from Earth (i.e. upwards) with a constant speed (i.e. zero acceleration). An **external agent** is required to exert an upward force on the body, and this force must be equal to weight (so that net force is zero).

Near the Earth's surface, the gravitational field strength is **constant** at \(g\), hence the body's weight and the external force \(F_{\text{ext}}\) are constant. If the body is lifted through a vertical displacement \(h\), the work done on the body by the external force \(F_{\text{ext}}\) increases the gravitational potential energy of the body

\[\Delta E_{p} =W_{\text{ext}}\] \[=F_{\text{ext}}h\]

Since \(F_{\text{ext}}=mg\), \(\Delta E_{p}=mgh\)

Calculating gravitational potential energy

The gravitational potential energy of a body with mass \(m\) at a height \(h\) above a reference level is

gravitational \(E_{p}=mgh\)

#### 5.2.2 Kinetic Energy (\(E_{k}=\frac{1}{2}mv^{2}\))

A body in motion possesses kinetic energy. We cannot observe kinetic energy directly, but we can observe the effects of gain or loss in kinetic energy.

Consider a body of mass \(m\) being accelerated **from rest** by a constant net force \(F\) on frictionless level ground. The work done by net force \(F\) on the body causes its kinetic energy \(E_{k}\) to increase. When the body has been displaced by a horizontal distance \(s\),

\[\Delta E_{k}=F\text{s}\]

Since F = ma (according to Newton's Second Law), \(\Delta E_{k}=mas\)

Since net force \(F\) is constant and hence acceleration \(a\) is constant, we can substitute the term as using an equation of linear motion:

\[v^{2} =u^{2}+2as\] \[\text{as} =\frac{1}{2}v^{2}-\frac{1}{2}u^{2}\]Thus, we can relate the change in kinetic energy \(\Delta E_{k}\) to the initial velocity \(u\) and the final velocity \(\nu\).

\[\Delta E_{k}=m\bigg{(}\frac{1}{2}\nu^{2}-\frac{1}{2}u^{2}\bigg{)}\]

The body was accelerated from rest (\(u=0\)), hence the kinetic energy possessed by the body is given by \(\Delta E_{k}=\frac{1}{2}mv^{2}\).

**Calculating kinetic energy**

The kinetic energy of a body with mass \(m\) travelling with velocity \(\nu\) is given by

\[E_{k}=\frac{1}{2}mv^{2}\]

### Conservation of energy

Although energy can be converted from one form to another, the total amount of energy in the universe remains constant.

**Principle of Conservation of Energy**

Energy can neither be created nor destroyed, but it can be transformed from one form to another.

Because of this principle of nature, even though energy can be transferred in and out of a system, we can account for the total amount of energy remaining in the system.

**System Model**

Rather than consider the entire universe in our calculations, we typically consider energy changes within a _system_. A valid system may be

* a single body or particle,
* a collection of bodies or particles,
* all the matter within a fixed region of space (such as a cylinder that is open to the surroundings), or
* a body that breaks up into smaller parts.

Identifying the system allows us to check if external forces are present, and hence to determine if the total energy of the system is conserved.

## Conversion of Energy and Conservation of Energy

**Difference between Isolated System and Closed System**

Consider a simple system which only has kinetic energy \(E_{k}\) and potential energy \(E_{p}\).

If the system does not exchange energy or matter with its surroundings, it is an **isolated system**. The total energy possessed by the system remains unchanged if no **external work is done** on the system. Within the system, an increase in kinetic energy must result in an equal decrease in potential energy, and vice versa. We say that **the total energy of an isolated system is conserved**.

If the system is able to exchange energy _but not matter_ with its surroundings, it is a **closed system**. Energy can be transferred via work done on the system, thus the total energy of a closed system need not be conserved.

_Note: Transfer of energy can take place via a few processes: work done on the system, heat transfer into or out of the system, mechanical waves passing through the system, electrical transmission, and electromagnetic radiation. We only focus on work done on the system here._

Since energy is a scalar quantity, and the energy of a system can be determined, we can write an equation to relate the initial and final energy of the system.

**Determining initial/final energy of a system**

Total initial energy of system \(\begin{array}{c}\text{Total initial energy of system}\\ \text{(potential + kinetic)}\end{array}\) \(\begin{array}{c}\text{Net work done on system}\\ \text{(positive or negative)}\end{array}\) \(\begin{array}{c}\text{Total final energy of system}\\ \text{(potential + kinetic)}\end{array}\)

**OR**

Total \(E_{i}+W_{\text{net}}=\text{Total }E_{i}\)

**Determining change in total energy of a system**

\(\begin{array}{c}W_{\text{net}}=\text{Total }E_{i}-\text{Total }E_{i}\\ \Delta E_{\text{total}}=W_{\text{net}}\end{array}\)

**OR**

Change in total energy of system \(\begin{array}{c}\text{Net work done on system}\\ \text{(final - initial)}\end{array}\) \(\begin{array}{c}\text{(positive or negative)}\end{array}\)

**Problem Solving Skills Set (p\(\mathbf{s}^{\mathbf{s}}\))**

1. Determine what constitutes the system (which bodies are part of the system?)
2. Determine the initial state of the system
3. Determine the final state of the system
4. Form an equation to relate the initial and final total energy (\(E_{p}+E_{i}\)) of the system

**Example 4**:

_White the energy equation for each of the following scenarios._

### Example 5

A 2000 kg car coasts up a hill (without additional force) at A with a speed of 20 m s\({}^{-1}\). Its speed when it reaches B is 5.0 m s\({}^{-1}\) and the distance along the road from A to B is 40 m. Determine the average resistive force \(f\) along the road from A to B.

By conservation of energy:

\[\frac{1}{2}m_{v}{{}_{i}^{2}}+0-f(d) =\frac{1}{2}m_{v}{{}_{i}^{2}}+mgh\] \[\frac{1}{2}(2000)(20^{2})-f(40) =\frac{1}{2}(2000)(5^{2})+(2000)(9.81)(10)\] \[178800 =f(40)\] \[f =4500\text{ N (2 s.f.)}\]

### Example 6

M and N, two objects of mass 1.0 kg and 0.60 kg respectively, are connected by a light cord passing over a light, free-running pulley. From rest, N descends vertically while M moves over a smooth plane inclined at 30\({}^{\circ}\) to the horizontal.

Determine the final velocity of both objects when M has travelled a distance \(d=2.0\) m along the plane.

\[m_{w}gd\sin\theta-m_{w}gd+\frac{1}{2}(m_{w}+m_{w})(\nu_{t}{{}_{i}^{2}}-\nu_{t} ^{2}) =0\] (1.0) (9.81) (2.0sin30\({}^{\circ}\)) - (0.60) (9.81) (2.0) + \frac{1}{2}(1.0+0.60)(\nu_{t}{{}_{i}^{2}}-0) =0\] \[0.80\nu_{t}{{}_{i}^{2}}=1.962,\,\nu_{t}=1.57\text{ m s}^{-1}\]

### Energy Loss and Efficiency

In the absence of any energy loss, the total input energy to a device is completely converted to useful work done. However, in practice, the useful energy output from the device is always less than the energy input - the difference is **energy loss**. We say that this energy is _lost_ (not destroyed) to the environment because it did not do any useful work for us.

**Definition of efficiency**

The energy efficiency \(\eta\) of a device is the **ratio** of useful energy output to the energy input.

**Determining efficiency of a process**

\[\eta=\frac{\text{useful energy output}}{\text{energy input}}=\frac{\text{useful work done}}{\text{energy input}}=\frac{\text{useful power output}}{\text{power input}}\]

The value of efficiency can never be greater than 1; in practical devices, it is always less than 1. For example, an automobile engine converts chemical energy released from the burning of gasoline into mechanical energy that moves the pistons in the engine and eventually the wheels, enabling the car to move. However, nearly 85% of the input energy from combustion is wasted as thermal energy that heats up the exhaust gases and engine, or used to overcome friction (doing work against friction) in the moving parts. Hence, only about 15% of the energy from combustion goes into useful work in automobiles.

**Example 7**

A small motor is used to raise a weight of 2.0 N through a vertical height of 0.80 m. The efficiency of the motor is 20%. Calculate the minimum energy input to the motor to raise the weight.

**System: weight & Earth**

**Initial point:** before weight is raised

**Final point:** after it is raised through 0.80 m

When minimum energy is provided, work done increases gravitational \(E_{p}\) without increase in \(E_{k}\).

\(\Delta E_{p}+\Delta E_{k}=W_{\text{useful}}\)

\((mg)h+0=W_{\text{useful}}\)

\(W_{\text{useful}}=(2.0)(0.80)=1.6\) J

Since the efficiency of the motor is 20%,

\(\eta=\frac{W_{\text{useful}}}{W_{\text{input}}}=0.20\)

\(W_{\text{repeat}}=8.0\) J

### Power

In practical devices, we are often more concerned about the time taken to do a certain amount of work; a device that does too long to do the work required is not very useful to us. Thus it is meaningful to quantify the rate of work done using a physical quantity - **Power**.

**Definition of power**

Symbol: \(P\)

Unit: Watt (\(W\))

Power is defined as the rate at which work is done.

**Note**

For a device in motion, _instantaneous power output_ at any point in time is given by

\[P =\frac{dW}{dt}\] \[=\frac{d(F\text{s})}{dt}\]

If the force \(F\) exerted is constant, e.g. when net force is zero as a constant driving force \(F\) balances resistive forces \(f\),

\[P =F\frac{d\text{s}}{dt}\] \[=F\nu\text{ (since $\nu=\frac{d\text{s}}{dt}$ is velocity)}\]

For a stationary device that does work \(\Delta W\)in a time interval \(t\), the average power is given by

\[\left<P\right>=\frac{\Delta W}{t}\]

### Example 8

A fire-pump delivers 20 kg of water per second, the water being initially at rest and leaving the nozzle at a speed of 12 m s\({}^{-1}\). The nozzle is 6.0 m above the source of water supply and the pump is 40% efficient. Calculate the input power to the pump.

**System:** The volume of water in the fire pump

**Initial to final point:** over a duration of 1 s

The useful power of the pump is being used to increase the energy of water

\[\Delta E_{p}+\Delta E_{k}=W_{\text{useful}}\]

\[\Delta E_{p}+\Delta E_{k} =W_{\text{useful}}\] \[mg\Delta h+\frac{1}{2}m(\nu_{{}^{2}}-\nu_{{}^{2}}) =W_{\text{useful}}\] \[W_{\text{useful}} =(20)(9.81)(6.0)+\frac{1}{2}(20)(12^{2})\] \[=2617.2\;\text{J}\] \[\eta =\frac{W_{\text{useful}}}{W_{\text{input}}}=0.40\] \[W_{\text{input}} =6500\;\text{N}\;(2\;\text{s.f.})\]

### NEA Energy Label

In Singapore, all air-conditioners, refrigerators, clothes dryers and television must have an energy label. This energy label is issued by the National Environment Agency (NEA)1, and indicates the appliance's energy efficiency rating, (estimated) annual energy consumption, and annual energy cost.

Footnote 1: The Energy Label, National Environment Agency.

[http://www.nea.gov.sg/energy-waste/energy-efficiency/household-sector/the-energy-label](http://www.nea.gov.sg/energy-waste/energy-efficiency/household-sector/the-energy-label)

NEA also has a list of registered appliances that carry the Energy Label. From that list, the annual energy cost for air-conditioners can range from $241 to $2,301, depending on the cooling capacity and energy efficiency rating of the radiator unit

In 2003, Singapore was ranked 14th in total energy consumption per capita in a year worldwide with 6455.7 koge/a (kg of oil per annum). 10 years later, in 2013, this had dropped to 4833.4 koge/a (ranked 21st worldwide). We have also moved from oil-fired steam turbine plants (37% efficiency) to Combined Cycle Gas Turbine (CCGT) plants burning natural gas, which are cleaner and more efficient (up to 53%).

In 2016, 96% of our power production comes from CCGTs, and 2.9% comes from burning waste products (including sewage). Households used 7,220.9 GWh (15.2%) of a total 47,513.8 GWh islandwide. Commercial buildings and services used 17,481.0 GWh (36.8%).2

Any further development in energy efficiency will rely on renewable energy sources, as well as energy conservation and reuse.

#### Why should appliance efficiency matter to you?

1. A less energy-efficient appliance uses more power to achieve the same effect. This means you are paying more without benefiting from it.
2. A less energy-efficient appliance produces more waste heat, which escapes into the room or house (unless the heat is vented outside). This makes the house more uncomfortable and means even more power used to cool the house down.
