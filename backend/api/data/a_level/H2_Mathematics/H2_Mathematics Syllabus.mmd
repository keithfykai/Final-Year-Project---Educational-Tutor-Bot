Mathematics

(Syllabus 9758)

(First year of examination in 2025)

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:2]

## Preamble

Mathematics is a basic and important discipline that contributes to the developments and understandings of sciences and other disciplines. It is used by scientists, engineers, business analysts and psychologists, etc. to model, understand and solve problems in their respective fields. A good foundation in mathematics and the ability to reason mathematically are therefore essential for students to be successful in their pursuit of various disciplines.

H2 Mathematics is designed to prepare students for a range of university courses, including mathematics, sciences, engineering and related courses, where a good foundation in mathematics is required. It develops mathematical thinking and reasoning skills that are essential for further learning of mathematics. Through applications of mathematics, students also develop an appreciation of mathematics and its connections to other disciplines and to the real world.

## Syllabus aims

The aims of H2 Mathematics are to enable students to:

* acquire mathematical concepts and skills to prepare for their tertiary studies in mathematics, sciences, engineering and other related disciplines
* develop thinking, reasoning, communication and modelling skills through a mathematical approach to problem-solving
* connect ideas within mathematics and apply mathematics in the contexts of sciences, engineering and other related disciplines
* experience and appreciate the nature and beauty of mathematics and its value in life and other disciplines.

## Assessment objectives (AO)

The assessment will test candidates' abilities to:

Approximate weightings for the assessment objectives are as follows:

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|} \hline AO1 & 30\% \\ \hline AO2 & 60\% \\ \hline AO3 & 10\% \\ \hline \end{tabular}

## Use of a Graphing Calculator (GC)

The use of an approved GC without computer algebra system will be expected. The examination papers will be set with the assumption that candidates will have access to GC. As a general rule, unsupported answers obtained from GC are allowed unless the question states otherwise. Where unsupported answers from GC are not allowed, candidates must present the mathematical steps using mathematical notations and not calculator commands. For questions where graphs are used to find a solution, candidates should sketch these graphs as part of their answers. Incorrect answers without working will receive no marks. However, if there is written evidence of using GC correctly, method marks may be awarded.

Candidates should be aware that there are limitations inherent in GC. For example, answers obtained by tracing along a graph to find roots of an equation may not produce the required accuracy.

## List of Formulae and Results

Candidates will be provided in the examination with a list of formulae and results.

## Integration and Application

Notwithstanding the presentation of the topics in the syllabus document, it is envisaged that some examination questions may integrate ideas from more than one topic, and that topics may be tested in the contexts of problem solving and application of mathematics.
