The Gaseous State

## 1 Introduction

Gases tend to have the following physical properties:

* Gases have much lower density than solids or liquids. **(Why is density low for gases?)**
* Gases assume the volumes and shapes of their containers. **(Why ONLY gases assume the volumes of their containers? Why liquids do not assume the volume leh?)**
* Gases are highly compressible and their volumes change greatly when a pressure is applied. **(Why are gases highly compressible?)**
* Gases exert pressure equally in all directions. **(Why gases exert pressure equally in all directions?)**

[0.5cm] **Making Thinking Visible**

[0.5cm] **Do you know what is pressure?**

[0.5cm] **Pressure refers to the force that the particles exert on a surface per unit area. Hence, pressure measured is not due to the collision between the particles.**

[0.5cm] **Since pressure refers to the force that the particles exert on the surface per unit area, does that mean that if there are more particles hitting per unit area, the pressure will be higher?**

[0.5cm] **Yes!! That is why the measured pressure is directly proportional to the amount of particles, in moles (n).**

**In addition, pressure is directly proportional to temperature (T) because the higher the temperature, the greater the kinetic energy of the particles (KEaverage \(\alpha\) T). The faster the particles move, the "harder" it hits against the surface. The particles also strike the surface more frequently.**

**Lastly, the pressure is inversely proportional to the volume of the container (V) because the greater the volume, the further the particles are spread out, the lower the frequency of collisions as the particles will take a "longer time" to hit the surface again.**

[0.5cm] **Sir, if** \(p\) **of a gas is affected by** \(n\)**,** \(V\) **and** \(T\)**, does it mean that** \(V\) **of a gas is being affected by** \(p\)**,** \(n\) **and** \(T\)**

[0.5cm] **Certainly Eunoians, we will later discuss the interconnectedness of** \(p\)**,** \(V\)**,** \(n\) **and** \(T\) **in the ideal gas equation,** \(pV=nRT\)**.**

## 2 The Gas Laws

* (c) state and use the general gas equation \(pV=nRT\) in calculations, including the determination of \(M_{\rm t}\)

Some of the first quantitative investigations were conducted in the \(17^{\rm th}-18^{\rm th}\) century to study the behaviour of gases. The relationship between the different macroscopic properties of gases (volume, temperature and pressure) are expressed via the different gas laws.

### Boyle's Law

* The volume \(V\) of a **fixed mass of gas** at a **constant temperature** is **inversely proportional** to the pressure \(p\) of the gas.

\(V\propto\frac{1}{p}\)

\(pV=k\) where \(k\) is a constant

* In other words, for a **fixed mass (or amount)** of gas at **constant temperature**, when its volume **increases**, its pressure **decreases**, and vice versa.

The Gaseous State
* Hence, for a **given mass of gas under two different sets of conditions at constant temperature**,
* Graphically, Boyle's Law can be represented in the following forms:
* A balloon occupies a volume of 600 cm\({}^{3}\). Assuming that temperature remains constant, what volume will the balloon occupy if the surrounding pressure is reduced so that the pressure in it is reduced to one-third of its starting value?
* Let the initial pressure be \(p\). By Boyle's law, \(p_{1}V_{1}=p_{2}V_{2}\)
* \(V_{2}=3\times 600\)
* \(1800\) cm\({}^{3}\)

### Charles's Law
* The volume \(V\) of a **fixed mass of gas*
* at a **constant pressure*
* is **directly proportional*
* to its temperature \(T\) (in kelvin).
* In other words, for a **fixed mass (or amount)*
* of gas at **constant pressure**, when its volume **increases**, its temperature **increases**, and vice versa
* For a given mass of gas under two different sets of conditions at constant pressure,

The Gaseous State

### Avogadro's Law

Under the same conditions of temperature and pressure, equal volumes of all gases will contain equal numbers of molecules.

\(\forall\infty n\)where \(n\) is the amount (in moles) of gas present

For example, the number of O\({}_{2}\) molecules in 1 dm\({}^{3}\) of O\({}_{2}\) gas = the number of CO\({}_{2}\) molecules in 1 dm\({}^{3}\) of CO\({}_{2}\) gas.

At constant temperature and pressure,

\(\frac{V_{1}}{n_{1}}=\frac{V_{2}}{n_{2}}\)

Graphically, Avogadro's Law can be represented as:

\(V=kn\)

### The Ideal Gas Equation

Combining Boyle's law, Charles's law and Avogadro's law,

\(V\propto\frac{nT}{D}\)

therefore, \(pV=nRT\)where \(R\) is the molar gas constant (\(R=8.31\) y.K\({}^{-1}\) mol\({}^{-1}\))

An ideal gas is one whose behaviour follows the ideal gas equation exactly under any pressure and temperature.

\(Important:\)When using the ideal gas equation, each quantity needs to be expressed in its S.I. unit.

From pV = nRT, if n and T constant \(\Rightarrow\) p \(\alpha\frac{1}{V}\)Boyle's Law

If n and p constant \(\Rightarrow\) V \(\alpha\) TCharles's Law

Example 76

Calculate the molar volume of an ideal gas at 0 \({}^{\circ}\)C and 1 bar (i.e. under standard temperature and pressure, s.t.p.).

Converting the quantities to S.I. units:

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|} \hline Pressure & 1 bar = 10\({}^{5}\) Pa \\ \hline Volume &? \\ \hline Temperature & 0 \({}^{\circ}\)C = 0 + 273 = 273 K \\ \hline \(\rho V=nRT\) \\ \(\rho V_{m}=RT\) \\ \((10^{5})\big{(}V_{m}\big{)}=(8.31)(273)\) \\ \(V_{m}=\textbf{0.0227 m}^{3}\textbf{ mol}^{-1}=\textbf{22.7 dm}^{3}\textbf{ mol}^{-1}\) \\ \hline \end{tabular}

Example 77

A sample of gas was heated from 25 \({}^{\circ}\)C until both its pressure and its volume doubled. What was the new temperature?

Since the amount of the gas remains constant, \(\rho V=nRT\Rightarrow\frac{\rho V}{T}=nR=\text{constant}\)

Let the initial pressure and volume be \(p_{1}\) and \(V_{1}\),

\[\frac{p_{1}V_{1}}{T_{1}} =\frac{p_{2}V_{2}}{T_{2}}\] \[\frac{p_{1}V_{1}}{(25+273)} =\frac{(2p_{1})(2V_{1})}{T_{2}}\] \[T_{2} =4\,(25+273)\] \[=1192\text{ K}=\textbf{1190 K}\ \ (3\text{ s.f.})\]

Example 78

The volume occupied by 0.10 g of a gas is found to be 83.1 cm\({}^{3}\) (measured at 1.0 \(\times\) 10\({}^{5}\) Pa and 27 \({}^{\circ}\)C). Assuming that the gas behaves ideally, what is the relative molecular mass of this gas?

\[\rho V=nRT\] \[\rho V=\frac{\text{mass of gas}}{\text{molar mass of gas}}\times RT= \frac{m}{M}RT\] \[(1.0\times 10^{5})(83.1\times 10^{-6}) =\frac{0.10}{M}(8.31)(27+273)\] \[M=\frac{(0.10)(8.31)(27+273)}{(1.0\times 10^{5})(83.1\times 10^{-6})}\] \[=30.0\text{ g mol}^{-1}\] \[M_{r}\text{ of gas}=\textbf{30.0}\ (3\The Gaseous State

2. 1 cm\({}^{3}\) of ice was heated to 323 \({}^{0}\)C at a pressure of 1 atm. Given that the density of ice is 1.00 g cm\({}^{-3}\), what was the volume of steam produced? [2.72 dm\({}^{3}\)]
3. A fluoride \(X\) is formed when krypton reacts with fluorine. Given that 0.100 g of \(X\) occupies 104 cm\({}^{3}\) at 2.00 x 10\({}^{4}\) Pa and 305 K, what is the relative molecular mass and molecular formula of _X_? [121.9; KrF\({}_{2}\)]

### Dalton's Law of Partial Pressures

**LO**: (d) use Dalton's Law to determine the partial pressures of gases in a mixture (see also Section 9)

**In a mixture of gases that do not react with one another, each gas behaves as if it was the only gas present.**The Gaseous State

In a mixture of gases which do not react chemically, the total pressure is the sum of the partial pressures of the components.

\[\hat{p}_{\text{total}}=p_{\text{A}}+p_{\text{B}}+p_{\text{C}}+\cdots+p_{\text{ N}}=\sum_{i=\text{A}}^{i=\text{A}}p_{i}\]

where \(p_{i}\) is the partial pressure of any component, \(i\), in the mixture

The **partial pressure** is the pressure that would be exerted if the gas was alone in the container. We can determine the partial pressure of each component gas using its **mode ratio**. (Partial pressure = part of the total pressure)

Assuming a non-reacting mixture of gas **A** and gas **B** contained in a volume, \(V\), at temperature, \(T\),

partial pressure of gas **A**: \[p_{\text{A}}=\frac{n_{\text{A}}RT}{V}\] partial pressure of gas **B**: \[p_{\text{B}}=\frac{n_{\text{B}}RT}{V}\] total pressure, \[p_{\text{total}}=p_{\text{A}}+p_{\text{B}}=\frac{n_{\text{A}}RT}{V}+\frac{n_{ \text{B}}RT}{V}\] \[=\frac{\left(n_{\text{A}}+n_{\text{B}}\right)RT}{V}\]

**Mode Fraction and Partial Pressure**

The **mode fraction** (fraction calculated using moles) of a component A, \(\chi_{\text{A}}\), in a mixture is the ratio of the number of moles of A to the total number of moles of all components present in the mixture. Mathematically, this is shown as:

\[\chi_{\text{A}}=\frac{\text{amount of component A}}{\text{total amount of all components in mixture}}=\frac{n_{\text{A}}}{n_{\text{total}}}\]

If there is a non-reacting mixture of gas A and gas B in a container, then:

\[\frac{p_{\text{A}}}{p_{\text{total}}} =\frac{n_{\text{A}}RT}{V}+\frac{\left(n_{\text{A}}+n_{\text{B}} \right)RT}{V}\] \[=\frac{n_{\text{A}}}{n_{\text{A}}+n_{\text{B}}}\] \[=\chi_{\text{A}}\text{ }\text{ }\text{(where }\chi_{\text{A}}\text{ is the mole fraction of gas A)}\]

The **partial pressure** of gas A is thus:

\[\text{E}\text{E}\text{E}\text{E}\text{E}\text{E}\text{E}\text{E}\text{E} \text{E}\text{E}\text{E}\text{E}\text{E}\text{E}\text{E}\text{E}\text{E} \text{E}\text{E}\text{E}\text{E}\text{E}\text{E}\text{E}\text{E}\text{E} \text{E}\text{E}\text{E}\text{E}\text{E}\text{E}\text{E}\text{E}\text{E} \text{E}\text{E}\text{E}\text{E}\text{E}\text{E}\text{E}\text{E}\text{E} \The Gaseous State

Example 21

Flask X contains 1 dm\({}^{3}\) of helium at 2 kPa pressure and Flask Y contains 2 dm\({}^{3}\) of neon at 1 kPa pressure. If the flasks are connected at constant temperature, what is the final pressure?

**Method 1**

Total no. of moles do not change.

Before connection, \(n_{\text{He}}=\frac{\rho V}{RT}=\frac{(2)(1)}{RT}=\frac{2}{RT}\)

For helium, \(p_{\text{I}}\), \(p_{\text{J}}\), \(p_{\text{J}}\), \(1\times 2=(1+2)p_{\text{I}}\)

After connection, \(n_{\text{total}}=n_{\text{He}}+n_{\text{Ne}}\)

For neon, \(p_{\text{J}}\), \(p_{\text{J}}\), \(p_{\text{J}}\), \(2\times 1=(1+2)p_{\text{I}}\)

\(p_{\text{I}}=0.667\) kPa

\(p_{\text{I}}=0.667\) kPa

**Making Thinking Visible**

**Q:**: Are the above two methods different in working principles?

**A:**: Nopel They are the same. Let me show you:

From method 1, after connection, \(n_{\text{total}}=n_{\text{He}}+n_{\text{Ne}}\)

\(\frac{p_{\text{final}}V_{\text{final}}}{RT}=\frac{p_{\text{He},\text{initial}} V_{\text{I}}}{RT}+\frac{p_{\text{Ne},\text{initial}}V_{\text{2}}}{RT}\)

\(p_{\text{final}}V_{\text{final}}=p_{\text{He},\text{initial}}V_{\text{He}, \text{initial}}+p_{\text{Ne},\text{initial}}V_{\text{2}}\) (since T is constant)

\(p_{\text{final}}(1+2)=2\times 1+1x2\) (in Method 2)

Method 1 is preferred as most of the time in A-level, the question set will have a constant amount of gases (in moles), before and after the change.

Important concepts to remember:

* _I need to know S.I. units for pressure (Pa), volume (m\({}^{3}\)), temperature (K) and amount (in moles)_
* _I need to know how to convert for eg. from \({}^{\circ}\)C to K, from cm\({}^{3}\) to m\({}^{3}\), from atm to Pa, etc._
* _I need to know how to sketch various types of graphs by modifying pV = nRT and know that n = \(\frac{mass}{major\ mass}\) (where molar mass is numerically the same as M\({}_{\text{J}}\))._
* _I need to use pV = nRT for various types of calculation and in the process be mindful of units conversion._
* _Dalton's Law of Partial Pressure is a very important concept to remember for future topics._The Gaseous State

## 3 The Kinetic Molecular Theory of Gases

LO (a) state the basic assumptions of the kinetic theory as applied to an ideal gas.

The ideal gas equation was obtained using an _empirical_ approach by combining the experimentally determined gas laws (Boyle's Law, Charles's Law, Avogadro's Law). While it enables us to determine what happens to a gas when conditions change, it does not tell us what is happening at the molecular level, and why.

In the 19\({}^{\text{th}}\) century, a group of scientists including Ludwig Boltzmann and James Clerk Maxwell developed the **kinetic molecular theory of gases** to try to explain gas behaviours as described by the gas laws and the ideal gas equation. This theory is based on a model that assumes that:

1. The **gas particles have no volume**, _i.e._ they are point masses.
2. There are **no forces of attraction between gas particles**.
3. When the particles collide, the **collision is perfectly elastic**. i.e., the particles bounce apart after they collide with **no loss of kinetic energy**.
4. The gas particles are in **constant random** motion.

As a result, the **average kinetic energy of the particles is proportional to the temperature (in Kelvin)**.

A Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution curve shows how energy is distributed among the particles in a system. **The total area under a Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution curve is proportional to the total number of particles present**. At a given temperature, the particles have a range of kinetic energies.

When temperature increases from 298 K to 500 K, the particles have a larger range of kinetic energy and the average kinetic energy of the gaseous particles increases. As such, the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution curve at the higher temperature broadens and flattens out.

**Making Thinking Visible**

**Q:**: Why must the peak of the curve be lower at higher temperature?
**A:**: Now, the y-axis represents the number of particles or fraction of particles with a particular energy, hence, the area under the curve corresponds to the total number of particles or is equal to 1.

Imagine each curve is approximated to a triangle. So, if the temperature is increased without changing the number of particles, in order to have a broader curve (a triangle with a greater base), the peak of the curve (height of a triangle) must be lower.
**Q:**: By the way, is the fraction here referring to mole fraction?
**A:**: Yup!

### Effect of Low Pressure (Real gas becomes more ideal)

The Gaseous State

Making Thinking Visible

* Hmmmm...so before the pressure becomes too high, we only consider the intermolecular forces as this is the main factor that causes the gas to become less ideal. But as the pressure keeps on increasing, the volume of gas decreases, causing the volume of the gas particles to be more significant as compared to the volume of empty spaces. So, is the volume of gas particles the main factor that causes the deviation from ideality?
* Absolutely! Under most circumstances (at low pressure), the more important factor to take note is actually intermolecular forces which has been covered in Chemical Bonding. We will see later that the stronger the intermolecular forces, the greater the deviation from ideal behaviour. Your insight also explains why after liquefaction, it is more difficult to compress liquid than gas.
* Can I plot \(\frac{pV}{nRT}\) against p for the above plot?
* Yes, you can! But take note that for ideal gas the \(\frac{pV}{nRT}\) value equals 1.

### Effect of High Temperature (Real gas becomes more ideal)

For a constant amount of a real gas, in this case, CO\({}_{2}\), at varying temperatures:

\begin{tabular}{l} \end{tabular}
* At high temperatures, kinetic energy of the gas particles increases and the particles move faster. This causes the intermolecular forces of attraction between the particles to be insignificant (assumption 2 becomes valid). The number of collision and force exerted on wall of container will increase as compared to at lower temperature, \(pV\) will approach that of an ideal gas. Hence at higher temperatures, there will be lesser deviation from ideality.

The Gaseous State

### Effect of Strong Intermolecular Forces

Under the same conditions (same amount and same temperature), different gases deviate from ideal gas behaviour to different extents due to **differences in the strengths of the intermolecular forces of attraction**.

**Strong hydrogen bonds exist between H\({}_{2}\)O molecules while **weak instantaneous dipole-induced dipole interactions** exist between H\({}_{2}\) and CO\({}_{2}\) molecules.

The hydrogen bonds between H\({}_{2}\)O molecules **are stronger** as compared to the instantaneous dipole-induced dipole interactions between H\({}_{2}\) and CO\({}_{2}\) molecules (assumption 2 less valid for H\({}_{2}\)O). Hence, H\({}_{2}\)O deviates more from ideality compared to H\({}_{2}\) and CO\({}_{2}\) at **low pressures**.

Since CO\({}_{2}\) has more electrons than H\({}_{2}\), the strength of the instantaneous dipole-induced dipole interactions between CO\({}_{2}\) are stronger than between H\({}_{2}\). Hence, CO\({}_{2}\) deviates more from ideality compared to H\({}_{2}\) at **low pressures**. As the instantaneous dipole-induced dipole interactions between H\({}_{2}\) molecules is too weak, the pv values do not deviate below that for the ideal gas.

See Appendix 3 for further discussion on deviations from the ideal gas laws.

**Making Thinking Visible**

**Q:**: Is it important to know which gas molecule has a larger molecular volume than another gas molecule at higher pressures?
**A:**: No! At A-level the most important factor to consider will be the intermolecular forces as the deviation from ideality can tell us more about the different strengths of the IMF. Take for instance, if you compare the H\({}_{2}\) graph and the CO\({}_{2}\) graph, before the cross-over, we cannot be sure whether the molecular volume of H\({}_{2}\) is larger than the molecular volume of CO\({}_{2}\). Then after the cross-over, we also cannot be sure that the molecular volume of CO\({}_{2}\) is larger than the molecular volume of H\({}_{2}\).

The Gaseous State

Rank the following gases in order of decreasing ideality, with the most ideal first. Explain the reasons for your order.

CH\({}_{4}\) HF HC_l_

* CH\({}_{4}\) is non-polar with **weak instantaneous dipole-** induced dipole interactions between its molecules.
* HC_l_ is **polar** with **strong permanent dipole-permanent dipole interactions** between its molecules.
* Compared to HC_l_ molecules, there is **stronger hydrogen bonding** between HF molecules (F is highly electronegative).
* Hence, in terms of ideality, CH\({}_{4}\) is most ideal (deviates least from ideality), followed by HC_l_ and HF.

Important concepts to remember:

* _I need to mug AT LEAST three assumptions of the Kinetic Molecular Theory of Gases._
* _I need to know how to sketch the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution curve as this is important for Chemical Kinetics._
* _There is intermolecular forces between the gas particles._
- _The volume of gas particles is significant._
* _Low pressure: Gas particles are further apart, intermolecular forces are insignificant and volume of particles are insignificant compared to volume of container. The lower the pressure, the smaller the deviation from ideal behaviour_
- _High temperature: Gas particles have higher kinetic energy, intermolecular forces are insignificant. The higher the temperature, the smaller the deviation from ideal behaviour._
* _I need to know the stronger the intermolecular forces, the greater the deviation from ideal behaviour._

## 5 Real Life Applications

Why is it important to know how gesses behave under different conditions?

_Find out the answers to the questions below to understand how important the gas laws are!_

Why must scuba divers return to the surface

very slowly at the end of their dive?

Reason:

The pressure at the surface is lower than below

sea-level. Hence, the solubility of gases in the

blood is lower. Therefore, if the surfacing is too fast, the dissolved gases will form bubbles in

the blood. It can be fatal.

Why must trucks transporting propane (a highly

flammable gas) be subjected to weight tests

before they travel during the summer months?

Reason:

Higher mass means more gas particles (more

moles). At higher temperature, with greater n, the

pressure will increase since volume of container

does not change (p a nT).

Why might it not be a good idea to bring a

bag of chips onboard an aeroplane?

Reason:

At higher height above sea-level,

atmospheric pressure is lower, hence, the

higher internal pressure inside the bag may

cause the bag to rupture apart.

Why do we find it harder to breathe at high

altitudes?

Reason:

At high altitudes, the atmospheric pressre is

lower. In order for the gas to go into the lung,

the pressure must be high enough. So, at a

lower atmospheric pressure, it is difficult for

gas particles to go into the lung.

Why does water boil at a lower temperature at higher

altitudes?

Reason:

During boiling, the vapour pressure of the liquid must

be equal to the atmospheric pressure. At high altitudes,

the atmospheric pressre is lower. Hence, a lower

temperature is needed for the water to have a vapour pressure equal to the atmospheric pressure for boiling

to take place (p a T).

The Gaseous State

**APPENDIX 2**

Using the Kinetic Molecular Theory of Gases to explain the behaviour of gases

1. Gas Pressure

Gas molecules are in constant random motion within the container that the gas is in and collide with the walls of the container. When they do so, they exert a force which results in pressure being set up \(\left(\text{pressure}=\frac{\text{force}}{\text{area}}\right)\).

## 2 Boyle's Law

When the volume of the gas decreases, the distances between the gas molecules and the walls of the container are shorter. Hence, molecules collide with the walls more **frequently**, leading to greater pressure being exerted _by_ the gas.

When the pressure exerted _on_ the gas increases, gas molecules are forced closer together, leading to a decrease in volume.

## 3 Charles' Law

When temperature of the gas increases, the gas molecules have higher kinetic energy and move faster. They hit the walls of the container more frequently and with greater force, resulting in greater pressure being exerted by the gas. This results in the walls of the container moving outwards (i.e. increase in volume) until constant pressure is restored.

## 4 Avogadro's Law/ Dalton's Law of Partial Pressure

The pressure exerted by the gas depends on the number of collisions per second, which is in turn proportional to the number of gas molecules present.

The Gaseous State

**APPENDIX 3**

**Trend of the \(pV\)-\(p\) graph for a real gas**

As we have discussed in the previous sections, the behaviours of real gases do not always obey the ideal gas equation, \(pV\)= \(nRT\).

In 1873, Dutch physicist Johannes van der Waals successfully accounted for the behaviour of real gases by introducing two additional terms to the ideal gas equation, resulting in the **van der Waals equation**:

The constants \(a\) and \(b\) differ for different gases: a correlates with the strength of the intermolecular forces between the gas particles, while \(b\) correlates with the size of the molecules. The smaller the constants are for a real gas, the more ideal it is. The van der Waals constants for some gases are listed in the table below:

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|} \hline
**gas** & \(a\) / Pa \(m^{6}\) mol\({}^{-2}\) & \(b\) / \(10^{-5}\)\(m^{3}\) mol\({}^{-1}\) \\ \hline water vapour & 0.5537 & 3.049 \\ \hline ammonia & 0.4225 & 3.713 \\ \hline carbon dioxide & 0.3658 & 4.286 \\ \hline carbon monoxide & 0.1472 & 3.948 \\ \hline nitrogen & 0.1370 & 3.87 \\ \hline hydrogen & 0.02453 & 2.651 \\ \hline helium & 0.00346 & 2.38 \\ \hline \end{tabular}

_Do these values concur with what you have learnt so far about how much different gases deviate from ideality?_
