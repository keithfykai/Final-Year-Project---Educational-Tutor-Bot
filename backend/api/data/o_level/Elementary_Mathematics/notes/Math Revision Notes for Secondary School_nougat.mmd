**Preface**

Hi there, thank you for downloading this book.

You have received a quick and concise summary of all the key concepts of every chapters in Secondary School Math.

Most students dread revising using the textbooks because they are too thick and lengthy.

That is why we compile this book to help your child extract and understand all the key concepts of each chapter.

This Revision Notes is broken down into different chapters, according to the latest MOE syllabus.

Each chapter is further broken down into different concepts and each concept is explained with examples.

Read and understand the concepts. Understand the examples behind the concepts to make sure that you know how to apply them next time.

Practice is essential. After understanding the concepts, your child needs to put in sufficient practice to master them. Use this book as a homework companion when practicing Math questions.

I hope that through this book, your child will enjoy learning Math as much as I do.

If your child needs more help, feel free to check out our online courses and tuition classes below.

We look forward to teaching your child one day.

**Chapter 1: Factors and Multiples**

**Prime Numbers**

Prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.

Examples: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23....

**Prime Factorisation**

Process of breaking up a composite number into its prime factors.

**Example**

\begin{tabular}{c|l l}
2 & 1176 \\
2 & 588 \\
2 & 294 \\
3 & 147 \\
7 & 49 \\
7 & 7 \\ \cline{2-3}  & 1 \\ \end{tabular}

**Highest Common Factor (H.C.F)**

The Highest Common Factor (H.C.F) of two (or more) numbers is the **largest number** that **divides evenly** into all the numbers.

To find the H.C.F in index form, compare the factors and take the **Lower Power**

**Example**

Find the H.C.F of \(2\times 3^{2}\times 5\) and \(2^{2}\times 3^{3}\times 7\times 13\)**.**

\(2\times 3^{2}\times 5\)

\(2^{2}\times 3^{3}\)\(\times 7\times 13\)

\(HCF=2\times 3^{2}\)

**Lowest Common Multiple (L.C.M)**

The Lowest Common Multiple (LCM) of two (or more) numbers is the **smallest number** that is **divisible by all the numbers**.

To find the L.C.M in index form, compare the factors and take the **Higher Power Example**

Compare and take the **Higher Power**

\(2\times 3^{2}\times 5^{2}\times 11\)

\(2^{3}\times 3\times 5^{3}\)

\(LCM=2^{3}\times 3^{2}\times 5^{3}\times 11\)

**Perfect Square**

\(4=2^{2}\)\(\sqrt{4}=2\)\(9=3^{2}\)\(\sqrt{9}=3\)\(16=2^{4}\)\(\sqrt{16}=2^{2}\)\(25=5^{2}\)\(\sqrt{25}=5\)

Perfect Squares \(\blacktriangleright\) 4, 9, 16, 25...

\(\blacktriangleright\) All the powers of the factors are divisible by 2

**Perfect Cube**

\(8=2^{3}\)\(\sqrt[3]{8}=2\)\(27=3^{3}\)\(\sqrt[3]{27}=3\)\(64=2^{6}\)\(\sqrt[3]{64}=2^{2}\)

Perfect Cube \(\blacktriangleright\) 8, 27, 64...

\(\blacktriangleright\) All the powers of the factors are divisible by 3

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:13]

**More Than, Less Than**

"a \(>\) b" means a is more than b.

Example: \(-2\) \(>\) \(-3\)

"a \(<\) b" means a is less than b.

Example: \(-3\) \(<\) \(-2\)

**Times and Divide for Negative Number**

**The 4 Rules of Multiplication**

1. Plus \(\times\) Plus = Plus \(2\times 1=2\)
2. Plus \(\times\) Minus = Minus \(2\times\) -1 = -2
3. Minus \(\times\) Plus = Minus -2 \(\times\) 1 = -2
4. Minus \(\times\) Minus = Plus -2 \(\times\) -1 = 2

**Order of Operations**

**(BODMAS rule)**

1. Brackets
2. Order (Power Of)
3. Division and Multiplication, left to right
4. Addition and Subtraction, left to right

**Example**

\[-2+[3-(-4)^{2}]\times(-5) = -2+[3-16]\times(-5)\] \[= -2+(-13)\times(-5)\] \[= -2+65\] \[= 63\]

**Chapter 3: Estimation**

**Rounding Off**

**Decimal Place**

\(24.16\approx 24.2\) (1 d.p)

**Nearest 10, 100 etc**

\(7894\approx 7890\) (Nearest Tens)

\(\approx 7900\) (Nearest Hundreds)

**Nearest unit**

\(789g=0.789kg\)

\(\approx 1\ kg\) (Nearest Kg)

**Significant Figures**

Significant figures show the accuracy in measurements.

The higher the significant figures, the accurate the answer is.

**Rules of Significant Figures**

1.23 has 3 significant figures (All the digits give us information on how accurate the measurement is).

0.123 has 3 significant figures (The first zero only tell us the size, and not the accuracy of the measurement).

0.1230 has 4 significant figures (The last zero tells us that this number has been rounded off, so it is significant).

0.10023 has 5 significant figures (All the zeros between the significant figures are significant).

10.0 has 3 significant figures (The zero between the significant figures is significant too).

10 has either 2 significant figures or 1 significant figure (Depending on the question)

For example, \(10.2\approx 10\) (2 sf)

\(\mbox{Or }10.2\approx 10\) (1 sf)

**Remember The 4 Rules of Multiplication!**

1. \(\text{Plus}\times\text{Plus}=\text{Plus}\)
2. \(\text{Plus}\times\text{Minus}=\text{Minus}\)
3. \(\text{Minus}\times\text{Plus}=\text{Minus}\)
4. \(\text{Minus}\times\text{Minus}=\text{Plus}\)

**Substitution**

**Example**

Given that \(x=5\) and \(y=-2\), evaluate \(\dfrac{x}{2x+y}\). \(\dfrac{y}{x}\).

\(\dfrac{x}{2x+y}-\dfrac{y}{x}\)

\(=\dfrac{5}{2(5)+(-2)}-\dfrac{2}{5}\)

\(=\dfrac{5}{10-2}+\dfrac{2}{5}\)

\(=\dfrac{5}{8}+\dfrac{2}{5}\)

\(=\dfrac{41}{40}\)

**Algebra Simplification for Times and Divide**

**Examples**

1. \(3a\times 5a=15a^{2}\)
2. \(27a+9b\times 3c\)

\(=27a\times\dfrac{1}{9b}\times 3c\)

\(=\dfrac{9ac}{b}\)

**Algebraic Expansion**

**Example**

Expand and Simplify \(2(a+b)-3(2a-b)\)

\(2(a+b)-3(2a-b)\)

\(=2a+2b-6a+3b\)

\(=2a-6a+2b+3b\)

\(=-4a+5b\)

**Algebraic Fraction**

**Example**

\[\text{Express }\frac{x-2}{4}+\frac{2x-2}{6}\text{ as a single fraction in its simplest form}.\]

\[\frac{x-2}{4}+\frac{2x-2}{6}\]

\[=\frac{3(x-2)}{12}+\frac{2(2x-2)}{12}\]

\[=\frac{3x-6+4x-4}{12}\]

\[=\frac{7x-10}{12}\]

**Algebraic Factorisation**

Identify the H.C.F of the terms and put outside the bracket.

**Examples**

1. \(12xy-36yz\)

\(=12y(x-3z)\)

2. \(4x-8x^{2}\)

\(=4x(1-2x)\)

**Solving Linear Equations**

### Example

Solve for \(x\) in the following equation:

\(3(4x-1)=7(2x-5)\)

\(3(4x-1)=7(2x-5)\)

\(12x-3=14x-35\)

\(12x-14x=-35+3\)

\(-2x=-32\)

\(x=\frac{-32}{-2}\)

\(x=16\)

### Solving Equations Involving Algebraic Fractions

Solve for \(x\) in the following equation:

\[\frac{2p+1}{6}-\frac{6-5p}{5}=\frac{12p-15}{10}\]

### Multiply each term by 30 (The LCM of 6, 5 and 10)

\[\left(\frac{2p+1}{6}\right)\times 30-\left(\frac{6-5p}{5}\right)\times 3 0=\left(\frac{12p-15}{10}\right)\times 30\] \[5(2p+1)-6(6-5p)=3(12p-15)\] \[10p+5-36+30p=36p-45\] \[10p+30p-36p=-45-5+36\] \[4p=-14\] \[p=\frac{7}{2}\]

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:19]

**Gradient**

Determines the slope of a line

This line has a lower gradient.

This line has a higher gradient.

**Calculation of Gradient**

Gradient = \(\frac{y_{2}-y_{1}}{x_{2}-x_{1}}=\frac{\text{Change in y}}{\text{Change in x}}\)

Change in \(x=3-1=2\)

Gradient = \(4+2=2\)

**Different Gradients**

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:22]

**Chapter 7: Geometry (Angles)**

1. There are different types of angles. 1. An **acute** angle is less than 90\({}^{\circ}\). 2. A **right angle** is equal to 90\({}^{\circ}\). 3. An **obtuse** angle is between 90\({}^{\circ}\) and 180\({}^{\circ}\). 4. A **straight line** is equal to 180\({}^{\circ}\). 5. A **reflex angle** is larger than 180\({}^{\circ}\) but less than 360\({}^{\circ}\). 6. A **complete turn** is 360\({}^{\circ}\). 7.

2. Two angles are said to be **complementary angles** if their sum is \(90^{\circ}\).
3. Two angles are called **supplementary angles** if their sum is \(180^{\circ}\).
4. **Vertically opposite angles** are those on the opposite sides of two intersecting lines.
5. Two angles are said to be **corresponding angles** if they have the same relative positive at the each intersection where a line cuts across a pair of parallel lines.

The corresponding angles are equal to each other.
6. Two angles are called **alternate angles** if they lie on the different side of the line cutting across a pair of parallel lines.

The alternate angles are equal to each other.
7. Two angles are known as **interior angles** if they lie on the same side of the line that lie on the different side of the line cutting across a pair of parallel lines.

**Chapter 8: Polygons**

1. A **polygon** is a closed plane figure with three or more straight lines. Polygons are named according to the number of sides they have. (3-sided) Quadrilateral Pentagon Hexagon (4-sided) (5-sided) (6-sided)

Note: Polygon with n sides is called an \(n\)-gon.
2. A **regular polygon** is a polygon with all its sides and angles equal.
3. Triangles can be classified according to the number of equal sides they have. 1. An **equilateral triangle** is a triangle with 3 equal sides. Each of its angles is 60\({}^{\circ}\). 2. An **isosceles triangle** is a triangle with 2 equal sides. Its base angles are equal. (4) The **sum of the interior angles** of a triangle is always 180\({}^{\circ}\).

* A **quadrilateral** is a 4-sided polygon. Any quadrilateral can be divided into 2 triangles along its diagonal. Since the angles of a triangle add up to \(180^{\circ}\), the angle sum of a quadrilateral is \(180^{\circ}\times 2=360^{\circ}\).
* A **regular polygon** is a polygon with equal angles and equal sides. Its \(n\) interior angles add up to \((n-2)\times 180^{\circ}\).
* The sum of the exterior angles of an \(n\)-sided polygon is always \(360^{\circ}\).

**Example 11**

Find the exterior angle of a 12-sided regular polygon.

Solution

Let \(x\) the size of each exterior angle.

\(12\times x=360^{\circ}\)

\(x^{\circ}=30^{\circ}\)

**Example 12**

The ratio of an interior angle to an exterior angle of a regular \(n\)-sided polygon is 8 : 1. How many sides does the polygon have?

Let 8a and a be the interior angle and the exterior angle at the same vertex respectively.

\(\mathit{exterior\ angle}+\mathit{interior\ angle}=\mathit{180^{\circ}}\) (**adjacent \(\boldsymbol{\angle}\)s on a straight line**)

\[a+8a =\mathit{180^{\circ}}\] \[a =\mathit{20^{\circ}}\] \[\mathit{Sum\ of\ exterior\ angles}=\mathit{360^{\circ}}\] \[20^{\circ}(n) =\mathit{360^{\circ}}\] \[n =\mathit{18}\]

**Chapter 11: Ratio and Proportion**

#### Ratio Involving Rational Number

What is a ratio?

* A ratio is a comparison of 2 quantities in the **same units**

Example:

\[3\text{ m}:20\text{ cm}\qquad\qquad\qquad 15:1=\frac{15}{1}\]

\[=300\text{ cm}:20\text{ cm}\]

\[=15:1\]

#### Equivalent Ratios

**Example 1**

\[\frac{1}{2}:3=\frac{2}{3}x:5\] \[\frac{1}{2}+3x<5=\frac{2}{3}x\] \[\frac{5}{6}=\frac{2}{3}x\] \[x=\frac{5}{6}+\frac{2}{3}=\frac{5}{4}\]

#### Combining Ratios (Repeated Identity Concept)

**Example 1**

## Chapter 12 Percentage

### 12.1 Discount

A discount is a reduction in the price.

\[\text{Discount}=\text{Marked Price - Selling Price}\]

\[\text{Percentage Discount}=\frac{\text{Discount}}{\text{Marked Price}}\times 100\%\]

### 12.2 Gst

GST (Goods and Services Tax) is an increase on the price. In Singapore, the GST is 7%.

Price after \(\text{GST}=(100\%+GST)\times\)Selling Price

### 12.3 Conversion

To convert a fraction or decimal to percentage, multiply it by 100%.

\[\frac{1}{4}= \frac{1}{4}\times 100\% 1\frac{1}{2}=\frac{3}{2}\times 100\%\] \[= 25\% =150\%\] \[0.8= 0.8\times 100\% 1.2= 1.2\times 100\%\] \[= 80\% = 120\%\]

### 12.4 Finding Percentage of a Number

To find percentage of a number,

1. Write the percentage as a fraction
2. Multiply the fraction by the number

\[25\%\text{ of }80 =\frac{25}{100}\times 80 125\%\text{ of }80 =\frac{125}{100}\times 80\] \[=\frac{1}{4}\times 80 =\frac{5}{4}\times 80\] \[=20 =100\]

#### Express one Quantity as a Percentage of Another

To express one quantity as a percentage of another,

1. Express as a fraction
2. Multiply the fraction by 100%

Express 15 cm as a percentage of 0.8 m

0.8 m = 80 cm

\[\frac{15}{80}\times 100\%=18.75\%\]

#### Reverse Percentage

25% of \(x\) is equal to 30, what is \(x\)?

1. Express 25% as a fraction.
2. Divide 30 by the fraction.

\[x =30+\frac{25}{100}\] \[\frac{25}{100}\ x=30 =30+\frac{1}{4}\] \[=30\times 4\] \[=120\]

#### Percentage Increase and Decrease

Percentage Increase = \frac{Increase}{Original}\times 100\%

Percentage Decrease = \frac{Decrease}{Original}\times 100\%

The price of a bag increased from $28 to $32. Find the percentage increase?

\[32-28=4\] \[\frac{4}{28}\times 100\%=14\frac{2}{7}\%\]

**Chapter 13: Rate and Speed**

**Rate**

**Definition of Rate**

* Measures how fast something changes
* Rate of Change of Distance = Speed (m/s)
* Rate of Change of Volume = Water Rate (litres per min)
* Printing Rate (Example: 100 pages/min)
* Working Rate (Example: Clean 1 house in 3 days)

**Speed**

* Average Speed is Total Distance \(\div\) Total Time

**Conversion**

Express 120 km/h in m/s.

Recall: 1 km = 1000 m

1 hour = 3600 sec

120 km/h = 120 000 m/h

\(=120\ 000\div 3600\) m/s

\(=13\) m/s (Ans)

**Perimeter**

1. We use **millimetres** (mm), **centimetres** (cm), **metres** (m) and **kilometres** (km) as units for measuring lengths or distances. The units are related as follows: 1km = 1000m; 1m = 100cm; 1cm = 10mm
2. Perimeter of a **circle** is referred to as the circumference. The **circumference**, \(C\), of a circle of radius, r, can be obtained by using this formula, circumference = \(2\times\pi\times r\) where \(\pi=3.14\) or \(\frac{22}{7}\).
3. Area of a closed figure is the amount of space it covers. It is measured in square units.
4. Note: 1cm\({}^{2}\) = 1 cm \(\times\) 1 cm \(=\) 10 mm \(\times\) 10 mm \(=\) 100 mm\({}^{2}\) b) 1 m\({}^{2}\) = 1 m \(\times\) 1 m \(=\) 100 cm \(\times\) 100 cm \(=\) 10 000 cm\({}^{2}\) c) 1 km\({}^{2}\) = 1 km \(\times\) 1 km \(=\) 1 000 m \(\times\) 1 000 m \(=\) 1 000 000 m\({}^{2}\) d) Hectare (ha) is a unit for measuring large land areas such as farms. 1 ha = 10 000 m\({}^{2}\)5. Area of a \(\textbf{triangle}=\frac{1}{2}\ \times\text{base}\times\text{height}\)
6. Area of a \(\textbf{ parallelogram}=\text{base}\times\text{height}\)
7. Area of a \(\textbf{trapezium}=\frac{1}{2}\ \times\text{(sum of parallel sides)}\times\text{height}\)
8. Area of a \(\textbf{circle}=\pi\times r^{2}\), where \(\pi=3.14\) or \(\frac{22}{7}\).

13. A cube has 6 equal faces. Therefore, its surface area is obtained by multiplying the area of one face by 6.
14. The lateral surface of a cylinder is also called the curved surface. If we rolled up a piece of rectangular sheet, the rectangular sheet will become the curved surface of the cylinder.

Area of rectangle = curved surface area of the cylinder

\[=2\pi rh\]

Hence, total surface area of a solid cylinder = area of curved surface + 2 x area of base

\[=2\pi rh+2\pi r^{2}\]

**Mass and Density**

15. The density of a substance is the mass of one unit volume of the substance. It is calculated using the formula:

\[Density=\frac{Mass}{Volume}\]

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:39]

4. The information about the pets owned by 48 children can be represented by a horizontal or a vertical **bar graph**.
5. A **pie chart** uses sectors of a circle to represent relative quantities. It compares the proportions of a whole instead of the actual numerical values. However, it is not suitable to display too many categories. Also, we need to calculate the angle size of each sector before drawing a pie chart.
6. The following pie chart shows the number of pets owned by 44 children.

Observe that

1. Each sector corresponds to the percentage of pets for that category.
2. The angle of each sector is proportional to the number of pets for that category.

7. A **line graph** is drawn by plotting the frequencies at various points and then joining the points with line segments. This is particularly useful when we wish to show trends over time.
8. A **histogram** is a vertical bar graph with no space in between the bars. The area of each bar is proportional to the frequency it represents.

**In Summary**

A **bar graph** is used to **compare quantities.**

A **pie chart** is used to **compare proportions.**

A **line chart** is used to **show trends.**

A **histogram** is similar to bar graph except it has **no gaps between the bars** and **the area is proportional to the frequency.**For Sec 2

**Chapter 2: Direct and Inverse Proportion**

**Direct Proportion**

2 quantities \(x\) and \(y\) are said to be **directly proportional** to each other if \(x=ky\), where k is a constant.

**Example**

\(A\) is directly proportional to \(B\), given that \(A=125\) when \(B=5\), find an equation connecting \(A\) and \(B\)

\(A=kB\)

\(125=k\times 5\)

\(k=25\)

\(A=25B\)

**Inverse Proportion**

2 quantities X and Y are said to be **inversely proportional** to each other if \(x=\dfrac{k}{y}\), where k is a constant.

**Example**

(i) \(A\) is inversely proportional to \(B\), given that \(A=125\) when \(B=5\), find an equation connecting \(A\) and \(B\)

\(A=\dfrac{k}{B}\)

\(125=\dfrac{k}{5}\)

\(k=625\)

\(A=\dfrac{625}{B}\)

**Algebraic Expansion**

**Type 1: Expand and Simplify (Rainbow Method)**

a) \(\widehat{a\big{(}b+c\big{)}}=ab+ac\)

**Example**

\(\widehat{x\big{(}5-y\big{)}}\)

\(=x(5)+x(-y)\)

\(=5x-xy\)

Take note that when we remove the bracket, the signs are included in each multiplication.

**Type 2: Expand with formula (Algebraic Identity)**

a) \((a+b)^{2}=a^{2}+2ab+b^{2}\)

b) \((a-b)^{2}=a^{2}-2ab+b^{2}\)

c) \((a+b)(a-b)=a^{2}-b^{2}\)

**Example 1**

\((x+2)^{2}=x^{2}+4x+4\)

**Example 2**

\((x-2)^{2}=x^{2}-4x+4\)

**Example 3**

\((x+2)(x-2)=x^{2}-4\)

**Algebraic Factorisation**

**Type 1: Taking out Highest Common Factor (HCF)**

To factorise the algebraic expression given, we need to identify the common factor.

**Example 1**

\[5x-xy\]

\[=x(5-y)\]

**Example 2**

\[a^{2}b+2ab-ab^{2}\]

\[=ab(a+2-b)\]

**Type 2: Group Factorisation**

We need to group the terms to find the common factors.

In some situations, we may need to change the operator in order to find the common factor.

**Example 1**

\[2x^{2}-8x-4+x\] \[= 2x(x-4)-1(4-x)\] \[= 2x(x-4)+1(x-4)\] \[= (2x+1)(x-4)\]

**Example 2**

\[\text{ Factorise }\ 2x+2y+\alpha x+\alpha y\ \text{ completely.}\] \[2x+2y+\alpha x+\alpha y\] \[= 2(x+y)+\alpha(x+y)\] \[= (2+a)(x+y)\]

**Type 3: Factorisation by formula (Algebraic Identity)**

\[a^{2}+2ab+b^{2}=(a+b)^{2}\]

\[a^{2}-2ab+b^{2}=(a-b)^{2}\]

\[a^{2}-b^{2}=(a+b)(a-b)\]

**Example 1**

Factories \(x^{2}+18x+81\) completely.

\[x^{2}+18x+81\]

\[=x^{2}+2(x)(9)+(9)^{2}\]

\[=(x+9)^{2}\]

**Example 2**

Factories \(x^{2}-8x+16\) completely.

\[x^{2}-8x+16\]

\[=x^{2}-2(x)(4)+(4)^{2}\]

\[=(x-4)^{2}\]

**Example 3**

Factories \(x^{4}-81\) completely.

\[x^{4}-81\]

\[=(x^{2})^{2}-(9)^{2}\]

\[=(x^{2}+9)(x^{2}-9)\]

\[=(x^{2}+9)(x^{2}-3^{2})\]

\[=(x^{2}+9)(x+3)(x-3)\]

 (This is a complete factorisation.)

**Type 4: Quadratic Factorisation**

**Example 1**

Factorise \(a^{2}+5a+6\)

Observe that

a) the quadratic term, \(a^{2}\), is the product of \(a\) and \(a\);

b) the coefficient of \(x\), 5, is the sum of 2 and 3; and

c) the constant term, 6, is the product of 2 and 3.

Using cross-multiplication method to factorise \(a^{2}+5a+6\), follow the following steps.

Step 1: Factorise the quadratic term, \(a^{2}\), into two linear factors.

\(a^{2}=a\times a\)

Step 2: Factorise the constant term, 6, into product of two numbers.

\(6=1\times 6\)

\(6=2\times 3\)

Step 3: Place the factors of the quadratic term and the constant term in two columns.

Cross multiply the factors and write the products in the third column. Add up the products in the third column to see which pair of factors gives \(+5a\) as the middle term.

When we consider \(6=1\times 6\), the sign for 6 will be negative and is different from the algebraic expression required, therefore \((a-1)(a+6)\) cannot be the factorisation of \(a^{2}+5a+6\).

\(\therefore a^{2}+5a+6=(a+2)(a+3)\)

## Similarity

Two figures are said to be **similar** if they have the **same shape but different sizes.**

Example:

1. The two triangles above are similar but not congruent due to the different sizes.
2. Similarity statement: \(\Delta ABC\) is similar to \(\Delta\)_DEF_. When we write similarity statement, the letters representing the vertices of the shape have to be written in marching pairs. For example: \(\Delta ABC\) is similar to \(\Delta\)_DEF_
3. The corresponding angles of similar figures are equal. Example: \(\Delta ABC\) is similar to \(\Delta\)_DEF_ \(\measuredangle BAC=\measuredangle EDF\), \(\measuredangle ABC=\measuredangle DEF\), \(\measuredangle ACB=\measuredangle DFE\)
4. The ratios of corresponding sides of similar figures are equal. Example: \(\Delta ABC\) is similar to \(\Delta\)_DEF_. Therefore: \(\frac{AB}{DE}\)\(=\)\(\frac{BC}{EF}\)\(=\)\(\frac{CA}{FD}\)\(\frac{3\) cm\(=\)\(\frac{4\) cm\(=\)\(\frac{5\) cm\(}{10\) cm\(}=\)\(\frac{1}{2}\)

The data is grouped into different class interval

There is no spacing between the different rectangles.

The area of the rectangles are proportional to the frequencies.

#### 5.2.2 Stem and Leaf

Stem-and-leaf diagram is used to organize a large amount of data.

In a stem and leaf diagram, each value is split into two parts, the stem and the leaf.

The leaf of a number is usually the last digit in a number.

The stem is the remaining digit or digits to the left.

**Advantages and disadvantages of different forms of statistical representation:**

The choice of statistical representation depends on the type of data collected and the purpose of collecting the data.

#### 5.2.3 Dot diagram

An advantage is that it is an easy way to display small sets of data that do not contain many distinct values.

A disadvantage is that if a set of data is too large, the diagram may appeared packed.

#### 5.2.4 Histogram

An advantage is that the data sets with the highest and the lowest frequencies can be easily determined.

#### 5.2.5 Stem-and-leaf diagram

An advantage is that individual data values are retained.

The shape of the data distribution can be easily observed if appropriate units are used.

A disadvantage is that it is not useful if there are extreme values in a set of data as many stems with no leaves will be present.

**Measures of central tendency**

A measure of central tendency refers to a value that indicates the approximate centre of a set of data. The 3 most common measures of central tendency are the mean, median, mode.

**MEAN**

1. The mean of a data set is the sum of all the data values divided by the total number of data.

\[Mean=\frac{\mbox{\it Sum of all data}}{\mbox{\it Total number of data}}\]

**MEDIAN**

1. The middle value of a set of ordered numbers (ascending or descending) is the median.

2. For a set of \(n\) data arranged in ascending or descending order

If the total number of data is odd, the median is the middle value.

If the total number of data is even, the median is the mean of the 2 middle values.

The middle position of a set of data = \(\frac{n+1}{2}\)

**MODE**

1. Mode of a data set is the value which occurs the most frequently (i.e. the data that has the highest frequency) or

2. Modal class is the class interval with the highest frequency.

**Example**

Consider the data: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5,

Mean \[=\frac{1+2+3+4+5+5}{6}\] \[=\frac{10}{3}\] Median \[=\frac{3+4}{2}\] \[=3.5\] Mode \[=5\]

## Chapter 15 Probability

### Introduction of Probability

#### Probability

is a measure of chance.

The probability of an event, A is:

\[P(A)=\frac{k}{m}\]

Where k is the number of outcomes of A while m is the total number of possible outcomes.

When the probability is 0, it is impossible to happen.

When the probability is 1, it will certainly happen.

#### Mutually Exclusive Events and Addition Law

Two events are called mutually exclusive events if they **cannot occur at the same time.**

Eg. In tossing a coin, the event A of getting 1 head and the event of event B of getting 1 tail are exclusive events. They cannot happen at the same time.

#### Addition Law

If A and B are exclusive events, then the probability that either A or B occurring is given by

\[P(A\ or\ B)=P(A)+P(B)\]

#### Example

A bag contains 4 red balls, 5 green balls and 6 yellow balls. If a ball is drawn at random from the bag, find the probability that the ball is either green or yellow.

Total of balls in the bags

\(=4+5+6\)

\(=15\)

P(ball is either green or yellow)

\(=\) P(ball is green) + P(ball is yellow)

\(=\frac{5}{15}+\frac{6}{15}\)

\(=\frac{11}{15}\)

## Independent Events and Multiplication Law

Two events are called independent events if the occurrence of one event does not affect the probability of occurrence of the other event.

Eg. In tossing a coin and a die, the event A that the coin is a head and the event B that the number on the die is even are independent events.

**Multiplication Law**

If A and B are independent events, then the probability that both A and B occurring is given by

\[\textit{P(A and B)}=\textit{P(A)}\ \times\textit{P(B)}\]

**Example**

A bag contains 4 red balls and 6 green balls. Two balls are drawn from the bag one by one with replacement. Find the probability that

i) both balls are red,

ii) one ball is red and one ball is green.

i) P(both balls are red) \(=\) P(1^{\text{st}}\) ball is red) \(\times\) P(2^{\text{nd}}\) ball is red) \(=\) \(\dfrac{4}{10}\times\dfrac{4}{10}\) \(=\) \(\dfrac{16}{100}\) \(=\) \(\dfrac{4}{25}\) ii) P(one ball is red and one ball is green) \(=\) P((1^{\text{st}}\) ball is red and 2^{\text{nd}}\) ball is green) or (1^st ball is green and 2^nd ball is red)] \(=\) \(\dfrac{4}{10}\times\dfrac{6}{10}\) \(+\) \(\dfrac{6}{10}\times\dfrac{4}{10}\) \(=\) \(\dfrac{24}{100}+\dfrac{24}{100}\) \(=\) \(\dfrac{48}{100}\) \(=\) \(\dfrac{12}{25}\)For Sec 3

**Chapter 2: Quadratic Equations**

A quadratic equation is in the form of \(ax^{2}+bx+c=0\) where \(a\), \(b\) and \(c\) are constants, and \(a\neq 0\).

It can be solved by :

1. Factorisation
2. Completing the square
3. Using quadratic formula

**(i)**: **Factorisation**

Example: \(2x^{2}-3x-9=0\)

By trial and error, cross multiply

\(2x+3)(x-3)=0\)

\(2x+3=0\)\(or\)\(x-3=0\)

\(x=-\frac{3}{2}\)\(or\)\(x=3\)\((ans)\)
**(ii)**: **Completing the square**

To solve the quadratic equation \(ax^{2}+bx+c=0\), where \(a\neq 0\)

Step 1 Change coefficient of \(x^{2}\) equal to 1

\(a(x^{2}+\frac{b}{a}x+\frac{c}{a})=0\)

Step 2 Leave \(x^{2}\) and \(x\) terms on LHS

\(x^{2}+\frac{b}{a}x=-\frac{c}{a}\)

Step 3 _Coefficient of \(x+2\), square it_, _add to both sides_

\(x^{2}+\frac{b}{a}x+\left(\frac{b}{2a}\right)^{2}=-\frac{c}{a}+\left(\frac{b}{ 2a}\right)^{2}\)

Step 4 Factorise the equation

\(x+\frac{b}{2a}\)\(x=-\frac{c}{a}+\left(\frac{b}{2a}\right)^{2}\)

Step 5 Simplify\[\begin{array}{ll}\mbox{\bf JIMMY}&\mbox{\bf www.jimmymaths.com}\\ \mbox{\bf M a t h s}&\\ \mbox{\bf Example:}&2x^{2}-3x-9=0\\ &x^{2}-\frac{3}{2}x-\frac{9}{2}=0\\ &x^{2}-\frac{3}{2}x=\frac{9}{2}\\ &x^{2}-\frac{3}{2}x+\left(-\frac{3}{4}\right)^{2}=\frac{9}{2}+\left(-\frac{3}{ 4}\right)^{2}\\ &\left(x-\frac{3}{4}\right)^{2}=\frac{9}{2}+\frac{9}{16}\\ &=\frac{81}{16}\\ &\left(x-\frac{3}{4}\right)=\pm\frac{9}{4}\\ &x=\frac{3}{4}+\frac{9}{4}\quad\mbox{or}\quad x=\frac{3}{4}-\frac{9}{4}\\ &=3\quad\quad\mbox{or}\quad=-\frac{3}{2}\quad(ans)\end{array}\]

**(iii) Quadratic Formula**

To solve the quadratic equation \(ax^{2}+bx+c=0\), where \(a\neq 0\) using the formula

\[x=\frac{-b\pm\sqrt{b^{2}-4ac}}{2a}\]

Example: \[\begin{array}{ll}2x^{2}-4x+1=0\\ &a=2,\;\;b=-4,\;\;c=1\\ &x=\frac{-(-4)\pm\sqrt{(-4)^{2}-4(2)(1)}}{2(2)}\\ &x=\frac{4\pm\sqrt{8}}{4}\\ &x=1.71\;\;\mbox{or}\;\;0.293\;\;(to\;3\;s.f.)\;\;(ans)\end{array}\]

**Note:**

In the case where \(b^{2}-4ac<0\), \(x=\frac{-b\pm\sqrt{b^{2}-4ac}}{2a}\)_has no solution_ (_no real roots_)

## 2 Graphical Method

To solve the quadratic equation \(\alpha x^{2}+bx+c=0\), where \(a\neq 0\) and the highest power of \(x\) is 2, the solution can be obtained from the intersection of the graph \(y=\alpha x^{2}+bx+c\) and the \(x\)-axis. The graph cuts the \(x\)-axis when \(y=0\).

(a) If \(a>0\), the graph open upwards (b) If \(a<0\), the graph open downwards

Example : \(y=2x^{2}-3x-9\)

\[\begin{array}{c}\mbox{when }y=0,\quad 2x^{2}-3x-9=0\\ (2x+3)(x-3)=0\\ x=-\frac{3}{2}\;\;or\;\;x=3\;\;(ans)\end{array}\]

**Special rules for linear inequalities:**

* When an inequality is multiplied or divided by a negative number, the inequality sign must be reversed. Example (1) \(-2x>10\) Multiply by \(-1\), \((-2x)(-1)<(10)(-1)\)* sign reversed to "\(<\)" \(2x<-10\) \(\therefore x<-5\)
* Reverse the inequality sign whenever you take the reciprocal of both sides Example \(3>\frac{1}{x}\)
* sign reversed to "\(<\)" \(x>\frac{1}{3}\)

**Combined inequality** Example (1) Solve \(-7\leq 3x-5\leq 2\) separate it into 2 inequalities, \(-7\leq 3x-5\), \(3x-5\leq 2\) move the variable to one side, \(-7+5\leq 3x\), \(3x\leq 2+5\) simplify, \(-2\leq 3x\), \(3x\leq 7\) \(-\frac{2}{3}\leq x\), \(x\leq\frac{7}{3}\) \(\therefore-\frac{2}{3}\leq x\leq\frac{7}{3}\)

**Chapter 4: Coordinate Geometry**

**Finding Length**

The length of the line segment joining two points \(A(x_{i},y_{1})\) _and_\(B(x_{2},y_{2})\) is given by

\(AB=\sqrt{\left(x_{2}-x_{1}\right)^{2}+\left(y_{2}-y_{1}\right)^{2}}\)

\(A(x_{1},y_{1})\)

\(x\)

The gradient of the line joining two points \(A(x_{i},y_{1})\) _and_\(B(x_{2},y_{2})\) is given by

\(gradient=m=\frac{y_{2}-y_{1}}{x_{2}-x_{1}}\) _where_\(x_{1}\neq x_{2}\)

\(A(x_{1},y_{1})\)

**Ratio of Volumes of Similar Solids**

For 2 geometrically similar solids,

the ratio of their length or heights are \(l_{1}:l_{2}\) and \(h_{1}:h_{2}\)

then the ratio of their areas is given by \(\frac{A_{1}}{A_{2}}=\left(\frac{h_{1}}{h_{2}}\right)^{2}=\left(\frac{l_{1}}{l_ {2}}\right)^{2}\)

and the ratio of their volumes is given by \(\frac{V_{1}}{V_{2}}=\left(\frac{h_{1}}{h_{2}}\right)^{3}=\left(\frac{l_{1}}{l_ {2}}\right)^{3}\)

Circumference: is the distance around a circle. Tangent: A line that touches a circle at only one point.

**Symmetry properties**

1. Equal chords are equidistant from the centre 

2. The perpendicular bisector of a chord passes through the centre 

3. Tangents from an external point are equal in length If TA and TB are tangents from T to a circle centre O then TA = TB
4. The line joining an external point to the centre of the circle bisects the angle between the tangents If TA and TB are tangents from T to a circle centre O then OT bisects \(\angle\) ATB and \(\angle\) a = \(\angle\) b

**Angle properties**

**Area of Triangle**

For non-right angled triangle with any 2 given sides and an included angle,

\[\text{Area of }\Delta\text{ABC} = \frac{1}{2}ab\sin C\] \[= \frac{1}{2}ac\sin B\] \[= \frac{1}{2}bc\sin A\]

**Sine rule**

For any triangle ABC,

\[\frac{a}{\sin A}=\frac{b}{\sin B}=\frac{c}{\sin C}\]

where A, B and C are the interior angles

or

### Chapter 10: Circular Measure

Radian is another unit of measure for angles, similar to degrees.

One radian is the angle made at the center of a circle by an arc whose length is equal to the radius of the circle.

### 11.1 Conversion from radians and degrees

\[2\pi\ radians=360^{\circ}\] \[\pi\ radians=\frac{360^{\circ}}{2}=180^{\circ}\] \[1\ radian=\frac{180^{\circ}}{\pi}\]

### 11.2 Conversion from degree to radians

\[360^{\circ}=2\pi\ radians\] \[180^{\circ}=\pi\ radians\] \[1^{\circ}=\frac{\pi}{180}\ radi\]

Conversion between radians and degrees

\[\times\frac{\pi}{180^{\circ}}\] \[\times\frac{180^{\circ}}{\pi}\] \[\times\frac{180^{\circ}}{\pi}\]

#### Area of Segment

Area of segment = Area of Sector - Area of Triangle

\[=\frac{\theta^{\circ}}{360^{\circ}}\times\pi r^{2}-\frac{1}{2}\,{\rm r}^{2}\, \sin\!\theta\;\;(\mbox{\it if }\;\theta\mbox{\rm\ is in degree})\]

\[=\frac{1}{2}\,r^{2}\theta-\frac{1}{2}\,{\rm r}^{2}\,\,\sin\!\theta\;\;(\mbox{ \it if }\;\theta\mbox{\rm\ is in radian})\]

**Chapter 2: Probability**

**Probability Using Set Notations**

If the sample space of an experiment has \(m\) equally likely outcomes with \(k\) ways for event \(E\) to occur, then the probability of an event \(E\) (or a specific outcome) happening is

\[\text{P}(E)=\frac{\text{number of favourable outcomes for event }E}{\text{ total number of possible outcomes}}=\frac{k}{m}=\frac{\text{n}(E)}{\text{n}(S)}=\frac{\text{n}(E)}{\text{n}(E)+\text{n}(E^{{}^{ \prime}})}\]

Recall that for any event \(\text{E}\), \(\text{P}(\text{not }E)=1-\text{P}(E)\). Therefore,

\[\text{P}(E^{{}^{\prime}})=1-\text{P}(E)\,.\]

_Example_

Suppose \(A\) is the event that a letter is chosen from the word 'INTENSE' is a vowel. Using set notations, find P(\(A\)).

Solution

\(S=\{\text{I,N}_{1},\text{T,E}_{1},\text{N}_{2},\text{S,E}_{2}\}\)

\(\text{n}(S)=7\)

\(A=\{\text{I,E}_{1},\text{E}_{2}\}\)

\(\text{n}(A)=3\)

P(\(A\)) = \(\frac{\text{n}(A)}{\text{n}(S)}=\frac{3}{7}\)

**Combined Events, Possibility and Tree Diagrams**

We can also list all the possible outcomes in an experiment using a possibility diagram or a tree diagram.

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|} \hline  & \multicolumn{2}{|c|}{**In Summary**} \\ \cline{2-3}
**Number of stages or** & **Example** & **Representation of** \\

2 & Choosing 2 balls from a bag, one after another & Possibility diagram \\ \hline
3 or more & Choosing 5 balls from a bag, one after another & Tree diagram \\ \hline \end{tabular}

### Example - Possibility Diagram

A pair of fair dice are rolled. Let \(B\) denote the integer sum of the two numbers shown on both dice. Find the probability that

a) \(B=10\); b) \(B\) is odd; c) \(B<13\); d) \(B>12\).

Solution

A possibility diagram is drawn to represent the sample space for rolling two dice.

a) \(\text{P}(B=10)=\dfrac{3}{36}\) b) \(\text{P}(B\) is odd) \(=\dfrac{18}{36}\)

c) \(\text{P}(B<13)=\dfrac{36}{36}\) d) \(\text{P}(B>12)=\dfrac{0}{36}\)

=0

#### Example - Tree Diagram

Three fair coins are tossed. Find the probability of getting

1. 3 heads;
2. at least one tail.

Solution

A tree diagram is drawn to represent the sample space for tossing three coins.

a) P(3 heads) = P(HHH)

b) Method 1 P(at least 1 tail) = 1 - P(no tail)

= 1 - P(3 heads)

= 1 - 18

= 78

Method 2

_Count the number of outcomes with at least 1 '\(T\)'_.

P(at least 1 tail) = 78

**Addition Law of Probability and Mutually Exclusive Events**

If two sets of events \(A\) and \(B\) cannot occur at the same time, then \(A\) and \(B\) are mutually exclusive. For example, when tossing a coin, the event \(A\): 'a head appears' and event \(B\): 'a tail appears' are mutually exclusive events.

In general,

If \(A\) and \(B\) are mutually exclusive events,

\(\circ\) \(\mathrm{P}(A\ \mathrm{or}\ B)=\mathrm{P}(A\cup B)=\mathrm{P}(B\cup A)=\mathrm{P}(A)+ \mathrm{P}(B)\)

\(\circ\) \(\mathrm{P}(A\cap B)=\mathrm{P}(\emptyset)=0\)

**To put it simply, add when you see "or".**

_Example_

A fair die is tossed. Find the probability of obtaining

either 1 or 4; \(\mathrm{ii)}\) neither 1 nor 4; \(\mathrm{iii)}\) 1 and 4.

Solution

_A dice cannot show both 1 or 4 at the same time so obtaining 1 and obtaining 4 from a die throw are mutually exclusive events._

\[\mathrm{P}(1\ \mathrm{or}\ 4) = \mathrm{P}(\mathrm{I})+\mathrm{P}(4)\] \[= \frac{1}{6}+\frac{1}{6}\] \[= \frac{1}{3}\]

_P_(neither 1 nor 4) = 1 - \(\mathrm{P}(1\ \mathrm{or}\ 4)\)

\(= 1-\frac{1}{3}\)

_There is only one number on each face of a die so this is an impossible outcome and event._

P(1 and 4) = 0

**Chapter 3: Statistics**

**Cumulative Frequency Table and Curve**

Cumulative frequency is the running total of frequencies. The cumulative frequency of a value is obtained by adding up the frequencies which are less than or equal to that value.

We use the data in a cumulative frequency table to draw a cumulative frequency curve.

_Example 1_

The table below shows the frequency table of the scores obtained by 32 students in a Math test.

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|} \hline
**Score, \(x\)** & **Frequency** \\ \hline \(0<x\leq 10\) & 2 \\ \hline \(10<x\leq 20\) & 5 \\ \hline \(20<x\leq 30\) & 13 \\ \hline \(30<x\leq 40\) & 9 \\ \hline \(40<x\leq 50\) & 3 \\ \end{tabular}

1. Construct a cumulative frequency table for the given data.
2. Using the table in (a), find the number of students who (i) scored less than or equal to 30 marks, (ii) scored more than 20 marks but not more than 40 marks.
3. Using a scale of 2 cm to represent 10 marks on the horizonal axis and 2 cm to represent 5 students on the vertical axis, draw the cumulative frequency curve for the given data.

Solution

(a) 
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|} \hline
**Score, \(x\)** & **Cumulative Frequency** \\ \hline \(x\leq 10\) & 2 \\ \hline \(x\leq 20\) & \(2+5=7\) \\ \hline \(x\leq 30\) & \(7+13=20\) \\ \hline \(x\leq 40\) & \(20+9=29\) \\ \hline \(x\leq 50\) & \(29+3=32\) \\ \end{tabular}

_Notice that the cumulative frequency for the last class in the table (\(x\leq 50\)) is the total number of students in the class._

2. (i) number of students who scored less than or equal to 30 marks \(=20\) (ii) number of students who scored more than 20 marks but not more than 40 marks \(=29-7\) \(=22\)When a set of data is arranged in ascending order, **quartiles** divide the data into four equal parts:

* the middle value of a set of data and it divides that set of data into two equal halves,
* middle of the lower half of a set of data,
* middle of the upper half of a set of data.

The **range** measures the spread of data. There are two measures of spread to show the degree of variation i.e. how spread out the data values are.

For a set of data,

* Smallest value
* Lower quartile = Q\({}_{3}\)

_Example_

For each of the following sets of data find

* Q\({}_{1}\), Q\({}_{2}\) and Q\({}_{3}\),
* the range,
* the interquartile range.

(a) \(\{13,3,11,8,9,5,10,3,17,1,20\}\)
* \(\{10,30,13,5,12,9,24,28\}\)

(a) Arranging the data set in ascending order, we get:

\(Q_{1}=3\)

\(Q_{2}=9\)

Range = \(20-1\)

= \(19\)

Interquartile Range = \(13-3\)

= \(10\)

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:111]

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:112]

**Standard Deviation**

**Interquartile range** measures the spread of a set of **data from the median Standard deviation** measures the spread of a set of **data from the mean**.

To find the standard deviation of an **ungrouped data** set \(\left\{x_{1},x_{2},x_{3},....,x_{n}\right\}\), where \(n\) is the number of data in the set:

Formula 1

Standard Deviation = \(\sqrt{\frac{\left(x-\overline{x}\right)^{2}+\left(x_{2}-\overline{x}\right)^ {2}+\left(x_{3}-\overline{x}\right)^{2}+...+\left(x_{n}-\overline{x}\right)^ {2}}{n}}\)

\[= \sqrt{\frac{\sum\left(x-\overline{x}\right)^{2}}{n}}\text{ \ \,\ where \ }\overline{x}=\frac{\sum x}{n}\]

Formula 2 (easier)

Standard Deviation = \(\sqrt{\frac{\left(x_{1}\right)^{2}+\left(x_{2}\right)^{2}+\left(x_{3}\right)^ {2}+...+\left(x_{n}\right)^{2}}{n}-\left(\overline{x}\right)^{2}}\)

\[= \sqrt{\frac{\sum x^{2}}{n}-\left(\overline{x}\right)^{2}}\text{ \ \,\ where \ }\overline{x}=\frac{\sum x}{n}\]

_Example_

The heights of five people in centimetres (cm) are: 155, 176, 182, 149, 166. Find the mean and the standard deviation of their heights.

\[\overline{x}=\frac{155+176+182+149+166}{5}= 165.6\,\text{cm}\]

\[\sum x^{2}= 155^{2}+176^{2}+182^{2}+149^{2}+166^{2}\] \[= 137882\]

Standard deviation = \(\sqrt{\frac{\sum x^{2}}{n}-\left(\overline{x}\right)^{2}}\)

\[= \sqrt{\frac{137882}{5}-165.6^{2}}\] \[= \sqrt{153.04}\] \[= 12.4\text{ cm (3 s.f.)}\]

**Equal matrices** have the same order and their corresponding elements are the same.

## 2 Addition and Subtraction of Matrices

We can only add or subtract matrices of the same order.

In general, given \(\mathbf{A}=\begin{pmatrix}a&b\\ c&d\end{pmatrix}\) and \(\mathbf{B}=\begin{pmatrix}e&f\\ g&h\end{pmatrix}\), then

\[\mathbf{A}+\mathbf{B}=\begin{pmatrix}a&b\\ c&d\end{pmatrix}+\begin{pmatrix}e&f\\ g&h\end{pmatrix}=\begin{pmatrix}a+e&b+f\\ c+g&d+h\end{pmatrix}\]

\[\mathbf{A}-\mathbf{B}=\begin{pmatrix}a&b\\ c&d\end{pmatrix}-\begin{pmatrix}e&f\\ g&h\end{pmatrix}=\begin{pmatrix}a-e&b-f\\ c-g&d-h\end{pmatrix}\]

Note:

\(\bullet\quad\mathbf{A}+\mathbf{B}=\mathbf{B}+\mathbf{A}\)

\[\text{e.g. }\begin{pmatrix}9\\ 10\end{pmatrix}+\begin{pmatrix}7\\ 8\end{pmatrix}=\begin{pmatrix}7\\ 8\end{pmatrix}+\begin{pmatrix}9\\ 10\end{pmatrix}=\begin{pmatrix}16\\ 18\end{pmatrix}\]

\(\bullet\quad\mathbf{A}+\mathbf{B}+\mathbf{C}=(\mathbf{A}+\mathbf{B})+\mathbf{C }=\mathbf{A}+(\mathbf{B}+\mathbf{C})\)

\[\text{e.g. }\mathbf{A}+\mathbf{B}+\mathbf{C}= \begin{pmatrix}1&2\end{pmatrix}+\begin{pmatrix}3&4\end{pmatrix}+ \begin{pmatrix}5&6\end{pmatrix}\] \[= \begin{pmatrix}1+3+5&2+4+6\end{pmatrix}\] \[= \begin{pmatrix}9&12\end{pmatrix}\]

\[\begin{array}{c}(\mathbf{A}+\mathbf{B})+\mathbf{C}= \begin{bmatrix}(1&2)+\begin{pmatrix}3&4\end{pmatrix}\end{bmatrix}+ \begin{pmatrix}5&6\end{pmatrix}\\ =\begin{pmatrix}4&6\end{pmatrix}+\begin{pmatrix}5&6\end{pmatrix}\\ =\begin{pmatrix}9&12\end{pmatrix}\\ \end{array}\]

\[\mathbf{A}+(\mathbf{B}+\mathbf{C})= \begin{pmatrix}1&2\end{pmatrix}+\begin{bmatrix}(3&4)+(5&6) \end{bmatrix}\] \[= \begin{pmatrix}1&2\end{pmatrix}+\begin{pmatrix}8&10\end{pmatrix}\] \[= \begin{pmatrix}9&12\end{pmatrix}\]Multiplication by a Scalar

If a matrix is multiplied by a scalar \(k\), every element in the matrix is multiplied by \(k\).

\[\text{If }\mathbf{A}=\begin{pmatrix}a&b\\ c&d\end{pmatrix}\text{, then }k\mathbf{A}=\begin{pmatrix}ka&kb\\ kc&kd\end{pmatrix}\text{.}\]

Multiplication by another Matrix

Multiplication of a matrix is only possible if the number of columns in the first/left matrix is equal to the number of rows in the second/right matrix.

\[\begin{array}{ccccc}\mathbf{A}&\times&\mathbf{B}&=&\mathbf{C}\\ m\times\overbrace{\tilde{m}_{r}}^{\text{}}&\times&\begin{array}{c}\tilde{m }_{r}\times&r\\ \end{array}&m\times r\\ \end{array}\]

We **multiply** the **rows of the first/left matrix with the columns in the second/right matrix.

Example

It is given that \(\mathbf{A}=\begin{pmatrix}5&6\\ 7&8\end{pmatrix}\), \(\mathbf{B}=\begin{pmatrix}9\\ 10\end{pmatrix}\), \(\mathbf{C}=\begin{pmatrix}1&2&3\\ 4&5&6\end{pmatrix}\), \(\mathbf{D}=\begin{pmatrix}-1&0\\ 3&11\end{pmatrix}\) and \(\mathbf{E}=\begin{pmatrix}7\end{pmatrix}\).

1. [label=()]
2. Find the following. 1. \(\mathbf{A}\mathbf{D}\), 2. \(\mathbf{D}\), 3. \(\mathbf{D}\), 4. \(\mathbf{D}\) \(=\begin{pmatrix}5&6\\ 7&8\end{pmatrix}\)\(\begin{pmatrix}-1&0\\ 3&11\end{pmatrix}\) \[=\begin{pmatrix}5(-1)+6(3)&5(0)+6(11)\\ 7(-1)+8(3)&7(0)+8(11)\end{pmatrix}\] \[=\begin{pmatrix}13&66\\ 17&88\end{pmatrix}\] \[\text{(ii)}\quad\mathbf{D}\mathbf{A} =\begin{pmatrix}-1&0\\ 3&11\end{pmatrix}\begin{pmatrix}5&6\\ 7&8\end{pmatrix}\] \[=\begin{pmatrix}-1(5)+0(7)&-1(6)+0(8)\\ 3(5)+11(7)&3(6)+11(8)\end{pmatrix}\] \[=\begin{pmatrix}-5&-6\\ 92&106\end{pmatrix}\] _Compare this answer with the answer to (a)(i). Notice that_ \(\mathbf{A}\mathbf{D}\mathbf{\neq}\mathbf{D}\mathbf{A}\) _so unlike multiplication of real numbers, multiplication by matrices is not commutative._

## 4 Application of Matrices

We can solve word problems with the use of matrices.

### Example

A factory makes two types of confectionary - Chocolate Dream and Strawberry Wonder. The number of packets of ingredients required to make a box of each is as follows:

* Chocolate Dream needs 3 packets of sugar, 3 packets of flour and 2 packets of yeast.
* Strawberry Wonder needs 2 packets of sugar, 4 packets of flour and 2 packets of yeast.

The cost of a packet of sugar, flour and yeast is $1.20, $8.25 and $3 respectively.

It is given that \(\mathbf{E}=\begin{pmatrix}3&3&2\\ 2&4&2\end{pmatrix}\) and \(\mathbf{F}=\begin{pmatrix}1.20\\ 8.25\\ 3\end{pmatrix}\).

1. Evaluate \(\mathbf{EF}\).
2. Explain what your answer in (a) represents.
3. Bala's Sweets orders 10 boxes of Chocolate Dream and 5 boxes of Strawberry Wonder every week. 1. Write down matrix \(\mathbf{D}\) such that its product with matrix \(\mathbf{EF}\), matrix \(\mathbf{DEF}\) will give the total cost of ingredients incurred by the factory to fulfil Bala's Sweet's weekly order. 2. Hence, find the total cost of ingredients to fulfil Bala's Sweet's weekly order.

Solution

1. \(\mathbf{EF}=\begin{pmatrix}3&3&2\\ 2&4&2\end{pmatrix}\begin{pmatrix}1.20\\ 8.25\\ 3\end{pmatrix}\) \[=\begin{pmatrix}3(1.2)+3(8.25)+2(3)\\ 2(1.2)+4(8.25)+2(3)\end{pmatrix}\] \[=\begin{pmatrix}34.35\\ 41.40\end{pmatrix}\]
2. The total cost of ingredients to make one box of Chocolate Dream and one box of Strawberry Wonder.
3. 1. 2. \(\mathbf{D}=\begin{pmatrix}10&5\end{pmatrix}\) \[\begin{split}\mathbf{DEF}=\begin{pmatrix}10&5\end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix}34.35\\ 41.40\end{pmatrix}\\ =&\begin{pmatrix}10(34.35)+5(41.40)\end{pmatrix}\\ =&\begin{pmatrix}550.50\end{pmatrix}\end{split}\therefore\text{ total cost of ingredients to fulfil Bala's Sweet's weekly order}=\$550.50.\end{split}\]

## Chapter 5 Vectors

### 1 Vectors in Two Dimensions

_Scalars and Vectors_

A vector has both magnitude and direction but a scalar only has magnitude.

For example, a car has a speed of 90 km/h but a velocity of 90 km/h northwest.

(Speed is a scalar but velocity is a vector. Speed is the magnitude of the velocity.)

Other examples:

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|} \hline
**Scalar** & **Vector** \\ \hline Distance & Displacement \\ \hline Mass & Weight \\ \hline Temperature & \\ \hline \end{tabular}

_Representation of Vectors_

* A vector is represented by a line segment. \(\circ\) The length of the line segment represents the magnitude of the vector. \(\circ\) The arrows on the line segment indicates the direction of the vector.
* The vector on the right is denoted by \(\overrightarrow{PQ}\) or \(\mathbf{a}\). (In your workings, instead of \(\mathbf{a}\) you can write \(\alpha\).)

\begin{tabular}{c c} \hline \(\mathbf{a}\) & \\ \hline \(\mathbf{a}\) & \\ \hline \(\mathbf{a}\) & \\ \hline \(\mathbf{a}\) & \\ \hline \end{tabular}

_Column Vectors_

Vectors on a Cartesian plane can be expressed as a column vector. Column vectors are written in the form \(\begin{pmatrix}x\\ y\end{pmatrix}\), where \(x\) is the horizontal component and \(y\) is the vertical component.

\begin{tabular}{c c} \hline \(\mathbf{a}\) & \\ \hline \(\mathbf{a}\) & \\ \hline \(\mathbf{a}\) & \\ \hline \(\mathbf{a}\) & \\ \hline \(\mathbf{a}\) & \\ \hline \(\mathbf{a}\) & \\ \hline \end{tabular}

\begin{tabular}{c c} \hline_Magnitude of Vectors_

Magnitude of \(\overline{PQ}=\text{length of }\overline{PQ}=\left|\overline{PQ}\right|=\left| \mathbf{a}\right|=\left|a\right|.\)

For the vector \(\overline{PQ}\) on page 1, \(\left|\overline{PQ}\right|=100\).

The magnitude of a column vector \(\overline{AB}=\mathbf{b}=\begin{pmatrix}x\\ y\end{pmatrix}\) is given by

\[\left|\overline{AB}\right|=\left|\mathbf{b}\right|=\sqrt{x^{2}+y^{2}}\.\]

_Equal Vectors_

Two vectors are equal if they have the same magnitude and same direction.

i.e. \(\overline{AB}=\overline{CD}\) so \(AB\) is parallel to \(CD\) and \(\left|\overline{AB}\right|=\left|\overline{CD}\right|.\)

_Negative Vectors_

Two vectors are negative vectors of each other is they have the same magnitude but opposite direction.

i.e. \(\overline{AB}=-\overline{BA}\) OR \(\overline{BA}=-\overline{AB}\)

\(\mathbf{a}=-\begin{pmatrix}-\mathbf{a}\end{pmatrix}\)

Regardless, \(\left|\overline{AB}\right|=\left|\overline{BA}\right|.\)

## 2 Addition and Subtraction of Vectors

_Vector Addition_

The principle of adding two vectors can be extended to more than two vectors.

Method 1: Triangle Law of Vector Addition

\[\begin{array}{c}\overline{AB}+\overline{BC}=\overline{AC}=\mathbf{a}+ \mathbf{b}\\ \overline{same\ point}\end{array}\]

\[\begin{array}{c}\overline{AC}\text{ is called the \ \ \vector sum or\ resultant vector,}\\ \text{indicated by a double arrow in the diagram.}\end{array}\]

Method 2: Parallelogram Law of Vector Addition

\[\begin{array}{c}\overline{AB}+\overline{AD}=\overline{AC}=\mathbf{a}+ \mathbf{b}\\ \overline{same\ point}\end{array}\]

Notice \(\mathbf{a}\) and \(\mathbf{b}\) are the sides of the parallelogram and \(\overline{AC}=\mathbf{a}+\mathbf{b}\) (the resultant vector) is the diagonal.

Method 3: Resultant by Column Vectors

For column vectors,

\[\begin{pmatrix}p\\ q\end{pmatrix}\begin{pmatrix}r\\ s\end{pmatrix}=\begin{pmatrix}p+r\\ q+s\end{pmatrix}\]

In general,

Vector addition is commutative: \(\mathbf{a}+\mathbf{b}=\mathbf{b}+\mathbf{a}\).

Vector addition is associative: \(\mathbf{a}+\mathbf{b}+\mathbf{c}=(\mathbf{a}+\mathbf{b})+\mathbf{c}=\mathbf{a }+(\mathbf{b}+\mathbf{c})\).

It is usually easier to use method 1 and 3 unless the parallelogram has been drawn.

_Vector Subtraction_

The principle of subtracting two vectors can be extended to more than two vectors.

Method 1: Addition of Negative Vectors

Method 2: Triangle Law of Subtraction

From addition, \(\overline{AC}+\overline{CB}=\overline{AB}\).

Therefore, \(\overline{AB}-\overline{AC}=\overline{CB}\).

Method 3: Resultant by Column Vectors/Coordinates

For column vectors,

\[\begin{pmatrix}p\\ q\end{pmatrix}-\begin{pmatrix}r\\ s\end{pmatrix}=\begin{pmatrix}p-r\\ q-s\end{pmatrix}\end{pmatrix}\]_Scalar Multiplication and Parallel Vectors_

When vector \(\mathbf{a}\) is multiplied by scalar \(k\), the resulting vector has magnitude \(k\) times of \(\mathbf{a}\), \(\left|k\mathbf{a}\right|=k\left|\mathbf{a}\right|.\)

* When \(k>0\), \(k\mathbf{a}\) is a vector with the same direction as \(\mathbf{a}\) and a magnitude that is \(k\) times of \(\mathbf{a}\).
* When \(k<0\), \(k\mathbf{a}\) is a vector with the opposite direction as \(\mathbf{a}\) and a magnitude that is \(k\) times of \(\mathbf{a}\).
* When \(k=0\), \(k\mathbf{a}\) is a zero vector.

In general, for any vector \(\mathbf{a}\) and \(\mathbf{b}\), and real numbers \(m\) and \(n\), then

* \(m\big{(}n\mathbf{a}\big{)}=n\big{(}m\mathbf{a}\big{)}=\big{(}mn\big{)}\mathbf{a}\)
* \(m\mathbf{a}+n\mathbf{a}=\mathbf{a}\big{(}m+n\big{)}\)
* \(m\mathbf{a}+m\mathbf{b}=m\big{(}\mathbf{a}+\mathbf{b}\big{)}\)

_Parallel Vectors_

* If \(\mathbf{a}=k\mathbf{b}\), where \(k\) is a scalar and \(k\neq 0\), then \(\mathbf{a}\) is parallel to \(\mathbf{b}\) and \(\left|\mathbf{a}\right|=k\left|\mathbf{b}\right|.\)
* If \(\mathbf{a}\) is parallel to \(\mathbf{b}\), then \(\mathbf{a}=k\mathbf{b}\)  where \(k\) is a scalar and \(k\neq 0\).
* If \(m\mathbf{a}+n\mathbf{b}=p\mathbf{a}+q\mathbf{b}\), where \(m,n,p\) and \(q\) are scalars and \(\mathbf{a}\) is not parallel to \(\mathbf{b}\), then \(m=p\) and \(n=q\).

_Collinear Points_

If points A, B and C lie in a straight line (i.e. they are collinear), then \(\overrightarrow{AB}=k\overrightarrow{BC}\).

## 4 Position Vectors

The **position vector** of any point is the vector from the origin to that point.

For example, \(\overrightarrow{OP}\) is the position vector of \(P\) relative to \(O\).

If point \(P\) has coordinates \(\left(a,b\right)\), then the position vector of \(P\),

\(\overrightarrow{OP}\) is written as \(\overrightarrow{OP}=\begin{pmatrix}a\\ b\end{pmatrix}\).

For any two points \(P\) and \(Q\), \(\overrightarrow{PQ}\) is the position vector of \(Q\) relative to \(P\).

\(\overrightarrow{PQ}=\overrightarrow{PO}+\overrightarrow{QQ}=\overrightarrow {QQ}-\overrightarrow{OP}\)

\(\overrightarrow{PQ}\) is also known as a **translation vector** because the vector can be regarded as a movement from \(P\) to \(Q\).
