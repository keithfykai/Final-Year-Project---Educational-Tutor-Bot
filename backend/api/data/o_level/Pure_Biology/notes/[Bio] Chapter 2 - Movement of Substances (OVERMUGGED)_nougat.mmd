Diffusion is the **net movement of molecules** from a **region of higher concentration** to a region of **lower concentration**, down a concentration gradient.

It is a passive process as energy is not required

When the molecules have reached **equilibrium** between the two regions, the concentrations are the same and there will be **no net movement** of molecules.

* Osmosis is the net movement of water molecules from a region of higher water potential to a region of lower water, through a partially permeable membrane
* Water potential refers to the tendency of water to move from one area to another
* Plasma membrane or visking tubing are examples of partially permeable membranes that only allow allow some substances such as water, gases like oxygen and carbon dioxide to pass through freely but not some other substancesExamples:

* The 20% solution is more concentrated than the 10% solution. Hence, 10% solution has a higher water potential than 20% solution. The partially permeable membrane does not allow solute molecules to pass through as it is too big.
* As a result, water molecules will move from the arm with the 10% solution which has a higher water potential to the arm with the 20% solution which has a lower water potential, passing through semi permeable membrane via osmosis.

When an animal cells is immersed in a solution with a higher water potential relative to its cytoplasm,

Water moves into the cell by osmosis.

Animal cells do not have cell walls to protect the cells from overexpansion.

As more water enters the cell, it swells to such an extent that it bursts.

The cell is lysed / CYTOLYSIS

When an animal cell is immersed in a solution with a lower water potential, relative to its cytoplasm,

Water moves out of the cell by osmosis.

The cell shrinks and become dehydrated. In red blood cells, little spikes appear on the cell surface membrane.

The cell is created/ CRENATION

(c) Define active transport and discuss its importance as an energy-consuming process by which substances are transported against a concentration gradient, as in ion uptake by root hairs and uptake of glucose by cells in the villi
