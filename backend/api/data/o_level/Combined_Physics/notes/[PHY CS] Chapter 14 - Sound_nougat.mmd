When vibrating object alternately pulls or pushes on the layers of air adjacent to it, it causes small but rapid changes in air pressure.

**Compressions** are regions where particles are pushed closer together, resulting in higher pressure.

**Rarefactions** are regions where particles are pulled further apart, resulting in lower pressure.
