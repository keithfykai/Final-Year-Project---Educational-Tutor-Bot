## 1 Introduction

Hydroxy compounds are organic compounds containing the functional group -OH.

There are two types of hydroxy compounds:

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|} \hline
**Alcohols** & \multicolumn{2}{c|}{**Phenols**} \\ \hline -OH group bonded to a saturated C (sp\({}^{2}\) hybridised) of an alkyl group & -OH group bonded directly to a C (sp\({}^{2}\) hybridised) in the benzene ring \\ \hline Examples: & Examples: \\ CH\({}_{3}\)CH\({}_{2}\)OH ethanol & \multicolumn{2}{c|}{OH phenol} \\ \hline CH\({}_{2}\)OH phenylmethanol & H\({}_{3}\)C & OH 4-methylphenol \\ OH & cyclohexanol & NO\({}_{2}\) & 2,4,6-trinitrophenol \\ O\({}_{2}\)N OH & OH & \\ \hline \end{tabular}

## 2 Nomenclature and Structure

* Alcohols are named with the suffix, -_ql_, added to the corresponding alkane.
* A number is used to indicate the position of the -OH group if there is more than one possible position on the parent chain.
*The benzene ring is named as a 'phenyl' group when it is considered as a substituent.

* Compounds that have a hydroxyl group directly attached to a benzene ring are called phenols. The carbon bearing the \(-\)OH group is numbered 1, other substituents are numbered relative to it.

* In cases where there are higher priority substituent groups such as the carboxyl group, the \(-\)OH group is named as _hydroxy_ in the prefix.

* Alcohols are classified according to the number of carbon atoms attached to the carbon bonded to the \(-\)OH group. They can be primary, secondary or tertiary.

* Note: the groups R, R' and R" may or may not be the same.

## 3 PHYSICAL PROPERTIES OF ALCOHOLS AND PHENOLS (SDL)

_Study this part of the topic on your own by recalling and applying Chemical Bonding concepts here._

### Boiling points

1. Alcohols have considerably higher boiling points than the alkanes of comparable molecular masses. Example **Compound** _M._ **Boiling point / \({}^{\circ}\)C** CH\({}_{3}\)CH\({}_{2}\)OH** 46.0 78.5 **CH\({}_{3}\)CH\({}_{2}\)CH\({}_{3}\)** 44.0 -42.1

Chemical bonding concept: relative strength of hydrogen bonding vs id-id **More energy** is required to overcome the **stronger hydrogen bonding between CH\({}_{3}\)CH\({}_{2}\)OH molecules** as compared to the **weaker instantaneous dipole-induced dipole attractions between CH\({}_{3}\)CH\({}_{2}\)CH\({}_{3}\) molecules**.

2. Boiling point of alcohols increases with increasing length of alkyl chain. Example **Compound** CH\({}_{3}\)OH CH\({}_{3}\)CH\({}_{2}\)OH CH\({}_{3}\)CH\({}_{2}\)OH

**Boiling point / \({}^{\circ}\)C** 65 78 97

Chemical bonding concept: Factors affecting strength of id-id: no of e- As the length of the alkyl chain increases, the **number of electrons / electron cloud size increases**, which results in a **greater ease of distortion of the electron cloud**. More energy is required to overcome the **stronger instantaneous dipole-induced dipole attractions between the alcohol molecules**.

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:5]

### Solubility

1. The lower alcohols (methanol, ethanol, and propanol) are completely miscible with water. The energy released during the formation of hydrogen bonding between alcohol molecules and water molecules is able to compensate for the energy taken in to break the hydrogen bonding between alcohol molecules and the hydrogen bonding between water molecules. Example 1. Hydrogen bonding between ethanol and water 2. The **solubility of alcohols in water decreases as the number of carbon atoms in the molecule increases**. Alcohols with more than 4 carbons are partially or immiscible with water _(you may well end up with two layers in your test tube)_. As the length of the non-polar alkyl chain increases, **id-id attractions between the alcohol molecules become more significant**. 2. The energy evolved during the formation of hydrogen bonding between the water molecules and the alcohol molecules is not enough to compensate for the energy required to break the hydrogen bonding and the stronger **id-id attractions between alcohol molecules and the hydrogen bonding between water molecules**. 3. Alcohols are completely miscible with organic solvents. 4. Phenols are not very soluble in water. This is due to the non-polar benzene ring that causes the **id-id attraction between phenol molecules to become significant**. Hence, the energy evolved during the formation of hydrogen bonding between the water molecules and the phenol molecules is not enough to compensate for the energy required break the hydrogen bonding and the more extensive **id-id attractions between phenol molecules and the hydrogen bonding between water molecules**. 4. Phenols are not very soluble in water**. 5. This is due to the non-polar benzene ring that causes the **id-id attraction between phenol molecules to become significant**. Hence, the energy evolved during the formation of hydrogen bonding between the water molecules and the phenol molecules is not enough to compensate for the energy required break the hydrogen bonding and the more extensive **id-id attractions between phenol molecules and the hydrogen bonding between water molecules**.

## 4 Preparation of alcohols

How are alcohols synthesised?

Alcohols can be obtained from four main groups of organic compounds, namely, alkenes, halogenoalkanes, carbonyl compounds and carboxylic acids.

### Electrophilic addition from alkenes (Refer to Alkene Lecture Notes for more details)

\begin{tabular}{|p{142.3pt}|p{142.3pt}|} \hline
**Type of reaction** & Electrophilic addition \\ \hline Industrial method \\ \hline \hline Reagents & steam, with concentrated phosphoric acid, H\({}_{3}\)PO\({}_{4}\), as catalyst \\ \hline Conditions & heat under reflux at high pressure \\ \hline Laboratory method \\ \hline \hline Stage 1 & Reagents and conditions & concentrated H\({}_{2}\)SO\({}_{4}\), cold \\ \hline Stage 2 & Reagents and conditions & water, warm \\ \hline \end{tabular}

Nucleophilic substitution from halogenoalkane (Refer to Halogenoalkane Lecture Notes for more details)

**Type of reaction** & Nucleophilic substitution \\ \hline Reagents \& conditions & NaOH (aq) or KOH (aq), heat under reflux \\ \hline Example & CH\({}_{3}\)CH\({}_{2}\)Br + NaOH & CH\({}_{3}\)CH\({}_{2}\)OH + NaBr \\ \hline \end{tabular}

### Summary of reducing agents

Both NaBH4 and LiAI4 only affect polar bonds (i.e. C=O), hence they cannot reduce both C=C and C=C.

NaBH4 is usually used to reduce aldehydes and ketones, due to its safety and ease of handling. NaBH4 does not reduce RCOOH and its derivatives.

LiAI4 is a **stronger reducing agent** than NaBH4. LiAI4 can reduce all carbonyl groups including acids, esters, ketones and aldehydes rapidly.

H2/Pt cannot reduce RCOOH to RCH2OH. Hence it can be used to selectively reduce C=C in compounds with both alkene and carboxylic acid functional groups present.

In summary, functional groups that the various reducing agents can reduce are:

\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|c|} \hline
**Reducing Agent** & & & **H2, Ni, heat /** \\  & **LiAI4 in dry ether** & & & **H2, PU/Pd, r.t.p.** \\ \hline Alkene & x & x & ✓ \\ \hline Aldehyde & ✓ & ✓ & ✓ \\ \hline Ketone & ✓ & ✓ & ✓ \\ \hline Carboxylic acid & ✓ & x & x \\ \hline Ester & ✓ & x & x \\ \hline Nitrile & ✓ & x & ✓ \\ \hline \end{tabular}

Exercise 1

Suggest the structure of the product formed.

\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|} \hline
**LiAI4 in dry ether** & & & \\ \hline \(\text{NaBH}_{4}\) in methanol & & & \\ \hline \(\text{H}_{2}\) (g) & \(\text{Pt}\) & & \\ \hline \end{tabular}

## 5 Chemical properties and reactions of alcohols

Which classes of reagents do alcohols react with and why?

What types of reactions do alcohols undergo and why?

Alcohols are polar molecules with two polar bonds (the C-O bond and the O-H bond) due to the presence of the electronegative O atom.

Hence, reactions of alcohols involve the breaking of the C-O bond and O-H bond. In addition, alcohols undergo combustion and oxidation reactions.

### Combustion

Alcohols burn in excess oxygen to give carbon dioxide and water.

E.g. Complete combustion of ethanol

CH\({}_{3}\)CH\({}_{2}\)OH + 3O\({}_{2}\) 2CO\({}_{2}\) + 3H\({}_{2}\)O

### Breaking of the O-H bond

#### 5.2.1 Reaction with sodium metal

Alcohols react rapidly with sodium metal to form alkoxides.

ROH + Na \(\rightarrow\) RO\({}^{\ast}\)Na\({}^{\ast}\) + \(\%\) H\({}_{2}\)

**Type of reaction**

**Reagents & conditions**

**Example**

CH\({}_{3}\)CH\({}_{2}\)O-H + Na \(\rightarrow\) CH\({}_{3}\)CH\({}_{2}\)O-Na\({}^{\ast}\) + \(\%\) H\({}_{2}\)

**Observations**

**Effervescence (of H\({}_{2}\)) is observed.**

**Note:**

**This reaction can be used to generate the alkoxide, which is a stronger nucleophile for subsequent reactions.**

### Oxidation

KMnO\({}_{4}\) and K\({}_{2}\)Cr\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{7}\) are common oxidising agents that are used to oxidise alcohols. K\({}_{2}\)Cr\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{7}\) is a weaker oxidising agent than KMnO\({}_{4}\). The products obtained and observations made will depend on the type of alcohol and the oxidising agent used.

Oxidation of an alcohol involves cleavage of the \(\alpha\) C-H bond. Hence, tertiary alcohols cannot undergo oxidation.

#### Oxidation of primary alcohols

(i) Using K\({}_{2}\)Cr\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{7}\)

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|} \hline
**Reagents \& conditions** & **Oxidation product** & **Observations** \\ \hline K\({}_{2}\)Cr\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{7}\), in dilute H\({}_{2}\)SO\({}_{4}\) & R-C-H & aldehyde & Orange K\({}_{2}\)Cr\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{7}\) solution turns green \\
**warm and distill** & & Note: \\ \hline \end{tabular}

The aldehyde formed can be isolated by distilling it from the hot reaction mixture once it is formed, to prevent further oxidation to carboxylic acid. (Refer to Fig 5.1)

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|} \hline
**Example** & & \\ Upon further oxidation, & & \\ CH\({}_{3}\)-C-H + [O] & K\({}_{2}\)Cr\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{7}\), dil. H\({}_{2}\)SO\({}_{4}\) & \\ \hline \end{tabular}

Note: Unlike K\({}_{2}\)Cr\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{7}\), warming and distilling primary alcohols with KMnO\({}_{4}\) will NOT form aldehydes as the alcohol will be oxidised directly to a carboxylic acid.

#### 5.4.3 Tertiary alcohols

Do not undergo oxidation.

Since oxidation of different classes of alcohols gives different products, it can be used to distinguish between primary, secondary and tertiary alcohols.

#### 5.4.4 Tri-iodomethane / lododform reaction

Only alcohols with the following structure can undergo this reaction.

Such alcohols are first oxidised by alkaline aqueous iodine into the carbonyl compound,, which undergoes further substitution and bond cleavage to produce a CH3--R

salt of a carboxylic acid and **tri-iodomethane, CH3,** which is a **yellow precipitate**. Due to the distinct formation of the yellow precipitate, CH3, this reaction is a useful chemical test for identifying alcohols with the above structure.

Tri-iodomethane reaction is a **step-down** reaction since the **carbon chain length of the organic compound is decreased by 1**.

## 6 PHENOLS

### Structure of phenol

Phenol has the following structure, where the -OH group is bonded directly to the benzene ring.

OH

_Recall from Arenes: Benzene ring has a delocalised cloud of \(\pi\) electrons due to the overlapping of \(p\)-orbitals of the carbon atoms._

In phenol, the lone pair of electrons on oxygen is delocalised into the benzene ring as the p-orbital of the oxygen overlaps with the \(\pi\) electron cloud of the benzene ring, forming a cloud of delocalised \(\pi\) electron. This introduces some partial double bond character in the C-O bond.

As a result, the C-O bond is strengthened while the O-H bond is weakened. This makes phenol slightly acidic.

### 6.2 Acidity of phenol, water and ethanol

Order of acid strength: phenol > water > ethanol \(K_{\text{s}}\) / mol dm\({}^{-3}\) : 1 x 10\({}^{-10}\) > 1.8 x 10\({}^{-16}\) > 1 x 10\({}^{-16}\)

_Recall:_\(K_{\text{s}}\) _is the acid dissociation constant for a weak acid. The value of_\(K_{\text{s}}\) _is a quantitative measure of the strength of a weak acid. The larger the value of_\(K_{\text{s}}\)_, the stronger is the acid._

Alcohols and phenols are Bransted-Lowry acids (proton donors) in the presence of a suitable base.

Water itself reacts similarly but to a very small extent:

H-OH + H\({}_{2}\)O > H-O\({}^{-}\) + H\({}_{3}\)O\({}^{+}\)

Since at any one time, only a small number of water molecules donate H\({}^{+}\) ions to other water molecules, water behaves as a **weak acid**.

A similar reaction occurs with ethanol, but to a lesser extent. The position of equilibrium lies further to the left, and **ethanol is a weaker acid than water**.

With phenol, the position of equilibrium lies further to the right than in water: **phenol is slightly more acidic than water**.

_THE BIG IDEA_

It is the **STABILITY** of the **anion (conjugate base) formed from the acid** which determines how strong the acid is, i.e. where the position of equilibrium lies.

The more stable the anion, the stronger the acid.

#### 6.2.1 Acidity of ethanol

**Ethanol is a weaker acid than water**. It loses a proton in water to form the ethoxide ion, CH\({}_{3}\)CH\({}_{2}\)O\({}^{-}\).

CH\({}_{3}\)CH\({}_{2}\)O\({}^{-}\) + H\({}_{3}\)O\({}^{+}\)

The **ethyl** group is **electron-donating**. This **intensities** the **negative charge** on the anion, thus, **destablising** the ethoxide ion. Hence, the dissociation of ethanol to release H\({}^{+}\) is less favoured.

Therefore, alcohols in general do **NOT** react with hydroxides and carbonates.

#### 6.2.2 Acidity of phenol

**Phenol is a stronger acid than water and alcohols**. It loses a proton in water to form the phenoxide ion.

The **lone pair of electrons** on **oxygen** in the phenoxide anion is **delocalised into the \(\pi\) electron cloud** of the benzene ring, thus, **dispersing** the **negative charge**.

Since the phenoxide ion is **resonance-stabilised**, the dissociation of phenol to release H+ is favoured.

[0.5cm] Note: (F.Y.I.)

Resonance stabilisation in phenol:

However, phenols are only slightly acidic (less acidic as compared to carboxylic acids).

While it can react with hydroxides, it is **NOT** acidic enough to react with carbonates or hydrogencarbonates _(which are weak bases)_ and also has no effect on litmus paper.

#### 7.1.3 Reaction with acid chlorides

Unlike alcohols, phenols are not nucleophilic enough to undergo esterification by heating with a carboxylic acid and a trace amount of concentrated H\({}_{2}\)SO\({}_{4}\). This is as a result of the delocalisation of the lone pair of electrons on the oxygen into the benzene ring.

Hence, phenols react with acid chlorides to form esters instead.

\begin{tabular}{|p{113.8pt}|p{113.8pt}|} \hline
**Type of reaction** & Nucleophilic (acyl) substitution / Condensation \\ \hline
**Reagents \&** & Stage 1: phenol and NaOH \\
**conditions** & Stage 2: sodium phenoxide formed in stage 1 and acid chloride \\ \hline \end{tabular}

\begin{tabular}{|p{113.8pt}|p{113.8pt}|} \hline
**Example** & Stage 1: \\
**Overall equation:** & \\
**CH\({}_{3}\)–C–\(CI\)** & \(H\)–O– \\
**CH\({}_{3}\)–C–\(O\)** & \(+\) \\
**HCl/** \\
**ethanoyl chloride** & phenylethanolamineate \\ \hline \end{tabular}

_Note: NaOH(aq) is added to phenol to form the phenoxide ion, which is a stronger nucleophilic than phenol, before adding the acid chloride to the mixture. This will result in higher yield of the ester._

#### 7.2.2 Bromination

Similar to nitration, a Lewis acid (A/Br\({}_{3}\) or FeBr\({}_{3}\)) is **not required** to generate the strong electrophile Br\({}^{+}\) unlike reaction with benzene.

**(a) Mono-substitution**

Phenol reacts with bromine liquid in \(\underline{\textbf{CC}I_{4}}\) to give a mixture of mono-substituted products.

**Type of reaction**
