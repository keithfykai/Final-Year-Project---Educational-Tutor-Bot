## Appendix A Work

In Physics, work is done by a **force** on a body when the force causes a displacement of the body in the direction of the force.

Work done by a constraint force

Syl unit: Joules [J]

Scalar

Work done by a force on a body is the product of the force and the displacement in the direction of the force.

where \(F=\) force exerted on the object

\(s=\) displacement

\(\theta=\) angle between vectors \(\vec{F}\) and \(\vec{s}\)

## Appendix

## Appendix 1 Work done by expanding gas

* Consider a gas enclosed in a chamber of cross-sectional area \(A\) and fitted with a light frictionless piston.
* If the gas expands at constant pressure \(p\), such that the volume changes by an amount \(\Delta V\), the force exerted by the gas on the piston, \(F_{gp}\), is \(F_{gp}=pA\)
* And the displacement of the piston \(\Delta x\), is given by \[\Delta x=\frac{\Delta V}{A}\] The work done by the gas on the piston, \(W_{gp}\) is \[W_{gp} =F_{gp}x\] \[=(pA)\left(\frac{\Delta V}{A}\right)\] \[W_{gp} =p\Delta V\]

## Appendix A Work done and Energy change

When work is done, energy is converted from one form to another as a result.

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|} \hline \(\pm W\), positive work done & \(-W\), negative work done \\ \hline \end{tabular}

* Force is exerted on a body in the direction of its motion.
* **Positive work** is done on the body.
* **Body gains energy.** & Force is exerted on the body opposite to the direction of its motion (e.g., friction)
* **Negative work** is done on the body.
* **Body loses energy.** \\ \hline \end{tabular}

* When body A does 100 J of work on body B, A loses 100J of energy and B gains 100 J of energy.
* When body A does -100 J of work on body B, B loses 100J of energy and A gains 100 J of energy.

## Appendix A Energy

* Energy is the capacity to do work. It exists around us in many different forms. Some of the common forms are shown below.

Since net force \(F\) is constant and hence acceleration \(a\) is constant, we can use the equation of linear motion

\[v^{2}=u^{2}+2as\]

\[\Rightarrow as=\frac{1}{2}v^{2}-\frac{1}{2}u^{2}\]

Thus, we can relate the \(\Delta E_{k}\) to the initial \(u\) and final velocity \(v\)

\[\Delta E_{k} =m\left(\frac{1}{2}v^{2}-\frac{1}{2}u^{2}\right)\] \[\Rightarrow E_{k}=\frac{1}{2}mv^{2}\]

## Appendix A Potential Energy

* is the energy possessed by an object which gives it the ability to do work as a result of its position, shape, or configuration

### Types

1. **Gravitational PE** * Is the energy of an object due to its mass and position in a gravitational field.
2. **Electric PE** * Is the energy of an object due to its charge in an electric field.
3. **Elastic PE** * Is the energy stored in an elastic object that is deformed under tension of compression.

## Appendix 1 Elastic Potential Energy

* In a spring, both compression and extension of the spring are able to store elastic potential energy

\[e.\,E_{p}=\frac{1}{2}kx^{2}\]

where \(k=\) spring constant [N/m]

\(x=\) extension [m]

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:20]

Hence, even though energy can be transferred in and out by being converted from one form to another, the amount of energy in the system can be easily accounted for:

A valid system may be

* a single body / particle
* a collection of bodies / particles
* a region of space (such as the interior of a combustion cylinder)
* varying with time in size and shape (such as a ball which deforms upon striking a surface)

Identifying the system allows us to be focused on the energy possessed by the system, conversion of energy in it and transference of energy in and out of it.

## Chapter Difference between Isolated and Closed System

Consider a simple system which only has kinetic energy \(E\).and potential energy \(E\).

If the system does not exchange energy or matter with its surroundings, it is an _isolated system_.

The total energy possessed by the system remains unchanged if **no**_external work is done_ on the system.

Within the system, an increase in kinetic energy must result in an equal decrease in potential energy, and vice versa. We say that _the total energy of an isolated system is conserved_.

If the system can exchange energy _but not matter_ with its surroundings, it is a _closed system_. Energy can be transferred via work done on the system; thus the total energy of a closed system need **not be conserved**.

## Appendix A Conservation of Energy

After identifying the system to be considered, the initial and final state of the system to be analyzed must then be decided.

Thereafter, the Law of Conservation of Energy can be applied as follows:

\begin{tabular}{|c c c c|} \hline Total initial energy & + & \begin{tabular}{c} Net work done on the system \\ (positive or negative) \\ \end{tabular} & = & 
\begin{tabular}{c} Total final energy \\ (of the system) \\ \end{tabular} \\ \hline \end{tabular}

In an isolated system:

\begin{tabular}{|c|} \hline \(\left(E_{p}+E_{k}\right)_{initial}\) \\ \(=\left(E_{p}+E_{k}\right)_{final}\) \\ \hline \end{tabular}

## Chapter Conservation of Energy Problem Solving Tips

* Determine what constitutes the system (which bodies are part of the system?)
* Determine the initial and final of the system
* Form an equation to relate the initial and the final total energy (\(E_{p}+E_{k}\)) of the systemFigure 1: The energy equation for each of the following cases.

Figure 1: The energy equation for each of the following cases.

**Solution (a):**

Using conservation of energy (no external force). Initial state is at point \(A\). Final state is at point \(B\).

\[\begin{array}{c}E_{p,A}+E_{k,A}=E_{p,B}+E_{k,B}\\ mg(4R)+\frac{1}{2}m(0)^{2}=mg(0)+\frac{1}{2}m(v_{B})^{2}\Rightarrow 8gR=v_{B}^{2}\\ v_{B}=2\sqrt{2gR}\end{array}\]

**Solution (b):**

Initial state is at point \(A\). Final state is at point \(C\).

\[\begin{array}{c}E_{p,A}+E_{k,A}=E_{p,C}+E_{k,C}\\ mg(4R)+\frac{1}{2}m(0)^{2}=mg(R)+\frac{1}{2}m(v_{C})^{2}\Rightarrow 3mgR=\frac{1}{ 2}mv_{C}^{2}\\ 6gR=v_{B}^{2}\\ v_{C}=\sqrt{6gR}\end{array}\]

**Solution (c):**

At point \(C\), the centripetal force \(\left(\frac{mv_{C}^{2}}{R}\right)\) is equal to the normal force or the force of the track on the box

\[\begin{array}{c}F_{track\;on\;box}=N=\frac{mv_{C}^{2}}{R}\\ F_{track\;on\;box}=\frac{m\big{(}\sqrt{6gR}\big{)}^{2}}{R}\\ F_{track\;on\;box}=6mg\end{array}\]

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:39]

**Solution (a):**

In order to maintain the car at constant speed, the driving force provided by the engine

\[F_{engine}=total\ resistive\ force=650N\]

Hence,

\[P_{engine}=F_{engine}v=(650)(30)\]

\[P_{engine}=19.5kW!\]

**Solution (b):**

When the car goes up the slope,

Additional power needed = rate of increase of _gravitational_ PE

\[=\frac{d(mgh)}{dt}=mg\frac{dh}{dt}=mgv_{y}=mg\ v\sin\theta\]

\[=1800(9.81)(30)\sin 7.5\]

\[=69.1\ kW\]
