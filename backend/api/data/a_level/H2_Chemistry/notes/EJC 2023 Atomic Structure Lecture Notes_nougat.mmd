### 1 The Atom and the Subatomic Particles

#### Subatomic Particles

Learning Outcome:

Identify and describe protons, neutrons and electrons in terms of their relative charges and relative masses

Describe the distribution of mass and charges within an atom

An **atom** is the smallest particle found in an element that can take part in a chemical reaction. Particles that are smaller than the atom are called **subatomic particles**. The three main **subatomic particles** that form an atom are **protons**, **neutrons**, and **electrons**. Protons and neutrons are collectively known as **nucleons**. The centre of the atom is called the **nucleus**.

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|} \hline
**Particles** & **Symbol** & \begin{tabular}{c} **Position** \\ **in atom** \\ \end{tabular} & \begin{tabular}{c} **Relative** \\ **Charge** \\ \end{tabular} & \begin{tabular}{c} **Mass / amu\({}^{\star}\)** \\ \end{tabular} & 
\begin{tabular}{c} **Actual mass / kg** \\ \end{tabular} \\ \hline Protons & p & Nucleus & +1 & 1 & 1.67 \(\times\) 10\({}^{-27}\) \\ \hline Neutrons & n & Nucleus & 0 & 1 & 1.67 \(\times\) 10\({}^{-27}\) \\ \hline Electrons & e & Orbitals & \(-1\) & \(\frac{1}{1836}\) & 9.11 \(\times\) 10\({}^{-31}\) \\ \hline \end{tabular}

#### Atomic mass units, or amu. It is defined as \(\frac{1}{12}\) the mass of one atom of carbon-12.

Almost the whole mass of the atom is concentrated in the nucleus, which takes up an extremely small space relative to the size of the whole atom. The size of an atom is easily more than 10,000 times that of the nucleus.

#### Nuclides and Isotopes

Learning Outcome:

Deduce the numbers of protons, neutrons and electrons present in both atoms and ions given protons and nucleon numbers (and charge)

Describe the contribution of protons and neutrons to atomic nuclei in terms of proton number and nucleon number

Distinguish between isotopes on the basis of different numbers of neutrons present

A nuclide is an atomic species whose proton and nucleon number are specified. It is usually represented in the manner below, using fluorine, F as an example:

\begin{tabular}{|c|} **Nucleon number (A) or Mass number** \\ \end{tabular} \\ \begin{tabular}{|c|} **Nucleon number is the total** number of \\ protons and neutrons in the nucleus of an \\ atom. \\ \end{tabular} \\ \begin{tabular}{|c|} **Proton number (Z) or Atomic number** \\ \end{tabular} \\ 
\begin{tabular}{|c|} **Proton number is the number of protons in \\ the nucleus of an atom. \\ \end{tabular} \\ \hline \end{tabular}

The mass number (**A**) and atomic number (**Z**) give us information about the number of subatomic particles in the species.

In a **neutral atom**, no. of protons = **Z**

no. of neutrons = **A - Z**

no. of electrons = **Z**

In an **ion**, no. of protons = **Z**

no. of neutrons = **A - Z**

no. of electrons = **Z**

no. of electrons in an **anion**

= **Z + |charge number|

no. of electrons in a **cation**

= **Z - |charge number|

For example,

Number of protons **Number of neutrons**

Number of electrons
\({}^{79}\)Br

\({}^{56}\)Fe\({}^{3*}\)

\({}^{32}\)S\({}^{2}\)

\({}^{16}\)S\({}^{2}\)

### 1.3 Behaviour of Subatomic Particles in an Electric Field

Learning Outcome:

(b) Deduce the behaviour of beams of protons, neutrons and electrons in an electric field

Protons, electrons and neutrons behave differently in an electric field due to differences in their charges and relative masses.

When beams of the three types of subatomic particles with the **same speed** are all travelling through an electric field of constant strength, each beam differs in their path travelled based on:

* **Direction** of deflection

* **Angle** of deflection

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|} \hline
**Subatomic particles** & **Direction of deflection** & **Angle of deflection** \\ \hline Proton, p & **curve** path towards the **negative** plate & \(\beta\) \\ (positively charged) & **curve** path towards the **positive** plate & \(\alpha\) \\ \hline Electron, e & **curve** path towards the **positive** plate & \(\alpha\) \\ (negatively charged) & **undeflected** & **zero** \\ \hline \end{tabular}

Deflection of a beam of charged particles **only starts when the beam enters the electric field**. Since an attractive force continuously acts on the charged particles in the beam, the beam travels in a **curve path** as it undergoes acceleration.

Once **out of the electric field**, no attractive force acts on the charged particles in the beam. Hence, the beam continues its path in a **straight line**.

Although electrons and protons have the same magnitude of charge, **electrons are lighter**, and are hence **deflected to a greater extent** (i.e. \(\alpha>\beta\)).

In general,

* **Direction** of deflection is dependent on charge of a particle
* **Angle** of deflection is dependent on the charge to mass ratio of a particle

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|} \hline angle of deflection \(\propto\)\(\beta\) & \(\mu\) \\ \hline \end{tabular}

where q is the charge of the particle, m is the mass of the particle

Hence, particles with **smaller mass** and/or **higher charge** will be **deflected more** in the electric field.

## Atomic Structure

A Levels/2021/P1/Q1

In two separate experiments a beam of protons and a beam of electrons, travelling at the same velocity, pass through an electric field as shown.

Which statements are correct?

1 The electrons are deflected to a larger extent than the protons.

2 The electron beam is deflected in the opposite direction to the proton beam.

Atomic Structure

Self Check 4A

Beams of charged particles are deflected by an electric field.

In an experiment, protons are deflected by an angle of +15\({}^{\mathrm{o}}\). In another experiment, under identical conditions, particle **X** is deflected by an angle of -5\({}^{\mathrm{o}}\).

What could be the composition of particle **X**?

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|} \hline  & protons & neutrons & electrons \\ \hline
**A** & 1 & 2 & 2 \\
**B** & 2 & 3 & 3 \\
**C** & 3 & 3 & 4 \\
**D** & 4 & 5 & 1 \\ \hline \end{tabular}

The Arrangement of Electrons

Electrons are not randomly distributed within an atom. Rather, they occupy specific volume regions, which have specific energies associated with them.

### Atomic Orbitals

Learning Outcome:

(g) Describe the shapes of s, p and d orbitals. [knowledge of wave functions is not required]

Knowing that electrons move around the nucleus, if we plot the position of a particular electron in a hydrogen atom every ten seconds over a period of time, we will see that the electron can be found anywhere within a spherical space around the nucleus, as shown in the diagram below.

The circle in the diagram demarcates the region of space in which you will be able to find the electron **95% of the time**. This region of **three dimensional space** is called an **orbital**.

In other words, an **orbital** is a region of space in which there is a high probability (95%) of finding an electron. Each orbital contains a maximum of 2 electrons. The energy of an orbital is the energy of the electrons occupying it.

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:9]

### Relationship between Principal Quantum Shells, Subshells and Orbitals

Learning Outcome:

(f) Describe the number and relative energies of the s, p and d orbitals for the principal quantum numbers 1, 2 and 3 and also the 4s and 4p orbitals.

Electrons are arranged in the following manner:

Principal Quantum Shells (Electronic Shells)

Each shell consists of a certain number of orbitals, subshells, depending on the **principal quantum number**, \(n\), where \(n\) = 1, 2, 3,... (numbered outwards from the nucleus).

**n** **Type of subshell(s)**

1 s subshell

2 s subshell, p subshell

3 s subshell, p subshell,

d subshell

4 s subshell, p subshell,

d subshell, f subshell

The **higher** the value of \(n\), the _further_ the electron is from the nucleus;

the **higher** the energy level of the electron;

the **less strongly** the electron is attracted to the nucleus;

the **larger and more diffused** (i.e. electron density spread over larger volume) the orbitals in the shell.

Putting everything together,

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|} \hline
**Principal quantum number, n** & Type of **subshell(s)** & Number of **orbital(s)** & Max number of electrons & 
\begin{tabular}{c} in each **quantum shell** \\ (max no. of electrons = **2/n**) \\ \end{tabular} \\ \hline
1 & s & 1 & 2 & 2 \\ \hline
2 & s & 1 & 2 & 8 \\ \hline
3 & p & 3 & 6 & 18 \\ \hline  & d & 5 & 10 & \\ \hline  & s & 1 & 2 & \\ \hline
4 & p & 3 & 6 & 32 \\ \hline  & d & 5 & 10 & \\ \hline  & d & 5 & 10 & \\ \hline  & d & 7 & 14 & \\ \hline \end{tabular}

### 3 Electronic Configuration

Learning Outcome:

(h) State the electronic configuration of atoms and ions given the proton number (and charge)

The **electronic configuration** of an element refers to the arrangement of electrons in the principal quantum shells, subshells and orbitals.

Knowing the electronic configuration enables us to identify the electron(s) to be removed in a chemical reaction. We will be able to know which orbital the electron to be removed resides in, and consequently the amount of energy required to remove it.

### **Rules for Arranging Electrons**

**Rule 1: Pauli's Exclusion Principle**

Two electrons in the **same orbital** must have **opposite spins**.

Electrons are often described with a special property known as spin. There are two possible orientations for electron spin, represented by arrows pointing in opposite directions.

_For your information_

Electron spin gives rise to the formation of magnetic fields. If two electrons in the same orbital have the same spin, the magnetic field created will be repulsive, causing the energy level of these two electrons to be higher, and thus being less stable as compared to a pair of electrons with opposite spins.

**Rule 2: Hund's Rule**

**Orbitals of a subshell** must be **s**indy** **occupied** **first with parallel spins before pairing occurs**.

For example, when filling **six** electrons into the **p subshell**,

**After filling the first three electrons:**

* Orbitals are singly occupied, electrons have parallel spins

**After filling all six electrons:**

* Orbitals contain paired electrons with opposite spins

This happens as electrons repel one another electrostatically. Hence, they will want to remain as far apart as possible from one another by occupying different orbitals (i.e. different regions of space) first.

### Electronic Configuration of Atoms and the Periodic Table

Learning Outcome:

Recognise variation in the electronic configurations across a Period and down a Group

The Periodic Table is compartmentalised into blocks, namely the s block, p block, d block and f block. The **name of the block** indicates the **last occupied subshell** of the atom.

The **period number** indicates the **principal quantum number**, n, of the valence (outermost) shell**. Elements in the same period have the same number of shells occupied with electrons.

The **group numbers** of the s and p block elements indicate the **number of electrons in the valence shell**. Elements in the same group have the same number of valence electrons and hence, same valence shell electronic configuration.

### Electronic Configuration of an Ion Steps for working out electronic configuration of an ion

1. Work out the electronic configuration of the **atom**.
2. For an **anion**, **add** the number of electrons equal to the negative charge **to the outermost shell**. For a **cation**, **remove** the number of electrons equal to the positive charge **from the outermost shell**.

[FIGURE:S4.F1][ENDFIGUR

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:17]

## 4 Factors Affecting Atomic Properties and Periodic Trends

The elements in the periodic table are arranged in order of increasing atomic number. All of these elements display similar trends in:

* Ionisation Energy
* Atomic and Ionic Radius
* Electronegativity

The following factors affect the **electrostatic forces of attraction between the valence electrons and the nucleus**, giving rise to the various trends.

* **Charge of nucleus (nuclear charge)**
* More protons in nucleus, larger positive charge of nucleus
* Stronger electrostatic forces of attraction between the nucleus and the valence electrons
* **Number of electrons between valence electrons and nucleus (shielding or screening effect)**

**Shielding or screening effect** refers to the inter-electronic repulsion between the valence (outermost) electrons and inner shell electrons.

* Inner shell electrons confer the most significant shielding. Shielding by electrons within the same shell is generally more insignificant in comparison.
* Fewer electrons in the inner shells which leads to weaker shielding effect
* Stronger electrostatic forces of attraction between the nucleus and the valence electrons

Bringing together the effects of nuclear charge and shielding effect: **Effective Nuclear Charge**

* The **effective nuclear charge** is the strength of the **net** electrostatic forces of **attraction** felt by the valence electrons after taking into account the shielding effect of the inner shell electrons.

**Effective nuclear charge = nuclear charge - shielding effect**

* (det by no. of protons)

* **Distance of electron from nucleus**
* Smaller distance between nucleus and valence electron
* Stronger electrostatic forces of attraction between the nucleus and the valence electron

## 5 Trends in Ionisation Energies

### Ionisation Energy (I.E.)

The first ionisation energy is the energy required to remove 1 mole of electrons from 1 mole of gaseous atoms to form 1 mole of singly charged gaseous cations.

\(X(g)\to X^{*}(g)+e^{-}\)

The second ionisation energy is the energy required to remove 1 mole of electrons from 1 mole of singly charged gaseous cations to form 1 mole of doubly charged gaseous cations.

\(X^{*}(g)\to X^{2*}(g)+e^{-}\)

Ionisation energy is always a **positive** value (i.e. **endothermic**) because energy is **required** to overcome the electrostatic forces of attraction between the nucleus and valence electrons.

### Trends of 1*1 I.E.

Learning Outcome:

Explain the factors influencing the ionisation energies of elements _(see the Data Booklet)_.

Describe and explain qualitatively the trends and variations in first ionisation energy:

Across a Period in terms of shielding and nuclear charge

Down a Group in terms of increasing number of electronic shells, shielding and nuclear charge

The following chart shows the 1* ionisation energies of elements with atomic numbers from 1 to 86.

#### 5.2.1 Across the Period (e.g. Li, Be, B, C, O, N, F, Ne)

**General increase in 1st I.E. across the period**

* Number of protons in the nucleus of the atom increases, thus **nuclear charge increases**
* Same number of inner shell electrons, thus **shielding effect is approximately constant**
* **Increase in effective nuclear charge**
* **Increase in electrostatic forces of attraction** between the nucleus and valence electron
* **More energy needed to remove the valence electron**
* **Increase in 1st I.E. across the period**

**Exception 1: Decrease in 1st I.E. from Group 2 to Group 13 (e.g. Be to B)**

* Valence shell: Group 2: _ns\({}^{2}\)_ Group 13: _ns\({}^{2}\)_np\({}^{1}\)_
* **_np electron is of a higher energy level than the _ns electron_**
* **Less energy is required to remove the valence _np_ electron from a Group 13 element**

**Exception 2: Decrease in 1st I.E. from Group 15 to 16 (e.g. N to O)**

* Valence shell Group 15: _n\({}^{2}\)_n\({}^{3}\)_ Group 16: _n\({}^{2}\)_n\({}^{4}\)_
* There is **inter-electronic repulsion between the paired electrons in the same orbital**
* for a Group 16 element
* **Less energy is required to remove the _np_ electron from Group 16 than Group 15**

#### 5.2.2 Down the Group (e.g. He, Ne, Ar, Kr, Xe, Rn)

**Decrease in 1st I.E. down the group**

* **Both nuclear charge and shielding effect increase**.
* However, valence electrons are located in a shell with a larger principal quantum number, n, and are **further away from the nucleus**
* **Decrease in electrostatic forces of attraction** between the nucleus and the valence electron
* **Less energy needed to remove the valence electron**
* **Decrease in 1st I.E. down the group**

### Successive I.E. of an Atom

Learning Outcome:

* Deduce the electronic configurations of elements from successive ionisation energy data
* Interpret successive ionisation energy data of an element in terms of the position of that element within the Periodic Table

**General Trend:**

* **Shielding effect decreases** as electrons are removed
* **Nuclear charge remains the same**, hence **effective nuclear charge increases**
* Resulting in **increase in electrostatic forces of attraction** between the nucleus and the remaining electrons
* **More energy needed for subsequent removal of electrons**
* Successive I.E. of an atom **always increases**

#### 5.3.1 Deducing Electronic Configuration Using Successive I.E.

The following graph and table show the successive ionisation energies of an **aluminium** atom (A\(\&\) 1s\({}^{2}\) 2s\({}^{2}\) 2p\({}^{6}\) 3s\({}^{2}\) 3p\({}^{1}\)).

* A **large increase** in I.E. represents a **change in principal quantum shell**.
* Electron is removed from an inner principal quantum shell which is **closer to the nucleus**, and hence experiences **stronger** electrostatic forces of attraction.
* The **number of electrons that are removed** before the **first large increase** in I.E. indicates the **number of valence electrons** in the atom, and hence the **group** the element is in.
* Using these pieces of information, the **valence shell electronic configuration of the atom** can be deduced.

## 6 Trends in Atomic Radius, Ionic Radius, and Electronegativity

Learning Outcome:

Describe and explain qualitatively the trends and variations in atomic radius, ionic radius and electronegativity:

Across a Period in terms of shielding and nuclear charge

Down a Group in terms of increasing number of electronic shells and nuclear charge

Apart from ionisation energies, electronic configuration can help us to understand atomic radius, ionic radius, and electronegativity. This is because these properties are also **dependent on the strength of attraction between the nucleus and the valence electrons or the shared electrons in a covalent bond**.

**Atomic radius** is defined as _half the distance_ between the centres of two adjacent atoms found in the structure of the element.

Due to differences in inter-atomic bonding in different elements, the way atomic radius is measured for each element may be different:

\[\begin{array}{c}\textbf{metallic radius}\\ \bullet\end{array}\begin{array}{c}\textbf{covalent radius}\\ \bullet\end{array}\begin{array}{c}\textbf{The overall radius of an atom is half the distance between the centres of two adjacent atoms in the metal.}\\ \bullet\end{array}\begin{array}{c}\textbf{van der Waals radius}\\ \bullet\end{array}\begin{array}{c}\textbf{The overall radius of an atom is half the distance between the centres of two adjacent atoms that are covalently bonded.}\\ \bullet\end{array}\begin{array}{c}\textbf{The van der Waals' radius of an atom is half the distance between the centres of two adjacent atoms which are not chemically bonded.}\\ \bullet\end{array}\begin{array}{c}\textbf{Van der Waals radius}\\ \bullet\end{array}\begin{array}{c}\textbf{The van der Waals' radius of an atom is half the distance between the centres of two adjacent atoms which are not chemically bonded.}\\ \bullet\end{array}\begin{array}{c}\textbf{Van der Waals' radius is most easily determined for non-metals, and is particularly useful for the **noble gases**.

### Trends Across the Period

**Atomic radius decreases across the period**

**Number of protons in the nucleus of the atom**

**Increases, thus nuclear charge increases**

**Name number of inner shell electrons, thus shielding**

**effect is approximately constant**

**Increase in effective nuclear charge**

**Increase in electrostatic forces of attraction**

**between the nucleus and valence electron**

**Cationic radii decreases from Na+ to Si+**

**Nuclear charge increases**

**Same shielding effect since the cations are isoelectronic (same number of electrons)**

**Stronger electrostatic forces of attraction between the nucleus and the valence electrons**

**Anion radii decreases from P3- to C/I**

**Nuclear charge increases**

**Same shielding effect since the anions are isoelectronic (same number of electrons)**

**Stronger electrostatic forces of attraction between the nucleus and the valence electrons**

### _More Observations About Ionic Radii_

_Cations are smaller than their corresponding atoms_

_E.g._ Electronic configurations of Na: 1s\({}^{2}\) 2s\({}^{2}\) 2p\({}^{6}\) 3s\({}^{1}\)

Electronic configurations of Na\({}^{+}\): 1s\({}^{2}\) 2s\({}^{2}\) 2p\({}^{6}\)

Nuclear charge **remains the same**

Cation has **fewer electrons** than the atom

Shielding effect **decreases**

**Increase** in the electrostatic forces of attraction between the nucleus and the valence electrons in cation

Electronic configurations of \(Cl\): 1s\({}^{2}\) 2s\({}^{2}\) 2p\({}^{6}\) 3s\({}^{2}\) 3p\({}^{6}\)

Nuclear charge **remains the same**

Anion has **more electrons** than the atom

Shielding effect **increases**

**Decrease** in the electrostatic forces of attraction between the nucleus and the valence electrons in anion

**The anions (P\({}^{3-}\), S\({}^{2-}\) and \(C\)) are larger than the cations (Na\({}^{+}\), Mg\({}^{2+}\), A\({}^{+}\), Si\({}^{4+}\))**

_E.g._ Electronic configurations of Na\({}^{+}\), Mg\({}^{2+}\), A\({}^{+}\), Si\({}^{4+}\): 1s\({}^{2}\) 2s\({}^{2}\) 2p\({}^{6}\)

Electronic configurations of P\({}^{3-}\), S\({}^{2-}\) and \(Cl\): 1s\({}^{2}\) 2s\({}^{2}\) 2p\({}^{6}\) 3s\({}^{2}\) 3p\({}^{6}\)

Anions have **one more filled principal quantum shell** compared to cations

Valence electrons in anions are **further** from the nucleus than those in cations

**Weaker electrostatic forces of attraction between the nucleus and valence electrons in anions than in cations

## Atomic Structure

### Annex 2 ELECTRONIC CONFIGATIONS OF D-BLOCK ELEMENTS

Up till Ca, the 4s orbital is lower in energy compared to the 3d orbitals. However, **from Sc** onwards, there is a crossover between the energies of the 3d and 4s orbitals (see Figure A below), and the **4s** becomes the **outermost (highest energy) orbital**, while the **3d** orbital is **penultimate** (2nd from the last). Hence, **when representing the electronic configuration** in writing, **3d is written before 4s**.

However, **when filling up the orbitals of an atom of a d-block element**, the **4s orbital is filled before the 3d**. For example, spectroscopic results show that Sc has the electronic configuration [Ar] 3d\({}^{1}\) 4s\({}^{2}\), instead of [Ar] 3d\({}^{3}\) or [Ar] 3d\({}^{2}\) 4s\({}^{1}\). This is due to the **3d subshell being more compact than the diffuse 4s orbital**. The most probable distance of a 3d electron from the nucleus is less than that of a 4s electron i.e. the 3d electrons are more likely to be found closer to the nucleus (see Figure B), so two 3d electrons repel each other more strongly than two 4s electrons. Hence, the **more electrons occupying the 3d subshell**, the larger the electron repulsion.

For Sc, electronic configuration [Ar] 3d\({}^{1}\) 4s\({}^{2}\) is more favourable as it minimises the strong electron-electron repulsions in the 3d orbitals. Even though energy is required to have electrons populate the higher energy 4s orbital, the total energy of the atom is the least.
