### Calculations Involving a Point and a Plane

#### 1.3.1 Foot of Perpendicular from a Point to a Plane

In Figure 5a, the foot of perpendicular from

point \(P\) to plane \(\pi\) is the point \(F\), where

the line through \(P\) and perpendicular to \(\pi\) meets \(\pi\).

Point \(F\) is also called the projection of

point \(P\) onto \(\pi\).

The distance \(PF\) is the perpendicular distance

from \(P\) to \(\pi\).

**Figure 5a**

**Example 6**

The plane \(\pi\) has equation \(\mathbf{r}\cdot\left(\mathbf{i}+\mathbf{j}-3\mathbf{k}\right)=1\) and the points \(A\) and \(B\) have position vectors \(\mathbf{i}\) and \(\mathbf{i}+2\mathbf{j}\) respectively, with respect to the origin \(O\).

**(i)**: Show that \(\pi\) contains \(A\) but does not pass through \(B\).
**(ii)**: The foot of perpendicular from \(B\) to \(\pi\) is \(P\). Find the position vector of \(P\) and determine the perpendicular distance from \(B\) to \(\pi\).
**(iii)**:Find the position vector of \(Q\), the image of \(B\) after reflection in \(\pi\).

**Solution**

**(i)**: \(\left(\

#### 1.3.2 Distance from a Point to a Plane

Suppose the plane \(\pi\) passes through a fixed point \(A\) and has a normal vector \(\mathbf{n}\), and the foot of perpendicular from point \(P\) to \(\pi\) is the point \(F\). The distance (or shortest distance or perpendicular distance) from point \(P\) to \(\pi\) is the distance \(PF\).

The distance \(PF\) is also the length of projection of \(\overrightarrow{AP}\) onto \(\mathbf{n}\), which is \(\overrightarrow{AP}\cdot\mathbf{\hat{n}}\).

### Calculations Involving Two Planes

#### 1.4.1 Angle between Two Planes

**Remark:** Two planes are perpendicular if their normal vectors are perpendicular.

The planes are parallel if their normal vectors are parallel.

**Example 8**

Find the acute angle between the planes with equations \(\mathbf{r}\cdot\left(\mathbf{i}+3\mathbf{j}+2\mathbf{k}\right)=4\) and \(\mathbf{r}\cdot\left(\mathbf{i}-\mathbf{j}-\mathbf{k}\right)=4\).

**Solution**

Let \(\theta\) be the angle between their normal vectors. Then

\(\theta=128.1^{\circ}\) (nearest \(0.1^{\circ}\))

The acute angle between the planes is \(180^{\circ}-128.1^{\circ}=51.9^{\circ}\).

**Figure 6**

Figure 6 shows two intersecting planes. The angle between two planes is the angle between their normals.

**Remark:** Two planes are perpendicular if their normal vectors are perpendicular.

The planes are parallel if their normal vectors are parallel.

**Example 8**

Find the acute angle between the planes with equations \(\mathbf{r}\cdot\left(\mathbf{i}+3\mathbf{j}+2\mathbf{k}\right)=4\) and \(\mathbf{r}\cdot\left(\mathbf{i}-\mathbf{j}-\mathbf{k}\right)=4\).

**Solution**

Let \(\theta\) be the angle between their normal vectors. Then

\(\theta=128.1^{\circ}\) (nearest \(0.1^{\circ}\))

The acute angle between the planes is \(180^{\circ}-128.1^{\circ}=51.9^{\circ}\).

#### Intersection of Two Planes

Given two distinct planes, there are two possible cases as shown in Figure 7.

**(1)** The two planes do not intersect so they are parallel.

In Figure 7, \(\pi_{1}\) and \(\pi_{2}\) do not intersect and are parallel, so \(\pi_{1}\) for some \(\lambda\in\mathbb{R}\).
**(2)** The two planes intersect in a line.

In Figure 7, \(\pi_{1}\) and \(\pi_{2}\) intersect in the line

In the case where two planes \(\pi_{1}\): \(\mathbf{r}\cdot\mathbf{n}_{1}=d_{1}\) and \(\pi_{2}\): \(\mathbf{r}\cdot\mathbf{n}_{2}=d_{2}\) intersect, where \(\mathbf{n}_{1}=a_{1}\mathbf{i}+b_{1}\mathbf{j}+c_{1}\mathbf{k}\) and \(\mathbf{n}_{2}=a_{2}\mathbf{i}+b_{2}\mathbf{j}+c_{2}\mathbf{k}\), there are three methods to determine the line of intersection \(l\).

**Method 1** (See Example 9a Method 1)

Solve the cartesian equations of \(\pi_{1}\) and \(\pi_{2}\) given by

\[\left\{\begin{array}{l}\overline{\mathbf{q}_{1}\mathbf{x}\mathbf{x}\mathbf{ x}\mathbf{y}\mathbf{y}+c_{2}\mathbf{z}=d_{1}}\\ \overline{\mathbf{q}_{2}\mathbf{x}\mathbf{x}\mathbf{y}\mathbf{y}+c_{2}\mathbf{ z}=d_{2}}\end{array}\right.\]

a system of two linear equations with three unknowns \(x,\ y\) and \(z\). We can solve for two variables in terms of the third, which serves as a parameter. This gives the equation of the line of intersection in parametric form.

**Method 2** (See Example 9a Method 2)

Since \(l\) lies on both planes, it is perpendicular to both \(\mathbf{n}_{1}\) and \(\mathbf{n}_{2}\), so \(l\) is parallel to \(\mathbf{n}_{1}\times\mathbf{n}_{2}\).

It remains to find a point \(A\) with position vector at \(\mathbf{n}\). This point can be obtained by observation or by solving the cartesian equations for \(\overline{\mathbf{n}_{1}}\) and \(\overline{\mathbf{n}_{2}}\) with one extra condition, like \(x=0\), \(y=0\) or \(z=0\).

The vector equation of \(l\) is then given by

**Method 3**

We can use the trick in Method 2 to first find two points \(A\) and \(B\) on \(l\), then use the points to find the vector equation of \(l\).

**Example 10** [PJC Prelim 9740/2008/01/Q10 (modified)]

The line \(l_{i}\) and plane \(\pi_{i}\) have vector equations

\[\mathbf{r}=\mathbf{i}+5\mathbf{j}-4\mathbf{k}+\lambda(3\mathbf{i}+2 \mathbf{j}+7\mathbf{k}), \lambda\in\mathbb{R}\] \[\mathbf{r}=\mathbf{i}+5\mathbf{j}-4\mathbf{k}+s(2\mathbf{i}+ \mathbf{j}+4\mathbf{k})+t(3\mathbf{i}+2\mathbf{j}+7\mathbf{k}), s,t\in\mathbb{R}\]

respectively.

**(i)**: State the coordinates of a point of intersection between \(l_{i}\) and \(\pi_{i}\), and hence give a geometrical interpretation about \(l_{i}\) and \(\pi_{i}\).
**(ii)**: The plane \(\pi_{2}\) passes through the point \(A\) with coordinates (3, 6, 1) and contains the line \(l_{i}\). Find, in the form \(\mathbf{r}\cdot\mathbf{n}=p\), the equation of \(\pi_{2}\).
**(iii)**: The plane \(\pi_{3}\) has equation \(x+2y-z=0\). Determine, with a reason, if the planes \(\pi_{1}\), \(\pi_{2}\) and \(\pi_{3}\) have a common point of intersection.
**(iv)**: Find the perpendicular distance between \(\pi_{1}\) and \(\pi_{3}\), giving your answer in the surf form.
**Solution**

**(i)**: From the equations of \(l_{i}\) and \(\pi_{1}\), they have a common point \(\big{(}1,5,-4\big{)}\) and are parallel. Hence \(l_{i}\) lies on \(\pi_{1}\).
**(ii)**: A vector parallel to \(\pi_{2}\) is \(\begin{pmatrix}3\\ 6\\ 1\end{pmatrix}-\begin{pmatrix}1\\ 5\\ -4\end{pmatrix}=\begin{pmatrix}2\\ 5\end{pmatrix}\), and a normal vector of \(\pi_{2}\) is \(\begin{pmatrix}2\\ 1\\ 5\end{pmatrix}\)\(\begin{pmatrix}3\\ 2\\ 7\end{pmatrix}=\begin{pmatrix}-3\\ 1\\ 1\end{pmatrix}\).

\(\pi_{2}\) has equation \(\mathbf{r}\cdot\begin{pmatrix}-3\\ 1\\ 1\end{pmatrix}=\begin{pmatrix}3\\ 6\\ 1\end{pmatrix}\)\(\begin{pmatrix}-3\\ 1\\ 1\end{pmatrix}\), i.e. \(\mathbf{r}\cdot\begin{pmatrix}-3\\ 1\\ 1\end{pmatrix}=-2\).
**(iii)**: A normal of \(\pi_{1}\) is \(\begin{pmatrix}2\\ 1\\ 4\end{pmatrix}\)\(\begin{pmatrix}3\\ 2\\ 7\end{pmatrix}=\begin{pmatrix}-1\\ -2\\ 1\end{pmatrix}\), and \(\pi_{1}\) has equation \(\mathbf{r}\cdot\begin{pmatrix}-1\\ -2\\ 1\end{pmatrix}=\begin{pmatrix}1\\ 5\\ -4\end{pmatrix}\)\(\begin{pmatrix}-1\\ -2\\ 1\end{pmatrix}=-15\) or \(x+2y-z=15\). The equations of \(\pi_{1}\) and \(\pi_{3}\) show they are two parallel planes. Thus, the 3 planes have no common point of intersection.
**(iv)**: From the equation of \(\pi_{3}\), observe that \(\pi_{3}\) passes through the origin. Hence the distance is

\[\begin{pmatrix}1\\ 5\\ -4\end{pmatrix}\cdot\frac{1}{\sqrt{6}}\begin{pmatrix}1\\ 2\\ -1\end{pmatrix}=\frac{15}{\sqrt{6}}\,.\]

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:18]

**Example 12** [NYJC Prelim 9740/2008/01/Q11]

Two planes \(\pi_{1}\) and \(\pi_{2}\) have equations

\[\mathbf{r}=\big{(}3+\lambda-2\mu\big{)}\mathbf{j}+\big{(}2-3\lambda+\mu\big{)} \mathbf{j}+\big{(}1-\mu\big{)}\mathbf{k}\;\;\text{and}\;\;\mathbf{r}\cdot\left( \begin{array}{c}a\\ -1\\ b\end{array}\right)=5\;\text{respectively}.\]

**(i)**: Show that the Cartesian equation of \(\pi_{1}\) is \(3x+y-5z=6\). [2]

**(ii)**: Given that the point \(A\) (\(3\), \(2\), \(1\)) lies on \(\pi_{2}\) and that the two planes are perpendicular to each other, find the values of \(a\) and of \(b\). [3]

**(iii)**: Find a vector equation of \(I\), the line of intersection between the planes \(\pi_{1}\) and \(\pi_{2}\). [2]

**(iv)**: The point \(B\) has position vector \(-6\mathbf{i}+3\mathbf{j}+11\mathbf{k}\). Find the coordinates of the point \(C\) on \(\pi_{2}\) such that \(\angle ACB=90\). [3]

**(v)**: The line \(L\) is the reflection of the line \(AB\) in the plane \(\pi_{2}\). Find an equation for the line \(L\) and determine the acute angle between the lines \(I\) and \(L\). [4]

**Solution**

**(i)**: \(\mathbf{r}=\left(\begin{array}{c}3+\lambda-2\mu\\ 2-3\lambda+\mu\\ 1-\mu\end{array}\right)=\left(\begin{array}{c}3\\ 2\\ 1\end{array}\right)+\lambda\left(\begin{array}{c}1\\ -3\\ 0\end{array}\right)+\mu\left(\begin{array}{c}-2\\ 1\\ -1\end{array}\right)\)

A normal vector of plane \(\pi_{1}\) is \(\left(\begin{array}{c}1\\ -3\\ 0\end{array}\right)\times\left(\begin{array}{c}-2\\ 1\\ -1\end{array}\right)=\left(\begin{array}{c}3\\ 1\\ -5\end{array}\right)\),

Hence equation of \(\pi_{1}\) is \(\mathbf{r}\cdot\left(\begin{array}{c}3\\ 1\\ -5\end{array}\right)=\left(\begin{array}{c}3\\ 2\\ 1\end{array}\right)\cdot\left(\begin{array}{c}3\\ 1\\ -5\end{array}\right)\), so cartesian equation of \(\pi_{1}\) is \(3x+y-5z=6\).

**(ii)**: The point \(A\) lies on \(\pi_{2}\), so \(\left(\begin{array}{c}3\\ 2\\ 1\end{array}\right)\cdot\left(\begin{array}{c}a\\ -1\\ b\end{array}\right)=5\)\(\Rightarrow\)\(3a+b=7\)\(\rightarrow\)(1)

Planes \(\pi_{1}\) and \(\pi_{2}\) are perpendicular, so \(\left(\begin{array}{c}3\\ 1\\ -5\end{array}\right)\cdot\left(\begin{array}{c}a\\ -1\\ b\end{array}\right)=0\)\(\Rightarrow\)\(3a-5b=1\) --(2)

Solving (1) & (2), \(a=2\), \(b=1\).

**(iii)**: \(\left(\begin{array}{c}3\\ 1\\ -5\end{array}\right)\times\left(\begin{array}{c}2\\ -1\\ 1\end{array}\right)=\left(\begin{array}{c}-4\\ -13\\ -5\end{array}\right)\)

_l:_ \(\mathbf{r}=\left(\begin{array}{c}3\\ 2\\ 1\end{array}\right)+\lambda\left(\begin{array}{c}4\\ 13\\ 5\end{array}\right)\), \(\lambda\in\mathbb{R}\).

**(iv)**Point \(C\) is where the line \(BC\) with equation \(\mathbf{r}=\begin{pmatrix}-6\\ 3\\ 11\end{pmatrix}+\mu\begin{pmatrix}2\\ -1\\ 1\end{pmatrix}\), \(\mu\in\mathbb{R}\) meets \(\pi_{2}\):

\[\begin{split}\begin{pmatrix}-6\\ 3\\ 11\end{pmatrix}+\mu\begin{pmatrix}2\\ -1\\ 1\end{pmatrix}\end{split}\begin{pmatrix}2\\ -1\\ 1\end{pmatrix}=5\\ \begin{pmatrix}-12-3+11\end{pmatrix}+\mu\begin{pmatrix}4+1+1\end{pmatrix}=5 \\ \mu=\frac{3}{2}\\ \begin{pmatrix}-6\\ 3\\ 11\end{pmatrix}+\frac{3}{2}\begin{pmatrix}2\\ -1\\ 1\end{pmatrix}\text{, so }C\text{ has coordinates }\begin{pmatrix}-3,\frac{3}{2}, \frac{25}{2}\end{pmatrix}\text{.}\end{split}\]
**(v)** Let \(B^{*}\) be the reflection of \(B\) in \(\pi_{2}\).

\[\begin{split}\overline{OC}=\frac{\overline{OB}+\overline{OB}^{*} }{2}&\Rightarrow&\overline{OB}^{*}=2\overline{OC}-\overline{OB}=14\text{k}\\ \overline{AB}^{*}=\begin{pmatrix}0\\ 0\\ 14\end{pmatrix}-\begin{pmatrix}3\\ 2\\ 1\end{pmatrix}=\begin{pmatrix}-3\\ -2\\ 13\end{pmatrix}\\ \text{Hence an equation for the line }L\text{ is }\mathbf{r}=\begin{pmatrix}3\\ 2\\ 1\end{pmatrix}+\alpha\begin{pmatrix}-3\\ -2\\ 13\end{pmatrix}\text{, }\alpha\in\mathbb{R}\text{. Let }\theta\text{ be the angle between }\begin{pmatrix}4\\ 13\\ 5\end{pmatrix}\\ \text{and }\begin{pmatrix}-3\\ -2\\ 13\end{pmatrix}\text{. Then }\cos\theta=\frac{\begin{pmatrix}4\\ 13\\ 5\end{pmatrix}\cdot\begin{pmatrix}-3\\ -2\\ 13\end{pmatrix}}{\begin{pmatrix}4\\ -3\\ 13\end{pmatrix}}=\frac{-12+13\times 3}{\sqrt{4^{2}+13^{2}+5^{2}\sqrt{3^{2}+2^{2}+13^{2}} }}=\frac{27}{\sqrt{210}\sqrt{182}}\\ \theta=82.1^{\circ}\text{ (nearest }0.1^{\circ}\text{)}\end{split}\]

Hence the required acute angle is \(82.1^{\circ}\).

**CONCLUSION**

With the introduction of vector product and equations of planes, many new and interesting problems in three-dimensional geometry are created and this makes the study of vectors more complete.
