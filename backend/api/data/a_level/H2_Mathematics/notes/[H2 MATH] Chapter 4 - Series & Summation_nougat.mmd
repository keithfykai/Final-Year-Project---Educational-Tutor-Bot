A sequence is a set of numbers arranged in a defined order. Each number in the sequence is called a term of the sequence, \(u_{n}\)

Types of Sequences:

* Finite: sequence terminates

infinite: there is no end, sequence keeps going on...

Convergent: \(u_{n}\) approaches a unique value (the limit) as \(n\rightarrow\infty\)

Divergent: sequence that does not converge

Strictly increasing: \(u_{n-1}>u_{n}\) for all \(n\)

Strictly decreasing: \(u_{n+1}<u_{n}\) for all \(n\)

Constant: \(u_{n}=c\) for all \(n\)

A series is the sum of the terms of a sequence, denoted by \(S_{n}\). It can have a finite or infinite number of terms.

Useful results:

\[u_{n}=S_{n}-S_{n-1}\text{ for }n>1\] \[u_{1}=S_{1}\]

If \(S_{n}\) approaches a unique value as \(n\) approaches infinity, we say \(S_{n}\) converges and the sum to infinity \(S_{n}\) exists.

Or else it is said to **diverge**.
