## 1 Introduction

### Structure and classification

* Amines are derivatives of ammonia where one or more hydrogen atoms of the ammonia molecule have been substituted by alkyl or aryl groups.
* Amines may be classified as **primary** (1\({}^{\text{\text{\textregistered}}}\)), **secondary** (2\({}^{\text{\text{\textregistered}}}\)) or **tertiary** (3\({}^{\text{\text{\textregistered}}}\)), depending on the **number of alkyl/ aryl groups** attached to the **N atom**.

### Nomenclature

* Many **aliphatic amines** are named by specifying the alkyl groups attached to the N atom, following by the suffix -_amine_.
* Many **aromatic amines** are named as derivatives of the simplest aromatic amine, e.g. **phenylamine (aniline)**.

* For polyfunctional amines with other functional groups of higher priority, the amine group is treated as a substituent and the prefix -_amino_ is added to the parent compound. e.g. H2NCH2COOH H2N--OH

**2-aminoethanoic acid 4-aminophenol**

### Physical properties

* **Boiling point*
* Amines have higher boiling points than hydrocarbons with similar \(M_{t}\) due to stronger hydrogen bonding (except for 3\({}^{o}\) amines).
* However, amines have **lower boiling points** than **alcohols** of similar \(M_{t}\) due to the **hydrogen bonds** in amines being **weaker** than those in alcohols since the **N-H bond is less polar than O-H bond**.
* Amines which are constitutional isomers, have boiling points which increases in the order: 3\({}^{o}\) amines < 2\({}^{o}\) amines < 1\({}^{o}\) amines

* **b.p. \(I\) \({}^{o}\)C*
* **intermediate forces of attraction*
* **48 instantaneous dipole-induced dipole*
* **34 instantaneous dipole-induced dipole*
* **no hydrogen bonding between molecules permanent dipole-permanent dipole (weaker) instantaneous dipole-induced dipole*
* **Think: Why is the hydrogen bonding in secondary amines less extensive than that of primary amines? _Answer:_ With one more R group bonded directly to the N atom in secondary amines, there is greater steric hindrance which makes the lone pair of electrons on the N atom is less accessible for hydrogen bonding as compared to primary amines. Hence, the hydrogen bonding in secondary amines is less extensive.

## 3 Basicity of Amines

LO (b) describe and explain the basicity of primary, secondary and tertiary amines in the gaseous phase (interpret as Lewis bases)

### Amines as bases in gaseous phase

* In the gaseous phase, amines behave like a **Lewis base**_i.e._ **electron-pair donor**. This is due to the availability of the lone pair of electrons on the nitrogen atom for donation to an electron pair acceptor (Lewis acid), like H+ ion.
* Their **basic strength** increases with the **availability of the lone pair of electrons** on the nitrogen atom for **donation** to an electron pair acceptor.

**Relative basicity of primary, secondary and tertiary amines in the gaseous phase**

* Basicity of tertiary amine > secondary amine > primary amine > ammonia

NH3(g) + H+(g) \(\rightarrow\) NH4*(g) \(\rightarrow\) CH3NH2(g) + H+(g) \(\rightarrow\) CH3NH3*(g) \(\rightarrow\) CH3NH3*(g) \(\rightarrow\) -896 kJ mol-1 (CH3)2NH(g) + H+(g) \(\rightarrow\) (CH3)2NH2*(g) \(\rightarrow\) -923 kJ mol-1 (CH3)3N(g) + H+(g) \(\rightarrow\) (CH3)3NH*(g) \(\rightarrow\) (CH3)3NH*(g) \(\rightarrow\) -938 kJ mol-1 Order of base strength (in gas phase):

**trimethylamine > dimethylamine > methylamine > ammonia**

most basic

**Reason**

* From methylamine to trimethylamine, the **number of electron-donating alkyl groups attached to the N atom increases**.
* This **increases the electron density on N atom** of the amine. Hence, the **lone pair of electrons on N atom** is **more available for donation** to a Lewis acid.
* Thus basicity of tertiary amine > secondary amine > primary amine > ammonia.
* The same order of basicity is seen in the reaction of amines with other Lewis acids, such as AIC_b_:

### Amines as bases in aqueous medium

* Amines are **weak bases** in aqueous medium.
* In the **aqueous medium**, amines behave like a **Bronsted-Lowry base** _i.e._ **proton acceptor**. This is due to the ability of the **lone pair of electrons on N atom to accept a proton** from H2O.

* Their **basic strength increases** with the **availability** of the **lone pair of electrons** on the nitrogen atom for **donation** to a proton.

#### 3.2.1 Relative basicity of ammonia, ethylamine and phenylalanine in water

* The base dissociation constant, \(K_{b}\), of an amine is a measure of the base strength of an amine. It is a measure of the extent of ionisation of the amine in water.
* The larger the \(K_{b}\) or the lower the pK\({}_{b}\), the stronger the base.

Comparing the base dissociation constant, \(K_{b}\):

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|} \hline
**compound** & \(K_{b}\) / mol dm-3 \\ \hline ethylamine & \(5.6\times 10^{-4}\) \\ \hline ammonia & \(1.8\times 10^{-5}\) \\ \hline phenylalanine & \(4.3\times 10^{-10}\) \\ \hline Order of base strength: & ethylamine \textgreater{} ammonia \textgreater{} phenylalanine \textgreater{} most basic & least basic \\ \hline
**Why is ethylamine a stronger base than ammonia?** \\ \(\text{CH}_{3}\text{CH}_{2}\overset{\ast}{\text{NH}}_{2}\left(\text{aq}\right)\ +\ \text{H}_{2}\text{O}\left(l\right)\ \textless{}\ \text{CH}_{3}\text{CH}_{2}\text{NH}_{3}^{+}\left(\text{aq}\right)\ +\ \text{OH}^{-}\left(\text{aq}\right)\) \\ \(\overset{\ast}{\text{NH}}_{3}\left(\text{aq}\right)\ +\ \text{H}_{2}\text{O}\left(l\right)\ \textless{}\ \text{NH}_{4}^{+}\left(\text{aq}\right)\ +\ \text{OH}^{-}\left(\text{aq}\right)\) \\ \(\textgreater{}\) The **electron-donating ethyl group (\(\text{CH}_{3}\text{CH}_{2}\)--) increases the electron density of the lone electron pair on N atom of ethylamine. Hence, the **lone electron pair on N atom** is more available for **donation to a proton**. \\ \(\textgreater{}\) However, ammonia does not have any electron-donating group attached to its N atom. Hence, ammonia is a weaker base than ethylamine.

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:11]

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:12]

### Comparison of basicity of amine in gas phase and aqueous phase (for enrichment)

* In the gas phase basicity of the methyl amines is of the order: **trimethylamine** > **dimethylamine** > **methylamine** > **ammonia** \(\Delta\)**H**\({}_{\text{protonation}}\) -938 -923 -896 -858 kJ mol-1 most basic **least basic**
* However in aqueous solution, the basicity as measured by the p**K**\({}_{\text{b}}\) **is of the order:** **dimethylamine** > **methylamine** > **trimethylamine** > **ammonia** \(\rho\)**K**\({}_{\text{b}}\) 3.27 3.38 4.22 4.74  most basic **least basic**

**There are 3 factors affecting the basicity of amines.**

* **Inductive effect of substituents on N. Alky! groups will increase the basicity as they exert electron-donating inductive effect.**
* **Solvation Effect which is the degree of solvation of the protonated amine. More N-H groups allow for more extensive hydrogen bonds between the protonated amine and water molecules, leading to greater degree of solvation and thus greater stability of the protonated amine and greater ease of formation. Thus, basicity of amine will increase.**
* **Steric hindrance offered by the groups on N. Bulky groups hinder formation of hydrogen bond between N and the approaching H+ ion.**

### Nucleophilic substitution with halogenoalkane (See Section 2.1)

* Amines can react halogenoalkanes in a nucleophilic substitution with the amine acting as the nucleophile.

LO (e) describe the formation of amides from the condensation reaction between RNH\({}_{2}\) and RCOC\(l\)

### Nucleophilic substitution/ condensation reaction with acyl chloride

* Amines can undergo nucleophilic substitution / condensation with acyl chlorides to form amides.

Example:

* Other acyl halides can be used to form amides. e.g. acyl bromide.
* Anhydrous condition is required for the reaction as acyl halides react readily with water.
* The reaction of acyl halides with ammonia, primary amines and secondary amines is the **ONLY** method to synthesise amides.
* Carboxylic acids cannot react with amines to form amide. Why?

Amines are basic and would undergo acid-base reaction with carboxylic acids to form a salt instead.

### Electrophilic substitution of phenylalanine

* Bromination of the benzene ring of phenylamine can be done using aqueous bromine at room temperature without the use of a Lewis acid catalyst.
* This is due to the -NH\({}_{2}\) group increasing the electron density of the benzene ring as the lone pair of electrons on N atom is delocalised into the benzene ring, making it more susceptible to electrophilic attack as the benzene ring is now more electron-rich.

* Phenol and phenylalanine react similarly with Br\({}_{2}\) (aq) to give the same observations. How can phenol and phenylalanine be distinguished?

* Add aqueous neutral FeCl\({}_{3}\) solution separately to each unknown compound.
* forms a violet complex Phenylamine
- does not form a violet complex
* Can phenylalanine react with _dilute_ nitric acid like phenol to give 2-nitrophenylamine or 4-nitrophenylamine?

* Think: How to synthesise 2-nitrophenylamine or 4-nitrophenylamine from phenylalanine? (Hint: Convert the basic -NH\({}_{2}\) group into a neutral functional group that is still 2,4-directing)NitrogenCompounds

## 4 Reactions of Amides

* LO (h) describe the chemistry of amides, exemplified by the following reactions: (i) hydrolysis on treatment with aqueous alkali or acid (ii) reduction to amines with lithium aluminium hydride

### Hydrolysis

* Amides can undergo hydrolysis when heated in a strong acid or strong alkali. The C-N bond in the amide group is cleaved during hydrolysis.

* Heating is required to hydrolyse amides.
* The alkaline/base hydrolysis reaction can be used as a distinguishing test for amides.

Observations: Pungent gas, CH\({}_{3}\)CH\({}_{2}\)NH\({}_{2}\), evolves that turns moist red litmus paper blue.

This test works if amines produced contain 5 carbons or less as these amines are volatile enough to be vapourised by the heat.

### Reduction

* Amides can undergo **reduction** to form amines using LiAH\({}_{4}\) in dry ether at r.t.
* The C=O group in the amide is reduced to a methylene group, -CH\({}_{2}\)-.

Example: Reduction of ethanamide

* Secondary amides and tertiary amides are reduced to secondary and tertiary amines respectively.
* Catalytic hydrogenation (H\({}_{2}\), Ni) and NaBH\({}_{4}\)**cannot** be used to reduce amides.

## 1 Introduction

* Amino acids are building blocks of proteins. Of the 20 amino acids needed to make up our proteins, eight cannot be synthesised in our bodies. These eight are called essential amino acids and must be part of our diet.

### \(\alpha\)-amino acids

* An amino acid contains at least 1 carboxylic acid group (-CO\({}_{2}\)H) and 1 amino group (-NH\({}_{2}\)).
* The C atom to which the -CO\({}_{2}\)H group is bonded to is called \(\alpha\)-carbon.
* _Definition of \(\alpha\)-amino acid_: An amino-acid where both the -NH\({}_{2}\) and the -CO\({}_{2}\)H group are directly bonded to the same C atom (\(\alpha\)-carbon).

* The side chain, **R**, varies considerably in the 20 naturally occurring \(\alpha\)-amino acids. The composition of the **R** group confers an individual set of properties to each amino acid, which affects the properties of the proteins in which they are found (see Table 1).
* **Acidic** amino acid : **R** group contains **one or more carboxyl group**, -CO\({}_{2}\)H
* **Basic** amino acid : **R** group contains **one or more amino group**, -NH\({}_{2}\)
* **Neutral** amino acid : **R** group contains **neutral group(s)** (neutral groups could be polar or non-polar)

### Nomenclature of amino acids

* Amino acids are named as amino derivatives of carboxylic acids. However, they are still often referred to using their common names (in brackets).

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|} \hline amino acid & abbre & R & amino acid & abbre & R \\ \hline \multicolumn{6}{|c|}{non-product-attributed R group} & \multicolumn{6}{|c|}{polar neutral R group} \\ \hline glycine & gly & \(-\)H & serine & ser & \(-\)CH\({}_{2}\)OH \\ \hline alanine & ala & \(-\)CH\({}_{3}\) & cysteine & cys & \(-\)CH\({}_{2}\)SH \\ \hline valine & val & \(-\)CH\({}_{3}\) & threonine & thr & \(-\)CH\({}_{3}\) \\  & & CH\({}_{3}\) & & OH \\ \hline leucine & leu & \(-\)CH\({}_{2}\)CH & asparagine & asn & \(-\)CH\({}_{2}\)\(-\)C\(-\)NH\({}_{2}\) \\  & & CH\({}_{3}\) & & o \\ \hline isoleucine & lie & \(-\)CH\({}_{2}\)CH\({}_{3}\) & glutamine & gln & \(-\)CH\({}_{2}\)CH\({}_{2}\)\(-\)C\(-\)NH\({}_{2}\) \\ \hline methionine & met & \(-\)CH\({}_{2}\)CH\({}_{2}\)\(-\)S\(-\)CH\({}_{3}\) & tyrosine & fyr & \(-\)CH\({}_{2}\)\(-\)OH \\ \hline phenylalanine & phe & \(-\)CH\({}_{2}\) & & \\ \hline tryptophan & trp & \(-\)CH\({}_{2}\) & & \\ \hline proline* & pro & \(-\)CH\({}_{2}\) & & \\ \hline apatite & k group & \(-\)CH\({}_{2}\)\(-\)C\({}_{2}\) & lysine & lys & \(-\)CH\({}_{2}\)CH\({}_{2}\)CH\({}_{2}\)NH\({}_{2}\) \\ \hline glutamic acid & glu & \(-\)CH\({}_{2}\)CH\({}_{2}\)\(-\)C\({}_{2}\) & arginine & arg & \(-\)CH\({}_{2}\)\(-\)CH\({}_{2}\)\(-\)NH\({}_{2}\) \\ \hline glutamine acid & glu & \(-\)CH\({}_{2}\)CH\({}_{2}\)\(-\)C\({}_{2}\) & arginine & arg & \(-\)CH\({}_{2}\)\(-\)CH\({}_{2}\)\(-\)NH\({}_{2}\) \\ \hline \end{tabular}

### Isoelectric point (pJ) of an amino acid (for enrichment)

* The pH at which the amino acid exists predominantly in the form of its **zwitterions** is called the **isoelectric point (pJ)**. At this pH, the amino acid will not migrate under the influence of an electric field as it has a **net charge of zero**.
* Every amino acid has a characteristic isoelectric point. The difference in isoelectric point can be used to separate amino acids by a technique called **electrophoresis**, in which an amino acid will move towards the cathode or anode depending on the pH of the solution in which the amino acids are dissolved in.

Neutral amino acids

- Fully protonated neutral amino acid is a **dibasic acid** as it has 2 acidic groups; \(\alpha\)-**CO\({}_{2}\)H** and \(\alpha\)-**NH\({}_{3}\)\({}^{*}\)**.

Figure 1: **H\({}^{+}\) is removed and hence [H\({}^{+}\)] does not change much and pH remains fairly constant.**

**For Information Only**

**Separation of Amino Acids**

* Amino acids can be separated according to their p_I_values using **electrophoresis**.
* When pH of the electrophoresis buffer = p_I_ of the amino acid, the amino acids will be in the zwitterionic form \(\Rightarrow\)**electrically neutral \(\Rightarrow\) does not migrate** under the electric field
* When pH of electrophoresis buffer < p_I_ of the amino acid, the relatively more acidic environment will cause the zwitterion to be protonated \(\Rightarrow\)**positively charge \(\Rightarrow\)** migrate toward the **negative electrode** (cathode)
* When pH of electrophoresis buffer > p_I_ of the amino acid, the relatively more basic environment will cause the zwitterion to be deprotonated \(\Rightarrow\)**negatively charge \(\Rightarrow\)**migrate toward the **positive electrode** (anode)
* To separate the amino acids, the pH of the solution is varied slightly over time and the different amino acids will migrate to the electrodes at different pH values

Amino acids can also be separated by **paper chromatography**. The different amino acids are separated based on different solubilities in a solvent as well as their molecular masses. Amino acids which are more soluble will move faster, and lighter amino acids will move faster than heavier amino acids. A reagent, ninhydrin, is then used to indicate the position of amino acids by the observation of a blue or purple colouration.

**Ion exchange chromatography**

Amino acid mixture is added to column containing cation exchangers

Figure 1: Amino acids move through column at rates determined by their **net charge** at the pH used. With cation exchangers, amino acids with a _more negative net charge_ move _faster_ and elute earlier

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:32]

* The peptide formed may vary in terms of the **number of amino acids**:
* 2 amino acids joined together: dipeptide (only 1 peptide bond)
* 3 amino acids joined together: tripeptide (only 2 peptide bonds)
* many amino acids joined together: polypeptide
* Polypeptides containing more than 40 amino acid residues are termed proteins.

* The formulae of three amino acids are given.

* **Note:**_By convention, the free NH\({}_{2}\) group is on the left and the free CO\({}_{2}\)H group is on the right of the peptide chain._

* **Split CheckQA**
