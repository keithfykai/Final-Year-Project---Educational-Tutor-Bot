\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|} \hline Physical State & Properties & Explanation \\ \hline Liquid & Fixed volume but not fixed shape & \(\bullet\) Moderately strong attractive force prevents them from escaping from their positions. \\  & & However, the particles can move about and slide past each other freely. \\ \hline Able to flow easily & \(\bullet\) The particles are able to move about and slide past each other. \\ \hline Not compressible & \(\bullet\) The particles are arranged quite closely together so there are less spaces between them \\ \hline Take up shape of container & \(\bullet\) Particles are able to move about within confined places \\ \hline Gas & No fixed volume and shape & \(\bullet\) The particles can move freely and randomly in all available spaces. \\  & & The negligible attractive force is not able to hold them in confined spaces. \\ \hline Compressible & \(\bullet\) The particles are far apart from each other, so they are more spaces between them \\ \hline Flow easily & \(\bullet\) Particles move freely at high speeds \\ \hline Take shape and volume of container & \(\bullet\) The particles are able to move freely in all directions to occupy every corner of the container \\ \hline \end{tabular}
