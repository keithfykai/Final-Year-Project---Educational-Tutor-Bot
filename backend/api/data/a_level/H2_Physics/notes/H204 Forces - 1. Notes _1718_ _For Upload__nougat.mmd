### Introduction

One of the main goals of Physics has been to understand the immense variety of forces in the universe in terms of the fewest number of fundamental laws. Today, all forces are understood in terms of just four fundamental interactions as follows:

A force is a push or pull exerted by one body on another. It is an interaction between two bodies or between a body and its environment. Force is a vector quantity and hence it is quantified by having both a magnitude and a direction.

The unit of force is newton (N). 1 N is defined as the magnitude of a force that accelerates a mass of 1 kg at a rate of 1 m s\({}^{-2}\) in the direction of the force.

#### 4.1.3 Force on a Moving Charge in a Magnetic Force

When a charge \(q\) is moving with velocity \(\vec{v}\) at an angle \(\theta\) to the magnetic field \(\vec{B}\), it will experience a magnetic force \(\vec{F}_{B}\) where

\[\framebox{$\vec{F}_{B}=q\vec{v}\times\overline{B}$}\]

Magnitude of \(\left|\vec{F}_{B}\right|=q|\vec{v}|\left|\overline{B}\right|Sin\theta\)

The direction of \(\vec{v}\) follows that of the movement of a positive charges.

#### 4.1.4 Normal Contact Force

Normal contact force is the force that the surface of one body exerts (or pushes) on the surface of another body it is in contact with. Normal contact force is always perpendicular (or normal) to the surfaces in contact with each other.

The diagram below shows the normal contact forces exerted by the table, block A and block C on block B.

#### 4.1.5 Tensile and Compressive Forces

Tension and compression are one dimensional forces exerted along the axis of a body. These forces cause changes to the linear dimension of the body.

A material is in tension when its ends are pulled apart along its axis by equal and opposite external forces.

A material in compression when its ends are pushed together along its axis by equal and opposite external forces.

_Conceptual Question_

A tensile force is exerted at the lower end of a vertical rod of negligible mass along its axis. Is the tension the same throughout the rod?

Yes. If not, it will mean that there will be a resultant force acting various portions of the rod which will in turn cause these portions to experience an acceleration.

#### 4.1.5.1 Hooke's Law

_Hooke's law_ states that the change in length \(x\) of a material is directly proportional to the force \(F\)applied on it, provided that the limit of proportionality is not exceeded.

where \(F\) is the force applied to the material,

\(L_{o}\) is the unstretched length of material

\(L\) is final length of material

\(x\) is the extension / compression of the material (\(L-L_{o}\)) or (\(L_{o}-L\))

\(k\) is the proportionality (force) constant

#### 4.1.6 Friction and Viscous Forces

Friction and viscous forces are known as _dissipative forces_. Some mechanical energy of the object experiencing these forces is dissipated (as heat) to the surroundings.

#### 4.1.6.1 Friction

Friction acts along the surface between two objects whenever one moves or tries to move over the other and in the direction so as to oppose relative motion (or impending relative motion) of the surfaces.

Close examination of the flattest and most highly polished surface reveals hollows and humps more than one hundred atoms high. When one solid is placed on another, contact occurs only at a few places of small areas. The pressure at the points of contact is extremely high and causes the humps to flatten out until the increased area of contact enables the upper solid to be supported. At the points of contact, small, cold-welded 'joints' are formed by the strong adhesive forces between molecules which are very close together. These joints have to be broken before one surface can move over the other.

The value of frictional force is dependent on the types of surfaces in contact with each other, as well as the magnitude of the normal contact force exerted by one surface on the other.

_Static friction_ is the frictional force that acts when there is no relative motion between two surfaces. The magnitude of static friction is self-adjusting such that it is just sufficient to prevent motion, but only up to a maximum value known as the _limiting static friction_.

_Kinetic friction_ is the frictional force that acts when two surfaces slide against each other. For the same two surfaces, the magnitude of kinetic friction is lower than that of the limiting static friction.

#### 4.1.6.2 Viscous Force

In a viscous flow, fluid can be regarded as made up of a stack of very thin layers, each moving with different speeds due to internal friction between the layers. When an object moves relative to a fluid with velocity \(\nu\), the layer of fluid \(P\) adjacent to it is dragged along by it. But the next layer \(Q\) slows layer \(P\) down. There is a gradual decrease in velocity for the layers with distance away from the object. The overall effect is represented by a net retarding force on the object. This retarding force, \(F\) (see diagram below) is acting to the right which opposes motion.

The magnitude of the viscous force increases with the speed of the object. At low speeds, the viscous force acting on the object is proportional to its speed. At high speeds, viscous force is proportional to the square of its speed. The exact relationship depends also on the shape, size, texture of surface and viscosity of fluid.

#### 4.1.7 Aerodynamic Lift

Lift is the force that acts on a body, such as an airplane wing or a helicopter rotor, due to the motion of a body through a fluid. Lift acts in the direction perpendicular to the direction of the relative flow of the surrounding fluid.

When an airplane is flying horizontally, the lift \(L\) is drawn as a single vector on the plane in the upward direction. When an airplane is climbing, descending, or banking in a turn, the lift is tilted with respect to the vertical.

#### 4.1.8 Uphrutst in Fluids *(Not required for 8867 Hi Physics)

#### 4.1.8.1 Fluid Pressure

_Pressure_ is defined as the normal force acting per unit area and it is a scalar quantity.

Considering a cross-sectional area \(A\) in a fluid at a depth \(h\) below the surface of the fluid:

If the density of the fluid is \(p\) and the volume of the column of fluid above the area \(A\) is \(V\), then the pressure \(P\) on \(A\) due to the fluid at this depth \(h\) is given by

\[P =\frac{\text{Normal force exerted by fluid column on }A}{A}\] \[=\frac{\text{Weight of fluid column}}{A}\] \[=\frac{mg}{A}=\frac{(\rho V)g}{A}=\frac{\rho(An)g}{A}=h\rho g\]

Hence fluid pressure \(P\) at a depth of \(h\) is given by

\[P=h\,\rho\,g\]

where \(p\) is the density of the fluid.

The absolute (total) pressure at this depth includes the over-bearing pressure acting on the open surface of the fluid. For example, if an atmospheric pressure P\({}_{o}\) acts on the open surface of the fluid,

\[P_{absolute}=P_{o}+hpg\]

**Example 1**:

1. What is the upthrust on a human body of volume 7.4 x 10\({}^{-2}\) m\({}^{3}\) when it is totally immersed in 1. air of density 1.3 kg m\({}^{-3}\) 2. sea water of density 1030 kg m\({}^{-3}\)? Since the body is totally immersed in the fluid, the volume of body would equal the volume of fluid displaced. 1. By Archimedes' Principle: \(U\)=\(\rho_{fluid}\)\(g\)V\({}_{fluid}\) displaced =(1.3)(9.81)(7.4x10\({}^{2}\)) = 0.94 N 2. By Archimedes' Principle: \(U\)=\(\rho_{fluid}\)\(g\)V\({}_{fluid}\) displaced =(1030)(9.81)(7.4x10\({}^{2}\)) = 750 N 2. Hence explain why, the upthrust acting on a human body when in air is normally ignored. The average person weighs about 600 N and the upthrust in air of about 1 N is less than 0.2 % of the weight of the person, making it negligible.

**Example 2**:

1. What weight of water would this boat displace if it were floating in salt water of density 1024 kg m\({}^{-3}\)? For the boat to float, the upthrust on the boat must be equal to the weight of boat W whether in salt or fresh water. Hence weight of salt water displaced = 35.6 kN 2. What is the volume of salt water displaced? 1. Uphrust = weight of salt water displaced. 2. \(\rho_{s}\)V\({}_{s}\)g = 35.6 kN 10\({}^{3}\) 2. \(\rm V_{s}\) = 35.4 m\({}^{3}\)An object floats because the upthrust acting on it is equal and opposite to the weight of the object. The object sinks when the upthrust acting on it is less than its weight. A ship made of steel can float because its internal hollow volume displaces a large amount of water and produces sufficient upthrust to keep the ship floating.

_Example 3_

A student rolled a lump of plasticene into the shape of an air-tight sphere. He dropped the plasticene into a bucket of water and observed that the plasticene sphere sank to the bottom of the water.

Show that the density of the plasticene must be greater than the density of water.

As the plasticene sinks, this implies that the weight of the plasticene is larger than the upthrust on it by the water.

By Archimedes' Principle, U = W\({}_{\text{fluid displaced}}\)

Therefore,

\(\text{W}_{\text{plasticene}}\) > W\({}_{\text{fluid displaced}}\)

\(\text{P}_{\text{plasticene}}\) \(\text{V}_{\text{plasticene}}\) > \(\text{P}_{\text{water}}\)gV\({}_{\text{water displaced}}\)

Since when the plasticene is fully submerged, V\({}_{\text{plasticene}}\) = V\({}_{\text{water displaced}}\)

\(\text{P}_{\text{plasticene}}\) > \(\text{P}_{\text{water}}\)

### Free-Body Diagrams

A _free-body diagram_ of a body (or system) shows all external forces acting on the body (or system). In the consideration of both static and dynamic problems, it is necessary to draw the free-body diagram of the appropriate body or system that is being identified for analysis.

Besides the magnitude and direction of a force, it is also important that its point of exertion and line of action are also identified. The point of exertion of a force is the point at which the forces acting on a system seem to be concentrated, such that the forces can be replaced by a single force, equivalent to the sum of the forces, acting at that point. The line of action of a force is the line along which the force vector acts. Both are important in determining the equilibrium and stability of a body or system that the force exerts upon.

In drawing a free-body diagram, one should

1. identify the body (or system) that is being considered and draw a simple sketch representing the body (or system).
2. mark and label on the sketch from (1), all external forces acting on the body (or system), paying attention to the point of exertion and line of action of each force.
3. determine the magnitude of the forces (if necessary) that can be directly calculated via a formula.

One salient point that helps in determining whether a force is to be included on a free-body diagram is to identify the origins of that force, i.e. the body exerting the force as well as the body experiencing the force. This is where the understanding of Newton's 3\({}^{\text{rd}}\) Law of Motion is especially important.

_Newton's 3\({}^{\text{rd}}\) Law of Motion_ states that when body A exerts a force on body B. body B will exert a force of equal magnitude but of opposite direction on body A. One implication of this law is that the free-body diagram of body A (or that of body B) should not have both "action-reaction" forces drawn on it.

2. the resultant torque on it must be zero about all axes * there is no angular acceleration of the object (i.e. it is not rotating at an increasing angular speed) and the object is said to be in _rotational equilibrium_. * _Method: Principle of Moments_ The _Principle of Moments_ states that when a body is in equilibrium, the sum of clockwise moments about any point must be equal to the sum of anticlockwise moments about the same point. * When the resultant torque of an object is zero about all axes, it further implies that the sum of moments of all forces acting on the object would be zero about any point. Hence, the principle of moments may be used deal with objects in rotational equilibrium. It should be noted that in any given situation, one will require the same number of unique equations as there are unknowns in order for all unknowns to be evaluated mathematically. * _Example 5_ The force diagram below represents a boat that is being lifted by two ropes so that the boat remains horizontal and travels vertically upwards at a constant speed after leaving the water. * The weight of the boat is 15000 N. Determine the tensions \(T_{t}\) and \(T_{2}\) in the ropes 1 and 2 respectively. * Taking moments about B: \(\sum M_{b}=0\) \(T_{t}\) (2.00) - 15000 (1.25) = 0 \(T_{t}=9.4\times 10^{3}\) N * Taking moments about A: \(\sum M_{A}=0\) \(T_{2}\) (2.00) - 15000 (0.75) = 0 \(T_{2}=5.6\times 10^{3}\) N * _T_{2}

### Special Considerations of Systems in Equilibrium

#### 4.5.1 Systems involving Two Coplanar Forces

For a rigid body at equilibrium subjected to coplanar forces acting at only two points, the two forces must

1. have the same magnitude,
2. have the same line of action,
3. be opposite in direction.

#### 4.5.2 Systems involving Three Coplanar Forces

For a rigid body at equilibrium subjected to coplanar forces acting at only three points, the lines of action of the three forces must **either** be

1. concurrent (intersect at a point) **or**
2. parallel

_Conceptual Question_

A body is acted upon by 3 coplanar forces.

If the lines of action of 3 forces are concurrent, the 3 forces must be able to maintain the body in equilibrium. Is this statement TRUE or **FALSE**?

If the lines of action of 3 forces are parallel, the 3 forces must be able to maintain the body in equilibrium. Is this statement TRUE or **FALSE**?

**Example 6**: The diagram below shows a heavy flagpole PQ hinged at a vertical wall at end P and held by a wire connected to the end Q and a point R on the wall. The weight of the flagpole is \(W\) and the tension in the wire is \(T\).

What is the direction of the force exerted by the wall on the flagpole?
