## Appendix A Magnetic Field

* is a region of space in which a magnetic material may experience a force.
* magnetic field may exist due to existence of either _permanent magnet_ or _current-carrying wire_.

## Appendix B Magnetic Flux Density

* The magnetic flux density of a magnetic field is numerically equal to the force per unit length per unit current of a long straight current carrying conductor placed at right angles to a uniform magnetic field.
* The SI unit of the Magnetic Flux Density is the **Tesla (T)**

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:6]

## Chapter 1 Magnetic Field Lines

* lines representing magnetic fields where each line has specific direction.
* The direction of a magnetic field line at any point in the field shows the direction of the force that a 'free' magnetic _north_ pole would experience at that point

### 1. They are imaginary

2. By convention, they leave **N** pole and enter **S** pole of a magnet.

* Note: Unlike electric field lines, magnetic field lines have no start and end point. They continue to go from **S** pole to **N** pole creating closed loops.

## Chapter 2 Characteristics

3. They do not touch or intersect one another

4. Can be straight or curved lines. The tangent to a curved filed line at a point indicates the direction of magnetic field at that point.

Effect of Ferrous Core

Inserting a ferrous core into a solenoid strengthens the magnetic field inside the solenoid.

This ferrous core can be made of iron, cobalt, or nickel.

Ferrous core becomes magnet when exposed to magnetic field.

A typical MRI solenoid has length of 1.2 m and diameter of 1.0 m which produces magnetic field of 1.0 T.

## Fore on a Moving Charge

* A current-carrying wire can experience a force when placed in a magnetic field, a moving charge.
* Since current is a wire consists of moving electric charges, we expect a moving charge in a magnetic field to experience a magnetic force as well

* A moving charge constitutes a current of \(I=q/t\)
* Assume the particle travels a distance \(L\) in time \(t\) such that its speed \(v=L/t\)

The force on the charge is given by

\(F=BIL\sin\theta\)

\(F=B\left(\frac{q}{t}\right)L\sin\theta=Bq\left(\frac{L}{t}\right)\sin\theta\)

(a) Solution:

\[|F_{a}|=|F_{b}|=\frac{\mu_{0}I_{b}I_{a}L}{2\pi r}=\frac{(4\pi\times 10^{-7})(2 )(2)(3)}{2(3.14)(2.5\times 10^{-3})}\]

\[|F|=9.6\times 10^{-4}N\]

(b) The current flows in the same direction so force is attractive.

**Breatee Example 7**

The solar wind is a stream of energized, charged particles, primarily electrons and protons, released from the upper atmosphere of the Sun. Suppose a proton is travelling toward the earth's equator at a speed of 900 km/s. At this point, the magnetic field of the earth is 50 \(\mu T\) directed parallel to the earth's surface. Find the direction and magnitude of the force on the proton.

When viewed in a 2D world map, the particle motion points into the page.

**Solution:**

\(\theta=90^{\circ}\) since \(v\) and \(B\) are perpendicular

\(F=qvB\sin\theta\)

\(F=(1.6\times 10^{-19})(900\times 10^{3})(5\times 10^{-5})\sin 0\)

\(F=7.2\times 10^{-18}N\)

When viewed in a world map, B is due north (upwards). Using Fleming's RHL, the force is due East (to the right).
