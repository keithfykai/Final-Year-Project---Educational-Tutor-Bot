**PRE-REQUUSITE KNOWLEDGE**

Candidates should be able to describe and explain redox processes in terms of electron transfer and/or of changes in oxidation number (oxidation state).

_Please refer to Lecture Notes 1b Redox Reactions pages 2 - 8 to refresh your understanding on redox reactions and how to balance redox equations._

An oxidation number is a number which is assigned to an element in a substance to show its state of oxidation.

Note: The oxidation number of an element in a substance is related to the number of electrons lost, gained, or shared as a result of chemical bonding.

* A positive change in oxidation state indicates that oxidation (loss of electrons) has occurred e.g. +1, +2.
* A negative change in oxidation state indicates that reduction (gain of electrons) has occurred e.g. -1, -2.

**Rules for Assigning Oxidation Number**

1. The oxidation number of an atom in the elemental state = 0.

Example: O.N. of Ca, \(\mathrm{I_{2}}\), \(\mathrm{S_{8}}\) or \(\mathrm{P_{4}}\) = 0
2. The oxidation number of a monoatomic ion is simply the charge on the ion.

Example: O.N. of C\(I^{-}\) = -1; O.N. of Ca\({}^{2+}\) = +2
3. The sum of the oxidation numbers of all the atoms or ions in an electrically neutral compound = 0.

Examples: CaBr\({}_{2}\) +2 +2 (-1) = 0

Al\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{3}\) 2(+3) +3 (-2) = 0

CO\({}_{2}\) +4+2(-2)=0

4. In polyatomic ions, the sum of the oxidation numbers = the charge on the ion.

Examples: SO\({}_{4}\)\({}^{2-}\): The sum of the oxidation numbers (O.N of S = +6, O.N. of O = -2)

= +6 +4(-2) = -2 = charge on the ion

CrCl\({}_{6}\)\({}^{3-}\): The sum of the oxidation numbers (O.N of Cr = +3, O.N. of C\(I\) = -1)

= +3 +6(-1) = -3 = charge on the ion

1. In a covalent bond, the more electronegative atom has the negative oxidation number while the less electronegative atom has the positive oxidation number.

* Electronegativity is the ability of an atom in a molecule to attract shared electrons in a bond.
* Electronegativity values: F > O > N > C > H Examples: O.N. of F in OF\({}_{2}\) = -1 O.N. of O in OF\({}_{2}\) = +26. The oxidation numbers of groups 1, 2, 13 and 17 elements, hydrogen and oxygen are listed in the table. Note the exceptions.

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|} \hline
**Element** & **O.N.** & **Examples** & **Exception** \\ \hline Group 1 (e.g. Na) & Always +1 & NaBr & **–** \\ \hline Group 2 (e.g. Mg) & Always +2 & MgO & **–** \\ \hline Group 13 (e.g. Al) & Always +3 & Al\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{3}\) & **–** \\ \hline Group 17 & Usually -1 & NaF & Except when forming compounds with \\  & (F is always -1) & & more electronegative atom \\  & & & E.g. & O.N. for C/I in C/O\({}_{2}\) = +4 \\  & & & O.N. for C/I in in C/F = +1 \\ \hline Hydrogen & Usually +1 & HC/ & -1 in metal hydrides such as NaH \\  & & & (since Na is more electropositive than \\  & & & H) \\ \hline Oxygen & Usually -2 & CaO & -1 in peroxides* such as H\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{2}\) \\  & & & (hydrogen peroxide) and BaO\({}_{2}\) (barium \\  & & & peroxide) \\  & & & **’Peroxide ion is O\({}_{2}\)2-** \\  & & & -0.5 in KO\({}_{2}\) (potassium superoxide*) \\  & & & **’Superoxide ion is O\({}_{2}\)-** \\  & & & +2 in OF\({}_{2}\) (fluorine monoxide) since F \\  & & & is more electronegative than O \\ \hline \end{tabular}

### Measurement of Electrode Potentials

1. The electrode potential, \(E\), of an electrode (half-cell) i.e. its absolute potential, cannot be measured directly. Another electrode is required, and this new electrode will introduce its own potential. The potential difference between two electrode systems can be measured directly. What we need to do is to assign one electrode system as a reference, and measure all other electrode systems against this standard.
2. It has been found that electrode potential is dependent on the following conditions: i. temperature, ii. concentration of ions in aqueous solution, iii. partial pressure of any gas involved in the reaction.
3. Hence, the measurement of the standard electrode potential of a half-cell requires: i. standard conditions, ii. a standard electrode as a reference electrode,

#### b.2.1 Standard Conditions

**Temperature**: 25 \({}^{\circ}\)C or 298 K

**Pressure** (of any gases involved): 1 bar

**Concentration** (of _all_ ions involved in half eqn): 1 mol dm\({}^{-3}\)

Note: The symbol \({}^{\text{\textminus}}\)\({}^{\text{\textminus}}\)\({}^{\text{\textminus}}\) denotes standard conditions and is written as a superscript.

#### b.2.2 Standard Hydrogen Electrode

Candidates should be able to describe the standard hydrogen electrode.

1. The standard hydrogen electrode (S.H.E.) consists of i. a platinum electrode coated with finely divided platinum ii. immersed in a solution where [H\({}^{+}\)] = 1 mol dm\({}^{-3}\), iii. hydrogen gas at 1 bar is bubbled over the platinum electrode, iv. temperature is kept at 25 \({}^{\circ}\)C or 298 K.

Platinum is used because it is inert. The electrode allows H\({}_{2}\)(g) to be adsorbed on its surface and establish the following equilibrium: \[\textbf{2H^{+}(aq)+2e^{-}\rightleftharpoons H_{2}(g),\qquad\textbf{E^{0}=0.00 V}}\] A potential develops on the surface of the platinum electrode and it is _arbitrarily_ assigned a value of 0.00 V. Note: i. The platinum electrode is coated with finely divided platinum to increase the surface area of the electrode so that equilibrium between H\({}_{2}\)(g) and H\({}^{+}\)(aq) can be established rapidly. ii. Other reference electrodes also exist e.g. the calomel electrode (\(E^{\text{e}}\) = +0.244 V) and the silver/silver chloride electrode (\(E^{\text{e}}\) = +0.199 V).

### Common Half-cell Systems

The following are three common types of half-cell systems:

\begin{tabular}{l l l l} \hline
**i. metal / metal ion** & **ii. gas / ion** & **iii. ion / ion** \\  & e.g. Cu\({}^{2+}\)(aq) + 2e\({}^{-}\rightleftharpoons Cu(s)\) & e.g. C\(l_{2}\)(g) + 2e\({}^{-}\rightleftharpoons 2C\)/(aq) & e.g. Fe\({}^{3+}\)(aq) + e\({}^{-}\rightleftharpoons Fe^{2+}(aq)\) \\  & & & \\ \end{tabular}

\begin{tabular}{l l l l l} \hline
**Cu\({}^{2+}\)(aq) / Cu(s) half-cell** & **C\(l_{2}\)(g) / C\(l\)(aq) half-cell** & **Fe\({}^{3+}\)(aq) / Fe\({}^{2+}\)(aq) half-cell** \\ \hline \end{tabular}

Note: i. & Each system primarily contains the same element in different oxidation states. ii. & In the absence of a metal in the half-cell, platinum is used as the inert electrode.

Exercise 3

The standard redox potential for the half-cell reaction

\[\text{Fe}^{3+}+\text{e}^{-}=\text{Fe}^{2+}\text{ is +0.77 V}.\]

Which cell would be used to determine this standard value?

AFe electrode in 1 mol dm\({}^{-3}\) Fe\({}^{3+}\) against Fe electrode in 1 mol dm\({}^{-3}\) Fe\({}^{2+}\).

BPt electrode in 1 mol dm\({}^{-3}\) Fe\({}^{3+}\) against Pt electrode in 1 mol dm\({}^{-3}\) Fe\({}^{2+}\).

CFe electrode in a solution containing 1 mol dm\({}^{-3}\) Fe\({}^{3+}\) and 1 mol dm\({}^{-3}\) Fe\({}^{2+}\) against a standard hydrogen electrode.

DPt electrode in a solution containing 1 mol dm\({}^{-3}\) Fe\({}^{3+}\) and 1 mol dm\({}^{-3}\) Fe\({}^{2+}\) against a standard hydrogen electrode. J95/IV/7

### Standard Electrode Potential, \(\mathbf{E^{\circ}}\)

Candidates should be able to define the terms:

(i)standard electrode (redox) potential

(ii)standard cell potential

1. If a half-cell is connected to a hydrogen electrode (which is also a half-cell), the resultant _cell_ has a potential difference i.e. electromotive force (e.m.f.) which can be measured by a voltmeter.
2. If this e.m.f. is measured under standard conditions, its value is known as the _standard electrode potential_, \(\mathbf{E^{\circ}}\), of the half-cell.

**Definition:**

The _standard electrode potential_ of a half-cell is the electromotive force, measured at 298 K, between the half-cell and the standard hydrogen electrode, in which the concentration of any reacting species in solution is 1 mol dm\({}^{-3}\) and any gaseous species is at a pressure of 1 bar.

Note: _Standard electrode potential_ is commonly written as _standard reduction potential_ or _standard redox potential_.

3. The electrode potentials of half-cells, \(E\), are often called _redox_ potentials. By convention, a standard electrode potential always refers to the half-reaction written as a reduction. redox potentials are written as _reduction_ processes. \[\begin{array}{c}\text{Zn}^{2+}(\text{aq})+2\text{e}^{-}\\ \text{Cu}^{2+}(\text{aq})+2\text{e}^{-}\\ \end{array}\rightleftarrows\text{Zn}(\text{s}),\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad E^{ \circ}=-0.76\text{ V}\\ \text{Cu}(\text{s}),\qquad\qquad\qquad E^{\circ}=+0.34\text{ V}\end{array}\] When standard conditions are employed, the potentials are termed \[\begin{array}{c}\text{standard electrode potentials}\\ \text{standard reduction potentials}\\ \text{standard reduction potentials}\end{array}\qquad\qquad\qquad E^{\circ}\]
4. The standard electrode potential is a measure of the tendency of _reduction_ (i.e. gaining electrons) occurring. The more positive the value of \(E^{\circ}\), the more _likely_ reduction is to occur (w.r.t. the standard hydrogen electrode.)
5. \(E^{\circ}\) values also give an indication of the _position of equilibrium_ of a reaction. A more _positive_\(E^{\circ}\) value indicates that the position of equilibrium lies to the _right_. A more _negative_\(E^{\circ}\) value indicates that the position of equilibrium lies to the _left_. 

6. Whenever the direction of a half-reaction is reversed, the sign of \(E^{\circ}\) must also be reversed. The value of \(E^{\circ}\) is not affected even if the half-reaction is multiplied by coefficients (unlike for \(\Delta H\) in Energetics). E.g. \[\begin{array}{c}\text{Zn}^{2+}(\text{aq})+2\text{e}^{-}\\ \text{Zn}(\text{s})\\ \text{2Zn}^{2+}(\text{aq})+4\text{e}^{-}\\ \end{array}\qquad\begin{array}{c}\text{Zn}(\text{s}),\\ \text{Zn}^{2+}(\text{aq})+2\text{e}^{-}\\ \text{Zn}(\text{s}),\end{array}\qquad\qquad\begin{array}{c}\text{$E^{\circ}=-0.76 \text{ V}$}\\ \text{$E^{\circ}=+0.76\text{ V}$}\\ \text{$E^{\circ}=-0.76\text{ V}$}\end{array}\] _Note: Doubling the coefficients does not double the \(E^{\circ}\) value as the standard electrode potential is the ratio of energy to charge. When we change the coefficients, the amount increases but the energy and charge increase proportionately, so their ratio stays the same. This is similar to the density, which does not change as the amount of substance increases because the mass and volume increase proportionately._

### Measurement of Standard Electrode (Redox) Potentials, \(E^{\circ}\)

Candidates should be able to describe methods used to measure the standard electrode potentials of:

(i) metals or non-metals in contact with their ions in aqueous solution

(ii) ions of the same element in different oxidation states.

* [Step 1:] Connect the given half-cell to the S.H.E. and ensure that all concentrations of solutions are 1 mol dm\({}^{-3}\), the temperature is 298 K and the pressure of gases (if any) is 1 bar.
* [Step 2:] Connect the two solutions in the two half-cells with a salt bridge, commonly made up of saturated potassium nitrate solution.
* [Step 3:] Measure the potential difference between the given half-cell and the S.H.E. using a high-resistance voltmeter. The value shown on the voltmeter is the standard electrode potential (or e.m.f.) of the half-cell concerned.
* [Note:] The first reading shown on the voltmeter the moment the two half-cells are connected is the actual e.m.f. If current is allowed to flow in a closed circuit, chemical reactions will occur and the concentration of the reactants will start to decrease and will no longer be at standard conditions. The reading on the voltmeter will eventually drop to zero when the cell goes flat (i.e. the system has reached equilibrium and there is no longer any potential difference between the two half-cells).
* [(i)] **metal / metal ion system** e.g. Cu\({}^{2+}\)(aq) / Cu(s) half-cell

At standard conditions, the reading on the voltmeter gives the standard electrode potential of the Cu\({}^{2+}\)(aq) \(|\) Cu(s) half-cell:

\[\mbox{Cu}^{2+}\mbox{(aq)}+2\mbox{e}^{-}\rightleftharpoons\mbox{Cu(s)}\qquad E ^{\circ}=\mbox{ +0.34 V}\]

Note: The voltmeter reading gives an indication of the direction of electron flow. A positive value in the above set-up shows that electrons flow from the H\({}^{+}\)(aq) \(|\) H\({}_{2}\)(g) half-cell to the Cu\({}^{2+}\)(aq) \(|\) Cu(s) half-cell; i.e. Cu\({}^{2+}\) is more easily reduced than H\({}^{+}\) and the reduction potential for the Cu\({}^{2+}\)(aq) \(|\) Cu(s) half-cell is +0.34 V.

_You need to be able to draw the experimental setup for measuring standard electrode potentials._At the standard conditions, the reading on the voltmeter gives the standard electrode potential of the Zn\({}^{2+}\)(aq) \(|\) Zn(s) half-cell:

\[\text{Zn}^{2+}\text{(aq)}+2\text{e}^{-}\rightleftharpoons Zn(s)\qquad E^{\text{e}}\,=\,-0.76\ \text{V}\]

Note: The voltmeter reading gives an indication of the direction of electron flow. A negative value in the above set-up shows that electrons flow from the Zn\({}^{2+}\)(aq) \(|\) Zn(s) half-cell to the H\({}^{+}\)(aq) \(|\) H\({}_{2}\)(g) half-cell; i.e. H\({}^{+}\) is more easily reduced than Zn\({}^{2+}\) and the reduction potential for the Zn\({}^{2+}\)(aq) \(|\) Zn(s) half-cell is -0.76 V.

## Appendix D Standard Cell Potentials, \(E^{9}_{\rm cell}\)

### Electrochemical (Voltaic) Cell

1. When a strip of zinc foil is dipped into copper(II) sulfate solution for some time, it is found that some zinc has dissolved and a brown deposit of copper metal is formed on the zinc foil. The reaction is exothermic and heat is given out. A redox reaction has occurred and this can be represented by the equation: \[\rm Zn\ (s)+Cu^{2+}\ (aq)\longrightarrow Zn^{2+}\ (aq)+Cu\ (s)\]
2. In the reaction, electrons are basically moving from Zn atoms to Cu\({}^{2+}\) ions via the metal-solution interface. By simply "_extending_ the route of electron travel", the chemical energy of this reaction could be converted to electrical energy.
3. This is explained by making use of the inherent _potential difference_ between the zinc half-cell and the copper half-cell. This cell is an example of an electrochemical (voltaic) cell or simply, _batteries_. (This Zn-Cu cell is also known as a Daniell cell.)

### The Daniell Cell

1. The Daniell cell is made up of a Zn\({}^{2+}\) | Zn half-cell is more negative, Zn is more easily oxidised than Cu, i.e. Zn has a higher tendency to lose electrons compared to Cu. Alternatively, we can say that since the \(E^{\circ}\) of Cu\({}^{2+}\) | Cu half-cell is more positive, Cu\({}^{2+}\) is more easily reduced than Zn\({}^{2+}\), i.e. Cu\({}^{2+}\) has a higher tendency to gain electrons compared to Zn\({}^{2+}\).
3. Zn loses 2 electrons and enters the solution as Zn\({}^{2+}\): \[\text{Zn(s)}\!\longrightarrow\!\text{Zn}^{2+}\text{(aq)}+2\text{e}^{-}\qquad \qquad\text{(anode, oxidation)}\] Cu\({}^{2+}\) ions in the solution near the copper metal surface will take up electrons and are reduced to Cu metal: \[\text{Cu}^{2+}\text{(aq)}+2\text{e}^{-}\!\longrightarrow\!\text{Cu(s)}\qquad \qquad\text{(cathode, reduction)}\] Overall redox equation: \[\text{Cu}^{2+}\text{(aq)}+\text{Zn(s)}\!\longrightarrow\!\text{Cu(s)}+\text{ Zn}^{2+}\text{(aq)}\] **Note:** For the half-equations and overall redox equation, use '\(\longrightarrow\)' instead of '\(\rightleftharpoons\)'.
4. Electrons leave the Zn electrode and travel via the connecting wire (i.e. the external circuit) to the Cu electrode (i.e. direction of electron flow is from Zn to Cu). Note: Current (\(I\)) is said to flow from the Cu electrode to the Zn electrode i.e. in a direction opposite to electron flow.
5. The salt bridge completes the circuit. (see the next section D.3)
6. The electrode where oxidation takes place is called the anode. (**An Ox**). It is the negative electrode (i.e. the (-) terminal of a battery) since electrons are produced at the anode and exit the cell via the anode. In the Daniell cell, the Zn electrode is the anode. The electrode where reduction takes place is called the cathode. (**Red Cat**). It is the positive electrode (i.e. the (+) terminal of a battery) since electrons are absorbed at the cathode when they re-enter the cell via the cathode. In this case, the Cu electrode is the cathode.

In general, the half-cell with a more positive \(E^{\rm e}\) is the reduction half-cell and the half-cell with a less positive (or more negative) \(E^{\rm e}\) is the oxidation half-cell. This is because the more positive the \(E^{\rm e}\) value, the more readily reduction occurs.

### Salt Bridge

For the electrochemical cell, electrons flow in the external circuit from the anode to the cathode.

The two half-cells are connected internally by a salt bridge - a U-tube that contains an electrolytic solution, such as KNO\({}_{3}\), whose ions do not react with other ions in the cell or with electrodes.

1. [label=0., ref=1]
2. _To maintain electrical (charge) neutrality of each half-cell_ In the Daniell Cell, as Zn\({}^{2+}\) continues to be produced, the Zn\({}^{2+}\) ion solution builds up a positive charge. Similarly, as Cu\({}^{2+}\) deposit as metal atoms on the copper electrode, the solution depletes in positive charge (i.e. becomes increasingly negative since SO\({}_{4}\)\({}^{2-}\) remain in solution). [label=0., ref=1] The ions in the salt bridge migrate so as to _neutralise the increasing charge_ in the two half-cells. In the salt bridge, cations migrate to the cathode while anions migrate to the anode. The salt bridge provides positive ions (e.g. K\({}^{*}\)) which enter the Cu\({}^{2+}\) solution and negative ions (e.g. NO\({}_{3}\)\({}^{-}\)) which enter the Zn\({}^{2+}\) solution.
3. _To complete the circuit by allowing ions to flow without the mixing of electrolytes._

### Standard Cell Potential, \(E^{\rm o}_{\rm cell}\)

Candidates should be able to calculate a standard cell potential by combining two standard electrode potentials.

1. [label=0., ref=1]
2. An electrochemical (or voltaic) cell converts the energy change of a spontaneous reaction (chemical energy) into electrical energy. This electrical energy can do work and is proportional to the difference in potential between the two electrodes. _(For the applications of electrochemical cells, refer to Section E - Fuel cells and other types of cells)_ The standard cell potential, \(E^{\rm o}_{\rm cell}\), is the _potential difference_ between two half-cells under standard conditions. It gives a measure of the e.m.f. (electromotive force) of the cell.

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:18]

### Effects of Changing Conditions on Cell Potential, \(E_{\text{cell}}\)

Candidates should be able to predict qualitatively how the value of an electrode potential varies with the concentration of the aqueous ion.

1. Under non-standard conditions, \(E\neq E^{\circ}\)
2. Consider the half-cell: \(\text{Fe}^{3+}\left(\text{aq}\right)+\text{e}^{-}\rightleftharpoons\text{Fe}^{2+} \left(\text{aq}\right)\), \(E^{\circ}=+0.77\) V * If the [Fe\({}^{3+}\left(\text{aq}\right)\)] is increased such that it becomes greater than 1 mol dm\({}^{-3}\) (i.e. conditions are no longer standard), the position of equilibrium will shift to the right and \(E>+0.77\) V (i.e. \(E>E^{\circ}\)). * If the [Fe\({}^{3+}\left(\text{aq}\right)\)] is decreased such that it becomes less than 1 mol dm\({}^{-3}\) (i.e. conditions are no longer standard), the position of equilibrium will shift to the left and \(E<+0.77\) V (i.e. \(E<E^{\circ}\)).
3. Similarly, for an electrochemical (voltaic) cell (i.e. made up of two half-cells) under non-standard conditions, \(E_{\text{cell}}\neq E^{\circ}_{\text{cell}}\).

**Exercise 8**

Consider the electrochemical cell made up of the following half-cells:

\(\text{Cu}^{2+}\left(\text{aq}\right)+2\text{e}^{-}\rightleftharpoons\text{Cu }\left(\text{s}\right)\), \(E^{\circ}=+0.34\) V

\(\text{Fe}^{3+}\left(\text{aq}\right)+\text{e}^{-}\rightleftharpoons\text{Fe}^{2+} \left(\text{aq}\right)\), \(E^{\circ}=+0.77\) V * Calculate \(E^{\circ}_{\text{cell}}\) and write the overall equation of the electrochemical cell.

The above electrochemical cell is initially set up under standard conditions. The following changes are made to the electrochemical cell. Predict whether the new \(E_{\text{cell}}\) is higher or lower than \(E^{\text{e}}_{\text{cell}}\).

### Relationship between \(E^{\circ}\) and Gibbs Free Energy

Candidates should be able to state and apply the relationship \(\Delta G^{\circ}\) = \(-nFE^{\circ}\) to electrochemical cells, including the calculation of \(E^{\circ}\) for combined half reactions.

1. In Energetics II (Lecture Notes 5b), the concept of using the change in Gibbs free energy, \(\Delta G^{\circ}\), to predict the spontaneity of reaction was introduced. If \(\Delta G^{\circ}\) < 0, the reaction is said to be spontaneous; if \(\Delta G^{\circ}\) > 0, the reaction is said to be non-spontaneous; if \(\Delta G^{\circ}\) = 0, the reaction is said to be at equilibrium. The relationship between \(E^{\circ}\) and \(\Delta G^{\circ}\) is: \[\Delta G^{\circ}=-nFE^{\circ}\] units of \(\Delta G^{\circ}\) is J **mol**-1 and \(E^{\circ}\) is **V** where \(n\) is the number of moles of electrons transferred in the redox equation \(F\) is the Faraday constant, 96500 C mol-1 _(given in section 1 of Data Booklet)_
2. The signs of \(\Delta G^{\circ}\) and \(E^{\circ}\) are opposite for any reaction. i. A spontaneous reaction has a negative Gibbs free energy change (\(\Delta G^{\circ}\) < 0) and positive cell potential (\(E^{\circ}\)\({}_{\rm cell}\) > 0). ii. A non-spontaneous reaction has a positive Gibbs free energy change (\(\Delta G^{\circ}\) > 0) and negative cell potential (\(E^{\circ}\)\({}_{\rm cell}\) < 0). Under standard conditions, \[E^{\circ}\)\(>\) 0; \(\Delta G^{\circ}\)\(<\) 0 \(\Rightarrow\) reaction is thermodynamically feasible and spontaneous. \[E^{\circ}\)\({}_{\rm cell}\) = 0; \(\Delta G^{\circ}\)\(=\) 0 \(\Rightarrow\) reaction is at equilibrium \[E^{\circ}\)\({}_{\rm cell}\) < 0; \(\Delta G^{\circ}\)\(>\) 0 \(\Rightarrow\) reaction is not thermodynamically feasible and not spontaneous.

**Exercise 11**

By referring to the following reduction half-equations,

\begin{tabular}{l c} C\(l_{2}\) + 2e\({}^{-}\)\(\rightleftharpoons\) 2C\(l^{-}\) & +1.36 V \\ Cr\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{7}\)\({}^{2-}\) + 14H\({}^{+}\) + 6e\({}^{-}\)\(\rightleftharpoons\) 2C\({}^{3+}\) + 7H\({}_{2}\)O & +1.33 V \\ O\({}_{2}\) + 4H\({}^{+}\) + 4e\({}^{-}\)\(\rightleftharpoons\) 2H\({}_{2}\)O & +1.23 V \\ Fe\({}^{3+}\) + e\({}^{-}\) = Fe\({}^{2+}\) & +0.77 V \\ I\({}_{2}\) + 2e\({}^{-}\)\(\rightleftharpoons\) 2I\({}^{-}\) & +0.54 V \\ O\({}_{2}\) + 2H\({}_{2}\)O + 4e\({}^{-}\)\(\rightleftharpoons\) 4OH\({}^{-}\) & +0.40 V \\ \end{tabular}

tick reactions that are spontaneous and cross out those that are not when the following are mixed:

\begin{tabular}{l c c} (a) & I\({}_{2}\) and Fe\({}^{2+}\) & (c) & C\(l^{-}\) and Cr\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{7}\)\({}^{2-}\) / H\({}^{+}\) & (e) & I\({}^{-}\) and O\({}_{2}\) / H\({}_{2}\)O \\ (b) & I\({}^{-}\) and Fe\({}^{3+}\) & (d) & I\({}^{-}\) and O\({}_{2}\) / H\({}^{+}\) & \\ Hence, explain why: & & & \\ \end{tabular}

\begin{tabular}{l c} (c) & Potassium iodide solution turns yellow in the presence of acid. \\ Reason: & \\ \end{tabular}

### Limitations of Spontaneity Predictions Based on \(E^{\mathbf{o}}_{\text{cell}}\)

Candidates should be able to understand the limitations in the use of standard cell potentials to predict the spontaneity of a reaction.

1. 
\begin{tabular}{l} Kinetic factor is not taken into consideration: \\ \(E^{\mathbf{e}}_{\text{cell}}\) is a measure of the position of equilibrium but gives no indication of rate. \\ \end{tabular}

In the reaction of H\({}_{2}\) with Cu\({}^{2+}\), \(E^{\mathbf{e}}_{\text{cell}}\) = +0.34 - 0.00 = +0.34V \\ \(\Rightarrow\) reaction is thermodynamically feasible and the reaction \\ Cu\({}^{2+}\)(aq) + H\({}_{2}\)(g) \(\rightarrow\) Cu(s) + 2H\({}^{+}\)(aq) is expected to occur spontaneously. \\ \end{tabular}

However, no reaction takes place when H\({}_{2}\)(g) is passed into CuSO\({}_{4}\)(aq) as the activation energy for the reaction is high. Hence, even though the reaction is thermodynamically feasible, it is kinetically not feasible.

Reaction takes place under non-standard conditions.

\(E^{\circ}_{\rm coll}\) is the cell potential at standard conditions. Predictions using \(E^{\circ}_{\rm coll}\) under non-standard conditions may not be valid.

In the reaction between Cu\({}^{2+}\) and V\({}^{3+}\),

Cu\({}^{2+}\) + 2e\({}^{-}\)\(\rightleftharpoons\) Cu, \(E^{\circ}\) = +0.34 V

VO\({}^{2+}\) + 2H\({}^{+}\) + e\({}^{-}\)\(\rightleftharpoons\) V\({}^{3+}\) H\({}_{2}\)O, \(E^{\circ}\) = +0.34 V

\(E^{\circ}_{\rm coll}\) = +0.34 - (+0.34) = 0 V

A reversible reaction takes place until equilibrium is reached.

However, by varying conditions such as concentration, the reaction may be made to proceed. Hence, V\({}^{3+}\) can reduce Cu\({}^{2+}\) by increasing concentration of V\({}^{3+}\) or increasing concentration of Cu\({}^{2+}\).

Side reactions may occur.

If a side reaction occurs, especially with insoluble ionic solid formation, a non-spontaneous reaction may become spontaneous.

For example, reaction between Cu\({}^{2+}\) and I,

I\({}_{2}\) (aq) + 2e\({}^{-}\)\(\rightleftharpoons\) 2I\({}^{-}\)(aq), \(E^{\circ}\) = +0.54 V --- (1)

Cu\({}^{2+}\) (aq) + e\({}^{-}\)\(\rightleftharpoons\) Cu\({}^{+}\)(aq), \(E^{\circ}\) = +0.15 V --- (2)

\(E^{\circ}_{\rm coll}\) = +0.15 - (+0.54) V = -0.39 V

\(\Rightarrow\) no reaction is expected when aqueous solutions of Cu\({}^{2+}\) and I- are mixed.

However, a reaction does occur: 2Cu\({}^{2+}\)(aq) + 4I\({}^{-}\)(aq) \(\rightarrow\) 2CuI(s) + I\({}_{2}\)(aq). When blue Cu\({}^{2+}\)(aq) is mixed with colourless I- (aq), a cream precipitate (CuI) in a brown solution (I\({}_{2}\)) is observed. Refer to QA3.

Due to the precipitation of CuI, [Cu\({}^{+}\)(aq)] becomes very low, such that the P.O.E. of (2) favours the R.H.S. Thus, \(E_{\rm Cu2+Cu}\) > \(E^{\circ}_{\rm Cu2+Cu}\) and \(E_{\rm coll}\) may become > 0 V.

Thus, the reaction becomes spontaneous.

## Appendix E Fuel cells & other types of cells

Candidates should be able to state the possible advantages of developing other types of cell, e.g. the H\({}_{2}\)/O\({}_{2}\) fuel cell and improved batteries (as in electric vehicles) in terms of smaller size, lower mass and higher voltage.

### Fuel Cell

1. Fuel cells use combustion reactions to produce electricity. The fuel does not burn because, as in other batteries, the reactants undergo separate half-reactions, and the electrons are transferred through an external circuit. This converts chemical energy into electrical energy. A fuel (e.g. hydrogen, methane etc.) is continuously supplied to one electrode and an oxidant (usually oxygen), to the other.
2. At the anode: the fuel is oxidised and electrons are released to the external circuit. At the cathode: oxygen is reduced by electrons received from the external circuit.

The energy produced in the reaction is converted into electrical energy very efficiently.

4.Hydrogen-oxygen fuel cell:

5.Electrolyte: KOH(aq) Anode reaction: Cathode reaction: Overall cell reaction: _(Note that since the electrolyte is KOH(aq), the half equations should be balanced in basic medium)_
6.Electrolyte: dil H2SO4 Anode reaction: Cathode reaction: Overall cell reaction: _(Note that since the electrolyte is H2SO4(aq), the half equations should be balanced in acidic medium)_
7.Advantages: i.Able to attain maximum power with minimum weight and volume, important e.g. for space flights. ii.Hish efficiency of conversion of chemical energy to electrical energy (up to 75% vs. about 40% for power stations). iii.Fuel cells do not 'go dead' as reactants are supplied continuously and products are continually removed. An ordinary battery stops working as soon as the electrode materials are used up. iv.The product of reaction is non-polluting. The water produced by the fuel cells on the U.S. space laboratory was used for drinking and washing.
8.Disadvantages: i.Expensive due to the use of Pt as catalyst at the graphite electrodes. ii.Most fuels require a high temperature to react in a fuel cell. iii.Hydrogen is potentially explosive.

### Exercise 12

Two fuel cells using ethane but different electrolytes:

\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|} \hline fuel cell & 1 & 2 (IVY Lecture Check Point) \\ \hline fuel used & ethane, C\({}_{2}\)H\({}_{6}\) & ethane, C\({}_{2}\)H\({}_{6}\) \\ \hline oxidising agent & air & air \\ \hline electrolyte & dil H\({}_{2}\)SO\({}_{4}\) & NaOH (aq) \\ \hline rxn at anode & C\({}_{2}\)H\({}_{6}\) (g) + 4H\({}_{2}\)O (l) & \\  & \(\to\) 2CO\({}_{2}\) (g) + 14H\({}^{+}\) (aq) + 14e\({}^{-}\) & \\ \hline rxn at cathode & O\({}_{2}\) (g) + 4H\({}^{+}\) (aq) + 4e\({}^{-}\)\(\to\) 2H\({}_{2}\)O (l) & \\ \hline overall rxn & 2C\({}_{2}\)H\({}_{6}\) (g) + 7O\({}_{2}\) (g) & \\  & \(\to\) 4CO\({}_{2}\) (g) + 6H\({}_{2}\)O (l) & \\ \hline \end{tabular}

### Development of Other Types of Cells

1. Improvement of cells are sought in terms of smaller size, lower mass, higher voltage, longer life, greater reliability, quicker recharging e.g. for electric vehicles, mobile phones, portable PCs, watches, cardiac pace-makers etc.
2. For example: the lithium-ion battery has a mass about half that of a Ni-Cd battery providing similar energy. Extremely high energy/mass ratio, and avoids the toxicity of cadmium in Ni-Cd battery.
3. Electric Car Reasons for electric car: i. & Shrinking oil supplies \\  & ii. & Concer about environmental pollution \\ \hline \multicolumn{2}{|c|}{Advantages} & Disadvantages \\ \hline i. & zero emission of polluting exhaust & i. & limited range (about 120 km) \& speed \\  & gases & & (80km/h) \\ ii. & quiet & ii. & batteries are heavy, bulky and expensive \\ iii. & easier mechanical maintenance & iii. & recharging takes time (> 3 hours) \\ \hline \end{tabular}

Criteria for batteries suitable for electric vehicle:

High energy density (i.e. carry a large amount of energy yet very light), long life and good durability, reliable and quick recharge.
