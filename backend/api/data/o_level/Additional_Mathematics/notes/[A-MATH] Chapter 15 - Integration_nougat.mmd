\(\int\sin x\,dx=-\cos x+c\)

\(\int\sin(ax+b)\,dx=-\frac{1}{a}\cos(ax+b)+c\)

\(\int\sec^{2}(ax+b)\,dx=\frac{1}{a}\tan(ax+b)+c\)

The bolded \(a\) in the denominator in the formula above is actually the **derivative** of the original bracket (\(ax+b\)). Do remember to differentiate the terms in the bracket and place them in the denominator

\(\int\cos x\,dx=\sin x+c\)

The following functions (non-exhaustive) cannot be integrated (at the 'O' Levels) easily. For some of them, we need to use trigonometric identities to integrate them, the rest, require further knowledge of other integration methods to solve! (Research if you are interested.)

**Require identities**

\(\bullet\)\(\sin^{2}x,\cos^{2}x,...\)

**Need external methods**

\(\bullet\)\(\tan x,\sin^{-2}x,...\)
