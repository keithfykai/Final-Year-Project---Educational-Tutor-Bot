**Ionic Bonding**

**1. Formation of Ions**

**Big idea 1: The Stable Electronic Configuration of a Noble Gas**

1. The elements found in Group 0 of the Periodic Table are known as noble gases. Some examples of the noble gases are helium, neon, argon, krypton, xenon and radon.
2. Noble gases are stable and unreactive. They are monatomic and exist as single atoms.

3. Noble gases are stable because they have fully filled outer shells. Helium has a duplet configuration while all other noble gases have an octet configuration. (thus are inert and do not react with other atoms.)
4. Atoms of other elements are reactive because their outer shells are not fully filled. These atoms lose, gain or share outer electrons to achieve complete valence shell configuration (the stable noble gas configuration).

## 2 Why atoms form ions?

**Big idea 2: Atoms form ions to achieve stable electronic structure with full electron shells.**

1. To achieve the stable electronic structure,

(a) atoms of metals lose electrons to form positive ions (cations);

(b) atoms of non-metals gain electron to form negative ions (anions). 2. Ions

with two or more covalently bonded atoms are called polyatomic ions.

Examples of such ions are the ammonium ion (NH4\({}^{+}\)), carbonate ion (CO3\({}^{2-}\)) and the sulfate ion (SO4\({}^{2-}\)) (Note: structure of polyatomic ions is not required).

## 3 Formation of Ionic Bond: Transferring Electrons

1. Ionic bonds are formed between metals and non-metals.

Fluorine, chlorine, oxygen,

sulfur

_Examples of metals:_ Sodium,

potassium, calcium, magnesium

_Examples of non-metals:_

2. In the formation of an ionic bond, the metal atom transfers electrons to the non-metal atom to form positive ions (cations) and negative ions (anions).

3. The oppositely-charged ions are held together by strong electrostatic forces of attraction

called ionic bonds.

Example 1: In the formation of sodium chloride.

(a) sodium atom (2.8.1) loses 1 electron to form Na\({}^{\prime}\)ion, achieving stable electronic structure (2.8).

(d) The formula of the compound formed is MgCl\({}_{2}\).

4. Physical Properties of Ionic compounds

Property

Explanation (Specify the identity of the ions where applicable.)

Have very high melting and boiling points (for reference: m.p. \(\sim\) few hundred to few thousand degrees Celsius).

An ionic compound has a giant ionic crystal lattice structure. A large amount of energy is required to overcome the strong forces of electrostatic forces of attraction between the negative and positive ions.

(lonic compounds are usually solid at room temperature due to the same reason.)

Not required to explain

Usually soluble in water

but insoluble in organic

solvents.

Dissolve to form a solution (aqueous state and the symbol is (aq)).

Conduct electricity in the aqueous and molten states but not in the solid state.

In **solid** state, the ions are held in fixed positions by strong electrostatic forces of attraction between the positive and negative ions. As there are no free mobile ions to carry charges, ionic compounds cannot conduct electricity in the solid state.

In **molten** or **aqueous states**, the strong electrostatic forces of attraction have been overcome, hence there are mobile ions to carry charges.

Hard and strong

A large amount of energy is required to overcome the strong forces of electrostatic forces of attraction between the negative and positive ions.

5. Chemical Formulae of Ionic Compounds

1. The name of the non-metal ion usually ends with -ide (mostly monatomic), -ite (polyatomic) or -ate (polyatomic)

2. Name and formulae of complex (polyatomic) ions [need to remember the formula]

**Name**

**Formula**

hydroxide

OH4. To determine the ratio of positive to negative ions:

(a) The charges must be balanced for the compound to be stable (i.e. overall charge must be 0).

(b) For inorganic compounds, the symbol of the metallic element will go first. (c) More than one ion can be involved in forming the compound. The number of each ion is indicated by a subscript number after the chemical symbol of the ion. The ratio should be the simplest ratio. "1" is by default and does not need to be indicated in the chemical formula.

(d) Polyatomic ions cannot be split up and should be considered as a whole. Brackets are required to group them.

**5. Simple Molecules: Physical Properties**

**Property**

**Explanation (_Specify the identity of the atoms / molecules where applicable._)

Have low melting and boiling

Have low melting and boiling

points

A simple molecule has simple molecular structure. Little energy

is needed to overcome the weak intermolecular forces of attraction between the molecules.

(Covalent molecules are usually liquids or gases at room

temperature due to the same reason.)

**Poor conductors of electricity in all physical states.**

Usually insoluble in water but soluble in organic solvents such as alcohol, methylated spirits or petrol.

Exceptions: hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid and nitric acid which are soluble in water.

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:12]

1. In metals, each atom loses its valence electrons to form a positive ion.

2. These electrons are mobile to form a "sea of mobile electrons".

3. The electrostatic forces of attraction between the positive metal ions and the'sea of mobile electrons' forms the metallic bond.

## 3 Alloys

**Definition:** It is a mixture of a metal with one or a few other elements.

1. Alloys have many advantages over pure metal. Alloys can be made to:

\(\bullet\) Be harder and stronger

\(\bullet\) Have better appearance

\(\bullet\) Be more resistant to corrosion

\(\bullet\) Have a lower melting point

**Examples of alloys** **Element** **Properties**

 Steel  iron + carbon  It makes metals harder and stronger.

 Stainless Steel  iron + carbon + nickel + chromium  It makes the metal more resistant to corrosion (rusting) - see later  part of notes.

 Bronze  copper + tin  It makes metals harder and stronger.

 Brass  copper + zinc  It makes metals harder and stronger.

2. Pure metal vs Alloy\({}_{**}\) Common Qns: Why are alloys harder and stronger

**than pure metals?**

Different sized atom of another element disrupts

the orderly arrangement of atoms, making it more

difficult for the layers of atoms to slide past one

another easily.

**Difference**

**Pure Metal**

**Aloy (eg. brass)**

**Structure**

**Atoms are of the same size. They are orderly arranged in regular rows.**

**Atoms are of different sizes. The**

**orderly arrangement of atoms is**

**disrupted.**

**Properties**

**When force is applied, the layers of atoms slide over each other**

**easily. Thus, pure metal is soft.**
