## 6 Evaporation

**Evaporation** is the process by which the **more energetic molecules**

at the **surface** of the liquid **overcome the downward attractive intermolecular forces**

**from other water molecules and escape into the surroundings's gas molecules.**

**As the more energetic molecules escape, the **average kinetic energy of the molecules decreases**

**and the temperature decreases.**

**Hence, evaporation has a **cooling effect.**
