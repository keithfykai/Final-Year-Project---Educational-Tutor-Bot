**Historical background**

Aluminium is the most abundant element in the Earth's crust but due to its highly reactive nature, it is almost never found in its pure form. Instead, it exists as aluminium oxide (or bauxite) and can be found in countries such as Australia, Jamaica and Ghana. Due to its highly reactive nature, aluminium is also a difficult metal to refine. An electrolytic process is used to refine aluminium. Hence, the one important factor in the aluminium refining industry is cheap electricity. Ghana, for example, refines a large proportion of the world's aluminium using its cheaply available hydroelectric power supply and natural reserves of bauxite.

## 1 Introduction to the Electrolytic Cell

Electrolysis is a process in which **electrical energy** is used to **induce non-spontaneous redox reactions**, e.g. decomposition of molten NaCl_t_ to give Na(s) and C_l_z(g).

Electrolysis takes place:

In an electrolytic cell - consists of a pair of electrodes (anode and cathode) which carry an electric current into and out of the cell.

(ii) With an electrolyte - a compound in aqueous or molten state which conducts an electric current due to presence of mobile ions, _e.g._ aqueous H_zSO_4, molten NaCl_t.

TAKE NOTE!

In the galvanic cell, the cathode is **positive** and the anode is **negative**.

In the electrolytic cell, the cathode is **negative** while the anode is **positive**.

**Checkpoint 1**

The apparatus below is used for the electrolysis of molten lead(II) bromide using inert electrodes. Write equations to represent the chemical reactions at the cathode and anode.

## 2 Factors Affecting Selective Discharge of Ions

* Four main factors affect the selective discharge of ions at the electrodes: (i) State of electrolyte (molten or aqueous) (ii) Position of species in the redox (electrochemical) series (iii) Concentration of ions in electrolyte (iv) Nature of electrode

### State of electrolyte (molten or aqueous)

* Molten electrolytes contain only their constituent ions. The cation and anion will be discharged at the cathode and anode respectively.
* If the electrolyte is an aqueous solution, a large proportion of it would consist of water molecules. In this case, the cation or water may be discharged at the cathode and the anion or water may be discharged at the anode (depending on their relative ease of reduction/oxidation). The equations for the discharge of water are: \[\begin{array}{ll}\mbox{Cathode (reduction):}&\mbox{$2\mbox{H}_{2}\mbox{O(l) + 2e}^{-}\rightarrow\mbox{H}_{2}\mbox{(g) + 2OH}\mbox{(aq)}$}\\ \mbox{Anode (oxidation):}&\mbox{$2\mbox{H}_{2}\mbox{O(l) \rightarrow 4H}^{+}\mbox{(aq) + O}_{2}\mbox{(g) + 4e}^{-}$}\end{array}\]
* _E.g._ NaCl(_l_) contains only Na\({}^{*}\)(_l_) and _C_l_(_l_). Electrolysis of NaCl(_l_) using graphite electrodes results in the discharge of Na\({}^{*}\)(_l_) and _C_l_(_l_) to give Na(s) and _C_l_(g). Cathode (reduction): Na\({}^{*}\)(_l_) + _e_\({}^{-}\rightarrow\) Na(s) \[\begin{array}{ll}\mbox{Anode (oxidation):}&\mbox{$2\mbox{C}\mbox{I}\mbox{(l) \rightarrow $C$l}_{2}\mbox{(g) + 2e}^{-}$}\end{array}\] NaCl(aq) contains Na\({}^{*}\)(aq), _C_l_(aq) and H\({}_{2}\)O(_l_). Electrolysis of NaCl(aq) using graphite electrodes results in the discharge of H\({}_{2}\)O(_l_) at both the cathode and anode instead to give H\({}_{2}\)(g) and O\({}_{2}\)(g). (See worked example in _Section 2.2_)

WortexampleA

Explain what happens when aqueous sodium chloride is electrolysed using platinum electrodes.

**Species present in electrolyte:** Na*(aq), \(C\mathit{l}\)(aq), \(H_{2}O(l)\)

**At the anode (oxidation):**

\[C\mathit{l}(\mathrm{g})+2\mathit{e}^{-}\rightleftharpoons2C\mathit{l}(\mathrm{aq}) \qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\mathit{E}^{\circ}=+1.36\ \mathrm{V}\]

\[O_{2}(\mathrm{g})+4H^{+}(\mathrm{aq})+4\mathit{e}^{-}\rightleftharpoons2H_{2}O(l) \qquad\qquad\qquad\mathit{E}^{\circ}=+1.23\ \mathrm{V}\]

\(H_{2}O(l)\) preferentially oxidised over \(C\mathit{l}(\mathrm{aq})\) as \(\mathit{E}^{\circ}\left(O_{2}\left(\mathrm{g}\right)\middle|H_{2}O(l)\right)\) is more negative than \(\mathit{E}^{\circ}\left(C\mathit{l}_{2}\left(\mathrm{g}\right)\middle|Cl^{-} \left(\mathrm{aq}\right)\right)\)

Reaction at anode: \(2H_{2}O(l)\to O_{2}(\mathrm{g})+4H^{+}(\mathrm{aq})+4\mathit{e}^{-}\)

**At the cathode (reduction):**

\[\mathrm{Na}^{+}(\mathrm{aq})+\mathit{e}^{-}\rightleftharpoonsNa(\mathrm{s}) \qquad\qquad\qquad\mathit{E}^{\circ}=-2.71\ \mathrm{V}\]

\[2H_{2}O(l)+2\mathit{e}^{-}\rightleftharpoonsH_{2}(\mathrm{g})+2OH^{+}( \mathrm{aq}) \qquad\qquad\mathit{E}^{\circ}=-0.83\ \mathrm{V}\]

\(H_{2}O(l)\) is preferentially reduced over \(\mathrm{Na}^{+}(\mathrm{aq})\) as \(\mathit{E}^{\circ}\left(H_{2}O(l)\middle|H_{2}\left(\mathrm{g}\right)\right)\) is more positive than \(\mathit{E}^{\circ}\left(\mathrm{Na}^{+}\left(\mathrm{aq}\right)\middle|Na( \mathrm{s})\right)\)

Reaction at cathode: \(2H_{2}O(l)+2\mathit{e}^{-}\to H_{2}(\mathrm{g})+2OH^{+}(\mathrm{aq})\)

**Overall reaction:**\(2H_{2}O(l)\to 2H_{2}(\mathrm{g})+O_{2}(\mathrm{g})\)

\(O_{2}(\mathrm{g})\) evolved at anode; \(H_{2}(\mathrm{g})\) evolved at cathode

As illustrated in the example above, the electrolysis of a dilute, aqueous solution of an ionic salt is often simply the **electrolysis of water**.

Note: From the auto-ionisation of water, some H*(aq) and OH*(aq) are present in the aqueous solution. However, their concentrations are much too low compared to the concentration of H\({}_{2}\)O and hence are not considered.

### Concentration of ions in electrolyte

* Ions at a higher concentration may be discharged in preference to other species at a lower concentration even though the position of the former in the redox series is not as favourable as the latter.

## 4 INDUSTRIAL APPLICATIONS

### **Anodising of aluminium**

* Aluminium is a reactive metal and is readily oxidised by oxygen in air. This forms a layer of aluminium oxide (Al\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{3}\)) on the surface of the metal about 2 to 3 nm thick, making it resistant to corrosion.
* The thickness of the oxide layer can be further increased by electrolysis. This process is known as **anodising**.

* Oxygen produced at the anode reacts with any exposed aluminium, forming a thicker oxide layer which is corrosion resistant.
* If a dye is added, it can be adsorbed onto the oxide layer during anodising.
* The oxide layer is initially porous and must be sealed by immersing the aluminium object into boiling hot deionised water.

* **Facts from your e-savvy life**
* Aluminium casings for handphones come in a multitude of colours. How do you think the colours are put onto their aluminium casings? They are obviously not painted on, although that would be the cheapest alternative. Paints cannot adhere onto metals very well and would peel in a matter of days, unless of course the paints are metallic based compounds. Hence, the mobile phone aluminium casings are dyed when anodising is done, and thermal sealing performed to fix the colours in. So, the next time you go into a shop and see a bunch of colourful metal objects, recall anodising!

### Purification of copper

* Impure copper (obtained from its ores) can be purified by electrolysis. **Electrolyte:** dilute CuSO\({}_{4}\)(aq) **Species present in electrolyte:** Cu\({}^{2+}\)(aq), SO\({}_{4}^{2-}\)(aq), H\({}_{2}\)O(_l_) **Reaction at anode:** Cu(s) \(\rightarrow\) Cu\({}^{2+}\)(aq) + 2\(e\) **Reaction at cathode:** Cu\({}^{2+}\)(aq) + 2\(e\) **Reaction at cathode:** Cu\({}^{2+}\)(aq) + 2\(e\) **Re**(s)
* At the anode, impurities (metals) above Cu in the redox series (_e.g._ Fe, Zn) are oxidised to form ions and dissolves. Impurities below Cu in the redox series (_e.g._ Ag, Au) are not oxidised and fall off the anode to the bottom of the cell as 'anode sludge'.
* At the cathode, metal ions (from the impurities) above Cu in the redox series are not reduced and remain in solution. Cu\({}^{2+}\) ions in the solution are reduced to form Cu(s). **\(\mbox{\rm{e.g.}}\)**\(\mbox{\rm{Cu}}^{2+}\)(aq) + 2\(e\) **\(\rightleftharpoons\) Cu(s) \(\mbox{\rm{E}}^{\odot}=+0.34\) V \(\mbox{\rm{Zn}}^{2+}\)(aq) + 2\(e\) **\(\rightleftharpoons\) Zn(s) \(\mbox{\rm{E}}^{\odot}=-0.76\) V At the anode (impure Cu, where Zn(s) could be one of the impurities), Zn(s) is readily oxidises to Zn\({}^{2+}\)(aq). However, Zn\({}^{2+}\)(aq) does not reduce to Zn(s) easily and does not plate out at the cathode.
* The concentration of the electrolyte remains relatively constant throughout the process. However, the mass of the anode decreases (anode dissolves) while the mass of the cathode increases (deposits of pure Cu(s)). **Fortunes from waste!** The recovery of the precious metals from the sludge practically pays for the electrolysis. Anodic sludge from copper refining provides one-quarter of the silver production and one-eighth of the gold production in US. **Eunoid Junior College**

### Electrochemistry (Part 2) Electrolytic Cell

* The electrolysis of brine is used in the manufacture of sodium hydroxide and chlorine.
* The diaphragm cell consists of a single cell separated by an ion (cation)-exchange membrane, usually asbestos. The cation permeable membrane allows the cell to remain electrically neutral despite OH(aq) being produced at the cathode by the migration of Na+(aq) from the anode compartment over to the cathode compartment. This results in the formation of NaOH(aq) in the cathode compartment and a small amount of NaC(aq).
* The electrolyte in the cathode compartment is then removed as a mixture of NaOH(aq) and NaC(aq). The NaCl(aq) is removed by crystallisation after the electrolyte is concentrated by evaporation.

### 4.4 Electroplating (enrichment)

* The electrolyte is usually an aqueous solution containing the ions of the metal to be plated, _e.g._ AgNO\({}_{3}\)(aq) for plating of Ag(s) and CuSO\({}_{4}\)(aq) for plating of Cu(s).
* The object to be plated is connected as the cathode. The metal to be plated is used as the anode to 'top-up' the electrolyte and maintain a constant concentration.
* Only metals less reactive than Zn (higher in the redox series) can be used as the plating metal, _e.g._ Cr, Cu, Ag and Au, but not Zn or _Al_. For Zn and metals below it in the redox series, water would be reduced to H\({}_{2}\)(g) at the cathode as the metal ions are much less easily reduced.
* Objects coated with metals like Au, Ag and Cu usually have shiny and attractive appearance. Iron objects coated with Au, Ag and Cr have a greater resistance to corrosion.

### 4.4.1.1.2.3.4.5 Green facts...and a bit of propaganda

Hydrogen has been thought to be the clean fuel for our future energy needs. Burning hydrogen in air produces harmless water as a by-product. But this begets a question. Where do we get the hydrogen from? There are several ways to do this, e.g. steam reforming, electrolysis, high temperature decomposition of water. All of these methods involve an input of energy. For hydrogen to really assume its role as a clean fuel, it must not generate greenhouse gases during its production. If we were to burn fossil fuels to generate electricity, and use this electricity to electrolose water to obtain hydrogen, it effectively defeats the purpose of using hydrogen in the first place. Renewable energy sources such as wind, solar and water could be used instead, with the electricity produced used to drive electrolysis of water. This is thought to be a much more acceptable method, but is currently in the works as it is still not economically sustainable. The problems however, do not stop here. The hydrogen generated will need to be stored to fulfil its purpose as a fuel. Hydrogen is explosive when mixed with air, and improper storage could lead to disastrous effects. You would not want to be sitting in a hydrogen-powered car, and have it explode during an accident on the road. You will be blown sky high, and probably toasted! Current research is ongoing in hydrogen storage, with the latest trend being nanotech breakthroughs to store hydrogen gas in nanotubes and specially designed lattices. Interested in environment engineering? This area could be the next hot thing, especially when crude oil hits US$200 a barrel or more...Think of countries which have no fossil fuel reserves. Think of countries which have a relentless urge to increase energy production to meet skyrocketing demands. Think of what they will do when oil hits US$200 a barrel...
