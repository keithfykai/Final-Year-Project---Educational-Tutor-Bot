ATOM

* The smallest particle of an element.
* proton, neutron, electron.
* \(\frac{\pi}{2}X\)

X = symbol of the element

A = atomic mass (nucleon number) = total

number of protons and neutrons

Z = atomic number (proton number)

**Protons and neutrons are found in the nucleus of an atom whereas electrons are found in spaces outside the nucleus.**

**These spaces can be categorised as (1) principal quantum shells (2) subshells (3) orbitals Based on where they are found, each electron within the same atom have different energy level.**Each principal quantum number indicates the principal quantum shell. Each principal quantum shell (n = 1, 2, 3, or 4) contains either 1 (s), 2 (s, p), 3 (s, p, d), or 4 (s, p, d, f) subshells. The s- subshell has 1 orbital, p-subshell has 3 orbitals, d-subshell has 5 orbitals. Each orbital holds a maximum of 2 electrons with opposite spins.

\begin{tabular}{|p{42.7pt}|p{42.7pt}|p{42.7pt}|p{42.7pt}|p{42.7pt}|} \hline Principal Quantum Shell & Number of Subshell & Name of Subshell & Number of Orbital & Maximum number of electrons (2n2) \\ \hline \(n=1\) & 1 & 1s & 1 & 2 \\ \hline \(n=2\) & 2 & 2s, 2p & 1+3 & 8 \\ \hline \(n=3\) & 3 & 3s, 3p, 3d & 1+3+5 & 18 \\ \hline \(n=4\) & 4 & 4s, 4p, 4d, 4f & 1+3+5+7 & 32 \\ \hline \end{tabular}

**FIRST IONSIATION ENERGY**

**First IEs** is the energy required to remove 1 mole of electrons from 1 mole of gaseous atoms to form 1 mole of singly charged gaseous (cations)

* Ca*(g) + e

* Is always AH-0

* Units = kJ mol\({}^{-1}\)

**SECONDIONIONSENERGY**

**Second IE** is the energy required to remove 1 mole of electrons from 1 mole of singly charged gaseous (cations)

* Ca*(g) + e

* Is always AH-0

_Note: Will much more on it in Chapter 5: The Period Table & Chapter 7: Chemical Energetics_

**GENERAL TRENED OF LE AMONG ELEMENTS**

IE are used to overcome the electrostatic forces of attraction between the valence electrons to be removed in an atom and the nucleus.

* General trend **across the period: increase**
* General trend **down the group: Decrease**

_Note: Will touch more on it in Chapter 5: The Periodic Table_

FACTORS AFFECTING THE

MAGNITUDE OF IE (for exception

cases against the general trend)

**FACTOR 2:** ORBITAL THE ELECTRON IS IN

The **orbital (or sub-shell)** where the electron to be removed comes from also affects the IE.

The **further the orbital (or sub-shell)** is away from the nucleus, the **lower the IE** is.

_Note: The writing of electronic configuration will help in the explanation for this factor_

**FACTOR 3: INTER-ELECTRONIC REPULSION**

If 2 electrons are present in the same orbital, **inter-electronic repulsion occurs** as they are of the same charge.

IE is **lowered** if the electron to be removed from the orbital is **paired with another electron** in the same orbital as compared to a singly unpaired electron.

_Note: The writing of electronic configuration will help in the explanation for this factor_Using IE TO DETERMIINE THE POSITION OF THE ELEMENT

## Graphical Representation

* Big Jump = it indicates that the electrons removed come from a **different principal quantum shells** and hence there is a significant decrease in the shielding effect on the outermost electron due to a decrease in the number of inner shells between the electron to be removed and the nucleus
* Small Jump = it indicates that the electrons removed come from **different sub-shells** but is **still** within the **same** principal quantum shellsUsing IE TO DETERMINE THE POSITION OF THE ELEMENT MATHEMATICAL REPRESENTATION

## Appendix A
## Appendix A Practical Questions

_Answer: There is an increasing in ionisation energy as the number of electrons removed increased. As the number of protons remain the same whereas the number of electrons decreases, shielding effect decreases and hence effective nuclear charge increases. As effective nuclear charge increase, the outermost electron is more strongly attracted to the nucleus hence more energy is required to remove it and hence ionization increase._

_There is a large jump in the ionisation energy between the removal of the \(t^{11}\) and the \(2^{20}\) electron in Na. For the \(t^{11}\) ionisation energy, the electron removed is from the 3s orbital whereas for the \(2^{20}\) ionisation energy, the electron removed is from the 2p orbital. This resulted in a significant decrease in the shielding effect as the electron removed from the 2p orbital only has 1 inner shell shielding it from the nucleus. As nuclear charge remains the same, the large decrease in the shielding effect resulted in a large increase in effective nuclear charge and hence a large jump in ionisation energy._

_There is a smaller jump in ionisation energy between the removal of the \(7^{th}\) and the \(8^{th}\) electron in Na. For the \(7^{th}\) ionisation energy, the electron removed is from the 2p orbital whereas for the \(8^{th}\) ionisation energy, the electron removed is from the 2s orbital. As the 2s orbital is greater for the nucleus as compared to 2p orbital, it is more strongly attracted to the nucleus and hence greater amount of energy is required to remove the electron from the 2s orbital nucleus as compared to the removal of electron in the 2p orbital. This thus resulted in the small jump from the \(7^{th}\) ionisation energy to the \(8^{th}\) ionisation energy._

_However as the number of inner shells remain the same, the increase in ionisation energy is smaller as compared to the jump from the \(t^{11}\) ionisation energy to the \(2^{th}\) ionisation energy where there is a decrease in the number of inner shells._
