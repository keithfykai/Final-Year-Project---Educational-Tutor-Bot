### How electricity works in a circuit is similar to a river.

Current flows in a river and at times, it can split into smaller streams.

When it does, the volume of water is reduced in each smaller stream.

A parallel circuit works in the same way!

Current will split into smaller volume as it enters each individual branch of the circuit.

\[\mathbf{l_{total}=1_{1}+1_{2}+1_{3}}\]
