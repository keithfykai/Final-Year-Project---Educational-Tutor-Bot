### Field of Force

* A physical body can exert a force on another similar body not in contact with it. Such interactions can be explained using the field concept.
* Field concept can be used to explain a physical phenomenon in terms of a field and the manner in which it interacts with matter or with other fields.
* A **Field of Force** is a region of space surrounding a body within which it can exert a force on another similar body not in contact with it.

**(i) Gravitational Force**

* A body of mass \(M\) establishes round itself a region of space in which it has the ability (or potential) to exert a gravitational force on another _mass_.
* The strength of the gravitational field established by mass, \(M\), at a point in the region of space is given by \(g\), and the gravitational force \(F\) exerted on another body of mass, \(m\), placed at that point is given by _F = mg_. The gravitational force \(F\) is _always attractive_ and points towards the mass \(M\).

**(ii) Electric Force**

* A body of charge \(Q\) establishes around itself a region of space in which it has the ability (or potential) to exert an _electric force_ on another _charge_.
* The two kinds of charges responsible for electric forces are the positive and negative charges. Unlike gravitational forces, electric forces can be _attractive_ or _repulsive_, depending on the signs of the charges involved.
* Like charges _repel_ and _unlike charges _attract_.

**(iii) Magnetic Force**

* A magnetic field may exist in a region of space as a result of the presence of either a _permanent maquet_ or _a moving charge_ or _current-carrying conductor_.

### Some common types of Forces

#### (i) Contact Force

When a body is in contact with another surface, the surface exerts a contact force on the body. This contact force has two components, namely the normal contact force (\(F_{\text{N}}\)) and the frictional force (\(F_{\text{r}}\)).

Normal Contact Force, \(F_{\text{N}}\)

* Consider a stone resting on a road. If the contact between the road and the stone is examined closely, it can be seen that the two rough surfaces make close contact only at relatively few places. Where contact is made, the road will exert a force on the stone as shown in Fig 1(a).
* The sum of all these forces is shown in Fig 1(b) and this single force is the normal contact force which the road exerts on the stone. The normal contact force acts perpendicular to the surface that the body is in contact with and is always directed away from the surface towards the body.

Frictional Force, \(F_{\text{r}}\)

* For stationary body, the frictional force acts along the surface in a direction to prevent the body from sliding (or to oppose the tendency of motion).
* For surfaces in relative motion, the direction is to oppose the relative motion of the surfaces.
* Using the example of the stone above, if the stone is sliding across the road (e.g. to the left), Fig 1(a) then changes to Fig 2(a).

* The contact force can be considered as being the vector sum of a horizontal component (the frictional force) and a vertical component (the normal contact force).

* The graph of the external force plotted against extension (or compression) for a spring under load is shown below:

* Features of the graph:

* The magnitude of the force is directly proportional to the extension/compression of the spring (i.e. \(F\alpha x\)) until P, which is known as the **limit of proportionality**. Beyond this point, force is no longer proportional to extension/compression.
* The ratio of force to extension/compression (within the limit of proportionality) is the spring constant, \[\text{spring constant }k=\frac{F}{x}\]
* The larger the value of \(k\), the stiffer the spring. That is, a larger force is required to extend it by a given length.

**Example 1**

Some weight-lifters use a 'chest expander', consisting of a strong spring with a handle at each end, to exercise chest and arm muscles. The spring obeying Hooke's law has an unstretched length of 50.0 cm and a spring constant of 400 N m-1.

Calculate the tension in the spring when the overall length is 70.0 cm.

* Consider a point which is at a depth \(h\) below the surface of the liquid in Fig 2. The pressure due to the liquid at this depth \(h\) is due to the weight of the column of liquid \(F\) above it over an area of \(A\).
* Pressure \(P\)= \(\dfrac{F}{A}\)
* Density \(\rho\) is defined as the mass \(m\) per unit volume \(V\) of a substance.
* Hence, Pressure \(P\)= \(\dfrac{F}{A}\dfrac{m_{hail}g}{A}\)= \(\dfrac{(hA\rho_{hail})g}{A}\)= \(h\rho_{hail}g\)
* Pressure in a fluid increases with depth of the fluid.
* The pressure at equal depths within a uniform liquid is the same.
* The equation is valid for fluids whose density is constant and does not change with depth, that is, if the fluid is incompressible.

### Example 3

A long narrow tube is filled with water of density 1000 kg m\({}^{3}\) to a depth of 1.5 m, and oil of density 800 kg m\({}^{3}\) to a depth of 0.5 m. The tube is then inclined at 50\({}^{\circ}\) to the horizontal. Given that the atmospheric pressure is 1.01 x 10\({}^{5}\) Pa, estimate the pressure at the bottom of the tube, point P.

**PHYSICS 9749**

* **Archimedes' Principle states that for a submerged or floating object in a fluid, it experiences an **upthrust** equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to the **weight of fluid displaced**.

* **For an object floating in equilibrium, since the only two forces acting on the floating object are its weight and the upthrust, the **Principle of Flotation** states that for **an object floating in equilibrium**, the upthrust is equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to the weight of the object.

* **Extending Archimedes' Principle to an object floating in equilibrium**, the **weight of the fluid displaced** is therefore equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to the weight of the object**.

**Check Your Understanding**

Which of the following object(s) can **(i)** Archimedes' Principle and **(ii)** Principle of Flotation be applied?

**Example 4**: A spherical buoy of radius 10 cm floats on the surface of the water with half of its volume submerged in the water. The density of water is 1.0 x 10\({}^{3}\) kg m\({}^{3}\).

**Example 5**: A wooden body is floating as shown. Density of the body and water is \(\rho_{\rm b}\) and \(\rho_{w}\) respectively. The body has base area \(A\). Determine the ratio \(\rho_{w}\) /\(\rho_{\rm b}\).

## Appendix B Centre of Gravity

* Any body other than the idealised point body has size. It therefore has its mass distributed over its volume and forces acting on parts of it. If it were necessary to consider every bit of the body's mass separately, the mathematical manipulation would be very complex. To simplify this, we use the term centre of mass.
* The centre of mass is the point at which the whole mass of the body may be considered to be concentrated.
* The **centre of gravity** of an object is the point at which the whole weight of the body may be considered to act.
* The position of the centre of mass is usually in the same place as the centre of gravity of the body if the body is situated in a uniform gravitational field. The weight of a body may be taken as acting through the centre of gravity of the body.

* The centre of gravity of a regularly shaped body of uniform thickness and density is at its geometrical centre.

## Appendix C Turning Effects of Forces

* A force, besides being able to cause a body to change its linear momentum, can also cause the body to rotate. This is the moment of a force or the turning effect of a force.

### Moment of a force

Moment of a force is the turning effect of a force. It is equal to the product of the force and the perpendicular distance of the line of action of the force from the pivot.

* Mathematically,
* Moment of a Force about a point O = Force x Perpendicular Distance to point O
* The unit of moment is the newton-metre (N m).
* It is a vector quantity. Its direction is either clockwise or anti-clockwise.
* When finding moment of a force, we always find moment about any point. There is no need for a physical pivot in the question for us to find the moment of a force.
* Examples of moment at work include: closing a door, lifting a car hood.

### Extended Mass (or rigid body)

When an object is at rest (no translation or rotation), the object is said to be in static equilibrium (and the \(2\) conditions must be met). The same conditions apply to an object in uniform translational motion (without rotation) such as an airplane in flight with constant speed, direction and attitude. Such a body is in equilibrium but is not static.

### Extended Mass (or rigid body)

When applying Condition 2, the condition holds true for any point (or axis) that you take moments about. It need not necessarily be the cg, and for that matter, the point (axis) need not be on the object.

**Example 8**

A hungry bear weighing 700 N walks out on a beam in an attempt to retrieve some "goodies" hanging at the end of the beam. The beam is uniform, weighs 200 N, and is 6.00 m long. The goodies weigh 80.0 N.

**(a)** By drawing a labelled free body diagram of the beam, determine the tension in the wire when the bear is at a distance of 1.00 m away from hinge H.

**(b)** Determine the force from the hinge when the bear is at this distance.

### Equilibrium of Rigid Body under Three Concurrent Forces

* When an extended mass (rigid body)
* is in equilibrium and
* there are only 3 coplanar non-parallel forces acting on the body
* the forces must be concurrent forces (forces whose lines of action pass through a single point).

### Example 9

A uniform beam shown below is in equilibrium. It is supported by a wire and a rough wall. Which of the following forces correctly show the direction of the force exerted by the wall on the beam?

**Example 10**: A non-uniform rod of length 1.0 metre is held horizontally in place by two inextensible strings.

**(a)** Without calculation, indicate the location of the centre of gravity of the rod in the diagram below.

**(b)** If \(\theta_{t}=30^{\circ}\), \(\theta_{2}=45^{\circ}\) and the weight of the rod is 30 N, calculate the distance of the centre of gravity from end A of the rod.

**(a)** If \(\theta_{t}=30^{\circ}\), \(\theta_{2}=45^{\circ}\) and the weight of the rod is 30 N, calculate the distance of the centre of gravity from end A of the rod.

* Beyond the limit of elasticity, the spring will not return to its original length even when applied force to extend it is removed.
* Area **A + B** represents the work done necessary to extend the elastic material.
* Area **B** represents the energy released when the applied force to extend it is released. This is also the elastic potential energy stored within the elastic material.
* Not all the work done was transformed into elastic potential energy stored within the elastic material. The energy which was not transformed is represented by area **A**. This amount of energy is used to cause deformation of the material and is also converted into heat.

Consider that the block is made of two parts A and B.

Let \(t\) be the thickness of the block, \(\rho\) be the density of the body

Consider the x-direction, taking moment about the origin (0, 0)
