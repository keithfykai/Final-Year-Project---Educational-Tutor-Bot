**Notes**

**Effects of Ferrous Core on Magnetic Field of a Solenoid**

**Ferromagnetic material:**

characterized by numerous small magnetized regions called domains. Tiny atomic (elementary) magnets reside in each domain.

**In the unmagnetised state, all the elementary magnets are arranged randomly, as shown in fig 16.13.

**Material displays little or no magnetism.**

**When subjected to an external magnetic field e.g. when placed within a solenoid, elementary magnets line up in the direction of the external field as shown in fig. 16.14.**

**Now that the elementary magnets are all parallel, they give rise to a stronger field i.e. the permeability of matter** \(\mu\) **increases. Material is magnetized (i.e. displays magnetism).**

**Examples of ferromagnetic materials are iron, cobalt, nickel and alnico (an alloy of aluminium, nickel and cobalt).**

**Effects of Ferrous Core in Solenoid:**

**By putting a ferrous (iron) core inside a solenoid, it has ability to strengthen the magnetic flux density. There are more field lines and the field lines are closer together as shown below.**

Physics 9749

Large increase in magnetic flux density is due to the high degree of alignment of the magnetic domains in the ferromagnetic material. Once the solenoid is switched on, the previously unaligned domains "line up" and "contribute" to the field, hence magnetic flux density increases.

Iron is a particularly good core for solenoids as it is easily magnetised and demagnetised. This means that when the current is switched off the iron does not stay magnetic. Iron is said to be magnetically soft.

Applications:

In transformers where more will be covered under topic of _Alternating Current_.

In electromagnets where more will be covered under topic of _Electromagnetic Induction_.

**D** **Force on a current-carrying conductor**

A metallic conductor carrying a current \(I\) placed in a uniform magnetic field \(B\) will experience a force.

Only the component of the \(B\)-field perpendicular to the current \(I\) will result in a force on the conductor

\(I\)\(\rho\)\(B\)\(\rho\)\(F\)\(=\)\(B\)\(\sqcup\)\(II\)\(I\)\(=\)\((B\)\(\sin\,\theta)\)\(II\)\(=\)\((B\)\(\sin\,\theta)\)\(II\)\(=\)\(B\)\(II\)\(I\)\(\sin\,\theta\)

where \(F\)\(=\) electromagnetic force (N);

\(B_{\rm L}\)\(=\) component of magnetic flux density (T)

perpendicular to current;

\(I\)\(=\) current in conductor (A);

\(I\)\(=\) length of conductor (m); and

\(\theta\)\(=\) the angle between the conductor and magnetic field.

If the conductor is parallel to the field lines, then \(\theta\)\(=\)\(0^{\circ}\), and \(F\)\(=\)\(0\). (No magnetic force acts on the conductor).

If the conductor is at right angles to the field lines, then \(\theta\)\(=\)\(90^{\circ}\), and the magnetic force acting on the conductor would be maximum (\(F\)\(=\)\(B\)\(I\)).

Direction of the force

The direction of the force on the conductor can be predicted by using Fleming's Left Hand Rule.

**Anderson Serengoon Junior COLEGEG PHYSICS 9749**

* From \(B=\frac{F}{IL\sin\theta}\), the definition of magnetic flux density (B) and the Tesla (T) can be derived:

**Worked Example**

The given diagram shows a wire of length 3.0 cm, and carrying a current of 5.0 A, situated at an angle 20\({}^{\circ}\) to the vertical, in a uniform magnetic field of flux density 0.040 T.

What is the magnitude and direction of the force on the wire due to the field?

**Solution:**

Force = _BII_ sin \(\theta\) _(where \(\theta\) is the angle between the field and the wire)_

 = (0.040)(5.0)(0.03)sin 70\({}^{\circ}\) = 0.0056 N

By Fleming's Left Hand Rule, the force is acting out of the plane of the paper.

**Important note:**

\(\succ\) **\(\dfrac{F_{\mathrm{x}}}{l}\) **and** \(\dfrac{F_{\mathrm{y}}}{l}\) **are of the same magnitude, but act in opposite directions, on different wires. They constitute an action-reaction pair (Newton's Third Law)**

**Despite the difference in the magnitudes of the currents in both wires, they experience the same magnitude of force per unit length.**

**For wires carrying currents in the same direction, they will be attracted to each other; for wires carrying currents in the opposite directions, they will be repelled from each other.**

**The first person to discover evidence that electricity and magnetism are related phenomena was Danish scientist Hans Christian Ørsted. In the midst of a lecture on electricity, Ørsted noticed that a wire carrying current was able to deflect a compass needle. Furthering Ørsted's experimental work, French scientist Andre-Marie Ampere showed that two parallel wires carrying electric currents attract or repel each other, depending on whether the currents flow in the same or opposite directions, respectively. He generalised the experimental results into physical laws, one of which is in the same form you see at the bottom of page 17 - also known as the Ampere's force law.**

_This is an example how science is an evidence-based, model-building enterprise concerned with the natural world. From the evidence which are observations and experimental findings, Ampere was able to build a model in the form of physical law to describe the relationship or patterns in nature - how the force depends on the current through both the wires._

_This example also shows that_ **creativity is found in all aspects of scientific research, from coming up with a question, creating a research design, interpreting and making sense of findings._

_In recognition of his contributions, the ampere was established as a standard unit of electrical measurement for current._

* The above principle applies to positive charged particles: the only difference being that the forces are in the opposite direction compared to that for negative charges.
* Application: By suitable selection of the ratio of, charged particles of certain velocity may be collected from their undeflected paths. This is the basis on which a velocity selector works.

**Check your Understanding 4**

A beam of electrons enters an electric field at right angles to the field lines while a similar beam enters a magnetic field at right angles to the flux. The electrons in both beams will experience a force due to the fields.

Are the respective forces dependent on the speed of the electrons?

**Example 7**

A method of velocity selection of charged particles is illustrated in the given diagram. Plate P\({}_{1}\) has a hole through which a beam containing electrons of different speeds passes. Parallel to P\({}_{1}\) is plate P\({}_{2}\), also with a hole in it. A uniform magnetic field of flux density \(B\) and a uniform electric field of intensity \(E\) are applied at right angles to each other in the region between the plates as shown.

By adjusting the magnitudes of \(B\) and \(E\), only electrons with a particular speed \(v\) will pass undeflected through the holes in P\({}_{1}\) and P\({}_{2}\).

State and explain at which of the points could the electrons of a speed greater than \(v\) strike plate P\({}_{2}\).

## Appendix 1

### Hall Effect

The Hall effect is the production of a voltage difference (the Hall voltage) across an electrical conductor, transverse to an electric current in the conductor and a magnetic field perpendicular to the current.

he Hall effect comes about due to the nature of the current in a conductor. Current consists of the movement of many small charge carriers, typically electrons, holes, ions or all three. Moving charges experience a force, called the Lorentz force, when a magnetic field is present that is perpendicular to their motion.[22] When such a magnetic field is absent, the charges follow approximately straight, 'line of sight' paths between collisions with impurities, phonons, etc. However, when a perpendicular magnetic field is applied, their paths between collisions are curved so that moving charges accumulate on one face of the material. This leaves equal and opposite charges exposed on the other face, where there is a scarcity of mobile charges. The result is an asymmetric distribution of charge density across the Hall element that is perpendicular to both the 'line of sight' path and the applied magnetic field. The separation of charge establishes an electric field that opposes the migration of further charge, so a steady electrical potential builds up for as long as the charge is flowing.

As a result, the Hall effect is very useful as a means to measure either the carrier density or the magnetic field.

When a current-carrying semiconductor is kept in a magnetic field, the charge carriers of the semiconductor experience a force in a direction perpendicular to both the magnetic field and the current. At equilibrium, a voltage appears at the semiconductor edges.

One very important feature of the Hall effect is that it differentiates between positive charges moving in one direction and negative charges moving in the opposite. The Hall effect offered the first real proof that electric currents in metals are carried by moving electrons, not by protons. The Hall effect also showed that in some substances (especially p-type semiconductors), it is more appropriate to think of the current as positive "holes" moving rather than negative electrons. A common source of confusion with the Hall Effect is that holes moving to the left are really electrons moving to the right.

## Appendix 2 Mass Spectrometer

_Joseph John Thomson_ investigated the deflection of beams of positive ions using parallel electric and magnetic fields to deflect positive ions from a gaseous element. His results demonstrated the existence of isotopes, atoms of an element with different atomic masses.

_Thomson's research on positive ions was taken further and developed into the mass spectrometer which is used to measure atomic masses to 8 significant figures!

The Bainbridge mass spectrometer uses a velocity selector to restrict the speed of the ions in the beam to a narrow range. The ion beam is then deflected by a uniform magnetic field on a circular path.

The deflection of each type of ion can then be calculated by equating the electromagnetic force to the centripetal force acting on the ions.

\[\begin{array}{c}Bqv=mv^{2}/r\\ m=Bqr/v\end{array}\]

Thus ions of different isotopes carrying equal charge at the same speed are deflected on slightly different paths. They are therefore detected at slightly different positions. A modern mass spectrometer uses an electronic detector linked to a computer.
