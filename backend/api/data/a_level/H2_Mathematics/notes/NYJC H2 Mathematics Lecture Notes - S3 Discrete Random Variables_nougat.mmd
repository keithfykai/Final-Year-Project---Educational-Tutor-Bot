### 3.1 Discrete Random Variables

In this unit, students will

\(\bullet\) understand concepts of discrete random variables, probability distributions, expectations and variances.

### 3.2 Discrete Random Variables

Let \(X\) be a variable which has the following properties:

1. It is a discrete variable and can take only values \(x_{1},\ x_{2},\ldots,\ x_{n}\).
2. The probability that \(X\) assumes \(x_{1},\ x_{2},\ldots,\ x_{n}\) are \(p_{1},\ p_{2},\ldots,\ p_{n}\) respectively.

Then \(X\) is a **discrete random variable** if \(\sum_{i=1}^{n}p_{i}=1\).

A stable showing all the possible occurrences and probabilities is called a **probability distribution table**. The function that allocates probabilities \(\mathrm{P}(X=x)\) is known as the **probability density function (p.d.f) of \(X\).

**Chapter S3: Discrete Random Variables**

**Example 1**: Obtain a formula for the probability distribution of the random variable \(X\) defined as the result of rolling a fair six-sided die.

**Solution:**

Since the die is fair, \(\mbox{P}(X=x)=\dfrac{1}{6}\) for \(x=1,2,\ldots,6\). This can be presented by the following table:

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|} \hline \(x\) & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 \\ \hline \(\mbox{P}(X=x)\) & \(\dfrac{1}{6}\) & \(\dfrac{1}{6}\) & \(\dfrac{1}{6}\) & \(\dfrac{1}{6}\) & \(\dfrac{1}{6}\) & \(\dfrac{1}{6}\) \\ \hline \end{tabular}

**Remark:** This is an example of a _uniform distribution_.

**Example 2**: Two tetrahedral dice, each with faces labelled 1, 2, 3 and 4 are thrown and the score, \(X\), is noted, where \(X\) is the sum of the two numbers on which the dice land. Compute the probability distribution table of \(X\).

**Solution:**

The outcome table for \(X\) is as follows:

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|} \hline  & 1 & 2 & 3 \\ \hline
1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 \\ \hline
2 & 3 & 4 & 5 \\ \hline
3 & 4 & 5 & 6 \\ \hline
4 & 5 & 6 & 7 \\ \hline \end{tabular}

From the outcome table, the possible values of \(X\) and \(X\) are 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8.

To find the probability, one can refer to the outcome table and compute them.

The required probability distribution table is as follows:

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|} \hline  & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 & 7 & 8 \\ \hline \(\mbox{P}(X=x)\) & 1 & 1 & 3 & 1 & 3 & 1 & 1 \\ \hline \(\mbox{P}(X=x)\) & 16 & 8 & 16 & 4 & 16 & 8 & 16 \\ \hline \end{tabular}

**Remark:** This distribution is _symmetric_.

**Note:** One way to check your answer is to add up all the probabilities and see if it equates to 1, i.e. \(\sum_{i=1}p(X=x)=1\).

**Example 3**: Three coins are tossed.

**(i)** Construct the probability distribution table for the number of heads obtained.

**(ii)** Write down a formula for the probability distribution function.

**(iii)** Find the probability that there are

**(a)** at least 1 head,

**(b)** not more than 2 heads,

**(c)** at least 1 head but not more than 2 heads,

**(d)** not more than 2 heads given that there is at least 1 head.

**Solution:**

## Chapter S3: Discrete Random Variables

### 3.2 Expectation

**Definition:**

The **expectation** of a discrete random variable \(X\), denoted by \(\mathrm{E}(\!X\!)\), is given by

\[\mathrm{E}(X\!)=\sum_{\mathrm{all}\,x}\mathrm{x}\mathrm{P}(X=x)\,.\]

We often use the symbol \(\mu\) for the expectation, \(\mu=\mathrm{E}(\!X\!)\).

The expectation is another word for the average of the values of \(X\). This definition is motivated by the formula \(\overline{x}=\dfrac{\Sigma f\!x}{\Sigma f}=\sum x\!\left(\dfrac{f}{\Sigma f}\right)\) where \(f\) represent the frequency of the value associated with \(\Sigma f\).

**Remark**: \(\mathrm{E}(\!X\!)\) is a **constant** and not a function of \(X\). \(\mathrm{E}(\!X\!)\) represents the theoretical average (or mean) that is expected if a sufficiently large number of the same experiment were reached.

**Properties of Expectation**:

* If \(a\) and \(b\) are constants, then
* \(\mathrm{E}(a)=a\),
* \(\mathrm{E}(aX)=a\mathrm{E}(X)\) and
* \(\mathrm{E}(aX\pm b)=a\mathrm{E}(X)\pm b\).
* If \(\mathrm{g}(X\!)\) is a function of the discrete random variable \(X\), then
* If \(X\) and \(Y\) are discrete random variables, then

\[\mathrm{E}(aX\pm bY)=a\mathrm{E}(X)\pm bY\]

for constants \(a\) and \(b\).

**Example 7:**

Find the expectation of the random variable \(X\) with the following probability distribution function.

**Solution:**

\[\mathrm{E}(X)=\sum_{\mathrm{all}\,x}\mathrm{P}(X=x)=0(0.03)+1(0.04)+2(0.06)+3(0.12) \quad\mathrm{We}\quad\mathrm{can}\quad\mathrm{also}\quad\mathrm{se}\quad \mathrm{graphing}\quad\mathrm{calculator}\quad\mathrm{to}\quad\mathrm{ compute}\quad\mathrm{the}\quad\mathrm{near}\quad\mathrm{Refer}\quad \mathrm{to}\quad\mathrm{\bf Annex}\quad\mathrm{\bf Annex}\quad\mathrm{for}\quad \mathrm{\bf Annex}\quad\mathrm{for}\quad\mathrm{details}\]

Note that \(\overline{x}\) refers to the mean. In the event when probabilities are entered in \(\mathrm{L}_{2}\), \(\Sigma x\) and \(\Sigma x^{2}\) give the value of \(\mathrm{E}(\!X\!)\) and \(\mathrm{E}(\!X^{2}\!)\) respectively.

**Example 8**: A discrete random variable \(X\) is defined as the result of rolling a fair four-sided die that has sides labelled 1, 2, 3 and 4. Find E(\(X\)), E(\(X^{3}\) ) and E(\(3X-1\)).

**Solution:**

\begin{tabular}{|p{42.7pt}|p{42.7pt}|p{42.7pt}|p{42.7pt}|p{42.7pt}|} \hline We have & & & & \\ \hline \(x\) & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 \\ \hline \(x^{3}\) & 1 & 8 & 27 & 64 \\ \hline \(3x{-}1\) & 2 & 5 & 8 & 11 \\ \hline \(\mathrm{P}(X=x)\) & \(\dfrac{1}{4}\) & \(\dfrac{1}{4}\) & \(\dfrac{1}{4}\) & \(\dfrac{1}{4}\) \\ \hline \end{tabular}

**Thinkzone:**

Check your results using GC.

How can you use the GC in this case to obtain the value of E(\(X^{3}\) ) and E(\(3X-1\))? Refer to **Annex**

**Self-Review 2**:

The random variable \(X\) has distribution given by \(\ \ \mathrm{P}(X=-1)=\dfrac{1}{5}\), \(\ \ \mathrm{P}(X=3)=\dfrac{2}{5}\), \(\ \ \mathrm{P}(X=8)=\dfrac{2}{5}\).

Find (a) E(\(X\)), (b) E(\(X^{2}\) ) and (d) E(\(\dfrac{1}{X}\)). & [4.2, 29.4, 4.6, \(-0.0167\)] \\ \hline \end{tabular}

**Example 9**: In a gambling game, Pascal is paid \(\$a\) if he gets all heads or tails when 3 fair coins are tossed. He (days S3 if either 1 head or 2 heads are shown. Calculate the expected gain when \(\ a=5\). Find the value of \(\dfrac{1}{2}\) such that the game is fair. (Note: A game is fair if the expected gain is 0.)

**Solution:**

\begin{tabular}{|p{42.7pt}|p{42.7pt}|p{42.7pt}|p{42.7pt}|} \hline
**A** & \(\dfrac{1}{2}\) & \(\dfrac{1}{2}\) & \(\dfrac{3}{4}\) & \(\dfrac{1}{2}\) \\ \hline \(\mathrm{Expected\ gain}=\mathrm{E}(X)=5\bigg{(}\dfrac{1}{4}\bigg{)}-3 \bigg{(}\dfrac{3}{4}\bigg{)}=-\bigg{\|}\). & & & \\ \hline \end{tabular}

**Chapter S3: Discrete Random Variables**

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|} \hline \(\mathrm{E}(X)=2p+3p+4(1-2p)=4-3p\) & **Thinkzone:** \\ \(\mathrm{E}(X^{2})=4p+9p+16(1-2p)=16-19p\) & \\ \(\mathrm{Var}(X)=\mathrm{E}(X^{2})-\left[\mathrm{E}(X)\right]^{2}\) & \\ \(=16-19p-(4-3p)^{2}\) & \\ \(=5p-9p^{2}\) & \\ \(=p(5-9p)\) & \\ \(p(5-9p)>2-6p\) & \\ \(\Rightarrow 9p^{2}-11p+2<0\) & \\ \(\Rightarrow(9p-2)(p-1)<0\) & \\ \(\Rightarrow\frac{2}{9}<p<1\) & \\ \hline \end{tabular}

Since \(1\)-\(2p>0\), that is \(p<\frac{1}{2}\). Thus \(\frac{2}{9}<p<\frac{1}{2}\).

**Example 13:** (MB 1976/1/12)

Ten playing cards, two of which are Aces, are lying face down on a table. A player turns the cards over, one by one in random order, and the \(N^{\mathrm{th}}\) card turned over is the first Ace found \(\left(1\leq N\leq\ 9\right)\).

Calculate the probabilities \(\mathrm{P}(N=2)\) and \(\mathrm{P}(N=9)\).

A player pays a stake of $10 to try his luck at finding an ace, if the first card he turns over is an Ace he gets his stake $10 back and in addition he gets aprize of $10. If he fails to find an Ace with his first card, and if he turns a second card, and this is an Ace his $10 stake is returned, but otherwise he gets nothing at all and his stake is lost. Calculate the player's expectation, stating whether it is a gain or a loss.

**Solution:**

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|} \hline \(\mathrm{P}(N=2)=\frac{8}{10}\left(\frac{2}{9}\right)=\frac{8}{45}\) & **Thinkzone:** \\ \(\mathrm{P}(N=9)=\frac{8}{10}\left(\frac{7}{9}\right)=\frac{6}{8}\left(\frac{5 }{7}\right)\left(\frac{4}{6}\right)\left(\frac{3}{5}\right)\left(\frac{2}{4} \right)\left(\frac{1}{3}\right)\left(\frac{2}{2}\right)=\frac{1}{45}\) & There are \(10!\) ways to arrange the cards. If \(N=9\), the first 8 cards are not Aces (8! ways to arrange) while the \(9^{\mathrm{th}}\) and \(10^{\mathrm{th}}\) cards are both aces (2! ways to arrange). \\ \hline \end{tabular}

Since \(\mathrm{E}(Y)<0\), thus the player's expectation is a loss.
