## Role of Water

### Animals

* required for chemical reaction such as hydrolysis of food molecules
* key component for tissue and bodily fluid
* regulation of body temperature through sweat
* allow blood to transport substances

### Plants

* reactant for photosynthesis
* provides physical support to the plant in the form of turgor pressure.
* allow dissolved mineral salts to be transported from roots to other part of plants
* allow sugars to be transported from leaves to other parts of the plant.

**Crabohydrate**

**Monosaccharides**

- **Carohydrates** are organic molecules made up of the elements

carbon, hydrogen and oxygen.

- **Formula: C\({}_{n}\)H\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{n}\)

- 3 broad types of carbohydrate: monosaccharides, disaccharides and polysaccharides

**Monosaccharides**

- **Smallest unit of carbohydrate**

- **Formula: C\({}_{6}\)H\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{6}\)

- **Eg glucose (found in both plants and animal), fructose (found in plants), galactose (milk sugar)**

**Carbohydrate**

**Disaccharides**

* Two monosaccharides and undergo **condensation reaction** to form a disaccharides, with **removal of a water molecule**
* Disaccharides can be broken down to component monosaccharides by **hydrolysis reaction** in which a **water molecule is added.**
* Enzyme is needed for both condensation reaction and hydrolysis reaction.
* Formula: \(\text{C}_{2}\text{H}_{2}\text{C}_{1}\)

**Disaccharides**

**Manosaccharides**

**Maltose**

**glucose + glucose**

**Sucrose**

**glucose + fructose**

**Lactose**

**glucose + galactose**

**Carbohydrate**

**Polysaccharides**

\({}^{\bullet}\) Polysaccharides are formed when thousands of glucose molecules linked together in condensation reactions.

\({}^{\bullet}\) Eg. glycogen, starch and cellulose

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|} \hline  & **glycogen** & **starch** & **cellulose** \\ \hline Functions & storage of carbohydrates in & storage of carbohydrates in & The cellulose is used to make **cell wall in plant cells** \\  & **mammals** & **plants** & from bursting or damage. \\ \hline Location & found in liver and muscles & found in storage organs of & found in plants cells \\  & of mammals & plants eg potato tubers & \\ \hline \end{tabular}

## 1. Model test

### 1. Add **2cm3** of **Benedict's solution** to **2cm3** of solution to be tested.

Footnote 3: [https://github.com/google-research/](https://github.com/google-research/)

1. **Place food substance on a white tile. Solid foods may need to be chopped up to smaller pieces.**

### 2.2. **Add 2-3 drops of dilute iodine solution** to substance to be tested.

**Iodine solution** is yellowish brown, if it changes to blue black, starch is present. If it remains yellowish brown, starch is absent

**Fats**

* Made up of carbon, hydrogen and oxygen.
* No fixed formula, the ratio of hydrogen to oxygen is much higher in fats than in carbohydrates
* One fat molecule contains 1 glycerol to 3 fatty acids, joined together via condensation
* Three molecules of water is needed to breakdown fat molecules into glycerol and fatty acids

**Factions**

(a) Fats are **storage molecules** that can store a large amount of energy. **Each gram of fat** supplies the body with about **9 calories**, more than 4 calories by carbohydrate and protein. Therefore, Hibernating animals store fats as food reserve in cold seasons.

(b) They are also an important **component of cell membranes** and myelin sheath in nerve cells.

(c) Fats are used to make **steroids** and certain **hormones**.

(d) Fats stored as **adipose tissue** are also used as **insulating** material to prevent the loss of **body heat**.

(e) Fat is a **solvent for fat-soluble vitamins**.

(f) Fat serves protective functions by **cushioning vital organs** such as kidney.

(g) Large animals in cold seas have very thick layers of adipose tissues that **gives buoyancy** to aquatic animal. Also provide heat insulation to these animals.

## 1. **Add 2cm3 of sodium hydroxide** solution to 2cm3 food solution.

Shake thoroughly.

Add **1% copper (II) sulfate solution**, **drop by drop**, shaking after every drop. Allow the mixture to stand for 5 minutes.

Copper (II) sulfate is blue, remains blue \(\rightarrow\) protein is absent. Solution changes from blue to violet \(\rightarrow\) protein is present

## 10.1 Enzyme

* Definition: Enzymes are biological catalysts that **speed up the rate of chemical reactions** by **lowering the activation energy** of a chemical reaction, **without being chemically altered** in the reaction.
* Enzymes are required in **small amounts** because they remain **chemically unchanged** in the reactions they catalyse and can be **reused**.
* The active site of an enzyme has a specific shape into which the substrate(s) fit exactly. The shape of the substrate is complementary to the shape of the active site of the enzyme.

## Enzyme

### effect of temperature

1. At low temperatures, enzymes are inactive and the rate of reaction is low. Substrate and enzyme molecules have **little kinetic energy**, hence the frequency of collision is low. In addition, most substrate molecules **do not contain sufficient energy to overcome the activation energy required** to start a reaction.
2. As temperature increases, enzyme and substrate **gain kinetic energy** and they **collide more often**, increasing the **formation of enzyme substrate complex** thus increase rate of reaction. Rate of reaction doubles with every 10\({}^{\circ}\)C rise in temperature.
3. Reaction rate is its **maximum** at enzyme **optimum temperature**.
4. As temperature increases beyond optimum temperature, enzyme is **denatured**. The enzyme **loses its 3D shape** and active site is unable to bind to the substrate. Rate of reaction thus decreases.
5. Denaturation is irreversible even when temperature is lowered. At extremely high temperatures, the enzyme is completely denatured and the rate of reaction drops to zero.

## Enzyme

effect of pH

1. Enzyme activity is the **highest** at the **optimum pH** of the enzyme.
2. As the pH deviates from the optimum, enzyme activity sharply decreases. This is because the **hydrogen bonds and ionic bonds that hold the 3-dimensional structure are disrupted**. The enzyme is denatured and the **shape of the active site is altered**
3. At extreme pH levels, the enzyme is completely denatured and the rate of reaction drops to zero. The optimum pH for each enzyme differs.

## Enzyme

effect of enzyme and substrate concentration

\begin{tabular}{p{142.3pt} p{142.3pt}}  & Enzyme concentration \\  & - Limiting factor at low enzyme concentrations, adding more enzyme increases the rate of reaction. \\  & - With more enzymes present, there are **more active sites for effective collisions** to take place, increasing the **formation of enzyme substrate complex.** \\  & - The rate of reaction is directly proportional to the enzyme concentration **until all substrate have bind to enzyme active sites** \\  & - The rate of reaction becomes **constant** and **reaches a plateau.** \\  & - At this point, **substrate concentration becomes the limiting factor.** \\  & - Substrate concentration \\  & - Limiting factor at low substrate concentration, adding more substrate increases the rate of reaction \\  & - There are many available active sites for effective collisions to occur, when more substrate are present, **more enzyme substrate complex will be formed.** \\  & - At higher substrate concentrations, increasing the amount of substrate cannot increase the rate of reaction as **active sites of enzyme molecules are saturated** \\  & - Rate of reaction becomes **constant** and **reaches a plateau.** \\  & - At this point, **enzyme concentration becomes the limiting factor.** \\ \end{tabular}
