**FUELS & CRUDE OIL**

**FRACTIONAL DISTILLATION OF**

**PETROLEUM**Fossil Fuels and Crude OilFossil fuels are created due to compaction and heat from the remains of aquatic plants and animals. Upon extraction, it is known as crude oil or petroleum, which is a thick black liquid. In order to be used as fuel for planes, cars and cooking, it has to undergo **fractional distillation** first. Natural gas is a colourless gas found near fossil fuels in the earth's crust. Hydrocarbons are compounds that contain **only hydrogen and carbon atoms. Petroleum and natural gas are examples of the hydrocarbons. Petroleum is a mixture of hydrocarbons that has differing numbers of carbon atoms while **natural gas** comprises mainly **methane CH\({}_{4}\)** (up to 90%).

## Competing Use

Petroleum, however, is a **non-renewable and limited resource**. There is a **large demand from the petrochemical industry** as naphtha is used as a **chemical feedstock**. Production of substances such as plastics and drugs will be affected when petroleum eventually runs out.

Recall from 'Chapter 1.2 - Separation Techniques', **fractional distillation** is used to separation solutions with different boiling points.

A similar concept is used to separate the hydrocarbons into the different components!
## Classification of Organic Compounds

A **homologous series** is defined as a family of organic compounds that has

* Same general formula
* Same functional group
* Similar chemical properties (undergo similar chemical reactions)
* Gradual change in physical properties
* Each member differs from the next by -CH\({}_{2}\)

## Functional Group

A **functional group** is an atom or a group of atoms that is responsible for the chemical properties of the molecule:

* C=C bond in alkenes
* -OH group in alcohols
* -COOH group in carboxylic acids
* -COO- group in esters* 21 Petroleum can be separated into fractions by fractional distillation. Which statement about this process is **not** correct? (N2015/P1/Q38) 1. In a fractionating column, the bitumen fraction is obtained below the kerosene fraction. 2. The fraction obtained at the top of the fractionating column has the highest boiling point. 3. The lubricating oil fraction is a source of polishes and waves. 4. The relative molecular masses of the compounds obtained near the bottom of the fractionating column are higher than those of the compounds obtained near the top of the column. ( )

* 42. Petroleum can be separated into fractions using fractional distillation. Which statements are correct? (N2019/P1/Q32)

1 Alkanes used in polishes and waxes have a higher boiling point than those used as diesel fuel.

2 Any of the fractions could be used as fuels because their enthalpy changes of combustion are negative.

3 The fraction used for petrol (gasoline) is extracted from higher up the fractionating column than the fraction used for paraffin (kerosene).

4 The fraction obtained at a particular point in the fractionating column always contains the same compounds in the same ratio.
