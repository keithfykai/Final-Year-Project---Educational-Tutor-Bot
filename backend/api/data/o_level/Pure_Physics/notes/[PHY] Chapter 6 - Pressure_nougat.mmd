## MERCURY BAROMETER

A simple mercury barometer measures atmospheric pressure. The mercury experiences atmospheric pressure outside the column (at Y). The height, X, represents the atmospheric pressure. (76cm Hg) The volume of mercury in the column will increase or decrease with changes in atmospheric pressure such that Pressure at y = Height of X Atmosphere (atm) and centimetres of mercury (cm Hg) are common units for atm pressure At sea level, it is 1 atm or 76cm Hg.

\begin{tabular}{p{199.2pt} p{199.2pt}} \hline Scenario & Explanation \\ \hline Water is used instead & As water's density is much lower than water atmospheres, pressure remains constant, the height of the water column will be much higher. (\(\pm\) 9 ppb) \\ \hline The glass tube is tilted & Pependicular height of mercury column to the reservoir is unchanged as pressure is dependent on the vertical height and not the length of the column. \\ \hline The barometer is brought to a higher altitude & As the air is thinner at higher altitude, atmospheric pressure is lowered, hence, height of mercury column decreases. \\ \hline \end{tabular}

There is a crack in the glass tube along the mercury column above the reservoir

## Appendix A Hydraulic system

A hydraulic system multiplies the effort so a small effort can be used to lift a much greater load.

### Hydraulic system

Pressure throughout the liquid is equal.

### A.1.1 Application: Car Brakes

When a driver steps on the brake pedal, the force on the small piston exerts pressure on the brake fluid.

The brake fluid transmits the pressure to the larger pistons. The pressure exerts a greater force on the larger pistons, which damps the disc and shows down the car.
