**Chapter 17: Radioactivity**

Content:

* The composition of the atom
* Radioactive decay
* Dangers and uses of radioactivity

Learning Outcomes:

Candidates should be able to:

1. describe the composition of an atom in terms of a positively charged nucleus (with protons and neutrons) and negatively charged electrons
2. use the terms proton (atomic) number Z, nucleon (mass) number A and isotope
3. use and interpret the term nuclide and use the nuclide notation \({}^{A}_{Z}X\)
4. show an understanding that nuclear decay is a random and spontaneous process whereby an unstable nucleus loses energy by emitting radiation
5. show an understanding of the nature of alpha (\(\alpha\)), beta (\(\beta\)), and gamma (\(\gamma\)) radiation (including ionising effect and penetrating power) [\(\beta\)-particles are assumed to be \(\beta\)- particles only]
6. show an understanding of background radiation
7. use the term half-life in simple calculations, which might involve information in tables or decay curves
8. state the applications (e.g. medical and industrial uses) and hazards of radioactivity.

### What is the composition of an atom?

* Subatomic particles: protons, neutrons and electrons
* Are held together by: strong attractive forces
* Positively charged nucleus and negatively charged electrons.

* Proton Number Z in a nucleus Example 1 (17A): The nucleus of a radioactive element is represented by \({}^{235}_{92}\)U. (a) How many protons does the neutral atom contain? (b) How many neutrons does the nucleus contain? (a) No. of protons = 92 (b) No. of neutrons = 235
- 92 = 143

### Background Radiation and GM counter

* Ionising radiation: Ionising radiation is radiation with high energies that can knock off electrons from atoms to form ions.
* Background radiation: Background radiation refers to nuclear radiation in an environment where no radioactive source has been deliberately introduced. We encounter background radiation every dayi
* Geiger-Muller Counter (GM Counter) measures number of times a radioactive atoms decay (count).
* SI unit: Becquerel (Bqi)
* One becquerel (1 Bq) is equal to 1 disintegration per second.
* To measure background radiation:

Step 1:

Remove all known radioactive sources.

Step 2

Start the counter and the stopwatch.

Step the counter after 10 minutes and record the number of counts.

Number of counts per minute = number of counts in 10 minutes

Step 4:

Repeat your measurement at least once and calculate an average value.

**Example 4** (17B):

1. A scientist is using a radiation detector connected to a counter to measure the ionising nuclear radiation from a radioactive source. Briefly describe what the scientist should do.
2. The number of counts from the detector when placed in front of a radioactive source for 30 seconds is 1500. What is the count rate in counts/s?
3. The background count rate is 18 counts/min. What is the corrected count rate for the radioactive source in counts/min?

**Half-life**

The **half-life** of a radioactive nuclide is.

**Example 5** (17C):

The amount of radioactivity of sample X is 600 Bq. If the half-life of sample X is six hours, determine the amount of radioactivity of sample X after 18 hours.

**Example 6** (17D):

**Example 7** (**Let's Practise 17.2**):

The amount of radioactivity of a sample decreases from 252 Bq to 63 Bq in 14 days. What is the half-life of the sample?

In a paper rolling mill, the thickness of the paper is monitored by passing beta radiation through the paper. The beta radiation passing through the paper is detected by the detector.

Explain why beta radiation is used.

Would the beta source have a long or short half-life? Explain.
