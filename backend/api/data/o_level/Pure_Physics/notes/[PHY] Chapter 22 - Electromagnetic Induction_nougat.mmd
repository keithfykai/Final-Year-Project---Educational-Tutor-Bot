**Faraday's Law of electromagnetic induction states that the magnitude of the induced e.m.f is proportional to the rate of change of magnetic flux through the circuit.**

(Or proportional to the rate at which the magnetic field lines are cut)

**Magnitude of induced e.m.f increases:**

Increasing the speed of magnet moving through the coil Stronger magnet Increase number of turns on coil* 1. As it rotates in a clockwise manner, it cuts through the magnetic field & an induced current is generated.
* 2. By Fleming's Right Hand rule, an induced current will flow in a clockwise manner around the coil.
* 3. The induced current flows through two slips rings which are connected to the main circuit by the carbon brushes.
* 4. As the coil rotates beyond 180", it continues to rotate in a clockwise manner. However, direction of the current induced in both the coil and the circuit will be reversed.
* 5. Since the **direction of the current changes every time the coil passes the horizontal position**, the current is known as **'alternating current'**.

## Transformeds

Transformers comprise of two separate circuits, connected via a soft iron core which runs through the coils of the two circuits.

As the main voltage for every country is fixed, the transformers are necessary to increase (step up) or decrease (step down) the input voltage such that the output voltage can be suitable for different electrical appliances.

### How a transformer works:

The primary circuit is connected to an A.C supply it creates a magnetic field. These magnetic field lines are concentrated by the soft iron core & directed towards the secondary coil.

As the current at primary circuit is constantly alternating, the constant change in magnetic flux will continuously induce a current in the secondary coil which is used to power a load.

## Half-wave redirection

An **alternating current can be converted in a direct current**

using a diode.

This ensures that current can only flow in a single direction;

however, current is zero every alternate half cycle.
