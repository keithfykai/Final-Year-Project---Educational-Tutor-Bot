Functions of carbohydrates

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|} \hline Function & Description \\ \hline \multirow{2}{*}{Source of energy} & \(\star\) & The average energy yield is 17k/g. Carbohydrates are readily available and easy to digest, hence they are a convenient source of energy. \\ \hline \multirow{2}{*}{Support} & \(\star\) & Some carbohydrates are able to form supporting structures, e.g. cellulose in the cell walls of plants. \\ \hline \multirow{2}{*}{Starting point for the manufacture of other substances} & \(\star\) & Excess carbohydrates can be converted into amino acids and fats. Some may be used to form nucleic acids. \\ \hline \multirow{2}{*}{Production of nectar} & \(\star\) & Carbohydrates are used to produce nectar in flowers. \\ \hline \end{tabular}

Groups of carbohydrates

* There are three main groups of carbohydrates:
* Simple sugars (Monosaccharides)
* Complex sugars

### Monosaccharides

* Monosaccharides are simple sugars which include glucose, fructose (fruit sugar) and galactose (milk sugar).
* All simple sugars have the formula of C6H12O6 but differ in the arrangement of various atoms in the molecule. This gives rise to different chemical and biological properties.
* Glucose is most readily transported in the bodies of organisms. In this way it is easily metabolised when needed, eg. glucose circulating in the blood in human body.

### Disaccharides

* Glucose has to be converted into a transport form before it can be moved from place to place, so that it is less readily consumed.
* Disaccharides are the result of the combination of two simple sugars. All of them have the same chemical formula of C12H2O11.
* Disaccharides are formed during condensation reactions whereby two simple sugars are combined together with the loss of one water molecule.

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|} \hline Type of disaccharide & Description \\ \hline \multirow{2}{*}{Sucrose} & Glucose + Fructose \(\rightarrow\) Sucrose + Water * Sucrose is a common transport form of sugar in plants. It is found in sweet fruits and sugar cane stems; Sucrose is not found in mammals. \\ \hline \multirow{2}{*}{Maltose} & Glucose + Glucose \(\rightarrow\) Maltose + Water * Maltose is formed when starch is partially digested. It is found in barley seeds which can be used during fermentation to produce beer. \\ \hline \multirow{2}{*}{Lactose} & Glucose + Galactose \(\rightarrow\) Lactose + Water * It is found in the milk of all mammals. \\ \hline \end{tabular}

There is no direct test for sucrose as it is a non-reducing sugar and it will not reduce copper(II) sulfate.

It can be hydrolys into glucose and fructose before carrying out the Benedict's test. It is the only sugar that will give a negative Benedict's test before hydrolysis and a positive test afterwards.

To hydrolyse a sample of sucrose, boil it with dilute hydrochloric acid for a few minutes. Then neutralise the solution by adding a small amount of hydrogen carbonate until effervescence stops. Test as before for reducing sugars.

Add a few drops of iodine solution to the food sample.

A complex (called starch-polyiodide) is formed during a positive test and the characteristic blue-black colouration appears.
