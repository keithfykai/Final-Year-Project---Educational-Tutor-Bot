## Introduction

The syllabus is intended to provide students with fundamental mathematical knowledge and skills. The content is organised into three strands, namely, _Number and Algebra_, _Geometry and Measurement_, and _Statistics and Probability_. Besides conceptual understanding and skill proficiency explicated in the content strands, important mathematical processes such as reasoning, communication and application (including the use of models) are also emphasised and assessed.

### AIMS

The O-Level Mathematics syllabus aims to enable all students to:

* acquire mathematical concepts and skills for continuous learning in mathematics and to support learning in other subjects
* develop thinking, reasoning, communication, application and metacognitive skills through a mathematical approach to problem-solving
* connect ideas within mathematics and between mathematics and other subjects through applications of mathematics
* build confidence and foster interest in mathematics.

### Assessment Objectives

The assessment will test candidates' abilities to:

* **Use and apply standard techniques*
* recall and use facts, terminology and notation
* read and use information directly from tables, graphs, diagrams and texts
* carry out routine mathematical procedures
* **Solve problems in a variety of contexts*
* interpret information to identify the relevant mathematics concept, rule or formula to use
* translate information from one form to another
* make and use connections across topics/subtopics
* formulate problems into mathematical terms
* analyse and select relevant information and apply appropriate mathematical techniques to solve problems
* interpret results in the context of a given problem
* **Reason and communicate mathematically*
* justify mathematical statements
* provide explanation in the context of a given problem
* write mathematical arguments

Approximate weightings for the assessment objectives are as follows:

* **A01** & 45%
* **A02** & 40%
* **A03** & 15%
