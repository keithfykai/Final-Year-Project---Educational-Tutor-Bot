### Graphical Representations of Transverse and Longitudinal Waves

The displacement-distance graph shows how the displacements of the particles vary with the distance from the source at _a particular instant in time_.

The _wavelength_ can be determined from the graph. (one complete sine curve or cosine curve)

#### 10.4.2 Displacement-Time Graph

The displacement-time graph shows how the displacement of _a single wave particle_ varies with time.

Displacement from the

equilibrium point / m

For a longitudinal wave, the vertical axis represents horizontal displacement, e.g. positive represents rightwards and negative represents leftwards.

All the particles move in a similar manner with the same _amplitude_ and _frequency_ as the wave. The _period_ can be determined from the graph. (one complete sine curve or cosine curve)1. What is the displacements of Particle A, B and C respectively? 2 m, 1 m, -2 m
2. What is the amplitude of the wave? 2m
3. What is the wavelength of the wave? 8 m (Note: wavelength is the distance of one sine or one cosine curve on the displacement - distance graph)
4. What is the period of the wave? 0.20 s (Note: period is the duration of one sine or one cosine curve on the displacement - time graph)
5. What is the frequency of the wave? 5 Hz
6. What is the speed of the wave? 40 ms-1

### Phase and Phase Difference

Phase is an angle, in degrees (\({}^{\circ}\)) or radians (rad) which gives a measure of the fraction of a cycle that has been completed by an oscillating particle or by a wave. One cycle corresponds to 360 \({}^{\circ}\) or 2 \(\pi\) rad.

Phase difference (\(\Delta\phi\)) is a measure of how much one wave is out of step with another or how much one particle in a wave is out of step with another. It is expressed in terms of angles from 0 \({}^{\circ}\) to 360 \({}^{\circ}\) or 0 to 2\(\pi\) radians.

Two particles are _in phase_ if they are in step with one another. (i.e. phase difference = zero).

Two particles are _out of phase_ if they are _not_ in step with one another. (phase difference # 0).

Two particles are in _anti-phase_, if they are out of phase by half cycle (phase difference = 180\({}^{\circ}\) or \(\pi\) rad.)

**Note**: Particles oscillating in phase need not have the same amplitude but they must have the same frequency.

**e.g. 5**: From the displacement-distance graph below, determine the phase difference between the particle at X and the particle at Y. State which particle is leading.

\[\text{V}=\text{f}\lambda\,\quad\lambda=\frac{\nu}{f}=\frac{320}{400}=0.80\ \text{m}\, \quad\frac{\Delta\phi}{2\pi}=\frac{\Delta x}{\lambda}=\frac{0.20}{0.80}\quad \implies\Delta\phi=\frac{\pi}{2}\]

A 20 W loudspeaker is emitting sound at its full power in all directions. Find:

1. the intensity of sound at a distance 10 m away \[I=\frac{\mathrm{P}}{\mathrm{A}}=\frac{\mathrm{P}}{4\pi\mathrm{r}^{2}}=\frac{20}{4 \pi(10)^{2}}=0.0159\;\mathrm{Wm}^{-2}\]

To get the same intensity when power is halved,

\[I_{1}=K\frac{P_{1}}{\Gamma_{1}^{2}}=-(1)\quad I_{2}=K\frac{P_{2}}{\Gamma_{2}^ {2}}=-(2)\]

\[\frac{(1)}{(2)}\vdots\frac{I_{1}}{I_{2}}=\frac{P_{1}}{P_{2}}\frac{\Gamma_{2}^{ 2}}{\Gamma_{1}^{2}}\]

### Determine the frequency of sound using a calibrated C.R.O.

A signal (of unknown frequency) can be fed through a microphone into a cathode-ray oscilloscope (C.R.O.).

With the time-base of the C.R.O. turned on, the trace on the C.R.O. screen will be a display of the displacement against time.

The time-base can be adjusted to appropriate value so that the period can be determined from the screen. Then the frequency of the signal can be calculated using \(f=\frac{1}{T}\).

#### Functions of C.R.O.

The microphone connected to the c.r.o. is used to pick up the sound produced by the loudspeaker. The input sensitivity setting of the \(y\)-plates (in \(V\) cm\({}^{\text{-1}}\)) and the time-base (in ms cm\({}^{\text{-1}}\)) setting to the \(x\)-plates can be adjusted so as to display an appropriate number of cycles on the c.r.o. screen. The screen is divided into squares marked 1 cm x 1 cm. (Refer to Annex D for more details)

Since 1 cm represents 1.0 ms

Then 4 cm represents 4.0 ms

Therefore period T = 4.0 ms

\(f=\frac{1}{T}=\frac{1}{4.0\times 10^{-3}}=250Hz\)

Figure 9: The following stationary wave pattern is obtained using a C.R.O. whose screen is graduated in centimetre squares. Given that the time-base is adjusted such that 1 cm on the horizontal axis of the screen corresponds to a time of 1.0 ms, find the period and frequency of the wave.

1. The loudspeaker delivers a sound via signal generator. The incident wave is directed towards and is reflected at the reflector plate.
2. _Superposition_ (more details in next chapter) of the incident wave and the reflected wave produces a _stationary wave_ between the loudspeaker and the reflector. When two progressive waves of the same type of equal amplitude, equal frequency, equal wavelength, equal speed travelling in opposite directions meet and undergo superposition with each other, a stationary wave is formed. Vibrational energy of the wave is stored and not transmitted from one point to another. Wave has amplitudes of oscillation varying from maximum at antinodes to zero amplitude at nodes.
3. A microphone, connected to the c.r.o. (with time base switched off), is moved along the straight line between the loudspeaker and the reflector.
4. When the microphone is at positions of minimum amplitude (_nodes_ N) the signal displayed on the c.r.o. is a minimum. When the microphone is at positions of maximum amplitude (_antinodes_ A), the signal displayed on the c.r.o. is a maximum.
5. Several positions of the _antinodes_ and _nodes_ would be observed. The average distance \(d\) between two adjacent _antinodes_ is then determined.
6. The wavelength of the sound can be calculated from \(d=\dfrac{\lambda}{2}\)
7. If the frequency of the sound \(f\) is known, then the speed of the sound wave \(\nu\) = \(f\lambda=f\left(2d\right)\)

**E.g. 10** Find the speed of the sound wave given the following information:

When the microphone moved from the loudspeaker to the reflector, it was found that the distance between antinodes, A\({}_{1}\) and A\({}_{5}\) is 6.6 m.

When the microphone is place at A\({}_{5}\), the following waveform is shown on the CRO with a time-base = 2 ms / div

From 1\({}^{\text{st}}\) Figure

Distance between 2 consecutive antinodes is \(\text{\textasciitifidus{}}\lambda\)

4(\(\text{\textasciitifidus{}}\lambda\)) = 6.6 m

2\(\lambda\) = 6.6 m

\(\lambda\) = 3.3 m

From 2\({}^{\text{nd}}\) Figure

\(\text{T}\) = 5 x 2 x 10\({}^{3}\) = 10 x 10\({}^{3}\) s

\(\text{f}\) = \(\dfrac{1}{T}\) = \(\dfrac{1}{10\times 10^{-3}}\) = 100 Hz

\(\text{v}\) = f \(\lambda\) = (100) (3.3) = 330 ms\({}^{\text{-1}}\)

### Polarisation

If the oscillations in a wave are confined to one direction only, in a plane normal to the direction of transfer of energy of the wave, the wave is said to be polarised in that direction.

\begin{tabular}{c c} Unpolarized & \\ light & Polarizer \\ \end{tabular}

\begin{tabular}{c c} Transmission & \\ axis & light \\ \end{tabular}

**Only** transverse waves may be polarised. Light is an example of a transverse wave that can be polarised.

Consider a rope that is set into vibration in a vertical plane such that it forms a transverse wave. If we place a vertical slit in the path of the wave, it will pass through unaffected. However, if we place a horizontal slit in its path, it will not pass through.

\begin{tabular}{c c} Direction & \\ of rope & \\ vibrations & \\ wave energy travel & \\ \end{tabular}

Such slits are similar to polarisers. A polariser (or Polaroid) is a thin sheet of crystalline material containing long chains of molecules arranged parallel to each other.

\begin{tabular}{c c} Un-polarised & \\ light & Polariser \\ \end{tabular}

\begin{tabular}{c c} Plane-polarised light can be obtained by passing un-polarised light through the polarisers.

9.1 recall and apply Malus' Law, \(I=I_{o}\cos^{2}\theta\), to calculate the intensity of light transmitted by a plane polarizer.

An ideal polariser passes 100% of the incident light polarised parallel to its polarising axis and blocks completely all light polarised perpendicular to this axis. An ideal polariser should transmit 50% of all incident unpolarised light. This is because the incident light is a random mixture of all states of polarisation, the vertical and horizontal components are, on average, equal.

Suppose we place two polarizers between a light source and a photocoll as shown in the Figure. The first polariser has its polarizing axis held vertical. We can rotate the second polarizer (also known as the analyser) so that its polarizing axis makes an angle \(\theta\) with the vertical. The transmitted intensity is a maximum when \(\theta=0^{o}\) (i.e. when the polarizing axes of the filters are parallel). The transmitted intensity is zero when \(\theta=90^{o}\) (i.e. when the filters are 'crossed'). At intermediate values of the angle \(\theta\), only the parallel component of amplitude \(E\cos\theta\) is transmitted. Below is the working to find the transmitted intensity at intermediate values of the angle \(\theta\):

Let \(I_{o}\) be the intensity of light incident on the ideal polarisers and \(I\) is the amount transmitted at an angle \(\theta\). Recall that the intensity of an electromagnetic wave is proportional to the square of the _amplitude_ of the wave, \(I_{o}{}^{\infty}E^{2}\) (1)

\[I\propto(E\cos\theta)^{2}\quad\mbox{ or }\quad I\propto E^{2}\cos^{2}\theta \tag{2}\]

\[\frac{(2)}{(1)}\,;\qquad\quad\frac{I}{I_{0}}=\cos^{2}\theta\]

Thus the intensity of the light transmitted through the analyzer is can be found by Malus' Law

\[I=I_{o}\cos^{2}\theta \tag{6.1}\]

Malus' law applies only if the incident light passing through the analyzer is already linearly polarized.

See Annex E for more details

### 11 Explain why it would not be possible to polarise sound waves.

Only transverse waves can be polarised. However sound waves are longitudinal waves and do _not_ have oscillations in the plane normal to the direction of transfer of energy of the wave. Thus it cannot be polarised.

Given that unpolarized light with intensity \(I_{{}_{o}}\) is incident on a pair of filters, find the intensity of transmitted light after the second filter if the angle between their polarizing axes is \(30^{o}\).

The first polariser transmits 50% of all incident unpolarised light thus \(I_{1}=\frac{1}{2}\,I_{0}\)

After passing through the first polariser, the light is linearly polarised.

Apply Malus' Law for the second polariser, \(I_{2}=I_{1}\cos^{2}\theta\)

The intensity transmitted by the second polariser is \(I_{2}=\frac{I_{o}}{2}\cos^{2}(30^{o})=\frac{I_{o}}{2}\,(\frac{3}{4})=\frac{3}{8 }\,I_{o}\).

## Annex A Electromagnetic Waves

Electromagnetic waves consist of varying electric and magnetic fields. The two fields are perpendicular to each other, always in phase and vibrate with the same frequency (which is the frequency of the wave itself). The two fields are also perpendicular to the motion of the wave.

### Properties of electromagnetic waves:

1. All electromagnetic waves travel in vacuum with the same speed (= 3.0 x 10\({}^{8}\) m s-1)
2. All electromagnetic waves transfer energy from one place to another and can be absorbed/emitted by matter.

Electromagnetic waves differ from one another in their frequency. The classification of electromagnetic waves according to frequency is the electromagnetic spectrum.

### Annex C

#### Intensity of waves (derivation - more for enrichment)

Waves (progressive) transmit energy from one place to another.

As waves travel through a medium, the energy is transmitted as _vibrational_ energy from particle to particle of the medium.

For a sinusoidal wave of frequency \(f\), the particles move in SHM as the wave passes, so each particle has an **energy**_E_,

\[E=\frac{1}{2}\,m(2\pi\hbar^{2}\,x_{o}^{2}\] \[=2\pi^{2}m^{2}\,x_{o}^{2}\]

where \(x_{o}\) is the amplitude of its motion.

Since \(m=\rho V\), where \(\rho\) is the density of the medium and \(V\) its volume,

and \(V=Al\), where \(A\) is the cross-sectional area through which the wave travels and \(f\) is the distance the wave travels in a time \(t\),

and that \(I=\nu t\), where \(\nu\) is the speed of the wave,

\[m=\rho V=\rho\,Al=\rho\,A\,\,\nu t\]

Hence,

\[E=2\pi^{2}\rho\,A\,\,\nu t^{2}\,x_{o}^{2}\]

#### The energy transported by a wave is proportional to the square of the amplitude.

\[E\,\,\propto\,\,x_{o}^{2}\]

Since **power**_P_ is the average rate of transfer of energy,

\[P=\frac{E}{t}=2\pi^{2}\rho\,A\,\,\nu\,f^{2}\,x_{o}^{2}\]

The **intensity**_I_ **intensity**_(I)_ of a wave is the wave energy incident per unit time per unit area normal to the direction of energy transfer. Hence,

\[I=\frac{P}{A} =2\pi^{2}\rho\,\,\nu\,f^{2}\,x_{o}^{2}\] \[I \propto\,\,f^{2}\,x_{o}^{2}\]

#### For constant frequency f,

The intensity of a wave is proportional to the square of the wave amplitude.

\[I\,\propto\,\,x_{o}^{2}\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\, \,\The Cathode Ray Oscilloscope is an electronic instrument used in making electrical measurements. It consists of a cathode ray tube, which is a vacuum tube in which electrons are accelerated and deflected by 2 sets of plate placed at right angles to each other. The charge on the horizontal plates is programmed to change in such a manner that the beam sweeps across the face of the tube at a constant rate. The sound wave is picked up by a microphone, which changes the sound signal to an electric signal that is applied to the vertical plates. The combined effect of the horizontal and vertical plates causes the beam to sweep horizontally and up and down at the same time, resulting in a sinusoidal waveform displayed on the oscilloscope screen.

Polaroid is a material that polarizes light through selective absorption by orientated molecules. This material is fabricated in thin sheets of long-chain hydrocarbons, which are stretched during manufacture so that the molecules align. After the sheet is dipped into a solution containing iodine, the molecules become good electrical conductors. However, the conduction takes place primarily along the hydrocarbon chains, because the valence electrons can move easily along the chains. As a result, the molecules readily absorb light whose electric field vector is parallel to their lengths, and transmit light whose electric field vector is perpendicular to their lengths. It is common to refer to the direction perpendicular to the molecular chain as the transmission axis. In an ideal polarizer, all the light with electric field parallel to the transmission axis is transmitted, and all the light with electric field perpendicular to the transmission axis is absorbed.

Polarization is a characteristic of all transverse waves. Light, a form of electromagnetic waves consist of electric and magnetic fields, oscillating perpendicular to each other and to the direction of propagation. By convention, the direction of polarization is taken to be that of the electric field vector. Light is generally unpolarized, such as incandescent light bulbs and fluorescent light. The light emitted from an individual atom is polarized but when light from a vast number of atoms with random orientations is combined, there is no preferred polarization direction. Thus, the emitted light is a random mixture of waves linearly polarized in all possible transverse directions called **unpolarized light** or natural light.

Radio waves, on the other hand, are usually polarized because an antenna with a definite orientation generates them. For instance, the vertical rod antennas that are used for cellular telephones in automobiles emit waves that are polarized in the vertical direction. Nonetheless, visible light can be polarized, as all other forms of electromagnetic radiation by passing it through a **polarizing filter** (known commercially as 'Polaroid' which is widely used for sunglasses and camera lenses). Light passes through a polarizing filter and emerges with only one allowed electric field orientation. If the polarized light then meets a second filter, with its polarizing direction at right angles to that of the first filter, no light can pass. Two such Polaroid sheets are said to be 'crossed'.

Perhaps, the easiest to understand how a polarizer works in a practical sense is if we use microwaves as an example. Microwaves has wavelengths of a few centimeters, thus a grid of horizontal wires spaced few centimetres apart will block horizontally polarized microwaves because all the energy in the horizontal component of its electric vector is being absorbed making electrons move left and right along the wires. The electric vector orientated in the vertical direction pass through almost unaffected, since electrons cannot move through the air between the wires (Figure below).

* 20 Waves from a point source pass through an area that is 2.0 cm wide, as shown.

Within this area, the intensity of the waves is \(I\) and their amplitude is \(A\). The waves reach a second area of width 16 cm.

What will be the intensity and amplitude of the waves when they reach the second area?

* 20 Ripples on the surface of a pond spread out in circles from the point of an initial disturbance.

Assume that the energy of the wave is spread over the entire circumference of the ripple.

For one such ripple, the amplitude of the ripple at a distance of 150 mm from the disturbance is 2.0 mm.

What will be the amplitude of the ripple at a distance of 1200 mm from the disturbance?

(Assume that no energy is lost in the propagation of the ripple.)
