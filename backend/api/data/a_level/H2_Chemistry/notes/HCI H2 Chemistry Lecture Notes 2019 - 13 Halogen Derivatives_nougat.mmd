## 1 INTRODUCTION

There are only a few naturally-occurring organic halogen compounds. One example is thyroxine, a hormone secreted by the thyroid gland.

Organic halogen compounds are often used as intermediates in organic synthesis; they are readily formed from common materials and can easily be transformed into many different functional groups.

Two main types of halogen compounds will be discussed: halogenalkanes and halogenaenes.

### Halogenoalkanes (alkyl halides)

They are alkanes with one or more H atoms replaced by the halogen atom, F, _CI_, Br or I.

In IUPAC nomenclature, the halogen is considered as a substituent of the hydrocarbon. These compounds are therefore named using the prefixes, fluoro-, chloro-,bromo- and iodo-. Some examples are given below.

Hologenoalkanes may show constitutional isomerism and enantiomerism. For example, there are five isomers with the molecular formula, CaHgBr.

### Physical properties of halogenalkanes

Halogenoalkanes are generally colourless liquids with sweetish smells. They are immiscible with and denser than water. Boiling points of halogenalkanes are higher than those of their corresponding alkanes (alkanes with the same number of carbon atoms). For the same alkyl group, the boiling point increases in the order: chloroalkane < bromoalkane < iodoalkane.

The boiling points of some organic compounds are given below.

## 3 REACTIONS OF HALOGENOALKANES

Halogenoalkanes undergo two types of reactions: nucleophilic substitution and elimination.

### Nucleophilic substitution reactions

Halogenoalkanes are fairly reactive compounds, owing largely to the polarity of the C-X bond. Halogens are more electronegative than carbon, so the carbon-halogen bond is polar. The electron-deficient carbon atom has a partial positive charge which causes it to be attractive to nucleophiles.

During reaction, the halogen atom in the halogenoalkane can be substituted by a nucleophile e.g. OH\({}^{+}\), CN\({}^{-}\) and NH\({}_{3}\). This reaction typical of halogenoalkanes is called **nucleophilic substitution**.

The overall reaction for nucleophilic substitution can be represented as:

In this reaction, the halogen atom leaves as the halide ion, \(X^{-}\). We refer to the halide ion as the leaving group. A leaving group is an anion or molecule that departs with a pair of electrons in a heterolytic bond cleavage.

#### 3.1.1 General mechanisms of nucleophilic substitution mechanisms

Nucleophilic substitution reactions can proceed by either an \(S_{N}\)4 or \(S_{N}\)2 mechanism; Generally, primary halogenoalkanes undergo nucleophilic substitution via the one-step mechanism \(S_{N}\)2 while tertiary halogenoalkanes undergo reactions via the two-step mechanism \(S_{N}\)1. Secondary halogenoalkanes may react via either mechanism.

The nucleophilic attacks the partially positively charged carbon atom from the side opposite to the bromine atom. The nucleophilic donates its lone pair to the electron-deficient carbon so that a bond begins to form between the nucleophilic and the carbon atom.
* At the same time, the C-Br bond is simultaneously weakened and begins to break. Both the bonding electrons in the C-Br bond are donated to the Br atom to form Br-.
* An unstable, activated complex called a **transition state** is formed where the entering nucleophilic and the leaving Br ion are partially bonded to the same carbon atom. Bond breaking and bond forming occur simultaneously. This is a **one-step mechanism**.
* Rate = [RBr][NuT]
* The mechanism is known as Sn2 (**bimolecular nucleophilic substitution**), because two species are involved in the rate determining step of the mechanism.
* The energy profile or reaction pathway diagram for the Sn2 mechanism is given below.

* The C-Br bond in 3-bromo-3-methylhexane is **polar** due to the difference in electronegativity between the carbon and bromine atom.
* In the first step, heterolytic fission of the C-Br bond occurs, giving a **carbonation intermediate** and a bromide ion. The electron-donating alkyl groups help to stabilise the carbonation intermediate.
* In the second step, the highly reactive carbocation is readily attacked by the nucleophile to form the product.
* This is a **two-step mechanism**.
* Rate = \(K\)[RBr]
* The mechanism is known as \(S_{n1}\)(unimolecular nucleophilic substitution) because only one species is involved in the rate determining step of the mechanism.

Since the carbocation is **trigonal planar** with respect to the electron-deficient carbon, the nucleophilic is able to attack from the top and bottom face of the carbocation with **equal probability**. If the addition of the nucleophilic results in a chiral product, a **racemic mixture** is formed in this mechanism as both mirror image enantiomers are formed in equal quantities.

* **S\({}_{n}\)2 in terms of the steric hindrance of the halogenoalkane** The transition state in Sn\({}_{2}\) has five groups arranged around the central carbon atom. It is therefore more crowded than either the starting halogenoalkane or the final product, each of which has only four groups around the central atom. The more alkyl groups there are around the central atom, the more crowded will be the transition state and the higher the activation energy. This will thus slow down the Sn\({}_{2}\) reaction. **The rate of Sn\({}_{2}\) will increase in the order tertiary < secondary < primary.**
* These two effects reinforce each other -- the Sn1 reaction is faster with tertiary halogenoalkanes, while the Sn\({}_{2}\) reaction is faster with primary halogenoalkanes.

**Overall, we expect primary halogenoalkanes to react predominantly by the Sn2 mechanism, tertiary halogenoalkanes to react predominantly by the Sn1 mechanism, and secondary halogenoalkanes to react by a mixture of the two.**
* There are exceptions to the preference in mechanism due to the same electronic and steric considerations. E.g. 1-chloro-2,2-dimethylpropane, (CH\({}_{3}\))\({}_{3}\)CCH\({}_{2}\)_CI_, despite being a primary halogenoalkane, is practically inert to substitution by the Sn2 mechanism because of steric hindrance. On the other hand, (chloromethylbenzene, despite being a primary halogenoalkane, favours substitution by the Sn1 mechanism due to stabilisation of the carbocation intermediate by delocalisation of the positive charge into the benzene ring.

#### 3.1.4 Nucleophilic substitution with NH\({}_{3}\) to form amines

[FIGURE:S3.F1][ENDFIGUR

### Elimination

Halogenoalkanes take part in elimination reactions resulting in the formation of alkenes.

When KOH is dissolved in ethanol, the OH behaves more as a base than a nucleophilic it is able to remove a hydrogen ion from the carbon atom adjacent to the C-X, causing the C-X to break, forming an alkene.

The same reagent (hydroxide ion) can therefore carry out two different types of reaction (nucleophilic substitution or elimination) when reacted with the same halogenalkane. Both reactions do in fact occur at the same time, but the significance of substitution versus elimination varies, depending on the solvent, the nucleophile and the halogenoalkane used.

Figure 3.3: The previous mechanisms showed how a side product, the secondary amine, can be formed from the reaction between ammonia and excess bromomethane. Suggest mechanisms to show how the tertiary amine (CH\({}_{3}\))N and quarternary ammonium salt (CH\({}_{3}\))N*Br\({}^{-}\) may be formed in further reactions with excess bromomethane.

**For your information:**

The major product is the alkene with the largest number of alkyl groups attached to the double-bonded carbon atoms. This is known as _Soytzeff's_ rule. (Also spelt _Zaitsev_ in some books.) Based on _Soytzeff's_ rule, the major product for the above reaction is but:2-ene.

## 4 REACTIONS OF HALOGENOARENES

### Reactivity of halogenarenes

Halogenoarenes are very much less susceptible to nucleophilic substitution than halogenalkanes.

**Reasons:**

**1.** The lone pair of electrons on the halogen atom delocalises into the benzene ring.

**1.** The lone pair of electrons on the halogen atom delocalises into the benzene ring.

### Electrophilic substitution on the benzene ring of halogenorenes

The halogenorenes undergo electrophilic substitution on the benzene ring similar to other arenes. [See Topic 12 Arenes] However, halogenorenes are much less susceptible to electrophilic substitution as the halogen substituent is deactivating. The halogen substituent is also 2,4-directing. The deactivating and directing effects are seen in the nitration of chlorobenzene where a higher temperature is required and two isomers are formed.

## 5 Distinguishing tests for halogenoalkANES

### Comparing colour of AgX precipitate

The general method for distinguishing between the type of halogen substituents present in halogenoalkanes is to compare the colour of the silver halide precipitates that are formed after the compound undergoes nucleophilic substitution by hydroxide ion: The test involves 3 steps:

Step 1: Add NaOH(aq) and heat. [Reaction; RX + OH - ROH + X ]

Step 2: Add excess dilute HNO\({}_{3}\). [Removes unreacted OH - so that brown AgX opt will not be formed in the next step]

Step 3: Add AgNO\({}_{3}\)(aq) and observe the colour of precipitate formed. [ Ag\({}^{\prime}\)(aq) + X\({}^{\prime}\)(aq) - AgX(s) ]

The expected observations (for the positive tests) are given in the table below. Sometimes, the colours of Ag\(Cl\) and AgBr are difficult to differentiate. We can follow up by adding NH\({}_{3}\)(aq); Ag\(Cl\) dissolves in dilute aqueous NH\({}_{3}\) while AgBr does not.

### Comparing rate of formation of AgX precipitate

The three different halogenoalkanes can also be distinguished using ethanolic AgNO\({}_{3}\). In this method, the rates of the formation of the silver halide precipitates will be different. The identity of the halogenoalkane can also be determined from the colour of the AgX precipitate formed.

Figure 11: The identity of the halogenoalkane can also be distinguished using ethanolic AgNO\({}_{3}\). In this method, the rates of the formation of the silver halide precipitates will be different. The identity of the halogenoalkane can also be determined from the colour of the AgX precipitate formed.

## 6 HALOGENOAKANES AND THE ENVIRONMENT

### Uses of halogenoalkanes

Halogenoalkanes are used as refrigerants, aerosol propellants and fire extinguishers.

Fluoroalkanes are less reactive than chloroalkanes due to the high bond energy of the C=F bond. They are more useful in certain applications where their inertness are required, such as non-stick coating on pots and pans and as taps and stoppers in laboratory glassware like burettes and standard flasks. The commercial name for polytetrafluoroethene is Teflon9.

Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), often known by the trade name 'Freons', are used as refrigerants, aerosol propellants and in fire extinguishers.

These compounds have some useful properties:

1. they are inert and non-flammable
2. they are non-toxic
3. they are compounds that liquefy under pressure and therefore vapourise readily when that pressure is released
4. they are odourless

### Effect of CFCs on the ozone layer

#### Depletion of the ozone layer

Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) in aerosol sprays deplete the ozone (O\({}_{3}\)) layer and expose us to ultraviolet radiation from the sun. The O\({}_{3}\) layer absorbs ultraviolet rays and is vital in screening the earth from excess ultraviolet radiation. Too much exposure to ultraviolet radiation causes skin cancer and widespread crop,failure.

Due to the strength of C=F and C=C/I bonds, fluoroalkanes and CFCs are stable molecular entities under ambient conditions, which exhibit low toxicity, low reactivity, and low flammability. However, this lack of reactivity also provides CFCs a lifespan that can exceed 100 years, giving them time to diffuse into the upper stratosphere, where the strong UV radiation will cleave the weaker C=C/I bond (bond energies: C=C/I = +340, vs, C=F = +485 kJ mol\({}^{-1}\)) homolytically to generate reactive C/* radicals, which will catalyse the decomposition of ozone into oxygen, leading to depletion of the ozone layer.

In the stratosphere, oxygen atoms are produced when O\({}_{2}\) absorbs UV light at 250 nm wavelength.

O\({}_{2}\)\(\rightarrow\) 2O

Once oxygen atoms form, they can react with oxygen molecules to produce ozone, which by absorption-of ultraviolet light, decompose to re-form oxygen atoms and oxygen molecules, an equilibrium is set up between the two processes.
