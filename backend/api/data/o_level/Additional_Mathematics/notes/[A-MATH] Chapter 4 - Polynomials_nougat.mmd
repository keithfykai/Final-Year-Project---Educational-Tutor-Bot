* Determine one of the factors of \(f(u)\) using "trial and error"
* if more factors can be determined using "trial and error", then perform this method for the other factors as well
* Although the method of "trial and error" is most typically **fronted upon**, there is a **smart way to perform this "trial and error" method
* Key into the calculator the polynomial to check for all the factors
* Choose one of the factors that gives a beautiful solution (Z or Q) and present that factor as the "tnield" factor
* Presentation of solutions
* Follow the following template to show the **smart "trial and error"**.

Let the factor be \(a\) and \(f(u)=x^{3}-2x^{2}-5+6\) * Claim that x is the factor * Let \(x=a\) * Show that the substitution results in \(0\) * \(f(a)=(a^{3})-2(a)^{2}-5(a)+6=0\) * Write a concluding statement * Hence, by the factor theorem, \((x-a)\) is a factor
