### Introduction

Dynamics is the branch of mechanics where the forces that act on a body are **not in equilibrium**. The vector sum of the forces gives a resultant force that causes the body to accelerate. This resultant force causes change in motion. In Kinematics, we learned how a body would move under constant acceleration, if we combine the knowledge from Dynamics and Kinematics, we will be able to predict the motion of a body when we know the forces acting on the body. In the seventeenth century, Sir Isaac Newton formulated the three Newton's laws of motion and it is the basis behind Newtonian Mechanics. Today, Newtonian mechanics is useful for many engineering efforts in our everyday scale, like how an artillery shell travels in air, and it explains many phenomena observed.

### Newton's 3\({}^{\mbox{\scriptsize\it d}}\) Law of Motion

_Newton's Third Law of Motion_ states that when body A exerts a force on body B, body B will exert an oppositely directed force of equal magnitude on body A.

It should be noted that:

1. Newton's Third Law of Motion involves two different bodies; the 'action and reaction' pair of forces as stated within the law acts on **separate bodies** (if the 'action' acts on body A, then the'reaction' must act on body B).
2. The pair of forces is equal in magnitude and opposite in direction; they must also be of the same type/nature. In other words, if the force that A exerts on B is a gravitational force, then the equal and opposite force exerted by B on A is also a gravitational force.

**In summary:**

The action and reaction pair must

* act on different bodies
* be of the same type/nature
* have equal magnitude and act in opposite direction to one another

_Examples of Newton's Third Law 'Action and Reaction' Pair of Forces_

Action: rocket pushes on _gas_ Reaction: gas pushes on rocket

Action: man pulls on spring Reaction: spring pulls on man

#### 3.1.1 Identifying Action-Reaction Forces

For a book which is lying flat on a table, is the weight of the book and the force which the table acts on the book an action-reaction pair, and why?

_So, what is the action-reaction pair for weight of the book?_

In this context, by Newton's 3rd law, the action and reaction pair must also be a _contact force_, that is the Force on table by book, \(F_{T\,by\,B}\).

_Key Question Although weight of the book is not force by book on table, can their magnitudes be the same? Why?_

**Yes:** From FBD of book, when the book is in equilibrium, \(W_{B}=F_{B\,by\,\tau}\).

**No:** When you throw the book onto the table, the force by the book on table (on impact) is more than the weight of the book, i.e. \(F_{B\,T}>W_{B}\)!

_Thinking question_

The magnitude of the force by the table on book may not always be the same as the weight of the book. Imagine a book placed on the floor of a lift that is accelerating.

#### 3.2.1 Linear Momentum

_Linear momentum_ of a body is defined as the product of its mass and its velocity.

\(\vec{P}=m\vec{v}\)

Linear momentum is a vector quantity and it takes the same direction as the velocity of the body.

Momentum is the property of a body by virtue of its mass and velocity. For a body to gain a larger momentum, it will require more effort to accelerate it. Conversely, the more momentum a body possesses, the harder it will be to stop it.

### Newton's 2nd Law of Motion

_Newton's Second Law of Motion_ states that 1[the rate of change of momentum of a body is directly proportional to the net external force acting on it] and 2[takes place in the direction of the net external force].

\(\frac{d\vec{P}}{dt}\propto\vec{F}_{net}\)

* Since momentum (and hence change in momentum) is a vector quantity, Newton's 2nd Law as stated above can be interpreted in 2 parts as marked with the first part of the statement giving the magnitude of rate of change of momentum (how fast the change in momentum is taking place) while the second part provides the direction in which the change in momentum takes place.

Mathematically,

\(\frac{d\vec{P}}{dt}\propto\vec{F}_{net}\)

\(\frac{d\vec{P}}{dt}=k\vec{F}_{net}\), where \(k\) is the proportionality constant

In the case where SI units are used, \(k=1\). (since 1 N is defined as the force which produces an acceleration of 1 m s\({}^{-2}\) when it is applied to a mass of 1 kg.) Hence,

\(\frac{d\vec{P}}{dt}=\vec{F}_{net}\)Thus _force_ may be defined as the rate of change of momentum.

\[\tilde{F}_{net} =\frac{d\vec{P}}{dt}\] \[=\frac{d(m\vec{v})}{dt}\] \[=m\frac{d\vec{v}}{dt},for\ analysis\ where\ the\ mass\ of\ the\ body\ remains\ constant\] \[\therefore\tilde{F}_{net} =m\vec{a}\]

In analyzing situations in which the mass of the body remains constant, the recommended procedure is as follows:

1. Draw a free body diagram, identify and label all forces acting on the body.
2. Determine the net force acting on the body in the direction of acceleration.
3. Equate the net force to mass \(\times\) acceleration to determine the unknowns. This mass is the mass of the free body considered.
* If a system is moving with velocity \(v\) and acceleration \(a\), all bodies in that system will also move with velocity \(v\) and acceleration \(a\).

_Example 1a_ A car of mass 800 kg is moving up a hill inclined at 30\({}^{o}\) to the horizontal. The total frictional force on the car is 1000 N. Calculate the force \(F\) due to the engine on the car when the car is (a) accelerating up the plane at 2.0 m s\({}^{-2}\). (b) moving with a steady velocity of 15 m s\({}^{-1}\).

**Considering a free body diagram of the car:**

(a) Considering forces acting along the slope, taking the direction up the slope to be positive:

Using Newton's 2\({}^{\text{nd}}\) Law: F\({}_{\text{net}}\) = ma

\(F_{engine}-f-Wsin\) 30\({}^{o}\)

\(F_{engine}=ma+f+Wsin\) 30\({}^{o}\)

\(=(800)(2.0)+1000+(800)(9.81)\sin 30^{o}\)

\(=6520\) N (b) Considering forces acting along the slope, taking the direction up the slope to be positive:

Using Newton's 2\({}^{\text{nd}}\) Law: F\({}_{\text{net}}\) = ma

\(F_{engine}-f-Wsin\) 30\({}^{o}\) = 0

\(F_{engine}=f+Wsin\) 30\({}^{o}\)

\(=1000+(800)(9.81)\sin 30^{o}\)

\(=4920\) N

### Example 2

_Note: To solve this problem, you have to consider the free body diagram of X or Y depending on which one will give you the answer in shortest number of steps._

**STEP 1:**

### Example 3

In the figure shown, masses 4 kg and 6 kg are connected by an inextensible thread looped over a smooth pulley.

Calculate the acceleration of the masses and the tension in the thread.

_Apply "General Approach to Solving Problem"_

_Key question to solving question:_

_What does "connected by an inextensible thread" and "smooth" imply?_

_It means that_ \(m_{l}\) _and_ \(m_{2}\) _share the same acceleration. The tensions acting on_ \(m_{l}\) _and_ \(m_{2}\) _are the same_

_Is the acceleration of the masses g? Why?_

_No. Since_ \(m_{l}\) _and_ \(m_{2}\) _are not free-falling masses (i.e. acted only by their own weights), they do not fall at free-falling acceleration g._

The directions of acceleration should also be "continuous", i.e. if \(m_{l}\) accelerates upwards, \(m_{2}\) accelerates downwards, and vice versa.

By Newton's Second Law,

\(4\) kg mass : (taking upwards positive):

\(F_{net}=ma\)

\(T-(4)(9.81)=4a\)... (1)

Solving (1) and (2)

\(a=1.96\) m s\({}^{2}\)

\(T=47.1\) NExample 4: Three blocks are connected as shown in the figure below on a horizontal frictionless table and pulled to the right with a force \(T_{1}=60\) N. If \(m_{1}=30\) kg, \(m_{2}=20\) kg and \(m_{3}=10\) kg, find the tensions \(T_{2}\) and \(T_{3}\).

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|} \hline \(m_{1}\) & \(T_{3}\) & \(m_{2}\) & \(T_{2}\) & \(m_{1}\) & \(T_{1}=60\) N \\ \cline{2-5} \(10\) kg & & \(20\) kg & & \(30\) kg & \\ \hline \end{tabular}

Clue: All the blocks must be accelerating at the same rate.

Consider a free-body consisting of \(m_{1}\), \(m_{2}\) and \(m_{3}\):

Apply Newton's \(2^{\text{nd}}\) Law \(\rightarrow\) F\({}_{\text{net}}\) = \(T_{1}\) = (60) a \(\rightarrow\) a = 1.0 m s\({}^{2}\)

Consider a free-body consisting of \(m_{2}\) and \(m_{3}\):

Apply Newton's \(2^{\text{nd}}\) Law \(\rightarrow\) F\({}_{\text{net}}\) = \(T_{2}\) = (30)(1.0) = 30 N

Consider a free-body consisting of \(m_{3}\):

Apply Newton's \(2^{\text{nd}}\) Law \(\rightarrow\) F\({}_{\text{net}}\) = \(T_{3}\) = (10)(1.0) = 10 N

### What is "weightlessness"?

We do not experience our weight or the gravitational force by the Earth directly. Instead, it is through the contact force that the **ground exerts on us** that we feel our weight. Normally, when we are on stationary ground, we feel our weight as constant.

However, if we are in an accelerating lift, we begin to feel funny. This is due to the acceleration of the lift. The contact force that the floor exerts on us changes and we feel our 'weight' has changed.

If the lift cable was cut and the lift falls freely, the person then feels the sensation of **'weightlessness'**. When a person experiences **"weightlessness"**, it does not mean that the person has no weight. **'Weightlessness'** refers to the state where the body **does not experience** the effects of **contact forces**. In this case, the lift floor exerts **zero** contact force on the person.

If that person in the falling lift was to stand on a weighing scale, the reading on the scale would read zero. This is because weighing scales **do not measure our weight directly**. Instead, they measure the contact force or pressure our bodies exert on the weighing scale.

Remember your **actual weight** does not change. However, the contact force exerted on the weighing scale can change and hence the reading on the weighing scale changes giving you an **apparent weight**. (i.e. for calculation purposes the **apparent weight** is equal to the contact force on the _weighing scale)_

### Example 5

A man of mass 80 kg stands on a platform scale in a lift.

1. Draw a free-body diagram to show the forces acting on the man. \(N_{Man\ by\ Scalc}\): Normal contact force on man by scale * \(\left|\begin{array}{l}N_{Man\ by\ Scalc}\end{array}\right|\) = \(\left|-F_{scale\ by\ Man}\right|\) * \(F_{scale\ by\ Man}\) gives the reading on the scale \(W_{Man\ by\ earth}\), _Gravitational force on man by earth\(=\) (80)(9.81)=785_ N
2. Calculate the reading on the scale during the motion of the lift: i. Lift is stationary _Lift is going up to a higher level:_ ii. accelerating at 2.0 m s\({}^{\text{-}2}\). iii. moving at a constant speed of 5.0 m s\({}^{\text{-}1}\). iv. decelerating at 2.0 m s\({}^{\text{-}2}\). _Lift is going down to a lower level:_ v. accelerating downwards at 2.0 m s\({}^{\text{-}2}\). vi. moving at constant speed of 5.0 m s\({}^{\text{-}1}\). vi. decelerating at 2.0 ms\({}^{\text{-}2}\). viii. Lift is faulty and free-falling: **Taking vectors in the upward direction to be positive: i.** \(N-W=\mathbf{0}\) \(N=W=\mathbf{mg}=785\) N
2. \(N-W=\mathbf{ma}\) \(N=(\mathbf{80})(\mathbf{2.0})+W\) \(=945\) N

**iii.** \(N-W=0\) \(N=W=785\) N
**iv.** \(N-W=ma\) \(N=(80)(-2.0)+W\) \(=624\) N
**OR:** **Taking vectors in the downward direction to be positive:** **iv.** \(W-N=ma\) \(N=W-(80)(-2.0)\) \(=624\) N
**v.** W-N=ma N = W-ma
**vi.** W-N=0 N = W
**vii.** N-W=ma N = ma +W
**viii.** N-W=ma Free fall \(\Rightarrow\) a =g N - mg = mg N = 0

### Air resistance and Terminal velocity

If there was no air resistance or drag, all objects close to the earth should fall with the same acceleration g.

With air resistance, the **resultant** force experienced by the object is reduced. In this case, it's **W - F\({}_{\text{drag}}\)**. Since, the mass of the object does not change, from Newton's 2\({}^{\text{nd}}\) law, a reduction in the resultant external force will cause the acceleration to be lower. This is why with air resistance an object takes a longer time to fall.

With air resistance:

Using Newton's 2\({}^{\text{nd}}\) law,

Fnet = ma'

W- F\({}_{\text{drag}}\) = ma'

a'= (mg - F\({}_{\text{drag}}\) )/m

= g - F\({}_{\text{drag}}\)/m

Therefore a'\(<\) a or a'\(<\)g.

Now, air resistance **increases** with speed. The faster the object moves, the greater the amount of air resistance it experiences. Initially, when an object falls from rest, it has zero speed and it experiences an acceleration of g. However, as it **accelerates**, it increases in speed and the air resistance **increases**.

This in turn reduces the resultant force experienced by the object until the air resistance is equal to the weight of the object. At this point, the object has **zero** resultant force and **zero** acceleration. The velocity of the object stops increasing and achieves a final value which we call the terminal velocity.

#### Examples of "weightlessness"

* A free-falling parachutist before parachute is deployed (ignoring air resistance)
* A free-falling bungee jumper before the cord experiences tension
* An astronaut in a spacecraft which is in orbit around the Earth

**Note:** In all the examples above, the person is accelerating with g. Their weight is constant. The gravitational force exerted on them is constant.

**Thinking Question:**

Are these examples illustrate "weightlessness" as well?

**a)**: A parachutist falling to earth with his parachute opened. The **harness** of the parachute **pulling** on him.
**b)**: A scuba diver floating underwater. No. He feels the **upthrust** of water.
**c)**: _A bungee jumper when the cord is under tension. No. He feels the **tension** of the cord._

### _Impulse_

Problems in Newtonian mechanics that have been analyzed thus far using concepts of kinematics and forces are generally limited to situations involving a constant net force (and thus a constant acceleration). In the real world, this is seldom the case. Understanding the concept of impulse will allow a better analysis of real world phenomena which usually involves forces that vary with time.

When we exert a force \(F\) on a body for a time period \(t\), it is can be said that an impulse is exerted by the force on the body. The _impulse_ of a force is defined as the integral of a force over the time interval during which the force acts.

Mathematically, the impulse of the force \(F\) acting on the object between times \(t_{I}\) and \(t_{2}\) is given by

\[\mathbf{impulse}=\int_{t_{1}}^{t_{2}}F\,\mathrm{dt}\]

Graphically, impulse is given by the area under the \(F\)-\(t\) graph.

#### 3.6.1 Impulse-Momentum Theorem

Considering Newton's Second Law of Motion,

\[\frac{d\vec{P}}{dt}=\vec{F}_{net}\]

\[\Longrightarrow\int_{t_{1}}^{t_{2}}\vec{F}_{net}\,dt=\Delta\vec{P}\big{|}_{ from\,t_{1}\,to\,t_{2}}\]

The above relationship gives rise to the _impulse-momentum theorem_ which states that the impulse of the net force acting on a body between times \(t_{I}\) and \(t_{2}\) is equal to the body's change in momentum within this time interval.

**Example 6**: When a force F, varying as shown, is applied to a mass of 10 kg, the gain in momentum in 5 s is 40 kg m s\({}^{-1}\).

Determine the value \(x\).

**Change in Momentum = Area under \(F-t\) graph**

\(40=\nicefrac{{1}}{{2}}(5+3)\)\(x\)

\(x=10\) N

#### 3.6.2 Average Force

In situations where forces act only briefly on a body (e.g. the force of the ground on a bouncing ball, impact of a bullet on its target), it is difficult and sometimes impractical to ascertain the variation of the forces with time.

For ease of analysis in such situations, the average force that causes the same change in momentum is usually considered instead.

\[\vec{F}_{net}=\frac{d\vec{P}}{dt}\]\[\langle\vec{F}_{net}\rangle=\frac{\Delta\vec{P}}{\Delta t}\]

\[\therefore\langle\vec{F}_{net}\rangle\Delta t=\Delta\vec{P}\big{|}_{for\ the\ time\ interval\ \Delta t}\]

Graphically, this method of analysis ensures that the area under the \(F\)-\(t\) graph is equal to the area under the \(\langle F_{net}\rangle\)-\(t\) graph for the time interval \(\Delta t\) in which \(F\) acts.

Hence it should be noted that the \(\langle F_{net}\rangle\) determined will, in general, be smaller than the peak force experienced by the body.

_Example 7_

A basketball of mass 0.62 kg is bounced horizontally off a flat vertical surface. The basketball has an initial speed of 9.0 m s-1 and rebounds with a speed of 6.0 m s-1. If the basketball is in contact with the surface for 15 ms, determine the magnitude of the average force the surface exerts on the basketball.

Taking upwards as positive.

\[\begin{array}{l}Resultant\ force\ on\ ball,\ Fract=\frac{\Delta P_{ball}}{ \Delta t}\\ =\frac{m_{ball}\Delta V_{ball}}{\Delta t}\\ =\frac{(0.62)[6.0-(-9.0)]}{15\ \times\ 10^{-3}}=620\ N\\ \end{array}\]

\[\begin{array}{l}\mathbf{F}_{\text{avg}}-\text{mg}=\ Fract=\ 620\\ \mathbf{F}\text{avg}=\mathbf{620}+(0.62)(9.81)=626\ N\\ \end{array}\]

_Example 8_

A conveyor belt is used to transfer luggage at an airport. It consists of a horizontal endless belt running over driving rollers, moving at a constant speed of 1.5 m s\({}^{-1}\). The rate at which baggage is placed on the belt is 20 kg s\({}^{-1}\). What is its value of the driving force \(F\) needed?

**In 1 s, the change in horizontal momentum experienced by the baggage**

\(=m\Delta\nu\)

\(=20\) (\(1.5-0\))

\(=30\) kg m s\({}^{-1}\)

Hence the average force needed (to change the horizontal momentum of the baggage)

\(=\frac{\Delta P_{baggage}}{t}\)

\(=\frac{30}{1}=30\) N

**Example 9**

A jet of water leaves the nozzle of a hose of diameter \(5.0\times 10^{-2}\) m with a speed of 0.400 m s\({}^{-1}\). The water is directed perpendicularly to the wall and it can be assumed that the water does not rebound. The density of water is 1000 kg m\({}^{-3}\).

Calculate the force exerted on the wall by the water. [0.314 N]

Given:

Diameter of hose, \(d\) =5.0 x 10\({}^{-2}\) m

Speed of water, \(\nu\) = 0.400 m s\({}^{-1}\)

Density of water, \(\rho\) = 1000 kg m\({}^{-3}\)

Taking:

Horizontal distance travelled by water, \(L\)

Time taken, \(t\)

Volume of water, \(V\)

Using Newton's 2\({}^{\text{nd}}\) Law,_Force by wall on water_\(=\)\(<F_{net}>\)\(=\)_mass per unit time_\(\times\)\(\Delta\nu\)

\[=\frac{m}{\Delta t}\Delta\nu\)\(=\)\(\frac{\rho(\text{Vol})}{\Delta t}\Delta\nu\)\(\qquad\text{since $m=\rho(\text{Vol})$}\)

\[=\frac{\rho\times\pi(\frac{d}{2}\,\hat{\nu}^{2}L}{t}\Delta\nu\] \[=\)\(\rho\times\pi(\frac{d}{2}\,\hat{\nu}\,\omega\nu\)\(\qquad\text{(Since v=L/t)}\)

\[=\rho\pi(\frac{d}{2}\,\hat{\nu}\nu(0\) - \(\nu\))

\[=\)\(-\)\(\rho\pi(\frac{d}{2}\,\hat{\nu}^{2}\)

\[=\)\(-\)\(\frac{(1000)\pi(5.0\times 10^{-2}\,\hat{\nu}(0.400)\,\hat{\nu}}{4}\)

\[=\)\(-\)\(0.314\) N

By Newton's 3rd Law, Force on wall by water = Force by water by wall = 0.314 N

General Equation: Force on wall by water = \(\rho\text{AV}^{2}\)\(\qquad\) [water does not rebound]

### Example of moving air mass: Helicopter hovering at constant height:

Taking downwards as positive,

Rate of gain in momentum of air =d\(\rho\)/d\(t\)\(\qquad\), downwards (Force on air by helicopter)

By Newton's 3rd law,

Force imparted on helicopter by air, = d\(\rho\)/d\(t\)\(\qquad\), upwards

= Mg, weight of helicopter

when the helicopter is hovering.

### Principle of Conservation of Linear Momentum

Considering Newton's Second Law of Motion,

\[\frac{\text{d}\overline{\text{P}}}{\text{dt}}=\overline{\text{F}}_{\text{net}}\]

and the situation in which no net force acts on a body, then it must follow that that the body will experience no change of linear momentum. This is consistent with Newton's First Law of Motion (which is usually seen as a special case of Newton's Second Law of Motion) and this idea gives rise to the Principle of Conservation of Linear Momentum.

The _Principle of Conservation of Linear Momentum_ states that the total linear momentum of a system of interacting particles remains unchanged provided no net external force acts on the system.

Considering body A with mass \(M_{A}\) and velocity \(U_{A}\) colliding head-on with body B with mass \(M_{B}\) and velocity \(U_{B}\) along a frictionless surface. The duration of impact is \(\Delta t\). After the collision, body A and B move off with velocities \(V_{A}\) and \(V_{B}\) respectively.

By Newton's Third Law of Motion:

\[\vec{F}_{A\;on\;B}=-\vec{F}_{B\;on\;A}\]

In the absence of other forces, \(\vec{F}_{A\;on\;B}=\frac{d\vec{F}_{\;of\;B}}{dt}\) and \(\vec{F}_{\;on\;A}=\frac{d\vec{F}_{\;of\;A}}{dt}\)

\[\therefore\frac{d\vec{P}_{\;of\;B}}{dt} =-\frac{d\vec{P}_{\;of\;A}}{dt}\] \[\frac{\Delta\vec{P}_{\;of\;B}}{\Delta t} =-\frac{\Delta\vec{P}_{\;of\;A}}{\Delta t}\] \[m_{B}V_{B}-m_{B}U_{B} =-(m_{A}V_{A}-m_{A}U_{A})\] \[m_{A}U_{A}+m_{B}U_{B} =m_{A}V_{A}+m_{B}V_{B}\]

The final relationship shows that the total initial momentum before collision is equal to the total final momentum before collision, implying that momentum is conserved!

Do note that although the total momentum of the system (consisting of bodies A and B) remains unchanged, the momenta of body A and body B individually has changed due to the net force that they exert on one another during the collision.

_Example 10_

The diagram shows two trolleys, X and Y, about to collide and gives the momentum of each trolley before the collision.

After the collision, the directions of motion of both trolleys are reversed and the magnitude of the momentum of X is then 2 N s. What is the magnitude of the corresponding momentum of Y?Even as the Principle of Conservation of Linear Momentum is used to analyze collisions, different collisions have their specific characteristics which will in turn yield other relationships that can aid in their analysis.

#### Elastic Collisions

A collision in which no mechanical energy is lost is called an _elastic collision_. As such, _kinetic energies of the colliding bodies are conserved_.

* Considering an elastic head on collision between body A and body B along a frictionless surface:
* Note: In **head-on*
* collisions, the velocity/velocities of the colliding objects are collinear (directed along the same straight line) both before and after the collision.
* Since no external force acts on the 2 body system,
* by Conservation of Linear Momentum, \[m_{A}\vec{U}_{A}+m_{B}\vec{U}_{B} =m_{A}\vec{V}_{A}+m_{B}\vec{V}_{B}\] \[m_{A}\big{(}\vec{U}_{A}-\vec{V}_{A}\big{)} =m_{B}\big{(}\vec{V}_{B}-\vec{U}_{B}\big{)}\,....\,(1)\] \[\succ \text{Since the collision is elastic,}\] by Conservation of Kinetic Energy \[\frac{1}{2}\,m_{A}\vec{U}_{A}^{\ 2}+\frac{1}{2}\,m_{B}\vec{U}_{B}^{\ 2} =\frac{1}{2}\,m_{A}\vec{V}_{A}^{\ 2}+\frac{1}{2}\,m_{B}\vec{V}_{B}^{\ 2}\] \[m_{A}\left(\vec{U}_{A}^{\ 2}-\vec{V}_{A}^{\ 2}\right) =m_{B}\left(\vec{V}_{B}^{\ 2}-\vec{U}_{B}^{\ 2}\right)\] \[m_{A}\big{(}\vec{U}_{A}-\vec{V}_{A}\big{)}\big{(}\vec{U}_{A}+ \vec{V}_{A}\big{)} =m_{B}\big{(}\vec{V}_{B}-\vec{U}_{B}\big{)}\big{(}\vec{V}_{B}+ \vec{U}_{B}\big{)}\,....\,(2)\] \[\frac{(2)}{(1)}\text{:

#### 3.7.3 Special Case: Separation of Objects

* Problems involving separation of objects involve a single mass which separates, such as 'explodes' or splits up.
* By using the principle of conservation of momentum, the directions and the velocities of the different pieces may be analyzed.

**Example 13** (Separation of Objects):

* Calculate the recoil velocity of a 5.0 kg rifle that shoots a 0.020 kg bullet out with a velocity of 620 m s\({}^{-1}\). [2.5 m s\({}^{-1}\)]
* Explain whether the rifle or the bullet has a higher kinetic energy.

* Since \(KE=\nu_{2}\,mv^{2}\) and \(p=mv\), \(KE=p^{2}\,/\,2m\). Since the magnitude of the momentum of the rifle and the bullet is the same, and the mass of the bullet is smaller than that of the rifle, the bullet has a larger kinetic energy.

## 4 Loss of energy during collisions

In most collisions, provided the time of interaction is rather short, momentum is usually conserved. However **some loss in kinetic energy usually takes place**. The loss of kinetic energy is usually converted to sound, heat or other forms of electromagnetic energy.
