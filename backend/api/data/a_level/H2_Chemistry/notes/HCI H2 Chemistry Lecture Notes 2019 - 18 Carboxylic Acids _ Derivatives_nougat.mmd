### 1.1 Nomenclature

Straight chain carboxylic acids are named by replacing the terminal '-e' of the corresponding alkane with "-oic acid". For branched carboxylic acids, find the longest chain containing the -CO\({}_{2}\)H group, and change the terminal '-e' of the parent alkane to the suffix '-oic acid'. The carboxyl carbon is numbered C\({}^{1}\).

Compounds that contain the -CO\({}_{2}\)H group bonded to a ring are named using the suffix 'carboxylic acid'. If the carboxyl group is directly attached to an aromatic ring, the suffix used is 'benzoic acid'. The carbon in the ring that is attached to the -CO\({}_{2}\)H group is numbered C\({}^{1}\).

For aromatic acids which have 2 -CO\({}_{2}\)H groups attached directly to the benzene ring, it is named as dicarboxylic acids:

The characteristic chemical behaviour of carboxylic acids is determined by the carboxyl group.

There are 3 main kinds of reactions that carboxylic acids undergo:

(i) Acid-metal/Acid-base reactions (O-H bond is broken to form salts)

(ii) Nucleophilic (acyl) substitution (replacement of the -OH group)

(iii) Reduction of the CO\({}_{2}\)H group

The C=O and O=H bonds are so close in proximity that carboxylic acids do not behave exactly like alcohols, aldehydes or ketones. For example,

(i) carboxylic acids are stronger acids than alcohols (discussed further in Section 4.1.1)

(ii) carboxylic acids do not undergo nucleophilic addition like aldehydes and ketones and do not give a positive test with 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine and aqueous alkaline iodine. This is because the delocalisation of electrons from the O-H group into the C=O group makes the carboxyl carbon.less electron deficient and less readily attacked by nucleophiles.

### 4.1Acidity of carboxylic Acids

_10 11.7 (c): explain the acidity of carboxylic acids and of chlorine-substituted ethanoic acids in terms of their structures_

Carboxylic acids are weak Bronsted acids. The O-H bond breaks to give H+ and the conjugate base, RCO\({}_{2}\) (carboxylate ion).

As seen in Topic 16 Hydroxy Compounds, the strength of acids depends on the stability of the conjugate base formed.

The conjugate base is negatively charged. The more dispersed the negative charge, the less likely the conjugate base will accept a proton (to re-form the acid), the more stable it is:

The more stable the conjugate base, the greater the extent of acid dissociation, the larger the \(K_{\rm s}\) (the smaller the \(\beta K_{\rm s}\)) and the stronger the acid.

#### 4.1.3 Acid-metal (Redox)/Acid-base reactions

Like inorganic acids, carboxylic acids react with metals, bases, carbonates and bicarbonatees to form salts.

The effervescence of CO\({}_{2}\)with carbonates or bicarbonatees can be used as a _distinguishing test_ for the presence of carboxylic acids. CO\({}_{2}\)forms a white port when bubbled through limewater.

### Reduction to Primary Alcohols

Carboxylic acids are reduced to primary alcohols using lithium aluminium hydride.

The LiA/H\({}_{4}\) must be used in anhydrous conditions! Note that carboxylic acids can only be reduced back to primary alcohols and not aldehydes.

Weaker reducing agents, such as NaBH\({}_{4}\) or H\({}_{2}\) with catalyst, will not work. Refer to Topic 17 Carbonyl Compounds for the comparison between the different reducing agents. With careful consideration of the reducing agents to be used, selective reduction can be done. For example, WA CHO

### Introduction

Carboxylic acid derivatives are compounds in which the \(-\)OH group in the acid is replaced by \(-\)**Y**.

### Chemical Reactivity of carboxylic acid Derivatives

#### 5.4.1 Inductive Effect

A halogen substituent withdraws electrons through inductive effect from the C=O group, thus increases the partial positive charge on the carbon atom. This makes acyl halides more readily attacked by nucleophiles.

An amino group (-NH\({}_{2}\) ) or alkoxy group (-OR\({}^{\prime}\) ) donates electrons to the carbonyl carbon through resonance effect. This decreases the partial positive charge on the carbon atom. Hence, amides and esters are less readily attacked by nucleophiles.

#### 5.4.2 Leaving Group

In general, the weaker the base, the better the leaving group. Halide anions are better leaving groups compared to the hydroxide ion as halides are weaker bases while the hydroxide ion is a stronger base (refer to discussion of leaving groups under nucleophilic substitution of alcohols in Topic 16 Hydroxy Compounds).

Because of these reactivity differences, it is usually possible to convert a more reactive acid derivative into a less reactive one.

### Introduction

Esters are generally sweet-smelling compounds and are widely used as flavourings and perfumes.

Ester linkages also occur naturally in fats and lipids.

Small esters, together with other volatile organic compounds, often give off fragrances that are characteristic of fruits.

Somé esters are pheromones (chemicals that will influence the behavior of animals of the same species): For instance, isoamyl acetate is a pheromone that attracts other bees and is released by a honey, bee’s sting. This serves as a trigger for other bees to congregate and attack!

Fats are made up of triglycerides which are esters of fatty acids, as shown below (the R groups represent long hydrocarbon chains). Saponification is used in making soap from fats.

Saponification involves base (such as NaOH) hydrolysis of triglycerides to form the sodium salt of a carboxylate, which has a long chain hydrocarbon non-polar "tail" and a polar negatively charged "head". These carboxylate salts are effectively soap. Your hands feel slippery when they come into contact with alkalis because of the saponification of fats and oils on your hands. The esters in the oil (triglycerides) undergo saponification in the presence of hydroxide ions and soap is effectively produced!

Esters are prepared industrially mainly for use as essence, perfumes and artificial flavourings, e.g.: (i) ethyl methanoate + rum flavouring (ii) methyl butanoate - apple flavour (iii) propyl pentanoate - pineapple flavour

Esters are also widely used as organic solvents, e.g.: (ii) ethyl ethanoate + paints and varnishes (iii) butyl ethanoate - extraction of penicillin (iii) pentyl ethanoate - nitrocellulose (iii) HWA CHON
