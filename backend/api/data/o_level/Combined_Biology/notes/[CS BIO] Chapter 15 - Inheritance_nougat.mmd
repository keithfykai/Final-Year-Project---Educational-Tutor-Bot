variation

Variations are **differences** in traits between individuals of the same species.

definitions

\begin{tabular}{c p{346.9pt}}
**Gene** & Gene is sequence of DNA nucleotides that stores information used to make a polypeptide, therefore **gene is a unit of inheritance** passed from parents to offspring \\
**Chromosome** & Chromosome is a compact structure visible in the nucleus during cell division and it is **made up of DNA** \\  & The place on the chromosome where the gene is located is called the gene locus. \\
**Allele** & Alleles are **different forms of a gene**. \\  & Alleles of a gene occupy the same locus on a pair of homologous chromosomes. \\  & For example, eye colour gene has brown allele and blue allele \\
**Dominant** & A dominant allele is the allele that is **always expressed in the phenotype**, no matter under homozygous or heterozygous condition. \\
**Recessive** & A recessive allele is the allele that is **only expressed under homozygous recessive condition**. \\
**Codominant** & When both alleles have an equal effect on the phenotype of the offspring. \\  & Both **alleles are expressed** in the phenotype. \\ Homozygous & Organisms having **two identical alleles of a particular gene**. Allele can be either both dominant or both recessive. \\
**Heterozygous** & Organisms having **two different alleles** of a particular gene. \\
**Phenotype** & Phenotype refers to the **expressed trait** in an organism. \\  & The phenotype of an organism is the result of its **genes** and the effects of its **environment**. \\
**Genotype** & A genotype is the **genetic makeup** of an organism. \\  & An organism's genotype is homozygous for a trait if the two alleles controlling the trait are identical, heterozygous for a trait if the alleles controlling the trait are different. \\ \end{tabular}

**Monohybrid Inheritance**

* The gene for flower colour of pea plant has two alleles: dominant purple allele (P) and recessive **white allele** (p)
* When a **homozygous** purple plants (PP) is crossed with a homozygous white plant (p'p'), each organism inherits **one allele** from **the mother** and **one allele from the father** during sexual reproduction
* The offspring generation consisted of **all purple-flowered** plants even though their genotype is **heterozygous (Pp')** as the **dominant purple allele (P) is expressed over recessive white allele
* Self-pollination in the F1 generation produced a F2 generation where the phenotypic ratio of purple-flowered to white-flowered plants is 3:1

**sex determination**

A human cell has 23 pairs of chromosomes and the last pair is the sex chromosomes

In humans, sex is determined by sex chromosomes. Human sex chromosomes are the X chromosome and the Y chromosome.

X chromosome is much larger than the Y chromosome.

Human males have one X chromosome and one Y chromosome (XY genotype) while human females have two X chromosomes (XX genotype)

**Key Concept**

**mutation**

## 6. Introduction

**gene mutation**

**Sickle-Cell anaemia is caused by a change in the sequence of nucleotides coding for haemoglobin**

**It is a recessive condition, which means mutated allele only expresses in homozygous recessive condition**

**Heterozygous individual with one normal allele, one mutated allele are healthy but are carrier**

**Normal red blood cells are flexible and can change their shape in order to pass through capillaries.**

**Mutated gene produces Haemoglobin S (HbS) that tend to clump together, which result in sickle-shaped red blood cells that can block capillaries**

**When oxygen concentration in the blood drops, the red blood cells become sickled-shaped and this lowers their surface area to volume ratio for diffusion of oxygen. Hence, they cannot transport oxygen as effectively as the normal red blood cells.**
