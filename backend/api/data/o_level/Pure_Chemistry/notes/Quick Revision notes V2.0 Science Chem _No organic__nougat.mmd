## 2 Particulate Nature of Matter

* Particles are too small to be seen directly
- There are spaces between particles
- Particles are in **constant random motion**; move in different speeds in different states
- showed in Diffusion * _Rate of diffusion depends on molecular mass and temperature_
* Describes the _arrangement and motion of particles_

\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|c|} \hline Physical State & Solid & Liquid & Gas \\ \hline Arrangement & Orderly, closely packed & Disorderly, closely packed & Disorderly, far apart \\ \hline Motion & Vibrate about fixed position & Slide pass one another & Free to move at high speeds \\  & & & in all direction \\ \hline \end{tabular}

* **Temperature** of a matter is due to the speed/kinetic energy of the particles within it.
* Matter expands due to the **increase in distance between its particles**.
* Matter may be coloured but its particles are not coloured.

## 6 **Mole Concept and Calculation**

Relative atomic mass - **average mass** of one atom compared to the mass of \({}^{1}\!/_{12}\) of a carbon-12 atom Relative molecular mass - average mass of one molecule compared to the mass of \({}^{1}\!/_{12}\) of a carbon-12 atom One mole of a substance contains **6 x 10\({}^{23}\)** particles. (Particles can be atoms, molecules, ions or even electrons)

* **mass of 1 mole** of any substance (in g/mol)
* % by mass of each element present in a compound
* all gases with 1 mole of particles have equal volumes at the **same temperature and pressure**
- Molar gas volume at r.t.p.= **24 dm\({}^{3}\)/mol
* the amount of solute per unit volume of the solution
- g/dm\({}^{3}\)or mol/dm\({}^{3}\) or molarity (M)
* gives **molar ratio** or **volume ratio** of reactants and products
* limits the amount of products formed Empirical formula
- shows the ratio of the type of atoms present Molecular formula
- shows the actual number and type of atoms present Structural formula
- shows how atoms are joined in the molecules

## 7 Periodicity

* Activation energy
* the minimum energy needed to start a reaction
* to break the bonds in the reactants before making new bonds
* a 'barrier' which must be overcome before any reaction can start

Overall heat change of reaction, AH = (Total heat involved in bond breaking) + (Total heat involved in bond making)

### Speed of Reactions

* Measuring speed of reactions by
* measure change in volume of gas evolved over time
* measure change in pressure of gas evolved over time
* measure change in mass of reaction mixture over time

* Factors affecting speed of reactions
* Concentration of solution
* Pressure of gas
* Particle size of solid
* Presence of catalyst
* The factors increase the speed of reaction by
* Increasing frequency of collisions and/or
* Increasing kinetic energy of the reacting particles

**Effects of acid rain**

**Reducing effects of acid rain**

* [noitemsep]
* Make soil acidic \(\simeq\) many plants cannot grow well
* Corrodes buildings and objects made of limestone
* Attacks metal \(\Rightarrow\) galvanised iron corrode faster
* Damages trees by leaching important nutrients from soil
* Acidic water kills fish and other aquatic life

Carbon cycle - involves the processes: combustion, respiration and photosynthesis

Increase emission of carbon dioxide and methane gases increases greenhouse effect and global warming

**Effects of Global Warming**

* [noitemsep]
* Seawater expands and sea levels rise
* Polar ice caps melt and sea levels can rise by over 20 m
* Big changes in global climate
* Floods and droughs, serious shortage of food

**Preventing effects of Global Warming**

* [noitemsep]
* Reduce usage of fossil fuels
* Use more clean methods of producing electricity
* Use of electric vehicles
* International agreements e.g. the Kyoto Protocol in 1997
