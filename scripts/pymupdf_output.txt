Learning Mathematics 
A 21st Century Necessity 
 
Learning mathematics is a key fundamental in every education system that 
aims to prepare its citizens for a productive life in the 21st century.  
As a nation, the development of a highly-skilled and well-educated manpower 
is critical to support an innovation- and technology-driven economy. A strong 
grounding in mathematics and a talent pool in mathematics are essential to support 
the wide range of value-added economic activities and innovations. Many countries 
are paying attention to the quality of their mathematics education. The growing 
interest in TIMSS and PISA speaks of the global interest and importance placed on 
mathematics education.    
At the individual level, mathematics underpins many aspects of our everyday 
activities, from making sense of information in the newspaper to making informed 
decisions about personal finances. It supports learning in many fields of study, 
whether it is in the sciences or in business. A good understanding of basic 
mathematics 
is 
essential 
wherever 
calculations, 
measurements, 
graphical 
interpretations and statistical analysis are necessary. The learning of mathematics 
also provides an excellent vehicle to train the mind, and to develop the capacity to 
think logically, abstractly, critically and creatively. These are important 21st century 
competencies that we must imbue in our students, so that they can lead a productive 
life and be life-long learners. 
Students have different starting points. Not all will have the same interests 
and natural abilities to learn mathematics. Some will find it enjoyable; others will find 
it challenging. Some will find the theorems and results intriguing; others will find the 
formulae and rules bewildering. It is therefore important for the mathematics 
curriculum to provide differentiated pathways and choices to support every learner in 
order to maximise their potential. The curriculum must engage the 21st century 
learners, who are digital natives comfortable with the use of technologies and who 
work and think differently. The learning of mathematics must take into cognisance 
the new generation of learners, the innovations in pedagogies as well as the 
affordances of technologies.  
It is the goal of the national mathematics curriculum to ensure that all students 
will achieve a level of mastery of mathematics that will serve them well in their lives, 
and for those who have the interest and ability, to pursue mathematics at the highest 
possible level. Mathematics is an important subject in our national curriculum. 
Students begin to learn mathematics from the day they start formal schooling, and 
minimally up to the end of secondary education. This gives every child at least 10 
years of meaningful mathematics education.

 Background 
Staying Relevant and Forward Looking 
 
 
As in all previous reviews, the 2010 full-term review aims to update the 
syllabuses so that they continue to meet the needs of our students, build a strong 
foundation in mathematics, and make improvement in the school mathematics 
education. It takes into consideration the analyses of students’ performances in 
national examinations as well as international studies such as TIMSS and PISA. This 
review also takes on board the curriculum-wide recommendations from envisaging 
studies into the overall Singapore curriculum such as seeking a better balance 
between content and skills, creating opportunities to develop 21st century 
competencies, promoting self-directed and collaborative learning through ICT-based 
lessons, and developing assessment to support learning.  
 
It is clear at the start of the review that there is more to be considered than 
just focusing on the content. While there is a need to constantly review what 
students learn, the changes in content will not be the key lever. In fact, little has been 
changed in the content as this has stabilised over the years. Instead, more focus has 
now been given to skills and competencies that will make a better 21st century 
learner – the process of learning becomes more important than just what is to be 
taught and remembered. The syllabuses are therefore written with the view that not 
only will it inform teachers on what to teach, it will also influence the way teachers 
teach and students learn. One key feature of this set of syllabuses is the explication 
of learning experiences, besides the learning outcomes. This gives guidance to 
teachers on the opportunities that students should be given as part of their learning. 
Ultimately, how students learn matters. 
 
Curriculum review and design is ongoing work. The quality of the curriculum is 
as much in its design as in its implementation. Teachers, who are the frontline of 
curriculum delivery, must believe in the value of the changes. Support, resources 
and training will be provided to build capacity in our teachers. All these will be part of 
the continuous effort to deliver the best mathematics curriculum for the students. 
 
The Primary Mathematics Syllabus will be implemented level by level starting 
from Primary One in 2013. The implementation schedule is as follows:

 Goals and Aims 
Different Syllabuses, Different Aims 
 
 
 
The overarching goal of the mathematics curriculum is to ensure that all 
students will achieve a level of mastery of mathematics that will serve them well in 
life, and for those who have the interest and ability, to pursue mathematics at the 
highest possible level.  
 
The broad aims of mathematics education in Singapore are to enable students to: 
 
• acquire and apply mathematical concepts and skills; 
• develop cognitive and metacognitive skills through a mathematical approach 
to problem solving; and 
• develop positive attitudes towards mathematics. 
 
The mathematics curriculum comprises a set of syllabuses spanning 12 years, 
from primary to pre-university, and is compulsory up to the end of secondary 
education. Each syllabus has its own specific set of aims to guide the design and 
implementation of the syllabus. The aims also influence the choice of content, skills 
as well as context to meet the specific needs of the students at the given level or 
course. Each syllabus expands on the three broad aims of mathematics education 
differently to cater for the different needs and abilities of the students (see table of 
aims).  
 
 
What does it mean to teachers? 
 
Understanding the aims of the syllabus helps teachers stay focused on the 
larger outcomes of learning and guides teachers when they embark on the school-
based curriculum innovations and customisations.

Syllabus Design 
Spiral Curriculum, Connected Syllabuses 
 
Mathematics is largely hierarchical in nature. Higher concepts and skills are 
built upon the more foundational ones and have to be learned in sequence. A spiral 
approach is adopted in the building up of content across the levels. 
 
 
The mathematics curriculum consists of a set of connected syllabuses to cater 
to the different needs and abilities of students. This section gives an overview of the 
syllabuses and their connections so that teachers are better able to appreciate the 
mathematics curriculum as a whole.

The Primary Mathematics syllabus assumes no formal learning of 
mathematics. However, basic pre-numeracy skills such as matching, sorting and 
comparing are necessary in providing a good grounding for students to begin 
learning at Primary 1 (P1). 
 
The P1-4 syllabus is common to all students. The P5-6 Standard Mathematics 
syllabus continues the development of the P1-4 syllabus whereas the P5-6 
Foundation Mathematics syllabus re-visits some of the important concepts and skills 
in the P1-4 syllabus. The new concepts and skills introduced in Foundation 
Mathematics is a subset of the Standard Mathematics syllabus. 
 
 
The O-Level Mathematics syllabus builds on the Standard Mathematics 
syllabus. The N(A)-Level1 Mathematics syllabus is a subset of O-Level Mathematics, 
except that it re-visits some of the topics in Standard Mathematics syllabus. The 
N(T)-Level2 Mathematics syllabus builds on the Foundation Mathematics syllabus.  
 
The O-Level Additional Mathematics syllabus assumes knowledge of O-Level 
Mathematics content and includes more in-depth treatment of important topics. The 
N(A)-Level Additional Mathematics is a subset of O-Level Additional Mathematics. 
O-Level Additional Mathematics together with O-Level Mathematics content provide 
the prerequisite knowledge required for H2 Mathematics at the pre-university level. 
 
At the pre-university level, mathematics is optional. The H1 Mathematics 
syllabus builds on the O-level Mathematics syllabus. H2 Mathematics assumes 
some of the O-Level Additional Mathematics content. H3 Mathematics is an 
extension of H2 Mathematics.

Flexibility and Choice 
 
There are two mathematics syllabuses at the P5-6 level. Most students would 
offer Standard Mathematics and for students who need more time to learn, they 
could offer Foundation Mathematics. 
 
There are five mathematics syllabuses in the secondary mathematics 
curriculum. 
O-Level Mathematics, 
N(A)-Level Mathematics 
and 
N(T)-Level 
Mathematics provide students from the respective courses the core mathematics 
knowledge and skills in the context of a broad-based education. The more 
mathematically able students from the N(A) course can choose to take O-Level 
Mathematics in four years instead of five years. Likewise, the more able N(T) 
students can also offer N(A)-Level Mathematics.  The variation in pace and syllabus 
adds to the flexibility and choice within the secondary mathematics curriculum. At the 
upper secondary level, students who have the interests and abilities in mathematics 
may choose to offer Additional Mathematics as an elective at the O-Level or N(A)-
Level. This gives students with an inclination towards and interest in mathematics 
the opportunity to learn more mathematics that would prepare them well for courses 
of study that require higher mathematics.  
 
For students who wish to study in the Engineering-type courses at the 
polytechnics, Additional Mathematics will be a good grounding. The N(A)-Level and 
N(T)-Level Mathematics syllabuses will prepare students well for ITE courses. 
Students who aspire to study Mathematics or mathematics-related courses at the 
universities could offer H2 Mathematics, and if possible H3 Mathematics.  
 
 
What does it mean to teachers? 
 
 Teachers need to have the big picture in mind so that they can better 
understand the role of each syllabus, the connection it makes with the next level and 
the dependency relationship between syllabuses. This enables teachers to better 
understand what they have to do at their level, as well as to plan and advise students 
in their learning of mathematics. For example, H2 Mathematics assumes some of the 
O-Level Additional Mathematics content but may be offered by students without 
Additional Mathematics background as long as effort is made to bridge the gap.

Problem Solving 
Concepts, Skills, Processes, Metacognition, Attitudes 
 
 
The Mathematics Framework has been a feature of our mathematics curriculum 
since 1990, and is still relevant to date. The central focus of the framework is 
mathematical problem solving, that is, using mathematics to solve problems. The 
framework sets the direction for and provides guidance in the teaching, learning, and 
assessment of mathematics at all levels, from primary to pre-university. It reflects 
also the 21st century competencies3. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The framework stresses conceptual understanding, skills proficiency and 
mathematical processes, and gives due emphasis to attitudes and metacognition. 
These five components are inter-related. 
 
Concepts 
 
Mathematical concepts can be broadly grouped into numerical, algebraic, 
geometric, statistical, probabilistic, and analytical concepts. These content 
categories are connected and interdependent. At different stages of learning and in 
different syllabuses, the breadth and depth of the content vary.

To develop a deep understanding of mathematical concepts, and to make 
sense of various mathematical ideas as well as their connections and applications, 
students should be exposed to a variety of learning experiences including hands-on 
activities and use of technological aids to help them relate abstract mathematical 
concepts with concrete experiences.  
 
Skills 
 
Mathematical skills refer to numerical calculation, algebraic manipulation, 
spatial visualisation, data analysis, measurement, use of mathematical tools, and 
estimation. The skills are specific to mathematics and are important in the learning 
and application of mathematics. In today’s classroom, these skills also include the 
abilities to use spreadsheets and other software to learn and do mathematics.  
 
To develop proficiencies in mathematics skills, students should have 
opportunities to use and practise the skills. These skills should be taught with an 
understanding of the underlying mathematical principles and not merely as 
procedures. 
 
Processes 
 
Mathematical processes refer to the process skills involved in the process of 
acquiring and applying mathematical knowledge. This includes reasoning, 
communication and connections, applications and modelling, and thinking skills and 
heuristics that are important in mathematics and beyond. 
 
In the context of mathematics, reasoning, communication and connections 
take on special meanings: 
• Mathematical reasoning refers to the ability to analyse mathematical 
situations and construct logical arguments. It is a habit of mind that can be 
developed through application of mathematics in different contexts. 
• Communication refers to the ability to use mathematical language to 
express mathematical ideas and arguments precisely, concisely and 
logically. It helps students develop their understanding of mathematics and 
sharpen their mathematical thinking. 
• Connections refer to the ability to see and make linkages among 
mathematical ideas, between mathematics and other subjects, and 
between mathematics and the real world. This helps students make sense 
of what they learn in mathematics. 
 
Applications and modelling allow students to connect mathematics that they 
have learnt to the real world, enhance understanding of key mathematical concepts 
and methods, as well as develop mathematical competencies. Students should have 
opportunities to apply mathematical problem-solving and reasoning skills to tackle a 
variety of problems, including open-ended and real-world problems. Mathematical 
 
 
Primary Mathematics

modelling is the process of formulating and improving a mathematical model 4 to 
represent and solve real-world problems. Through mathematical modelling, students 
learn to deal with ambiguity, make connections, select and apply appropriate 
mathematics concepts and skills, identify assumptions and reflect on the solutions to 
real-world problems, and make informed decisions based on given or collected data. 
 
Mathematical Modelling Process (version 2010) 
 
 
 
 
4 A mathematical model is a mathematical representation or idealisation of a real-world situation. It 
can be as complicated as a system of equations or as simple as a geometrical figure. As the word 
“model” suggests, it shares characteristics of the real-world situation that it seeks to represent.

Thinking skills and heuristics are essential for mathematical problem solving. 
Thinking skills are skills that can be used in a thinking process, such as classifying, 
comparing, analysing parts and whole, identifying patterns and relationships, 
induction, deduction, generalising, and spatial visualisation. Heuristics are general 
rules of thumb of what students can do to tackle a problem when the solution to the 
problem is not obvious. These include using a representation (e.g., drawing a 
diagram, tabulating), making a guess (e.g., trial and error/guess and check, making a 
supposition), walking through the process (e.g., acting it out, working backwards) 
and changing the problem (e.g., simplifying the problem, considering special cases).  
 
Metacognition 
 
Metacognition, or thinking about thinking, refers to the awareness of, and the 
ability to control one's thinking processes, in particular the selection and use of 
problem-solving strategies. It includes monitoring of one's own thinking, and self-
regulation of learning. 
 
To develop metacognitive awareness and strategies, and know when and 
how to use the strategies, students should have opportunities to solve non-routine 
and open-ended problems, to discuss their solutions, to think aloud and reflect on 
what they are doing, and to keep track of how things are going and make changes 
when necessary.  
 
Attitudes 
 
Attitudes refer to the affective aspects of mathematics learning such as: 
• beliefs about mathematics and its usefulness; 
• interest and enjoyment in learning mathematics; 
• appreciation of the beauty and power of mathematics; 
• confidence in using mathematics; and 
• perseverance in solving a problem. 
 
Students’ attitudes towards mathematics are shaped by their learning 
experiences. Making the learning of mathematics fun, meaningful and relevant goes 
a long way to inculcating positive attitudes towards the subject. Care and attention 
should be given to the design of the learning activities to build confidence in and 
develop appreciation for the subject. Above all, students’ beliefs can influence their 
attitudes in learning, especially in student-centred learning where students are 
encouraged to take on more responsibility for their own learning. 
 
 
What does it mean to teachers? 
 
The five components of the mathematics framework are integral parts of 
mathematics learning and problem solving. The intent of the framework is to help 
teachers focus on these components in their teaching practice so as to provide a 
more engaging, student-centred, and technology-enabled learning environment, and 
to promote greater diversity and creativity in learning.

Learning Experiences 
It matters how students learn 
 
 
Learning mathematics is more than just learning concepts and skills. Equally 
important are the cognitive and metacognitive process skills. These processes are 
learned through carefully constructed learning experiences. For example, to 
encourage students to be inquisitive, the learning experiences must include 
opportunities where students discover mathematical results on their own. To support 
the development of collaborative and communication skills, students must be given 
opportunities to work together on a problem and present their ideas using 
appropriate mathematical language and methods. To develop habits of self-directed 
learning, students must be given opportunities to set learning goals and work 
towards them purposefully. A classroom, rich with these opportunities, will provide 
the platform for students to develop these 21st century competencies. 
 
Learning experiences are stated in the mathematics syllabuses to influence 
the ways teachers teach and students learn so that the curriculum objectives can be 
achieved. These statements expressed in the form “students should have 
opportunities to …” remind teachers of the student-centric nature of these 
experiences. They describe actions that students will perform and activities that 
students will go through, with the opportunities created and guidance rendered by 
teachers. The descriptions are sufficiently specific to provide guidance yet broad 
enough to give flexibility to the teachers. 
 
For each topic, the learning experiences focus on the mathematical processes 
and skills that are integral parts of learning of that topic. There are also generic 
learning experiences that focus on the development of good learning habits and 
skills such as: 
 
 
Students should have opportunities to: 
 
• take notes and organise information meaningfully; 
• practise basic mathematical skills to achieve mastery; 
• use feedback from assessment to improve learning; 
• solve novel problems using a repertoire of heuristics; 
• discuss, articulate and explain ideas to develop reasoning skills; and 
• carry out a modelling project. 
 
 
These learning experiences, whether they are topical or generic, are not 
exhaustive. Teachers are encouraged to do more to make learning meaningful and 
effective.

Teaching and Learning 
Principles of Teaching and Phases of Learning 
 
 
This section outlines three principles of mathematics teaching and the three 
phases of mathematics learning in the classrooms. 
 
Principles of Teaching 
 
Principle 1 
Teaching is for learning; learning is for understanding; understanding is for reasoning 
and applying and, ultimately problem solving. 
 
 
Teaching is an interactive process that is focused on students’ learning. In this 
process, teachers use a range of teaching approaches to engage students in 
learning; students provide teachers with feedback on what they have learnt through 
assessment; and teachers in turn provide feedback to students and make decisions 
about instructions to improve learning.  
 
The learning of mathematics should focus on understanding, not just recall of 
facts or reproduction of procedures. Understanding is necessary for deep learning 
and mastery. Only with understanding can students be able to reason 
mathematically and apply mathematics to solve a range of problems. After all, 
problem solving is the focus of the mathematics curriculum.  
 
Principle 2 
Teaching should build on students’ knowledge; take cognizance of students’ 
interests and experiences; and engage them in active and reflective learning. 
 
 
Mathematics is a hierarchical subject. Without understanding of pre-requisite 
knowledge, foundation will be weak and learning will be shallow. It is important for 
teachers to check on students’ understanding before introducing new concepts and 
skills.  
 
Teachers need to be aware of their students’ interests and abilities so as to 
develop learning tasks that are stimulating and challenging. This is important in order 
to engage students in active and reflective learning where students participate and 
take ownership of the learning.  
 
Principle 3 
Teaching should connect learning to the real world, harness ICT tools and 
emphasise 21st century competencies. 
 
 
There are many applications of mathematics in the real world. Students 
should have an understanding and appreciation of these applications and how 
mathematics is used to model and solve problems in real-world contexts. In this way, 
students will see the meaning and relevance of mathematics. 
 
 
 
Primary Mathematics 
 
22 
 
Teachers should consider the affordances of ICT to help students learn. ICT 
tools can help students understand mathematical concepts through visualisations, 
simulations and representations. They can also support exploration and 
experimentation and extend the range of problems accessible to students. The ability 
to use ICT tools is part of the 21st century competencies. It is also important to 
design learning in ways that promote the development of other 21st century 
competencies such as working collaboratively and thinking critically about the 
mathematical solution. 
 
 
Phases of Learning 
 
Effective instruction of a unit typically involves three phases of learning: 
Readiness, Engagement and Mastery.  
 
 
Phase 1 - Readiness 
 
Student readiness to learn is vital to learning success. In the readiness phase 
of learning, teachers prepare students so that they are ready to learn. This requires 
considerations of prior knowledge, motivating contexts, and learning environment. 
 
• Prior Knowledge 
For students to be ready to learn, teachers need to know students’ prior 
knowledge in relation to the new learning. This requires knowing whether 
students have the pre-requisite concepts and skills. Some form of 
diagnostic assessment is necessary to check that students are ready to 
learn. 
 
 
Primary Mathematics 
 
23 
 
• Motivating Contexts 
For students to be ready to learn, teachers need to provide motivating 
contexts for learning. These contexts should be developmentally 
appropriate. For example, younger students may like contexts such as 
stories and songs, and play-based activities such as games, whereas 
older students may appreciate contexts related to everyday life so that 
they can see the relevance and meaningfulness of mathematics. For the 
more advanced students, applications in other disciplines can serve as 
motivation for learning. 
 
• Learning Environment   
Shared rules help promote respectful and emotionally-safe interactions 
between teacher and students and among students that are necessary for 
productive and purposeful learning. Established procedures for organising 
students and managing resources will also facilitate a smooth start and 
transitions during lessons. 
 
Phase 2 - Engagement 
 
This is the main phase of learning where teachers use a repertoire of 
pedagogies to engage students in learning new concepts and skills. Three 
pedagogical approaches form the spine that supports most of the mathematics 
instruction in the classroom. They are not mutually exclusive and could be used in 
different parts of a lesson or unit. For example, the lesson or unit could start with an 
activity, followed by teacher-led inquiry and end with direct instruction. 
 
• Activity-based learning   
This approach is about learning by doing. It is particularly effective for 
teaching mathematical concepts and skills at primary and lower secondary 
levels, but is also effective at higher levels. Students engage in activities to 
explore and learn mathematical concepts and skills, individually or in 
groups. They could use manipulatives or other resources to construct 
meanings and understandings. From concrete manipulatives and 
experiences, students are guided to uncover abstract mathematical 
concepts or results. 
 
For example, to develop problem solving skills, students investigate 
whether rectangles with the same perimeter can have different areas. 
Students are given sheets of 1-cm square grids to draw and cut out 
different rectangles of a given perimeter (e.g. 12 cm). They will record the 
length, breadth and area of each rectangle that they have cut out on a 
record sheet. Questions will be posed for students to discuss during the 
activity e.g. ’How do you figure out the length and breadth of a rectangle 
given its perimeter’ ‘What assumptions do you make about the 
length/breadth of the rectangle?’ Students further explore different 
strategies and explain why the strategies work or do not work and finally, 
derive a conclusion as a team. During the discussion, students are also 
encouraged to communicate their ideas using appropriate mathematical 
language. Throughout the activity, the teacher will be observing what the 
students say and do and constantly making the decision on the 
 
 
Primary Mathematics 
 
24 
 
appropriate amount of feedback to be provided to them. Teacher ends the 
activity by summarising and highlighting some of the strategies that 
students use. 
 
 
• Teacher-directed inquiry 
This approach is about learning through guided inquiry. Instead of giving 
the answers, teachers lead students to explore, investigate and find 
answers on their own. Students learn to focus on specific questions and 
ideas and are engaged in communicating, explaining and reflecting on 
their answers. They also learn to pose questions, process information and 
data and seek appropriate methods and solutions. This enhances the 
development of mathematical processes and 21st century competencies.  
 
For example, in teaching the topic on Symmetry, teacher first shows two 
groups of shapes – symmetric and non-symmetric shapes, without 
introducing the concept of symmetry. Students are asked how the shapes 
are classified and how one group is different from the other. Teacher tests 
the rule for classification suggested by students. Eventually, teacher 
guides students to focus on the attributes of symmetric shapes and directs 
them to concept of symmetry. To check whether students understand the 
concept of symmetry, teacher gives students paper cut-outs of symmetric 
and non-symmetric shapes and asks them to classify them in the same 
way. Students can fold the shapes into halves and decide if they are 
symmetrical. They also visualise how a line of symmetry divides a 
symmetric shape into halves that fit exactly over each other. 
 
 
• Direct instruction 
This approach is about explicit teaching. Teachers introduce, explain and 
demonstrate new concepts and skills. Direct instruction is most effective 
when students are told what they will be learning and what they are 
expected to be able to do. This helps them focus on the learning goals. 
Teachers draw connections, pose questions, emphasise key concepts, 
and role-model thinking. Holding students’ attention is critical. Stimuli such 
as videos, graphic images, real-world contexts, and even humour, aid in 
maintaining a high level of attention.  
 
For example, in teaching problem solving, the teacher demonstrates how 
to use Pólya’s four-step problem-solving strategy5 and models thinking 
aloud to make visible the thinking processes. While explaining and 
demonstrating, the teacher also probes students’ understanding of the 
process by asking questions and giving feedback to the students who 
response to the questions. Teachers also use the students’ response to 
modify her explanation and demonstration so that students are better able 
to follow the process. Teachers use additional examples if necessary and 
assign work for students to do on the spot. Teachers check on students’ 
work and selectively pick a few responses for further discussion. During 
 
5 G. Pólya, "How to Solve It", 2nd ed., Princeton University Press, 1957 
 
 
Primary Mathematics 
 
25 
 
lesson closure, the teacher reviews the key learning points of the lesson to 
consolidate the learning. 
 
Phase 3 - Mastery 
 
 
This is the final phase of learning where teachers help students consolidate 
and extend their learning. The mastery approaches include: 
 
• Motivated Practice   
Students need practice to achieve mastery. Practice can be motivating 
and fun. Practice must include repetition and variation to achieve 
proficiency and flexibility. Structuring practice in the form of games is one 
good strategy to make practice motivating and fun, while allowing for 
repetition and variation. There should be a range of activities, from simple 
recall of facts to application of concepts. 
 
• Reflective Review  
It is important that students consolidate and deepen their learning through 
tasks that allow them to reflect on their learning. This is a good habit that 
needs to be cultivated from an early age and it supports the development 
of metacognition. Summarising their learning using concept maps, writing 
journals to reflect on their learning and making connections between 
mathematical ideas and between mathematics and other subjects should 
be encouraged. Sharing such reflections through blogs makes learning 
social. 
 
• Extended Learning   
Students who are mathematically inclined should have opportunities to 
extend their learning. These can be in the form of more challenging tasks 
that stretch their thinking and deepen their understanding.

Assessment in the Classroom 
Supporting Teaching and Learning in Mathematics 
 
 
Role of assessment 
 
Assessment is an integral part of the interactive process of teaching and 
learning, as illustrated in the diagram below. It is an ongoing process by which 
teachers gather information about students’ learning to inform and support teaching. 
An important product of assessment is feedback. Feedback must be timely and rich. 
It must inform students where they are in their learning and what they need to do to 
improve their learning. It must also inform teachers what they need to do to address 
learning gaps and how to improve their instruction.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Range of assessment 
 
Assessments can be broadly classified as summative, formative, and 
diagnostic. 
 
• Summative assessments, such as tests and examinations, measure what 
students have learned. Teachers usually report the assessment result as a 
score or a grade. 
 
• Formative and diagnostic assessments are used as assessment for 
learning to provide timely feedback to students on their learning, and to 
teachers on their teaching.  
 
 
Assessment in the classroom should focus on helping students improve their 
learning. Therefore, they are primarily formative and diagnostic in purpose.

Though teachers are comfortable with the use of traditional pen-and-paper 
tests to find out how much students know and can do, there is value in exploring a 
wider variety of assessment strategies. These strategies allow teachers to gather 
information that is not easily available through traditional methods of assessment, 
but are nevertheless valuable to support learning. Ultimately, the choice of 
assessment strategies must be guided by its purpose, that is, it must be fit-for-
purpose. 
 
 
Integrating assessment with instruction 
 
It is important that teachers know what and when to assess student learning, 
and how to embed the assessment in the learning process. Assessment can be 
integrated into classroom discourse and activities using different assessment 
strategies. For example, teachers may watch students solve problems and get them 
to explain their strategies. Teachers may also engage students in assessing their 
own work and reflecting on their own learning and how to improve it. Both moment-
by-moment assessment and planned assessment should be considered. 
 
Effective questioning can scaffold learning and probe understanding. It 
creates teachable moments for teachers to correct a misconception, reinforce a point 
or expand on an idea. The questions can be open-ended to encourage students to 
consider alternative approaches. Sufficient wait-time is necessary so that students 
can formulate their thoughts, communicate and share their ideas, and hear the ideas 
of others. In the process, students learn to articulate their thinking and deepen their 
understanding, and develop confidence in talking about mathematics and using it. 
Teachers can assess students’ thinking and understanding, and provide useful 
feedback to improve their learning. 
 
Teachers can integrate performance assessments into the instructional 
process to provide additional learning experiences for students. This type of 
assessment requires students to apply their knowledge and skills in context, and the 
focus is on mathematical processes rather than on mathematics content. A rubric is 
useful to show teachers what to look for in students’ work, but more importantly, it 
shows what is expected of students in terms of processes and quality of work. The 
rubric also provides a structured means of giving qualitative feedback. Teachers may 
allow students to assess their own performances so that they can reflect on their 
work and make improvements. 
 
Assessment for learning calls for new ways of assessment in the classroom. It 
involves a change in teachers’ roles and in the expectations of students. By 
integrating assessment and instruction, students will be more engaged in and will 
take greater ownership of their learning.

Strand: Mathematical Processes 
 
Mathematical processes refer to the process skills involved in the process of acquiring 
and applying mathematical knowledge. This includes reasoning, communication and 
connections, applications, and thinking skills and heuristics that are important in 
mathematical problem solving and beyond. 
 
At the primary level, students develop these process skills through problem solving. 
They learn to lay out their working logically; communicate their thoughts clearly both in 
written and oral forms; and reason inductively by observing patterns, similarities and 
differences. They make connections among mathematical ideas, and between 
mathematics and everyday life. Through solving problems in real-world context, 
students see the relevance of mathematics in everyday situations. They formulate 
methods and strategies to solve problems, and develop the habit of checking the 
reasonableness of their answers against the real-world context. Most importantly, they 
develop reasoning and problem solving skills that are essential to lifelong learning. 
 
The teaching of process skills should be deliberate and yet integrated with the learning 
of concepts and skills. Students should be exposed to heuristics and use problem-
solving approaches such as the Polya’s model in class. Teachers could “think aloud” to 
give attention to these processes and make them visible to students. Through practice, 
students will develop habits and strategies that will help them be better and more 
independent learners.
