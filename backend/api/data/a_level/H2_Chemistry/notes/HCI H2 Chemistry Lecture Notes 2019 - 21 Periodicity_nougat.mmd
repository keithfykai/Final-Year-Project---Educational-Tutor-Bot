## 1 Introduction

In this topic, we will study the trends in chemical properties of elements and their compounds. It is essential to recall knowledge from earlier topics on Atomic Structure & Physical Periodicity and Chemical Bonding: ionisation energy trends and electronegativity have an impact on the types of the bonding found in compounds, and this will in turn affect their physical properties. To explain chemical properties and trends, concepts on redox reactions, electrode potential and acid-base behaviour are also relevant.

* The period number is the same as the number of quantum shells. Elements in the same period show a periodic change in their chemical and physical properties across the period.

Thus, knowledge of periodicity is useful in understanding and predicting the physical and chemical behaviour of elements. CHONG

## 3 Variation in Oxidation Number of Period 3 Oxides and Chlorides

_LO (5e)(l): for elements across the third period; state and explain the variation in the highest oxidation number of the elements in oxides (for No,O; MgO; Al,O; Si,O; P,O; Ni,O; Si,O) and chlorides (for NoCl; MgCl, AlCl; Si,O; P,O)_

The following diagram and table summarise the oxidation numbers that are found in the oxides and chlorides of Period 3 elements.

A few trends can be observed across the period:

* Oxidation numbers of the elements in their oxides are always positive (except for fluorine, where O.N. of F is -1 in F,O) as oxygen is the most electronegative element other than fluorine.
* From Na to _CI_, there is a regular increase in the number of O and _CI_ atoms that can combine with an atom of the element.
* The maximum positive oxidation number shown by an element often corresponds to the number of valence electrons in an atom of the element.
* e.g. phosphorus has 5 valence electrons and thus has a maximum oxidation number of +5
* From left to right, the elements show increasing variation in possible oxidation numbers; e.g. in their oxides and chlorides, the metals Na, Mg and Al display only one possible oxidation number each, corresponding to the loss of all their valence electrons.
* P, S and _CI_ exhibit a wider range of oxidation numbers because they can expand their octets (by utilising their vacant _d_-orbitals, which are close enough in energy to their valence electrons to be used for chemical bonding as well). The oxidation number thus depends on the number of electrons used for bonding.

### Structure and bonding of the oxides

_LO 5(e)(ii): state and explain the variation in bonding in oxides in terms of electronegativity_

The trends in physical properties of the oxides can be explained by the gradual change in their structures and bonding.

As we move across the period, the bonding of the oxides changes from ionic to covalent.

This is because the difference in electronegativity between each element and oxygen decreases across the period, hence bonding becomes increasingly covalent. Recall from Topic 2 Chemical Bonding that covalent bonds usually form between atoms of similar electronegativity while atoms with a great difference in electronegativity tend to form ionic bonds. The difference in electronegativity can help us predict if the compound is predominantly ionic or covalent.

### Trend in melting points of the oxides

The trend in melting points of the oxides across the period can be explained by the structure and bonding involved in each oxide.

Figure 1: The trend in melting points of the oxides across the period can be explained by the structure and bonding involved in each oxide.

### Acid-base behaviour of the oxides and hydroxides

_LO S(e)(iii): describe the reactions of the oxides with water_

_(iv): describe and explain the acid/base behaviour of oxides, including, where relevant, amphoteric behaviour in reaction with sodium hydroxide (only) and acids_

_(vi): suggest the types of structure and bonding present in the oxides from observations of their chemical and physical properties_

From their structure and bonding, the oxides of Period 3 elements can be classified into ionic oxides and covalent oxides, ionic oxides tend to act as bases whereas covalent oxides act as acids. Oxides of elements that are near the ionic/covalent boundary tend to form amphoteric oxides - i.e. oxides that can act as acids or bases depending on the conditions.

This section will also cover the acid-base behaviour of the three metal hydroxides, NaOH, Mg(OH)\({}_{2}\) and Al(OH)\({}_{3}\).

**Ionic oxides** contain the O\({}^{2}\) ions in their ionic lattice. The O\({}^{2}\) ions readily hydrolyse in water to form OH\({}^{2}\) ions. Hence, ionic oxides tend to be **basic** in nature:

**Covalent oxides** are usually classified as **acidic** oxides because they form acidic solutions when reacted with water, producing H\({}_{3}\)O\({}^{+}\) and an oxo-anion (i.e. a negatively charged ion containing the element covalently bonded to a number of oxygen atoms, e.g. SO\({}_{4}\)\({}^{-}\) and PO\({}_{4}\)\({}^{3}\)). [Refer to section 4.3.5 on the acidic oxides]

**Table 2. Summary list of period 3 oxides, their bonding and their acid-base nature**

#### 4.3.1 The basic oxides

Sodium oxide and magnesium oxide both react with water and acids, as shown in the table below.

#### 4.3.2 The basic hydroxides

Both sodium and magnesium hydroxides contain the hydroxide ion, OH-, which is a strong base. Thus, they are basic hydroxides, and can react with acids to form salt solutions in a classic neutralisation reaction.

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:12]

#### 4.3.5 The acidic oxides

As we move across the period, the electronegativity difference between each element and oxygen becomes too small for ionic bonds to form. The remainder of the oxides in Period 3 are thus all covalent in nature.

* Silicon dioxide, SiO2, is a macromolecular (i.e. giant covalent) oxide that does not contain the O2-ion and hence shows no basic properties at all. It is, however, weakly acidic in nature, and may react with strong bases, usually requiring more vigorous conditions to help in breaking up the macromolecular lattice (e.g. higher concentrations, temperatures, or pressures).

You may be required to plan experiments to prepare and purify inorganic substances. The separation and purification techniques used in Organic Chemistry are also applicable for inorganic compounds: filtration, extraction, distillation, recrystallization, and melting point determination.

Using aluminium chloride as an example, here is a fully labelled diagram of a laboratory set up used to produce purity and collect an inorganic compound. Of course, the physical state and properties of the desired compound should be considered when designing the experiment.

## 6 Summary of Period 3 Trends

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:26]

#### Factors affecting thermal stability

The thermal stability of the Group 2 carbonates is affected by the polarising power of the cation and the polarisability of the large anion.

* **Polarising power of the cation** Polarising power refers to the ability of a cation to distort the electron cloud of another ion, atom or molecule. In general, the higher the charge density of the cation, the greater the polarising power of the cation and the lower the thermal stability.

* **The small and highly charged M\({}^{2+}\) cation in these Group 2 compounds polarises the anion's larger electron cloud, weakening the covalent bonds within the anion. Hence these compounds decompose on heating as the weakened covalent bonds within the anion are easily broken.**

* **The delocalised electrons are pulled towards the positive** **on Its way to breaking away and becoming carbon dioxide.**

* **For Group 2 carbonates,** Cationicradius increases down the group while charge remains the same. Therefore charge density of cation decreases down the group Polarising power of the cation decreases down the group and is less able to distort the electron cloud of the carbonate, weakening the C-O bonds within the carbonate anion to a smaller extent** **Covalent bonds within the carbonate anion are less likely to be broken down the group The ease of decomposition decreases (or thermal stability increases) down the group so higher temperature is required to decompose the compound**
* **Polarisability of large anion Polarisability refers to the ease with which an anion, atom or molecule's electron cloud can be distorted by another. The greater the polarisability of the anion, the lower the thermal stability.**
The following table shows the products of decomposition of other polyatomic anions.

The following table shows the products of decomposition of other polyatomic anions.

## 7.2.2 Comparison with thermal stability of Group 1 carbonates

The Group 1 carbonates are resistant to decomposition except for LiCO\({}_{3}\). The charge, density of U\({}^{*}\) is high enough to distort the carbonate's electron cloud so that the compound decomposes on heating.

The other Group 1 metal cations have low charge density due to their larger radii and so are unable to sufficiently distort the carbonate's electron cloud. Therefore the carbonates, after lithium do not decompose on heating.

#### 8.3.1 Displacement reactions

In general, a halogen higher in the group can oxidise a halide below it. A more reactive halogen will hence displace a less reactive one from its compounds.

What observation would be made for the following? Explain your answer with the aid of chemical equations; where appropriate.

#### 8.3.2 Reactions with aqueous solutions containing iron(II) ions

in the presence of a halogen oxidising agent, an aqueous solution of Fe\({}^{2+}\) ions can be oxidised to Fe\({}^{2+}\).

By calculating the \(E^{*}_{\text{cell}}\) for the reaction between Fe\({}^{2+}\) and the halogen, show that only chlorine and bromine are able to oxidise Fe\({}^{2+}\) while iodine will not oxidise Fe\({}^{2+}\). (Given \(E^{*}\)(Fe\({}^{2+}\)/Fe\({}^{2+}\)) = +0.77V)

## 9 Diagonal relationships in the periodic table

In the periodic table, certain pairs of diagonally adjacent elements in Period 2 and Period 3 (shown below) show similarities in their properties: They are said to have a diagonal relationship. As a result, the first element of some groups can be seen to have slightly different properties to the rest of the group.

Examples of diagonal relationships:

* Li is the only Group 1 element that can form a nitride salt; all Group 2 elements form nitrides; etc.
* BeO and Al\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{3}\) are both amphoteric; aqueous solutions of Be\({}^{2+}\) and Al\({}^{\prime+}\) are both weakly acidic due to hydrolysis; etc.
* B and Si tend to form covalent compounds rather than forming cations; both B and Si are semiconductors; etc.

ExplanationAs we move across the period and down the group, the properties tend to have opposite trends:

For example, moving across the period, atomic radius decreases, but down the group, atomic radius increases. Similarly, moving across the period, electronegativity increases, while down the group, it decreases;
* Thus, moving _simultaneously_ across the period and down the group by one element results in the combined effects of the opposing trends "cancelling out".

Note that diagonal relationships become less noticeable as we move beyond, the B/Si pair, or below Period 3.
