Singapore-Cambridge General Certificate of Education Advanced Level Higher 1 (2025)

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:2]

## Introduction

Candidates will be assumed to have knowledge and understanding of Chemistry at O-Level, as a single subject or as part of a balanced science course.

This syllabus is designed to place less emphasis on factual material and greater emphasis on the understanding and application of scientific concepts and principles. This approach has been adopted in recognition of the need for students to develop skills that will be of long term value in an increasingly technological world rather than focusing on large quantities of factual material which may have only short term relevance.

Experimental work is an important component and should underpin the teaching and learning of Chemistry.

## Aims

The aims of a course based on this syllabus should be to:

1. provide students with an experience that develops interest in Chemistry and builds the knowledge, skills and attitudes necessary for them to become scientifically literate citizens who are well-prepared for the challenges of the 21st century
2. develop in students the understanding, skills, ethics and attitudes relevant to the _Practices of Science_, including the following: 1. understanding the nature of scientific knowledge 2.2 demonstrating science inquiry skills 2.3 relating science and society
3. develop the way of thinking to explain phenomena, approach and solve problems in chemical systems which involves students in: 1. understanding the structure, properties and transformation of matter at the atomic/molecular level and how they are related to each other
3.2 connecting between the submicroscopic, macroscopic and symbolic levels of representations in explaining and making predictions about chemical systems, structures and properties.

## Practices of Science

Science as a discipline is more than the acquisition of a body of knowledge (e.g. scientific facts, concepts, laws, and theories); it is a way of knowing and doing. It includes an understanding of the nature of scientific knowledge and how this knowledge is generated, established and communicated. Scientists rely on a set of established procedures and practices associated with scientific inquiry to gather evidence and test their ideas on how the natural world works. However, there is no single method and the real process of science is often complex and iterative, following many different paths. While science is powerful, generating knowledge that forms the basis for many technological feats and innovations, it has limitations.

The _Practices of Science_ are explicitly articulated in this syllabus to allow teachers to embed them as learning objectives in their lessons. Students' understanding of the nature and limitations of science and scientific inquiry are developed effectively when the practices are taught in the context of relevant science content. Attitudes relevant to science such as inquisitiveness, concern for accuracy and precision, objectivity, integrity and perseverance should be emphasised in the teaching of these practices where appropriate. For example, students learning science should be introduced to the use of technology as an aid in practical work or as a tool for the interpretation of experimental and theoretical results.

The _Practices of Science_ comprise three components:

### 1 Understanding the Nature of Scientific Knowledge

1 Understand that science is an evidence-based, model-building enterprise concerned with the natural world

2 Understand that the use of both logic and creativity is required in the generation of scientific knowledge

3 Recognise that scientific knowledge is generated from consensus within the community of scientists through a process of critical debate and peer review

4 Understand that scientific knowledge is reliable and durable, yet subject to revision in the light of new evidence

#### 2.2 Demonstrating Science Inquiry Skills

#### 2.1 Identify scientific problems, observe phenomena and pose scientific questions/hypotheses

2 Plan and conduct investigations by selecting the appropriate experimental procedures, apparatus and materials, with due regard for accuracy, precision and safety

#### 2.3 Obtain, organise and represent data in an appropriate manner

#### 2.4 Analyse and interpret data

5 Construct explanations based on evidence and justify these explanations through reasoning and logical argument

#### 2.6 Use appropriate models1 to explain concepts, solve problems and make predictions

Footnote 1: A model is a representation of an idea, an object, a process or a system that is used to describe and explain phenomena that cannot be experienced directly. Models exist in different forms, from the concrete, such as physical scale models, to the abstract, such as diagrams or mathematical expressions. The use of models involves the understanding that all models contain approximations and assumptions limiting their validity and predictive power.

#### 2.7 Make decisions based on evaluation of evidence, processes, claims and conclusions

#### 2.8 Communicate scientific findings and information using appropriate language and terminology

#### 3.1 Relating Science and Society

1 Recognise that the application of scientific knowledge to problem solving could be influenced by other considerations such as economic, social, environmental and ethical factors

2 Demonstrate an understanding of the benefits and risks associated with the application of science to society

3 Use scientific principles and reasoning to understand, analyse and evaluate real-world systems as well as to generate solutions for problem solving

## 1 Ctrriculum Framework

### 1 Core Ideas and Extension Topic

The topics in the H1 Chemistry are organised as two levels underpinned by the _Practices of Science_:

1. [label=()]
2. Core ideas: The three _Core Ideas_ of Chemistry are _Matter_, _Structure and Properties_, and _Transformation_. The concepts in these _Core Ideas_ are inter-related and form the basis for which further learning and understanding of chemical phenomena and reactions is built upon.
3. Extension topic: Concepts in the _Core Ideas_ are applied to real-world context in the study of nanomaterials and polymers.

### 2 Practices of Science

The _Practices of Science_ are common to the natural sciences of physics, chemistry and biology. These practices highlight the ways of thinking and doing that are inherent in the scientific approach, with the aim of equipping students with the understanding, skills, and attitudes shared by the scientific disciplines, including an appropriate approach to ethical issues.

### 3 Learning Experiences

The _Learning Experiences2_ refer to a range of learning opportunities selected by teachers to link the chemistry content with the _Core Ideas_ and the _Practices of Science_ to enhance students' learning of the concepts. Rather than being mandatory, teachers are encouraged to incorporate _Learning Experiences_ that match the interests and abilities of their students and provide opportunities to illustrate and exemplify the _Practices of Science_, where appropriate. Real-world contexts can help illustrate the concepts in chemistry and their applications. Experimental activities and ICT tools can also be used to build students' understanding.

Figure 1: H1 Chemistry Curriculum Framework

## Assessment Objectives

The _Assessment Objectives_ listed below reflect those parts of the _Aims_ and _Practices of Science_ that will be assessed.

### Knowledge with understanding

Candidates should be able to demonstrate knowledge and understanding in relation to:

1. scientific phenomena, facts, laws, definitions, concepts and theories
2. scientific vocabulary, terminology and conventions (including symbols, quantities and units)
3. scientific instruments and apparatus, including techniques of operation and aspects of safety
4. scientific quantities and their determination
5. scientific and technological applications with their social, economic and environmental implications.

The syllabus content defines the factual knowledge that candidates may be required to recall and explain. Questions testing these objectives will often begin with one of the following words: _define, state, name, describe, explain or outline_ (see the _Glossary of Terms_).

### Handling, applying and evaluating information

Candidates should be able (in words or by using symbolic, graphical and numerical forms of presentation) to:

1. locate, select, organise and present information from a variety of sources
2. handle information, distinguishing the relevant from the extraneous
3. manipulate numerical and other data and translate information from one form to another
4. analyse and evaluate information so as to identify patterns, report trends and conclusions, and draw inferences
5. present reasoned explanations for phenomena, patterns and relationships
6. apply knowledge, including principles, to novel situations
7. bring together knowledge, principles, concepts and skills from different areas of chemistry, and apply them in a particular context
8. evaluate information and hypotheses
9. construct arguments to support hypotheses or to justify a course of action
10. demonstrate an awareness of the limitations of Chemistry theories and models.

These _Assessment Objectives_ cannot be precisely specified in the syllabus content because questions testing such skills may be based on information which is unfamiliar to the candidate. In answering such questions, candidates are required to use principles and concepts that are within the syllabus and apply them in a logical, reasoned or deductive manner to a novel situation. Questions testing these objectives will often begin with one of the following words: _predict, suggest, construct, calculate_ or _determine_ (see the _Glossary of Terms_).

## Additional Information

### Data Booklet

_A Data Booklet_ is available for use in the theory papers. The booklet is reprinted at the end of this syllabus document.

### Nomenclature

Candidates will be expected to be familiar with the nomenclature used in the syllabus. The proposals in "_Signs_, _Symbols and Systematics_" (The Association for Science Education Companion to 16-19 Science, 2000) will generally be adopted although the traditional names sulfate, sulfite, nitrate, nitrite, sulfurous and nitrous acids will be used in question papers. Sulfur (and all compounds of sulfur) will be spett with f (not with ph) in question papers, however candidates can use either spelling in their answers.

### Units and significant figures

Candidates should be aware that misuse of units and/or significant figures, i.e. failure to quote units where necessary, the inclusion of units in quantities defined as ratios or quoting answers to an inappropriate number of significant figures, is liable to be penalised.

### Disallowed Subject Combinations

Candidates may not simultaneously offer Chemistry at H1 and H2 levels.

Chemistry is about the study of matter, its interactions and transformations. At a macroscopic level, we observe matter and its interactions everywhere in our daily life. The microscopic level looks at the structure of matter that gives rise to these interactions. At O-Level, students have been introduced to the fundamental idea that matter is made up of particles and the simple atomic model (electrons in discrete shells around a positively charged nucleus). This allows students to apply the key ideas of conservation of matter and energy in the quantitative treatment of reactions such as stoichiometry and thermochemistry.

At A-Level, an in-depth study of the electronic structure of atoms provides the basis for the study of chemical bonding. The Valence Shell Electron Pair Repulsion (VSEPR) model is used to visualise the three-dimensional structure of molecules, which determines the type of interactions possible and also helps to explain the physical and chemical properties. Knowledge of structure and bonding is also important to study and predict trends in properties of matter and its reactions.

Transformation of matter involves the study of the feasibility (energetics and kinetics considerations) and extent of chemical reactions (concept of equilibrium). The energetics dimension builds upon prior knowledge of thermochemistry, mainly enthalpy changes (\(\Delta\)_H_). The chemical kinetics facet of a reaction can be understood quantitatively by relating the rate of reaction to concentration of reactants. The qualitative aspect which deals with the factors affecting rate of reactions will be covered based on the collision theory.

The concepts in chemical energetics and kinetics will form the basis for the study of Chemical Equilibrium. Theoretically all reactions are reversible, and the notion of dynamic equilibrium will be introduced. The concept of equilibrium constant (_K_) is understood via the equilibrium expression, which gives a measure of the extent of a reversible reaction. Factors which determine the position of equilibrium will also be examined. Chemical equilibria in aqueous media involving acids and bases will be dealt with in greater depth, in view of the relevance and prevalence of these concepts in real world contexts.

The extension topic on materials features applications of core concepts to a real-world context where specific examples, such as graphene and plastics, provide the opportunity for students to apply their knowledge on structure and bonding to understand the properties and uses of these materials.

This curriculum framework provides students the opportunity to appreciate the connections between the concepts in the _Core Ideas_ of **Matter**, **Structure and Properties**, and **Transformation**, and to apply these to the study of materials in the _Extension Topic_.

#### Preamble

Although there are features of organic chemistry that are distinctive, it is intended that appropriate cross-references with other sections/topics in the syllabus should be made.

When describing preparative reactions, candidates will be expected to quote the reagents, e.g. aqueous NaOH, the essential practical conditions, e.g. reflux, high temperature and pressure, and the identity of each of the major products. Detailed conditions involving specific temperature and pressure values are **not** required.

Detailed knowledge of practical procedures is also **not** required: however, candidates may be expected to suggest (from their knowledge of the reagents, essential conditions and products) what steps may be needed to purify/extract a required product from the reaction mixture. In equations for organic redox reactions, the symbols [O] and [H] are acceptable.

Candidates will be expected to be able to predict the reaction products of a given compound in reactions that are chemically similar to those specified in the syllabus.

#### Content

* Empirical, molecular and structural formulae

**Full Structural or Displayed Formula**: detailed structure of molecule showing the relative placing of atoms and the number of bonds between them, e.g.

**Skkeletal Formula**: simplified representation of an organic formula derived from the structural formula by removing hydrogen atoms (and their associated bonds) and carbon atoms from alkyl chains, leaving just the carbon-carbon bonds in the carbon skeleton and the associated functional groups.

Skeletal or partial skeletal representations may be used in question papers and are acceptable in candidates' answers where they are unambiguous, e.g.

The convention for representing the aromatic ring is preferred.

## Mathematical Requirements

It is assumed that candidates will be competent in the techniques described below.

Make calculations involving addition, subtraction, multiplication and division of quantities.

Make approximate evaluations of numerical expressions.

Express small fractions as percentages, and vice versa.

Calculate an arithmetic mean.

Transform decimal notation to power of ten notation (standard form).

Use calculators to evaluate logarithms (for pH calculations), squares, square roots, and reciprocals.

Change the subject of an equation. (Most such equations involve only the simpler operations but may include positive and negative indices and square roots.)

Substitute physical quantities into an equation using consistent units so as to calculate one quantity. Check the dimensional consistency of such calculations, e.g. the units of a rate constant \(k\).

Solve simple algebraic equations.

Comprehend and use the symbols/notations \(<,>,\)\(\approx,/,\Delta,\)\(\equiv,\overline{x}\) (or \(<\)\(x\)\(>\)).

Test tabulated pairs of values for direct proportionality by a graphical method or by constancy of ratio.

Select appropriate variables and scales for plotting a graph, especially to obtain a linear graph of the form \(y=mx+c\).

Determine and interpret the slope and intercept of a linear graph.

Choose by inspection a straight line that will serve as the 'least bad' linear model for a set of data presented graphically.

Understand (i) the slope of a tangent to a curve as a measure of rate of change, (ii) the 'area' below a curve where the area has physical significance, e.g. Boltzmann distribution curves.

Comprehend how to handle numerical work so that significant figures are neither lost unnecessarily nor used beyond what is justified.

Estimate orders of magnitude.

Formulate simple algebraic equations as mathematical models, e.g. construct a rate equation, and identify failures of such models.

### Calculators

Any calculator used must be on the Singapore Examinations and Assessment Board list of approved calculators.

## Glossary of Terms

It is hoped that the glossary (which is relevant only to science subjects) will prove helpful to candidates as a guide, i.e. it is neither exhaustive nor definitive. The glossary has been deliberately kept brief not only with respect to the number of terms included but also to the descriptions of their meanings. Candidates should appreciate that the meaning of a term must depend in part on its context.

1. _Define (the term(s)...)_ is intended literally, only a formal statement or equivalent paraphrase being required.
2. _What do you understand by/What is meant by (the term(s)...)_ normally implies that a definition should be given, together with some relevant comment on the significance or context of the term(s) concerned, especially where two or more terms are included in the question. The amount of supplementary comment intended should be interpreted in the light of the indicated mark value.
3. _State_ implies a concise answer with little or no supporting argument, e.g. a numerical answer that can be obtained 'by inspection'.
4. _List_ requires a number of points, generally each of one word, with no elaboration. Where a given number of points is specified, this should not be exceeded.
5. _Explain_ may imply reasoning or some reference to theory, depending on the context.
6. _Describe_ requires candidates to state in words (using diagrams where appropriate) the main points of the topic. It is often used with reference either to particular phenomena or to particular experiments. In the former instance, the term usually implies that the answer should include reference to (visual) observations associated with the phenomena. In other contexts, _describe and give an account of_ should be interpreted more generally, i.e. the candidate has greater discretion about the nature and the organisation of the material to be included in the answer. _Describe and explain_ may be coupled in a similar way to _state and explain_.
7. _Discuss_ requires candidates to give a critical account of the points involved in the topic.
8. _Outline_ implies brevity, i.e. restricting the answer to giving essentials.
9. _Predict_ implies that the candidate is not expected to produce the required answer by recall but by making a logical connection between other pieces of information. Such information may be wholly given in the question or may depend on answers extracted in an early part of the question.
10. _Deduce_ is used in a similar way as _predict_ except that some supporting statement is required, e.g. reference to a law/principle, or the necessary reasoning is to be included in the answer.
11. _Comment_ is intended as an open-ended instruction, inviting candidates to recall or infer points of interest relevant to the context of the question, taking account of the number of marks available.
12. _Suggest_ is used in two main contexts, i.e. either to imply that there is no unique answer (e.g. in chemistry, two or more substances may satisfy the given conditions describing an 'unknown'), or to imply that candidates are expected to apply their general knowledge to a 'novel' situation, one that may be formally 'not in the syllabus'.
13. _Find_ is a general term that may variously be interpreted as calculate, measure, determine etc.
14. _Calculate_ is used when a numerical answer is required. In general, working should be shown, especially where two or more steps are involved.
15. _Measure_ implies that the quantity concerned can be directly obtained from a suitable measuring instrument, e.g. length, using a rule, or angle, using a protractor.
16. _Determine_ often implies that the quantity concerned cannot be measured directly but is obtained by calculation, substituting measured or known values of other quantities into a standard formula, e.g. relative molecular mass.

17. _Estimate_ implies a reasoned order of magnitude statement or calculation of the quantity concerned, making such simplifying assumptions as may be necessary about points of principle and about the values of quantities not otherwise included in the question.
18. _Sketch_, when applied to graph work, implies that the shape and/or position of the curve need only be qualitatively correct, but candidates should be aware that, depending on the context, some quantitative aspects may be looked for, e.g. passing through the origin, having an intercept, asymptote or discontinuity at a particular value. In diagrams, sketch implies that a simple, freehand drawing is acceptable: nevertheless, care should be taken over proportions and the clear exposition of important details.
19. _Construct_ is often used in relation to chemical equations where a candidate is expected to write a balanced equation, not by factual recall but by analogy or by using information in the question.
20. _Compare_ requires candidates to provide both the similarities and differences between things or concepts.
21. _Classify_ requires candidates to group things based on common characteristics.
22. _Recognise_ is often used to identify facts, characteristics or concepts that are critical (relevant/appropriate) to the understanding of a situation, event, process or phenomenon.
