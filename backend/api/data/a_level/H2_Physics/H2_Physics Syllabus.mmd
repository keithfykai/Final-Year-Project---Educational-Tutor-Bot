## Introduction

The syllabus has been designed to build on and extend the content coverage at O-Level. Candidates will be assumed to have knowledge and understanding of Physics at O-Level, either as a single subject or as part of a balanced science course.

### Aims

The aims of a course based on this syllabus should be to:

1. provide students with an experience that develops their interest in Physics and builds the knowledge, skills and attitudes necessary for further studies in related fields
2. enable students to become scientifically literate citizens who are well-prepared for the challenges of the 21st century
3. develop in students the understanding, skills, ethics and attitudes relevant to the _Practices of Science_, including the following: 1. understanding the nature of scientific knowledge 2. demonstrating science inquiry skills 3. relating science and society
4. develop in students an understanding that a small number of basic principles and core ideas can be applied to explain, analyse and solve problems in a variety of systems in the physical world.

### Practices of Science

Science as a discipline is more than the acquisition of a body of knowledge (e.g. scientific facts, concepts, laws, and theories) it is a way of knowing and doing. It includes an understanding of the nature of scientific knowledge and how this knowledge is generated, established and communicated. Scientists rely on a set of established procedures and practices associated with scientific inquiry to gather evidence and test their ideas on how the natural world works. However, there is no single method and the real process of science is often complex and iterative, following many different paths. While science is powerful, generating knowledge that forms the basis for many technological feats and innovations, it has limitations.

The _Practices of Science_ are explicitly articulated in the syllabus to allow teachers to embed them as learning objectives in their lessons. The students' understanding of the nature and the limitations of science and scientific inquiry are developed effectively when the practices are taught in the context of relevant science content. Attitudes relevant to science such as inequitiveness, concern for accuracy and precision, objectivity, integrity and perseverance should be emphasized in the teaching of these practices where appropriate. For example, students learning science should be introduced to the use of technology as an aid in practical work or as a tool for the interpretation of experimental and theoretical results.

The _Practices of Science_ comprise three components:

### 1 Understanding the Nature of Scientific Knowledge

1.1 Understand that science is an evidence-based, model-building enterprise concerned with the natural world

2.1 Understand that the use of both logic and creativity is required in the generation of scientific knowledge

3.1 Recognise that scientific knowledge is generated from consensus within the community of scientists through a process of critical debate and peer review

4.1 Understand that scientific knowledge is reliable and durable, yet subject to revision in the light of new evidence

#### 2.2.2 Demonstrating Science Inquiry Skills

#### 2.1.2 Identify scientific problems, observe phenomena and pose scientific questions/hypotheses

2.3 Plan and conduct investigations by selecting appropriate experimental procedures, apparatus and materials, with due regard for accuracy, precision and safety

#### 2.3.2 Obtain, organise and represent data in an appropriate manner

#### 2.4.2 Analyse and interpret data

5.1 Construct explanations based on evidence and justify these explanations through reasoning and logical argument

#### 2.6.1 Use appropriate models1 to explain concepts, solve problems and make predictions

Footnote 1: A model is a representation of an idea, an object, a process or a system that is used to describe and explain phenomena that cannot be experienced directly. Models exist in different forms from the concrete, such as physical, scale models to abstract representations, such as diagrams or mathematical expressions. The use of models involves the understanding that all models contain approximations and assumptions limiting their validity and predictive power.

#### 2.7.1 Make decisions based on evaluation of evidence, processes, claims and conclusions

#### 2.7.2 Communicate scientific findings and information using appropriate language and terminology

#### 3.2.3 Relating Science and Society

2.4 Recognise that the application of scientific knowledge to problem solving could be influenced by other considerations such as economic, social, environmental and ethical factors

2.5 Demonstrate an understanding of the benefits and risks associated with the application of science to society

3.6 Use scientific principles and reasoning to understand, analyse and evaluate real-world systems as well as to generate solutions for problem solving

## CORE IDEAS IN PHYSICS

* Physics encompasses the study of systems spanning a wide range of distances and times: from 10\({}^{-15}\) m (e.g. sub-atomic particles) to larger than 10\({}^{30}\) m (e.g. galaxies); from near-instantaneous events, such as the current flow with a flick of a switch, to slow-evolving phenomenon, such as the birth and death of a star.
* A small number of basic principles and laws can be applied in the study and interpretation of this wide variety of simple and complex systems. Similarly, a few core ideas that cut across traditional content boundaries can be introduced in the curriculum to provide students with a broader way of thinking about the physical world.
* These _Core Ideas_ are fundamental in the study of Physics and help students integrate knowledge and link concepts across different topics. They provide powerful analytical tools which can explain phenomena and solve problems.

### Systems and Interactions

1.1 Defining the _systems_ under study (by specifying their _boundaries_ and making explicit _models_ of the systems) provides tools for understanding and testing ideas that are applicable throughout physics.

1.2. _Objects_ can be treated as having no _internal structure_ or an internal structure that can be ignored. A _system_, on the other hand, is a collection of objects with an internal structure which may need to be taken into account.

1.3. Physical events and phenomena can be understood by studying the _interactions_ between objects in a system and with the environment.

1.4. Students should be able to identify _causal relationships_ when analysing interactions and _changes_ in a system.

1.5. Interactions between objects in a system can be modelled using _forces_ (e.g. a system of forces applied to move a mass; a system of two masses colliding; a system of the moon orbiting around the Earth; a system of electrical charges; a system of current in a straight wire placed in a magnetic field).

1.6. Fields existing in space are used to explain interactions between objects that are not in contact. Forces at a distance are explained by fields that can transfer _energy_ and can be described in terms of the arrangement and properties of the interacting objects. These forces can be used to describe the relationship between electrical and magnetic fields.

1.7. _Equilibrium_ is a unique state where the relevant physical properties of a system are balanced (e.g. the attainment of constant temperature at thermal equilibrium when objects of different temperatures interact, or an object returning to its equilibrium position after undergoing damped oscillatory motion).

1.8. Simplified _microscopic_ models can be used to explain _macroscopic_ properties observed in systems with complex and random interactions between a large number of objects:

1.8.1. Microscopic models are applied in the study of electricity, thermodynamics and waves. Macroscopic properties (e.g. current, temperature and wave speed) are used to investigate interactions and changes in these systems.

1.8.2. These macroscopic properties can be linked to complex interactions at the microscopic level, for example: the motion of electrons giving rise to current in a circuit, the random motion of atoms and molecules of an object giving rise to its thermal energy and the oscillatory motion of many particles giving rise to a wave motion.

1.8.3. Such complex systems may also be better characterised by _statistical averages_ (e.g. drift velocity, temperature) as these quantities may be more meaningful than the properties and behaviours of individual components (e.g. electron movement in a wire resulting in current).

## 2 Models and Representations

Models use reasonable _approximations_ to simplify real-world phenomena in order to arrive at useful ways to explain or analyse systems.

The awareness of the approximations used in a proposed model allows one to estimate the _validity_ and _reliability_ of that model.

Models are tested through observations and experiments and should be _consistent with available evidence_. Models can evolve and be refined in the light of new evidence.

The assumptions made in defining a system will determine how interactions are described and analysed. Understanding the limits of these assumptions is a fundamental aspect of modelling.

The use of _representations_ is inherent in the process of constructing a model. Examples of representations are pictures, motion diagrams, graphs, energy bar charts and mathematical equations.

Mathematics is an important tool in Physics. It is used as a _language_ to describe the relationships between different physical quantities and to solve numerical problems.

Representations and models help in analysing phenomena, solving problems, making predictions and communicating ideas.

### Conservation Laws

#### Conservation laws

* _Conservation laws_ are fundamental among the principles in physics used to understand the physical world.
* _When analysing physical events or phenomena, the choice of system and associated conservation laws provides a powerful set of tools to use to predict the possible outcome of an interaction._
* _Conservation laws constrain the possible behaviours of objects in a system, or the outcome of an interaction or process._
* _Associated with every conservation law in classical physics is a physical quantity, a scalar or a vector, which characterises a system._
* _In a_ closed _system, the associated physical quantity has a constant value independent of interactions between objects in the system. In an_ open _system, the changes of the associated physical quantity are always equal to the transfer of that quantity to or from the system by interactions with other systems._
* _In Physics, charge, momentum, mass-energy and angular momentum are conserved._
* _Examples of how conservation laws are used in our syllabus:_
* _Conservation of momentum in collisions and explosions allowing the prediction of subsequent motion of the objects or particles._
* _Conservation of energy to calculate the change in total energy in systems that are open to energy transfer due to external forces (work is done), thermal contact processes (heating occurs), or the emission or absorption of photons (radiative processes)._
* _Conservation of mass-energy, charge and nucleon number in nuclear reactions to enable the calculation of relevant binding energies and identification of the resulting nuclides._

## 4 CURLICULUM FRAMEWORK

The _Practices of Science, Core Ideas_ in physics and _Learning Experiences_ are put together in a framework (**Fig. 1**) to guide the development of the H2 Physics curriculum.

The _Practices of Science_ are common to the natural sciences of Physics, Chemistry and Biology. These practices highlight the ways of thinking and doing that are inherent in the scientific approach, with the aim of equipping students with the understanding, skills, and attitudes shared by the scientific disciplines, including an appropriate approach to ethical issues.

The _Core Ideas_ help students to integrate knowledge and link concepts across different topics and highlight important themes that recur throughout the curriculum. The syllabus content is organised into sections according to the main branches and knowledge areas of Physics, i.e. _Newtonian Mechanics, Thermal Physics, Oscillations and Waves, Electricity and Magnetism_ and _Modern Physics_. This allows for a focussed, systematic and in-depth treatment of topics within each section.

The _Learning Experiences2_ refer to a range of learning opportunities selected by teachers to link the Physics content with the _Core Ideas_ and the _Practices of Science_ to enhance students' learning of the concepts. Rather than being mandatory, teachers are encouraged to incorporate _Learning Experiences_ that match the interests and abilities of their students and provide opportunities to illustrate and exemplify the Practices of Science, where appropriate. Real-world contexts can help illustrate the concepts in Physics and their applications. Experimental activities and ICT tools can also be used to build students' understanding.

Footnote 2: The _Learning Experiences_ can be found in the Teaching and Learning Syllabus.

## Practical Assessment

Scientific subjects are, by their nature, experimental. It is therefore important that, wherever possible, the candidates carry out appropriate practical work to support the learning of this subject and to develop the expected practical skills.

### Paper 4 Practical

This paper is designed to assess a candidate's competence in those practical skills which can realistically be assessed within the context of a formal practical assessment.

Candidates will be assessed in the following skill areas:

1. Planning (P) Candidates should be able to: * define a question/problem using appropriate knowledge and understanding * give a clear logical account of the experimental procedure to be followed * describe how the data should be used in order to reach a conclusion * assess the risks of the experiment and describe precautions that should be taken to keep risks to a minimum.
2. Manipulation, measurement and observation (MMO) Candidates should be able to: * demonstrate a high level of manipulative skills in all aspects of practical activity * make and record accurate observations with good details and measurements to an appropriate degree of precision * make appropriate decisions about measurements or observations * recognise anomalous observations and / or measurements (where appropriate) with reasons indicated.
3. Presentation of data and observations (PDO) Candidates should be able to: * present all information in an appropriate form * manipulate measurements effectively in order to identify trends / patterns * present all quantitative data to an appropriate number of decimal places / significant figures.
4. Analysis, conclusions and evaluation (ACE) Candidates should be able to: * analyse and interpret data or observations appropriately in relation to the task * draw conclusion(s) from the interpretation of experimental data or observations and underlying principles * make predictions based on their data and conclusions * identify significant sources of errors, limitations of measurements and / or experimental procedures used, explaining how they affect the final result(s) * state and explain how significant errors / limitations may be overcome or reduced, as appropriate, including how experimental procedures may be improved.

The assessment of skill area P will be set in the context of the content syllabus, requiring candidates to apply and integrate knowledge and understanding from different sections of the syllabus. It may also require treatment of given experimental data to draw a relevant conclusion and in the analysis of a proposed plan.

The assessment of skill areas MMO, PDO and ACE will be set in the context of the syllabus. The assessment of PDO and ACE may also include questions on data analysis which do not require practical equipment and apparatus.

Within the Scheme of Assessment Paper 4 is weighted to 20% of the Higher 2 assessment. It is therefore recommended that the schemes of work include learning opportunities that apportion a commensurate amount of time for the development and acquisition of practical skills. The guidance material for practical work, which is published separately, will provide examples of appropriate practical activities.

Candidates are **not** allowed to refer to notebooks, textbooks or any other information in the Practical examination.

## Apparatus List

### Algebra

Candidates should be able to:

1. change the subject of an equation. Most relevant equations involve only the simpler operations but may include positive and negative indices and square roots

Any calculator used must be on the Singapore Examinations and Assessment Board list of approved calculators.

## Glossary of Terms

It is hoped that the glossary will prove helpful to candidates as a guide, although it is not exhaustive. The glossary has been deliberately kept brief not only with respect to the number of terms included but also to the descriptions of their meanings. Candidates should appreciate that the meaning of a term must depend in part on its context. They should also note that the number of marks allocated for any part of a question is a guide to the depth of treatment required for the answer.

1. _Define (the term(s)...)_ is intended literally. Only a formal statement or equivalent paraphrase, such as the defining equation with symbols identified, being required.
2. _What is meant by..._ normally implies that a definition should be given, together with some relevant comment on the significance or context of the term(s) concerned, especially where two or more terms are included in the question. The amount of supplementary comment intended should be interpreted in the light of the indicated mark value.
3. _Explain_ may imply reasoning or some reference to theory, depending on the context.
4. _State_ implies a concise answer with little or no supporting argument, e.g. a numerical answer that can be obtained 'by inspection'.
5. _List_ requires a number of points with no elaboration. Where a given number of points is specified, this should not be exceeded.
6. _Describe_ requires candidates to state in words (using diagrams where appropriate) the main points of the topic. It is often used with reference either to particular phenomena or to particular experiments. In the former instance, the term usually implies that the answer should include reference to (visual) observations associated with the phenomena. The amount of description intended should be interpreted in the light of the indicated mark value.
7. _Discuss_ requires candidates to give a critical account of the points involved in the topic.
8. _Deduce/Predict_ implies that candidates are not expected to produce the required answer by recall but by making a logical connection between other pieces of information. Such information may be wholly given in the question or may depend on answers extracted in an earlier part of the question.
9. _Suggest_ is used in two main contexts. It may either imply that there is no unique answer or that candidates are expected to apply their general knowledge to a 'novel' situation, one that formally may not be 'in the syllabus'.
10. _Calculate_ is used when a numerical answer is required. In general, working should be shown.
11. _Measure_ implies that the quantity concerned can be directly obtained from a suitable measuring instrument, e.g. length, using a rule, or angle, using a protractor.
12. _Determine_ often implies that the quantity concerned cannot be measured directly but is obtained by calculation, substituting measured or known values of other quantities into a standard formula.
13. _Show_ is used when an algebraic deduction has to be made to prove a given equation. It is important that the terms being used by candidates are stated explicitly.
14. _Estimate_ implies a reasoned order of magnitude statement or calculation of the quantity concerned. Candidates should make such simplifying assumptions as may be necessary about points of principle and about the values of quantities not otherwise included in the question.
15. _Sketch_, when applied to graph work, implies that the shape and/or position of the curve need only be qualitatively correct. However, candidates should be aware that, depending on the context, some quantitative aspects may be looked for, e.g. passing through the origin, having an intercept, asymptote or discontinuity at a particular value. On a sketch graph it is essential that candidates clearly indicate what is being plotted on each axis.

* [16]_Sketch_, when applied to diagrams, implies that a simple, freehand drawing is acceptable: nevertheless, care should be taken over proportions and the clear exposition of important details.
* [17]_Compare_ requires candidates to provide both similarities and differences between things or concepts.
