## 1 Introduction

Solubility is a very important phenomenon that impacts our daily life, environment and health.

Water with high content of calcium or magnesium ions (known as hard water) are present in some regions of the world. Mineral deposits can be found on cooking dishes or in bathtubs. Sometimes, you may also have felt like there was a film of residue left on your hands after washing your hands with soap.

Mineral deposits are formed due to the formation of insoluble precipitates by calcium or magnesium ions in the hard water. These deposits can make hard water unsuitable for many uses. They can reduce the lifespan of equipment, raise the costs of heating the water, lower the efficiency of electric water heaters, or clog pipes.

A variety of methods can be used to minimise the hardness of water. For example, mineral deposits in pots can sometimes be removed by running vinegar (an acid) through the pot. At the end of this topic, try to make sense of why precipitation occurs, and why the above method works in removing the mineral deposits.

**In this topic, we will find out the answer to the following questions:**

What is a saturated solution?

What is solubility and solubility product? How are they related?

When and why does precipitation take place?

What are the effects on the solubility of ionic salts when its equilibrium is disturbed?

## 2 Salts and Saturated Solutions

### Types of salts

Ionic compounds can be classified as soluble or sparingly soluble salts. We often use the term "insoluble salt" to describe ionic compounds that have low solubility in water. However, these are more appropriately described as **sparingly soluble** salts.

Recall from "O" levels that **all ionic compounds containing Na\({}^{+}\), K\({}^{+}\) and NH\({}_{4}\)\({}^{+}\) are soluble**. The table below shows a general classification of salts as either soluble or sparingly soluble.

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|} \hline \multicolumn{2}{|c|}{**Solubility in water**} \\ \hline \multicolumn{2}{|c|}{**Soluble Salts**} & \multicolumn{2}{|c|}{**Sparingly Soluble Salts**} \\ \hline All nitrates (NO\({}_{3}\)) & \(-\) \\ \hline Nitrites (NO\({}_{2}\)) & Only AgNO\({}_{2}\) \\ \hline Halides (C\(I^{*}\), Br\({}^{*}\), \(\Gamma\)) & Only halides of Ag\({}^{+}\), Pb\({}^{2+}\), Cu\({}^{+}\). \\  & PbCl\({}_{2}\), PbBr\({}_{2}\), PbI\({}_{2}\) are soluble in hot water \\ \hline Sulfates (SO\({}_{4}\)\({}^{2}\)) & Only sulfates of Ba\({}^{2+}\), Ca\({}^{2+}\) and Pb\({}^{2+}\) \\ \hline Only sulfides of **Na\({}^{+}\)**, **K\({}^{+}\) and NH\({}_{4}\)\({}^{+}\)** & Sulfides (S\({}^{2-}\)) \\ \hline Only carbonates of **Na\({}^{+}\)**, **K\({}^{+}\) and NH\({}_{4}\)\({}^{+}\)** & Carbonates (CO\({}_{3}\)\({}^{2-}\)) \\ \hline Only oxides of **Na\({}^{*}\)**, **K\({}^{*}\)**, NH\({}_{4}\)\({}^{+}\)** & Oxides (O\({}^{2-}\)) \\ and larger Group 2 cations & \\ (e.g. Ca\({}^{2+}\), Sr\({}^{2+}\), Ba\({}^{2+}\)) & \\ \hline Only hydroxides of **Na\({}^{*}\)**, **K\({}^{*}\)**, NH\({}_{4}\)\({}^{+}\)** & Hydroxides (OH\({}^{+}\)) \\ and larger Group 2 cations & \\ (e.g. Ca\({}^{2+}\), Sr\({}^{2+}\), Ba\({}^{2+}\)) & \\ \hline \end{tabular} When you add a sparingly soluble salt (or "insoluble salt") into water at a fixed temperature, it will dissolve in water until a point when, to the naked eye, no more solute can dissolve. This is when a **saturated solution** is obtained (See section 2.3 - page 2.3).

### Difference between a soluble salt and a sparingly soluble salt

* When a **soluble salt** is added to water, it **dissociates completely** to give separate hydrated ions in the solution. 

* When a **sparingly soluble salt** is added to water gradually, it **dissoves slightly** and produces a mixture consisting of a very dilute solution of the ions in **equilibrium** with the undissolved solid. 
 The solution is said to have become **saturated** and any excess solid would remain **undissolved** and settle to the bottom. 

### 2.3 Saturated solution

A saturated solution is one that contains the maximum amount of solute in a given amount of solvent such that the **ions are in equilibrium with the solid**.

\begin{tabular}{c}  \\ \end{tabular} _At equilibrium in a saturated solution, the rate of dissolution (from solid to hydrated ions) is equal to the rate of crystallisation or precipitation (from the hydrated ions to the solid)._ \\ \end{tabular}

## 3 SOLUBILITY AND SOLUBILITY PRODUCT (\(K_{\text{sp}}\))

### 3.1 Solubility of a solute (in water)

The solubility of a substance (salt) is the maximum amount of solute that dissolves in 1 dm\({}^{3}\) of water to form a saturated solution at a stated temperature.

* The units for solubility of a salt is either in **g dm\({}^{-3}\)** or mol dm\({}^{-3}\).

* If the solubility of PbCl\({}_{2}\) is 44.1 g dm\({}^{-3}\) at 25\({}^{\circ}\)C, it means that a maximum mass of 44.1 g (0.1585 mol) of PbCl\({}_{2}\) can dissolve in 1 dm\({}^{3}\) of water forming a saturated solution at 25\({}^{\circ}\)C.
* At saturation, PbCl\({}_{2}\)(s) Pb\({}^{2+}\)(aq) + 2Cl\({}^{\prime}\)(aq)
* This implies that 0.1585 mol Pb\({}^{2+}\)(aq) and 0.3170 mol Cl(aq) are formed in 1 dm\({}^{3}\) of the saturated solution.
* The value of the solubility of a sparingly soluble salt, at **a stated temperature**, is
* determined experimentally and
* used to calculate the solubility product, \(K_{\text{sp}}\), of the salt.
* by dissolving the salt until no more solid can dissolve, and **undissolved solid remains** in the solution. 2. Filter to remove the undissolved solid. 3. Perform a titration to determine the concentration of the salt that dissolved in the solution.

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:5]

### Relationship between solubility and solubility product, \(K_{\text{sp}}\)

The magnitude of \(K_{\text{sp}}\) gives a measure of the solubility of the salt at a stated temperature. For salts of the **same formula type**, the **smaller** the \(K_{\text{sp}}\)value, the **less soluble** is the salt.

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|} \hline Formula of salt & \(K_{\text{sp}}\)value & Remarks \\ \hline CaSO\({}_{4}\) & 6.1 x 10\({}^{-5}\) & Since the salts have the same type of formula (i.e. MA), \\ PbSO\({}_{4}\) & 1.3 x 10\({}^{-8}\) & the \(K_{\text{sp}}\) trend is indicative of solubility trend \\ AgCl & 1.6 x 10\({}^{-10}\) & \(\Rightarrow\) solubility of CaSO\({}_{4}\) \(>\) PbSO\({}_{4}\) \(>\) AgCl \(>\) AgI \\ AgI & 1.5 x 10\({}^{-16}\) & Since the salts have the same type of formula (i.e. MA\({}_{2}\)), \\ CaF\({}_{2}\) & 4.0 x 10\({}^{-11}\) & the \(K_{\text{sp}}\) trend is indicative of solubility trend \\ Cu(OH)\({}_{2}\) & 1.6 x 10\({}^{-19}\) & \(\Rightarrow\) Cu(OH)\({}_{2}\) is less soluble than CaF\({}_{2}\) \\ \hline \end{tabular}

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|} \hline \(K_{\text{sp}}\)Value & Quick Check: \\ \hline Can we always compare solubility of salts just by comparing their \(K_{\text{sp}}\) values and why? \\ \hline \end{tabular}

_Yes. If the formula type e.g. BaSO\({}_{4}\) and CaCO\({}_{3}\) are the same i.e. total number of ions in the formula unit is the same._

\begin{tabular}{|c|} \hline \(K_{\text{sp}}\)Value & How do we compare solubility of salts with different formula type (e.g. PbSO\({}_{4}\) and CaF\({}_{2}\))? \\ Can we still compare based on their \(K_{\text{sp}}\) values? \\ Refer to Exercise 2. \\ \hline \end{tabular}

### Calculations

#### Calculate \(K_{\text{sp}}\) given the solubility

_Suggested approach for the calculation:_

_1. Write the equation that represents the equilibrium between the sparingly soluble salt & its dissolved ions._

_2. Calculate the concentration of the respective ions (in mod dm\({}^{-3}\)), from the solubility of salt._

_3. Write the \(K_{\text{sp}}\) expression of the salt._

_4. Substitute and solve for \(K_{\text{sp}}\)._

Exercise 1

(a) The solubility of silver chloride, at 25 \({}^{\circ}\)C, is 1.26 x 10\({}^{-5}\) mol dm\({}^{-3}\). Calculate its solubility product at 25 \({}^{\circ}\)C.

\begin{tabular}{|c|} \hline \(\text{AgCl}(\text{s})\)\(\ \

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:7]

2. Calcium fluoride, CaF\({}_{2}\) has a solubility product of 4.0 x 10\({}^{-11}\) mol\({}^{3}\) dm\({}^{-9}\). Calculate its solubility in mol dm\({}^{-3}\).

Let the solubility of CaF\({}_{2}\) be \(s\) mol dm\({}^{-3}\).

\begin{tabular}{c c c c c}  & CaF\({}_{2}\)(s) & CaF\({}_{2}\)(aq) & + & 2F\({}^{-}\)(aq) & For a saturated solution of CaF\({}_{2}\): \\  & & & & & If solubility of CaF\({}_{2}\) \\  & & & & & = s mol dm\({}^{-3}\) \\ \(K_{\text{ep}}\) of CaF\({}_{2}\) = [Ca\({}^{2+}\)] [F\({}^{-}\)] & & & & Then, \\  & & & & [Ca\({}^{2+}\)] = s mol dm\({}^{-3}\) \\  & & & & [F\({}^{-}\)] = 2s mol dm\({}^{-3}\) \\  & & & & \\  & & & & \\  & & & & \\  & & & & \\  & & & & \\  & & & & \\ \end{tabular}

Observe that the solubility of CaF\({}_{2}\) is \(>\) solubility of PbSO\({}_{4}\), although the \(K_{\text{ep}}\) of CaF\({}_{2}\) is \(<K_{\text{ep}}\) of PbSO\({}_{4}\). Therefore, when comparing the solubility of salts with **different formula type** (especially when their \(K_{\text{ep}}\) values are close), you need to **calculate the solubility values** from their respective \(K_{\text{ep}}\) for comparison.

## 4 Effect on Solubility of Ionic Salts when Equilibrium is Disturbed

In this section, we will consider the changes in solubility of a sparingly soluble salt due to the addition or removal of ions in these cases:

* **Common Ion Effect**
* **Chemical reactions (complex ion formation, acid-base reaction)**

In each of the above scenario, we will discuss qualitatively how the solubility changes by applying the _Le Chatelier's Principle_ to determine how the position of equilibrium shifts. We will also determine quantitatively how the solubility changes.

Note that in these cases, the value of \(K_{\text{ep}}\)**does not change** since the temperature remains unchanged.

### Common lon Effect

#### 4.1.1 Effect on the solubility of ionic salts by the common ion effect

The phenomenon of **reduced solubility** with the **addition of a common cation or anion** to a sparingly soluble salt is called the **common ion effect**.

For example, we can decrease the solubility of silver chloride in a saturated solution of the salt by adding a soluble salt with a common anion (e.g. NaC_l_).

NaC_l_(s) Na*(aq) + **C_l_**(aq) AgC_l_(s) Ag*(aq) + **C_l_**(aq)

The **increase in [C_l_**] due to the added NaC_l_ will **shift the position of equilibrium (1) to the left. This will result in the precipitation of silver chloride, i.e. the **solubility of silver chloride decreases**.

Checkpoint 2

For a saturated solution of a sparingly soluble saltTrue or False?

1. Concentration of ions will remain constant although common ions are False added at equilibrium.

#### 4.1.2 Calculations involving common ion effect

_Suggested approach for the calculation:_

1. _Let the solubility of the **sparingly soluble salt** be y mol dm-3._

2. _Write the equation that represents the equilibrium between the sparingly soluble salt & its dissolved ions._

3. _State the concentration of the respective ions in terms of y._

4. _Write the K_\({}_{\rm sp}\) _expression of the salt._

5. _Substitute and solve for y._

Exercise 3: Calculation of (reduced) solubility in the presence of a common ion.

1. Given that the _K_\({}_{\rm sp}\) of AgC_l_ is 1.6 x 10-10 mol2 dm-6, calculate the solubility of silver chloride in 0.10 mol dm-3 NaCl.

Let the solubility of AgC_l_ be y mol dm-3NaC_l_(s) Na*(aq) + & Cl_l_**(aq) AgC_l_(s) Ag*(aq) + & Cl_l_**(aq)

Eqm conc / mol dm-3 y + **0.10**

\(K_{\rm sp}\) = [Ag*] [C_l_]

1.6 x 10-10 = y (y + 0.10)

y = \(\frac{1.6\times 10^{-10}}{y+0.10}\approx\frac{1.6\times 10^{-10}}{0.10}\) (since y << 0.10)

y = 1.60 x 10-9 mol dm-3

_Note: Assumption is valid since 1.60 x 10-9 << 0.10_

2024/ASRJC/Chemistry2. The value of the solubility product, \(K_{\text{sp}}\), for Ca(OH)\({}_{2}\) is 8.0 x 10\({}^{-6}\)mol\({}^{3}\) dm\({}^{-9}\) at 25 \({}^{\circ}\)C. Calculate the solubility of Ca(OH)\({}_{2}\) at 25 \({}^{\circ}\)C in a solution with [OH] = 0.158 moldm\({}^{-3}\). [label=()] **Note** * The concentration of OH-is contributed by both Ca(OH)\({}_{2}\) and OH-in solution. Since the contribution of OH-in the solution exerts a common ion effect and suppresses the dissociation of Ca(OH)\({}_{2}\), it can be assumed that 2y \(<\) 0.158 such that (2y + 0.158) \(\approx\) 0.158. [label=()] **Checkpoint** **For a saturated solution of a sparingly soluble salt** **True or False?** The value of \(K_{\text{sp}}\) changes with the amount of solid or ions added at a given temperature. [label=()] **Note** * The value of \(K_{\text{sp}}\) changes with the amount of solid or ions added at a given temperature.

### Effect on solubility of ionic salts by chemical reactions

The solubility of a sparingly soluble salt may be enhanced with the addition of a reagent that consumes either the cation or the anion of the salt.

#### Effect of Complex ion formation on solubility

_A complex ion consists of a central metal ion (cation) that is surrounded by anions or molecules called ligands. The ligand has at least a lone pair of electrons that can form a co-ordinate (dative covalent) bond with the central cation. (You will learn more in 'An Introduction to the Chemistry of Transition Elements')_

_Examples of ligands:_

_C1-, OH-, CN-, SCN- (thiocyanate ion), H2O, NH3, CO (carbon monoxide)_

List of common complex ions (To be covered in 'An Introduction to the Chemistry of Transition Elements')_

1. _Halide ligand_ _2. _Hydroxide ligand_ _3. _Ammonia ligand_ _[_PbX4_]_\({}^{2-}\) _(X = Cl, Br, I)_ _[_A1_(OH)4_]_\({}^{-}\)_ _[_Ag_(NH3_)2_]_\({}^{+}\)_ _[_CuC1_4_]_\({}^{2-}\)_ _[_Pb_(OH)4_]_\({}^{2-}\)_ _[_Zn_(NH3_)4_]_\({}^{2-}\)_ _[_Zn_(OH)4_]_\({}^{2-}\)_ _[_Cr_(OH)6_]_\({}^{3-}\)_

\(\bullet\) _The solubility of PbCl_\({}_{2}\) _increases with the addition of concentrated HCl_

\(\bullet\) _When concentrated HCl_\(l\) _is added, Cl_\({}^{-}\) _will react with Pb_\({}^{2+}\) _to form a complex ion [PbC_\(l_{4}\)_]_\({}^{2-}\)_(aq). [Pb_\({}^{2+}\) _decreases, causing position of equilibrium (1) to shift right to increase the [Pb_\({}^{2+}\)_]. Hence, solubility of PbCl_\({}_{2}\) _increases._

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:12]

### When and why does precipitation occur?

We can make use of the _ionic product_, which has the same expression as that for \(K_{\text{sp}}\), to predict whether precipitation of a sparingly soluble salt occurs when known quantities of two salts are mixed.

Consider an aqueous solution of AgNO3,

* KBr(s) is gradually added to it, the concentration of the bromide ions in the solution increases. This leads to an increase in the numerical value of the ionic product of AgBr.
* As more KBr(s) is added, the value of the ionic product will eventually be equivalent to that of \(K_{\text{sp}}\). This is when a saturated solution of the sparingly soluble salt (AgBr) is formed.
* On adding more KBr(s), the value of the ionic product will be greater than that of \(K_{\text{sp}}\). This is when precipitation of AgBr will occur.

Thus, with the \(K_{\text{sp}}\) and ionic product, we can predict whether precipitation of a sparingly soluble salt occurs when known quantities of two salts are mixed.

In summary, for a solution that contains a sparingly soluble salt, if:

\begin{tabular}{|c|l|} \hline ionic product \textless{} \(K_{\text{sp}}\) & no precipitation is observed since the solution is still unsaturated \\ \hline ionic product \textless{} \(K_{\text{sp}}\) & the solution is saturated and the system is in equilibrium \\ \hline \end{tabular}

\begin{tabular}{|c|l|} \hline  & precipitation occurs until ionic product \textgreater{} \(K_{\text{sp}}\), the rate of precipitation is greater than the rate of dissolution. So the net outcome is that you have precipitate being formed continuously (\(\Rightarrow\) value of the ionic product decreases as concentration of each of the ions in the solution decreases). When ionic product \textless{} \(K_{\text{sp}}\), the rate of precipitation equals the rate of dissolution, and thus there is no further precipitation. \\ \hline \end{tabular}

### Calculations

_Exercise 3: Predict if precipitation will occur when two solutions of known quantities are mixed_

_Suggested approach for the calculation:_

1. _Identify the ppt and write the equation that represents the equilibrium between the sparingly soluble salt & its dissolved ions._
2. _Calculate ionic product._ * _Calculate the concentration of both ions in the mature upon mixing._ * _Write the ionic product expression of the salt._ * _Substitute and calculate the ionic product._ * _Compare ionic product against given_ \(K_{\text{sp}}\)

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:14]

2. The solubility product of PbCrO\({}_{4}\) at 15 \({}^{\circ}\)C is 1.69 x 10\({}^{-14}\) mol\({}^{2}\) dm\({}^{-6}\). Concentrated Pb(NO\({}_{3}\))\({}_{2}\) is added dropwise to 0.0100 mol dm\({}^{-3}\) K\({}_{2}\)CrO\({}_{4}\). What is the concentration, in mol dm\({}^{-3}\), of Pb\({}^{2+}\) ions when the first trace of precipitate of PbCrO\({}_{4}\) appears? **Note:** We can **assume** that volume of solution containing K\(\mathrm{CrO}_{4}\) (aq) = total volume in the resultant mixture. Thus, [CrO\({}^{2}\)-] before mixing = [CrO\({}^{2}\)-] in the resultant mixture. Why? Since concentrated Pb(NO\({}_{3}\))(aq) is added to the solution of K\(\mathrm{CrO}_{4}\), only a small volume of it is needed to cause the solution to become saturated.
