Introduction

In Kinematics, we described motion in terms of position, velocity and acceleration without considering what might cause that motion.

In Dynamics, we consider the cause - what might cause one object to remain at rest and another object to accelerate? The two main factors are the mass of the body, and the forces acting on the body. Dynamics is therefore a study of the relationship between the forces acting on a body and the motion of that body.

The study of dynamics is largely governed by Newton's Three Laws of Motion.

Newton's First Law (Law of inertia):

A body stays at rest or continues to move with constant velocity unless a resultant force acts on it.

Newton's Second Law:

The rate of change of momentum of a body is proportional to the resultant force acting on the body and takes place in the direction of the resultant force.

Newton's Third Law:

If body A exerts a force on body B, then body B will exert a force of the same type that is equal in magnitude and opposite in direction on body A.

Nature of Science

Science is an evidence-based, model-building enterprise concerned with the natural world. In this topic, we can see how models such as free-body diagrams and vector diagrams are used to represent real-life scenarios. Using models allow us to make predictions, which we can proceed to verify experimentally.

Relating Science and Society

Examples of application of Newton's Law of Motion are found everywhere in everyday life. These can range from simple ones such as walking, playing tennis, to more complex applications such as car safety and rocket building.

### Newton's 1st Law

A body stays at rest or continues to move with constant velocity unless a resultant force acts on it.

Newton's 1st Law is also known as the law of inertia.

The inertia of a body is the property of a body to resist a change in its motion.

The mass of a body is a measure of the resistance of a body to a change in its motion i.e. a measure of its inertia.

The greater the mass of a body, the lesser the body accelerates under the action of a given applied force.

Unlike weight (see side note) which depends on gravitational field and therefore varies from place to place, mass is independent of gravitational forces, i.e. the mass of a body is the same on the Earth as on Moon. Mass is a scalar quantity while weight is a vector.

\begin{tabular}{c c} Additional & \\ Notes & With SI units, the **newton (N)** is the unit of force. One newton is defined as the force which gives a mass of 1 kg an acceleration of 1 m s\({}^{-2}\). Substituting \(F\) = 1 N, \(m\) = 1 kg and \(a\) = 1 m s\({}^{-2}\) in \(F\)= k _ma_ we obtain k = 1. Thus with these units k = 1 and \(F\)= _ma_. \\ \end{tabular}

Thus, a force can be measured by finding the acceleration it produces in a known mass.

If **SI units are used**, Newton's second law may be written as :

\[\text{Resultant force = rate of change of momentum}\]

\[F_{\text{\emph{ref}}}=\frac{dp}{dt}=\frac{\sigma(mv)}{dt}\]

If the force is applied over a time interval of \(\Delta t\) :

\[\text{Average resultant Force, }<F_{\text{\emph{ref}}}>=\frac{\Delta p}{\Delta t}\]

* **For two Forces to be Action-Reaction Pair, they must fulfil these three conditions.**

1. They are the same type of force, e.g. gravitational forces, contact forces.
2. They act on two different bodies.
3. They are equal in magnitude but opposite in direction to each other.

**Applying the conditions to identify action-reaction forces**

* Consider a stationary book which is lying flat on a table. Is the weight of the book and the force which the table acts on the book an action-reaction pair, and why?

* **Force by Table on Book, \(F_{TB}\)**

* **They are not the same type of force.** \(W_{B}\) **= gravitational (non-contact) force, and** \(F_{TB}\) **= contact force.** \(W_{B}\) **and** \(F_{TB}\) **are both acting on the same single body, i.e. the book itself!**

* **So, what is the action-reaction pair for weight of the book, \(W_{B}\)?**

* **By N3L, the action-reaction pair must be a** _gravitational force also_**, and it must act on a different body. which is** _the Earth in this case._

* **Thus, the action-reaction pair for** \(W_{B}\) **is actually the gravitational force by book on Earth,** \(F_{BE}\)**.**

* **Next, what is the action-reaction pair for force by table on book, \(F_{TB}\)?**

* **By N3L, the action-reaction pair must be a** _contact force also_**, i.e. contact force by book on table, \(F_{BT}\)anderson Serangoon Junior College

d) Are the weight of book, _W_s and the force by book on table, _F_st the same force? Why?

**No, _W_s is not _F_st**_1_

1) _W_s is a _gravitational (non-contact) force_ (i.e. by Earth on book, _F_EB) but _F_st is a _contact force_

2) _W_s forms action-reaction pair with the Earth (refer back to part (b)), while _F_st forms action-reaction pair with force by table on book, _F_TB

**Worked Example 3**

Scenario : A man is pushing a box which remains stationary.

Explain whether the following statements are true.

1. The pushing force by man on box and the friction by floor on box form an action-reaction pair.
2. By Newton's Third Law, the contact force by box on man and the pushing force by man on box cancel each other out. Hence, the box remains stationary.
3. The box is stationary because the pushing force by man on box is equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to the friction by floor on box.

Start by considering the horizontal forces on the man and on the box:

**Anderson SERANGOON JUNIOR COLLEGE**

**PHYSICS 9749 / 8867**

**Statement 1:**

The pushing (contact) force exerted by man on box, and the friction by floor on box are acting on the same body. This does not fulfil condition 2. In addition, these two forces are different types of forces, so they do not meet condition 1. Hence, they are not action-reaction pair.

**Statement 2:**

The contact force by box on man and the pushing (contact) force by man on box form an action-reaction pair, because they act on different bodies (condition 2). So they do not cancel each other out. Only forces acting on the same body can cancel out if they are of same magnitude and act in opposite directions. Therefore, this is not the correct explanation for why the box remains stationary.

**Statement 3:**

True. Both the pushing (contact) force by man on box and the friction by floor on box act on the same body. The box does not move because these two forces are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction and hence cancel each other out.

_(From statements 1 and 3, we can also see that two forces that are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction are not necessarily an action-reaction pair. Hence, always check against the three conditions.)_

**Check Your Understanding 1**

A sky-diver jumps from an aircraft. The Earth exerts a downward force \(F_{\rm E}\) on the sky-diver who also exerts an upward force \(F_{\rm S}\) on the Earth.

Which statement is correct?

**A.**: the magnitude of \(F_{\rm E}>\) the magnitude of \(F_{\rm S}\)
**B.**: the magnitude of \(F_{\rm E}<\) the magnitude of \(F_{\rm S}\)
**C.**: the magnitude of \(F_{\rm E}=\) the magnitude of \(F_{\rm S}\) and they cancel each other out
**D.**: the magnitude of \(F_{\rm E}=\) the magnitude of \(F_{\rm S}\) and they do not cancel each other out

## A.4 Solving Problems Using Newton's Laws of Motion

A **free-body diagram (FBD)** shows only the forces acting on _one object_. The object can be simplified further by simply drawing a dot to represent a point mass.

Steps to draw a FBD,

1. Draw a dot or a small circle to represent the body.

2. Draw arrows with appropriate lengths to represent all the forces. (Start the arrows _from the dot_.)

3. Label the forces.

A few examples of FBD of body A:

For scenarios where the body involved has constant mass, we can derive the following equation from Newton's \(2^{nd}\) Law.

\[\begin{array}{l}\mbox{By definition,}\hskip 28.452756ptF_{net}=\frac{d \rho}{dt}=\ \frac{d(mv)}{dt}\\ \mbox{For constant mass,}\hskip 14.226378ptF_{net}=m\frac{d\nu}{dt}=m \mathbf{a}\end{array}\]

\[\begin{array}{l}\mbox{or}\hskip 14.226378pt<F_{net}>\ =m\frac{\Delta\nu}{ \Delta t}=m<\mathbf{a}>\end{array}\]

where \(<\!\!F_{net}\!\!>\) is the average net force acting on the object

\(\begin{array}{l}m\hskip 14.226378pt\mbox{is the mass of the object}\\ \hskip 14.226378pt<\mathbf{a}>\ \mbox{is the average acceleration of the object}\end{array}\)

**The diagram below shows a wooden block B resting on another block A. Both blocks are connected by an inelastic string which goes around a fixed smooth pulley. The friction between blocks A and B is 4.0 N, and block A is pulled at a constant velocity by a 20 N force.**

**By considering the horizontal forces acting on A and B, calculate the frictional force between block A and the ground.**

**Solution:**

### **Impulse-Momentum**

\begin{tabular}{c c} \(\Rightarrow\) & \(\int dp=\int F_{net}dt\) \\ \end{tabular}

\begin{tabular}{c c} \(\Rightarrow\) & where \(\int dp\) is the change in momentum \\ \end{tabular}

\begin{tabular}{c c} Impulse is the product of the average force acting on the body and the time of impact, and is equal to the change in momentum of the body as a result of the application of the force. \\ \end{tabular}

The unit of impulse is N s.

\begin{tabular}{c c} For average (or constant) force \(<\)\(F_{net}>\), change in momentum, \(\Delta p=<F_{net}>\Delta t\) \\ \end{tabular}

\begin{tabular}{c c} where \(\Delta t\) is the duration acted upon by the net force \\ \end{tabular}

\begin{tabular}{c c} Take note that if the quantity & In general, for a net force \(F_{net}\) (including non-constant \(F_{net}\)), \\ \end{tabular}

\begin{tabular}{c c} change in momentum, \(\Delta p=\) Area under a \(F_{net}-t\) graph \\ \end{tabular}

The force can be constant or varying (e.g. for colliding bodies). For a constant force as shown below, the change in momentum from \(t\), to \(t_{k}\) is given by the shaded area.

Recall _Ft = mv - mu_.

Anderson Seraugoon Junior College

Physics 9749 / 8867

For colliding bodies, the force is not constant but builds up to a maximum value as the deformation of the colliding body increases. When the force imparting an impulse vary with time, it is convenient to define an average force \(F_{ave}\), such that \(F_{ave}(t-t_{t})=\) area under the F-t graph for the same time interval \(t_{2}-t_{t}\).

i.e. the average force gives the same impulse to a particle as does the time varying force in the same time interval.

**Worked Example 7**

A jet of water leaves the nozzle of a hose of diameter 5.0\(\times 10^{-2}\) m with a speed 0.400 m s\({}^{-1}\). The water is directed perpendicularly to the wall and it can be assumed that the water does not rebound. The density of water is 1000 kg m\({}^{-3}\).

Calculate the force exerted on the wall by the water.

Consider a column of water that hits the wall in t = 1 s.

Given:

Diameter of hose, \(d\) =5.0 \(\times\) 10\({}^{-2}\) m

Speed of water, \(\nu\) = 0.400 m s\({}^{-1}\)

Density of water, \(\rho\) = 1000 kg m\({}^{-3}\)

Let \(L\) be the distance travelled by the

column of water in 1 s. Hence, from the

speed, \(L\) = 0.400 m.

**Applying the Impulse-Momentum concept:**

The wall exerts an impulse on the water and changes its horizontal momentum. Let \(<F_{net}>\) be the average net force exerted by the wall on the water.

\[<F_{net}>\Delta t=\Delta\rho\]

\[<F_{net}>\times 1.0=m(\nu_{i}-\nu_{i})=\rho\Delta L(\nu_{i}-\nu_{i})\]

\[<F_{net}>\ =\rho\times\pi\bigg{(}\frac{d}{2}\bigg{)}^{2}\times L\times\big{(} \nu_{i}-\nu_{i}\big{)}\]

\[<F_{net}>\ =1000\times\pi\bigg{(}\frac{5.0\times 10^{-2}}{2}\bigg{)}^{2}\times 0.400\times(0-0.400)=-0.314\ \text{N}\]

_(negative sign shows that the force exerted by the wall on the water is in opposite direction to the direction of the velocity of water)._

## Appendix B.1 Principle of Conservation of Linear Momentum

#### Derivation of the Principle of Conservation of Linear Momentum from Newton's Laws of Motion

When two bodies \(m_{t}\) and \(m_{2}\) collide (take rightwards as positive),

\(m_{t}\) acts on \(m_{2}\) with a force of \(F_{t2}\)

According to Newton's 3\({}^{nd}\) Law, \(F_{t2}=-F_{2}\),... (1)

Taking the time of collision to be \(t\),

Using Newton's 2\({}^{nd}\) Law, eqn (1) can be rewritten as,

\(\dfrac{m_{2}\nu_{2}\cdot m_{2}\nu_{2}}{t}=-(\dfrac{m_{2}\nu_{t}\cdot m_{t}}{t})\)

\(m_{2}\nu_{2}-m_{2}\nu_{2}=-m_{2}\nu_{t}+m_{2}\nu_{t}\)

\(m_{2}\nu_{t}+m_{2}\nu_{2}=m_{2}\nu_{t}+m_{2}\nu_{2}\)

i.e. Total momentum after collision = Total momentum before collision

The above is the defining equation for conservation of linear momentum.

**Definition:** Principle of Conservation of Linear Momentum states that the net momentum of a **system** remains constant provided no resultant external force acts on the system.

* The principle of conservation of momentum can be used to analyse problems involving separation of bodies or collisions.
* It applies not only to collisions, but to any interaction between two or more bodies.
* For collisions, if no external resultant force acts on a system of colliding bodies, the total momentum of the bodies before collision = total momentum after collision.

## 6 Anderson Serangoon Junior College

#### 6.1.2 General Approach to Solving Problems involving Separations or Collisions

1. Identify whether the question is about a separation, elastic collision or inelastic collision (i.e. identify the isolated system)
2. Draw diagrams of what happens before and after the collision / separation (velocities and mass of body to be included).
3. Use the Principle of Conservation of Linear Momentum to form an equation. Take note that the direction of motion is important.
4. If collision is known to be elastic, use the fact that kinetic energy is conserved in the collision or that relative speed of separation = relative speed of approach to form another equation.

#### 6.1.3 Collisions

* Note: In head-on collisions, the velocity/velocities of the colliding bodies are collinear (directed along the same straight line) both before and after the collision. Understand the term "head-on", but there is no need to memorise the meaning.
* The momentum and the total energy of an isolated system are always conserved in any collision but the total kinetic energy of the system may or may not be conserved depending on the type of collision.
* There are two types of collisions:
* An elastic collision is one in which the total kinetic energy remains the same. An inelastic collision is one in which the total kinetic energy is not conserved.
* Real collisions are always inelastic.
* Sometimes, collisions can be such that \(K\!E_{t}\!=\!0\), i.e. the real colliding bodies come to a complete stop.
* Perfectly elastic collisions only occur between atomic and subatomic particles.

#### 6.1.3.1 Elastic Collisions

* Both linear momentum and kinetic energy of the system are conserved.
* Although bodies which collide elastically always separate, but collisions that result in bodies separating need not necessarily mean the collision is elastic.
* Separation can refer to bodies moving away from each other, or moving in the same direction with the leading body moving faster than the lagging body.
* For elastic collisions, the relative speed of approach of the bodies is equal to the relative speed of separation of the bodies (this is the direct consequence of the conservation of kinetic energy).

## 6 Conclusion

Inelastic collisions, only conservation of momentum can be applied.

Conservation of kinetic energy cannot be applied since some of the kinetic energy is transformed into internal energy and sound or other forms of energy.

Similarly, the relationship of Relative speed of approach = Relative speed of separation cannot be applied.

For perfectly inelastic collisions, the two bodies will stick together (sometimes the word coalesce is used) as one single body after collision, i.e. they move off together with a common velocity.

**Worked Example 13 (Perfectly Inelastic Collision)**

A body of mass \(m\) moving with speed \(u\) makes a head-on collision with an identical body which is initially at rest. The bodies coalesce and move off with a common velocity.

Determine the common speed of the bodies after the collision.

Determine the ratio of the kinetic energy of the system after the collision to that before.

Explain what happens to the kinetic energy that is 'lost'.

#### b.1.4 Special Case: Separation of Bodies

* Problems involving separation of bodies involve a single body which separates, such as 'explodes' or splits up.
* By using the principle of conservation of momentum, the directions and the velocities of the different bodies may be analysed.

**Example 4 (Separation of Bodies)**

a) Calculate the recoil velocity of a 5.0 kg rifle that shoots a 0.020 kg bullet out with a velocity of 620 m s\({}^{-1}\).

b) Explain whether the rifle or the bullet has a higher kinetic energy.

#### b.1.5 Real Life Applications of Elastic and Inelastic Collisions

* Most collisions in the real world are really inelastic in nature (even the example of two billiard balls colliding is not exactly elastic).
* Some of the kinetic energy before collision has been transformed into other forms of energy such as internal energy (heat) and sound.
* One can still approach these problems by approximating the collision to be elastic as such approximations do give a reasonable prediction of how the system will behave.

Since action and reaction pairs are always equal in magnitude and opposite in direction, the resultant force on any mass is always zero. (True/False)

## Appendix

### Collision between two masses with the same mass

Suppose that two bodies with the same mass \(m\) collide elastically and the body on the right has an initial velocity of zero,

By the Principle of Conservation of Linear Momentum (taking rightward as positive),

\[mu_{1}=m\nu_{1}+m\nu_{2}\]

Since the collision is elastic, kinetic energy is also conserved.

Relative speed of Approach = Relative speed of Separation

\[u_{1}=\nu_{2}-\nu_{1}\]

Subtracting equation (2) from equation (1),

\[2\nu_{1}=0\]

Therefore,

\[\nu_{1}=0\]

Sub \(\nu_{1}=0\) into equation (1) or (2),

\[\nu_{2}=u_{1}\]

This implies that the mass which was initially moving will come to a stop after collision and the mass that was initially stationary will move off with the same velocity as the mass that was initially moving. In other words, there is a complete transfer of kinetic energy.
