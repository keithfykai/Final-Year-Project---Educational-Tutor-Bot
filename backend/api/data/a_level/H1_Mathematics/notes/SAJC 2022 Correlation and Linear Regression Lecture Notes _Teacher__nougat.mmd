## Chapter 7 (Statistics) Correlation and Linear Regression

### Objectives

At the end of the chapter, students should be able to:

1. Understand that bivariate data consists of the values of two variables (independent and dependent variables) obtained from the same sample expressed in ordered pairs;
2. Use the graphic calculator to plot the scatter diagram for a set of bivariate data to determine if there is a linear relationship between the two variables;
3. Understand that the correlation coefficient is a measure of the fit of a scatter diagram to a linear model;
4. Calculate the product moment correlation coefficient for a set of bivariate data using a graphic calculator, and relate the value (in particular, values close to -1, 0 and 1) to the appearance of the scatter diagram; [Note: zero correlation does not necessarily imply 'no relationship', but rather 'no linear relationship'.]
5. Understand that a high correlation between two variables does not necessarily imply one directly causes the other;
6. Understand the concepts of linear regression and 'least squares' with reference to the scatter diagram;
7. Use a graphic calculator to find the equation of the least squares regression line, and interpret its slope and intercept; [Note: A different line will be obtained if we interchange the independent and dependent variables.]
8. Understand the concepts of extrapolation and interpolation of data, and use the appropriate regression line to make prediction or estimate a value in practical situations.

### Introduction

Regression analysis and correlation analysis have been developed to study and measure the statistical relationship that exists between two or more variables. In the A Level syllabus, we will investigate the linear regression analysis and linear correlation analysis of two variables.

In **linear correlation analysis**, we measure the strength or closeness of the linear relationship between the two variables.

In **linear regression analysis**, we prepare an estimating (or regression) linear equation to estimate the values of one variable from given values of another.

In other words, correlation analysis reveals the extent to which two variables are related whilst regression analysis tells us how they are related.

**EXAMPLE**

We are interested in the relationship between the number of hours studying and the marks obtained. The table below shows the amount of time (\(x\) hours) that 6 average students spent studying for a test and the marks that they obtained (\(y\) out of 100 marks).

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|l|l|} \hline \(x\) & 1 & 2.5 & 3 & 4 & 4.2 & 5 \\ \hline \(y\) & 20 & 46 & 48 & 60 & 61 & 65 \\ \hline \end{tabular}

Correlation and regression analyses will help us to answer the following questions:

* Linear Correlation
* By finding the regression line
* By using the regression line
* Interpolation, Extrapolation

#### 7.1.1 Bivariate Data

Bivariate data refers to data connecting two variables. Each observation thus comprises a pair of values taken by the two variables. It is customary to express the bivariate data as **ordered pairs (\(x\), \(y\))**.

An example of bivariate data is the data given in the table above, which shows a set of 6 pairs of values for the two variables, \(x\) and \(y\).

#### Independent vs Dependent Variables

In the physical sciences, we often set up investigations or experiments in which we try to find a relationship between two variables.

For such experiments, it is fairly common for the researcher to assign arbitrary values to one variable so that corresponding values of the other variable can be measured. For this reason, the variable that the researcher has control over is known as the independent variable (or controlled variable), while the other variable under investigation (whose values we want to predict) is called the dependent variable.

On the other hand, there are situations (called observational studies) where the values of the independent variable cannot be pre-selected. An example of this is the study on the effect of time taken to prepare for a test (independent variable) on result of the test (dependent variable).

An **independent variable** (or input/controlled/predetermined variable) is usually the one whose value can be set or controlled. It is usually denoted by \(x\).

A **dependent variable** (or output/response variable) is usually the one whose value we want to predict. It is usually denoted by \(y\).

However, it is sometimes not possible to decide what the independent and dependent variables are, given a set of data. For example, History and Geography scores of a student.

**Example 1**.: **Identifying independent and dependent variables**

In each of the cases below, identify the independent and dependent variables.

(a) The drying time of a particular type of hobby paint depends on various factors including ambient temperature. The following table shows eight pairs of data obtained in an experiment on the ambient temperature in degree Celsius ( \({}^{\circ}\)C ) and the corresponding drying time (in hours) of the paint.

\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|} \hline Ambient temperature, \(x\) (\({}^{\circ}\)C ) & 32.6 & 6.6 & 23.5 & 12.7 & 35.1 & 20.3 & 27.8 & 17.4 \\ \hline Drying time, \(y\) (hours) & 5.9 & 24.9 & 3.8 & 17.7 & 3.4 & 12.5 & 8.6 & 16.2 \\ \hline \end{tabular}

Independent variable : Ambient temperature

Dependent variable : Drying time

(b) The table shows a Verbal Reasoning test score, \(x\), and an English test score, \(y\), for each of a random sample of 10 students who took both tests.

\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|} \hline Verbal Reasoning test score (\(x\)) & 112 & 106 & 110 & 115 & 109 & 119 & 102 & 100 & 116 & 95 \\ \hline English test score (\(y\)) & 69 & 63 & 75 & 79 & 72 & 85 & 90 & 58 & 75 & 60 \\ \hline \end{tabular}

Either \(x\) or \(y\) can be considered as the independent variables

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:5]

When drawing a scatter diagram, ensure that the **axes are labeled** and the **relative position** of the points are correct. The **max and min \(x\) and \(y\) values observed** must be **labeled** as well.

**Solution:**

\[\begin{array}{c}\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{images/142.eps}\end{array}\]

#### Interpreting Scatter Diagrams

Plotting a scatter diagram gives us an overview of how the variables are related, and hence indicates the strength of correlation between the variables. To interpret scatter diagrams, we can comment on 3 things:

## 1 Type of relationship:

The relationship might be linear, curved or no clear relationship.

\[\begin{array}{c}\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{images/202.eps}\end{array}\]

If all the points in a scatter diagram seem to lie near a straight line, we say there is **linear** correlation between the variables.

If most points lie close to some curve, the correlation is curvilinear.

If all the points are randomly scattered, with no discernible pattern, we say that the variables are uncorrelated or there is no correlation.

## 2 Strength

If the data points are close to the line of best fit, there is a **strong** correlation between \(x\) and \(y\).

If the data points are close to the line of best fit, there is a **strong** correlation between \(x\) and \(y\).

If \(y\) generally increases as \(x\) increases, then \(x\) and \(y\) are **positively** correlated.

Note:

A scatter diagram can also give us visual evidence of _outliers_ (i.e. points that are significantly different from the rest of data) or suspicious observations. Removing such points gives a truer picture of the relationship between the variables.

**Exercise 1**

1. With the aid of a graphic calculator, sketch a scatter diagram for each of the following sets of data.

(a) 

(b) 

Correlation and Linear Regression2. For each of the scatter diagrams in Question 1, describe the correlation between the values of \(x\) and \(y\). Solution: (a) Moderately strong positive linear correlation. (b) Negative curvilinear correlation.

### Product Moment Correlation Coefficient, \(r\)

Interpreting the strength of correlation between two variables based solely on the scatter diagram is subjective. It can even be deceiving when different scales are used for the axes. To avoid such situations, we will use a **numerical analysis of the data** to determine the type of relation that exist between two variables.

#### What is Product Moment Correlation Coefficient, \(r\)?

The product-moment correlation coefficient, denoted by \(r\), where \(-1\leq r\leq 1\), is a numerical value which indicates the **strength** and **direction** of a linear relationship between two variables \(x\) and \(y\).

The product moment correlation coefficient is also known as sample correlation coefficient, linear correlation coefficient or Pearson Product Moment Correlation Coefficient.

#### Calculation of \(r\) using formula

For a sample of \(n\) measurements on \(x\) and \(y\), the product-moment correlation coefficient \(r\) is given by

\[r=\frac{\sum\bigl{(}x_{i}-\overline{x}\bigr{)}\bigl{(}y_{i}-\overline{y}\bigr{)} }{\sqrt{\bigl{(}\sum\bigl{(}x_{i}-\overline{x}\bigr{)}^{2}\bigr{)}\bigl{(}\sum \bigl{(}y_{i}-\overline{y}\bigr{)}^{2}\bigr{)}}}=\frac{\sum xy-\frac{\sum x \sum y}{n}}{\sqrt{\left(\sum x^{2}-\frac{\bigl{(}\sum x\bigr{)}^{2}}{n}\right) \Biggl{(}\sum y^{2}-\frac{\bigl{(}\sum y\bigr{)}^{2}}{n}\Biggr{)}}}\]

(formula given by MF 26)

**Note:**

1. \(\overline{x}=\frac{\sum x}{n}\) and \(\overline{y}=\frac{\sum y}{n}\)

2. The derivation of these two formulae is beyond the scope of the A Level syllabus.

**Example 3** (Use Formula when data are given in summary form)

10 sets of lengths (\(x\)) and breadths (\(y\)) in mm have been taken and the data has been summarized as:

\[\sum x=1782,\ \sum y=1483,\ \ \sum x^{2}=318086,\ \sum y^{2}=220257,\ \sum xy=264582.\]

Find the product moment correlation coefficient for the sample and comment on your answer.

**Solution:**

\[r_{xy} = \frac{\boldsymbol{\Sigma}xy-\frac{\boldsymbol{\Sigma}x\boldsymbol {\Sigma}y}{n}}{\sqrt{\left(\boldsymbol{\Sigma}x^{2}-\frac{(\boldsymbol{ \Sigma}x)^{2}}{n}\right)\left(\boldsymbol{\Sigma}y^{2}-\frac{(\boldsymbol{ \Sigma}y)^{2}}{n}\right)}}\] \[= \frac{264582-\frac{\bigl{(}1782\bigr{)}\bigl{(}1483\bigr{)}}{10} \sqrt{\left(318086-\frac{1782^{2}}{10}\right)\left(220257-\frac{1483^{2}}{10} \right)}}=0.744\]

Lengths and breadths have positive and moderately strong linear correlation.

#### Calculating \(r\) using the Graphic Calculator

Your graphic calculator can be used to calculate the value of \(r\) for a given set of data.

**Example 4**

The table shows the number of hours (_x_ hours) that 6 average students spent studying for a test and the marks obtained (_y_ marks out of 100 marks). Find the linear product-moment correlation coefficient between \(x\) and \(y\).

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|} \hline \(x\) & 1 & 2.5 & 3 & 4 & 4.2 & 5 \\ \hline \(y\) & 20 & 46 & 48 & 60 & 61 & 65 \\ \hline \end{tabular}

To find the value of \(r\), we may use the following GC keystrokes:

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|} \hline \multicolumn{2}{|c|}{**Steps**} & \multicolumn{2}{c|}{**Screenshot**} & \multicolumn{2}{c|}{**Remarks**} \\ \hline Press [MODE] then [ARROW DOWN]. & \multicolumn{2}{c|}{**tBACN+**} & \multicolumn{2}{c|}{**cLAS5IC**} & \multicolumn{2}{c|}{Alternatively,} \\  & \multicolumn{2}{c|}{**tBACN+**} & \multicolumn{2}{c|}{**tBACN+**} & \multicolumn{2}{c|}{**tBACN+**} \\ \hline \(y\) & 20 & 46 & 48 & 60 & 61 & 65 \\ \hline \end{tabular}

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|} \hline \multicolumn{2}{|c|}{**Steps**} & \multicolumn{2}{c|}{**Screenshot**} & \multicolumn{2}{c|}{**Remarks**} \\ \hline Press [MODE] then [ARROW DOWN]. & \multicolumn{2}{c|}{**

#### 7.3.4 Properties of Product Moment Correlation Coefficient, \(r\)

1. The **sign** of the correlation coefficient indicates the **direction** of linear correlation. * When \(r>0\), there is a **positive linear correlation** between the variables i.e. as \(x\) increases, \(y\) also increases. * When \(r<0\), there is a **negative linear correlation** between the variables i.e. as \(x\) increases, \(y\) decreases.
2. The **magnitude** of \(r\) indicates the **strength** of the linear correlation, where -1 \(\leq\)\(r\)\(\leq\) 1. The closer the value of \(r\) is to 1 (or - 1), the closer the points on a scatter diagram are to a positively (or negatively) sloped straight line and the stronger the linear relationship. * When \(r=1\), there is a **perfect** positive linear correlation. All the points lie exactly on a straight line with positive gradient. * When \(r=-1\), there is a **perfect** negative linear correlation. All the points lie exactly on a straight line with negative gradient. * When \(r=0\), there is **no linear** correlation. However it does not mean there is no relationship between the two variables. As a general guide, * 0.8 \(\leq\)\(|r|\) <1 indicates **strong** linear correlation between the two variables. * 0.5 \(\leq\)\(|r|\) < 0.8 indicates **moderately strong** linear correlation between the two variables. * 0 \(<\)\(|r|\) < 0.5 indicates **weak** linear correlation between the two variables.

**Example 6**:

1. We are interested in the relationship between the amount of food supplement fed to hens (in grams/day) and the hardness of the shells of eggs laid (on a scale of 1 to 10). 

The scatter diagram is given on the left. Find \(r\) and comment on the relation between the variables. 

The value of \(r\) is positive and close to 1, and the scatter diagram reveals a strong linear relationship, there is a strong positive linear correlation between the amount of food supplement fed to hens and the hardness of the shells of eggs laid. 2. The daily rate charged by a car-hire firm varies with the length of the hire period, as shown in the table below. 

The scatter diagram is given on the right. Find \(r\) and comment on the relation between the variables. 

Since the value of \(r\) is negative but not close to -1, and the scatter diagram suggests a curved relationship, there is a negative correlation between the length of the hire period and the daily rate.

#### The Effect of Transformation on \(r\)

**Example 7**

The table shows the number of hours (\(x\) hours) that 6 average students spent studying for a test and the marks obtained (\(y\) marks out of 100 marks).

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|} \hline \(x\) & 1 & 2.5 & 3 & 4 & 4.2 & 5 \\ \hline \(y\) & 20 & 46 & 48 & 60 & 61 & 65 \\ \hline \end{tabular}

The teacher decided to scale the test marks by multiplying each mark by 2 and then add 10 marks to obtain the new mark \(z\). Find the linear product-moment correlation coefficient between \(x\) and \(z\) and comment on the value obtained.

What do you notice about the value of \(r\) compared to the value found in Example 4?

**Solution:**

To find the value of \(r\), we may use the following GC keystrokes:

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|} \hline New mark, \(z=2y+10\) & \(\begin{array}{c}\text{L1}\\ \text{L2}\\ \text{L3}\end{array}\) by keying in the formula \(\begin{array}{c}\text{L}_{3}\\ \text{L}_{3}=2\text{L}_{2}+10\end{array}\). & \\ \hline \end{tabular}

### Exercise 2

1. Explain why it is advisable to plot a scatter diagram before interpreting a correlation coefficient calculated for a sample drawn from a bivariate distribution. **Solution:** A scatter diagram is useful in showing correlation as the correlation coefficient does not show any kind of relation except linear correlation. By plotting a scatter diagram, we are able to have an overview of how the variables are related and hence give an indication of the strength of correlation (which may not be linear) between the variables. 2. A sample linear correlation coefficient between two random variables \(X\) and \(Y\) gave a value close to 1. Explain why this need not indicate a linear relation between \(X\) and \(Y\). **Solution:** A sample linear correlation coefficient between two random variables \(X\) and \(Y\) is a measure of the strength of linear correlation between the two variables, but it does not provide further information about the actual relation between the variables. 3. With the aid of a graphic calculator, find the value of the product moment correlation coefficient for each of the following sets of data. (a) 

**Solution:**

(a) -0.436 (b) 0.975

4. For each of the data set in Question 3, use the product moment correlation coefficient to suggest the correlation between the values of \(x\) and \(y\). **Solution:**

(a) Weak negative linear correlation (b) Strong positive linear correlation

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:17]

### Linear Regression

#### Types of regression lines

Linear Regression attempts to model the relationship between two variables by fitting a linear equation to a set of observed data.

Before attempting to fit a linear model to the observed data, we should first determine whether there is a linear relationship between the two variables. **A scatter diagram and the product moment correlation coefficient, \(r\), between the two variables will give us a good indication of whether it is meaningful to model the observed data with a straight line.**

To calculate the equation of the linear regression line, the method most commonly used is called the least squares method. The resulting line is called the line of best fit or the **least squares regression line** because we have to work backwards or regress, using the given points, to find the original linear equation.

In general, given a set of bivariate data, we can find two types of regression lines:

1. the **regression line of \(y\) on \(x\)**, and
2. the **regression line of \(x\) on \(y\)**.

To decide which one is the appropriate line to construct, we can consider the context of the problem and the purpose of the regression line.

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|} \hline \(x\) & \(y\) & **Purpose** & \begin{tabular}{c} **Equation of** \\ **Regression Line** \\ \end{tabular} & \begin{tabular}{c} **Remarks** \\ \end{tabular} \\ \hline Independent & Dependent & Predict \(y\) given \(x\) & \(y\) on x & \\ \cline{3-6}  & & Predict \(x\) given \(y\) & \(y\) on x & \\ \hline Random & Random & Predict \(y\) given \(x\) & \(y\) on x & \begin{tabular}{c} Treat \(x\) as the independent variable \\ \end{tabular} \\ \cline{3-6}  & & Predict \(x\) given \(y\) & \begin{tabular}{c} \(x\) on \(y\) \\ i.e. \(x=dy+e\) \\ \end{tabular} & 
\begin{tabular}{c} Treat \(y\) as the independent variable \\ \end{tabular} \\ \hline \end{tabular}

#### Using Graphic Calculator to find Equations of Regression Lines

To begin, let us try to find regression lines for the following set of data, which contains eight pairs of observations of the variables \(x\) and \(y\).

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|} \hline \(x\) & 16 & 13 & 16 & 15 & 16 & 12 & 17 & 15 \\ \hline \(y\) & 7 & 17 & 12 & 11 & 18 & 10 & 17 & 12 \\ \hline \end{tabular}

The GC can be used to find the equations of both types of regression lines: the regression line of \(y\) on \(x\), and the regression line of \(x\) on \(y\).

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:19]

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:20]

**Interpretation of the Slope and Intercept of a linear regression line**

For the regression equation \(y=bx+c\), \(b\) is the **gradient** (slope) of the line and \(c\) is the **\(y\)-intercept** of the line. It is necessary to interpret the meaning of the values of \(b\) and \(c\) in the context of the question.

\(c\) is the value of \(y\) when \(x=0\). Note that this value of \(y\) is meaningful only if the range of values of \(x\) in the bivariate data includes 0 or has values near 0.

\(b\) is the amount by which \(y\) increases for every unit of increase in \(x\) i.e. \(b\) is the rate of change of \(y\) with respect of \(x\).

#### Least Squares regression line of \(x\) on \(y\)

Similarly, the least squares regression line of \(x\) on \(y\) can be written as \(x=dy+e\), and is the line that produces the least sum of the residuals, \(\sum f_{i}^{2}\).

\(x=dy+e\)

The least squares regression line of \(x\) on \(y\) can be written as \(x=dy+e\).

or \(x-\overline{x}=d\left(y-\overline{y}\right)\), where \(d=\dfrac{\sum\left(x-\overline{x}\right)\left(y-\overline{y}\right)}{\sum \left(y-\overline{y}\right)^{2}}\)

(NOT in MF 26)

**Note:**

1. \(d\) is also known as the **coefficient of regression** of \(x\) on \(y\).
2. The point \((\overline{x},\,\overline{y})\) lies on the regression line \(x=dy+e\). Hence the point \((\overline{x},\,\overline{y})\) lies on both types of regression lines.
3. The equation of the regression line of \(x\) on \(y\) cannot be found by making \(x\) the subject in the equation of the regression line of \(y\) on \(x\). In general, the two lines are not identical unless there is perfect linear correlation.
4. Equation \(x=dy+e\) may be written as \(y=\dfrac{x-e}{d}=\left(\dfrac{1}{d}\right)x-\dfrac{e}{d}\). Therefore the gradient of the line is \(\dfrac{1}{d}\).

1. For **regression line of \(x\) on \(y\)**, we have to **rearrange the variables and express \(y\) in terms of \(x\)** before sketching.

\begin{tabular}{|c|} \hline \(x=0.0648y+14.157\) \\ \(y=\dfrac{x-14.157}{0.0648}\) \\ \end{tabular}

2. (a) As \(y\) is correctly determined as 16, \(y\) is controlled. Thus \(y\) is the independent variable. Hence the regression line of \(x\) on \(y\) should be used to estimate the value of \(x\). So \(x=14.157+0.0648(16)=15.2\) (3 s.f.) This is not a good estimation because the scatter diagram does not show a clear linear relationship between \(x\) and \(y\). (b) Since there is no clear indication of the independent variable, the regression line of \(x\) on \(y\) should be used to estimate the value of \(x\) given \(y=13\). Hence \(x=14.157+0.0648(13)=15.0\) (c) Since there is no clear indication of the independent variable, the regression line of \(y\) on \(x\) should be used to estimate the value of \(y\) given \(x=15\). Hence \(y=0.35(15)+7.75=13\)

#### Properties of Regression Lines

1. The point \((\overline{x},\,\overline{y})\) lies on both the regression lines of \(y\) on \(x\), and \(x\) on \(y\). Hence the two regression lines intersect at \((\overline{x},\,\overline{y})\). (as observed in Example 7) 2. The bigger the value of \(\left|r\right|\), the closer the regression lines of \(y\) on \(x\) is to the regression line of \(x\) on \(y\).
3. If there is perfect linear correlation i.e. \(r=\pm 1\), the regression lines of \(y\) on \(x\) and \(x\) on \(y\) are identical.
4. If there is no linear correlation i.e. \(r=0\), the regression lines of \(y\) on \(x\) and \(x\) on \(y\) are at right angles.

The following diagrams are a graphical representation of points \(2-4\).

Correlation and Linear Regression

**Example 10**: **[SRJC 2007 Prelim]**

The table below gives the observed values of bivariates \(x\) and \(y\).

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|} \hline \(x\) & 20 & 30 & 34 & 35 & 36 & 40 & 42 \\ \hline \(y\) & 32 & 25 & \(a\) & 22 & 26 & 18 & 19 \\ \hline \end{tabular}

It is given that the equation of the regression line of \(y\) on \(x\) is \(y=43.5-0.602x\).

Find the value of \(a\) correct to the nearest integer.

**Solution:**

\[\overline{x} =\frac{20+30+34+35+36+40+42}{7}=\frac{237}{7}\] \[\overline{y} =\frac{32+25+a+22+26+18+19}{7}=\frac{142+a}{7}\]

The point \(\left(\overline{x},\overline{y}\right)\) lies on the regression line of

\[y\]

 on

\[x\]

, \[y=43.5-0.602x\]

\[\Rightarrow\frac{142+a}{7}=43.5-0.602\left(\frac{237}{7}\right)\Rightarrow a=19.826 \approx 20.\]

Q: Why can't we simply substitute \(x=\)34 into the equation of the regression line?

A: Since \(x=\) 34 is an observation, it is unlikely to lie on the regression line.

### Interpolation and Extrapolation

**Interpolation** refers to the process of predicting an unknown value that is **within** the range of the sample data.

**Extrapolation** prefers to the process of predicting an unknown value that is **outside** the range of the sample data.

**EXAMPLE**

Consider the table of data which shows the age (\(x\) years) of 8 female athletes and their time (\(y\) seconds) taken to complete a 100m race.

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|l|l|l|l|l|} \hline \(x\) years & 15.5 & 16.5 & 17.2 & 19.0 & 20.5 & 21.4 & 23.0 & 24.3 \\ \hline \(y\) seconds & 12.4 & 12.4 & 12.1 & 12.0 & 11.9 & 11.7 & 11.5 & 11.4 \\ \hline \end{tabular}

Observe that the least and greatest values of \(x\) are 15.5 and 24.3 years respectively.

Using the least squares regression line of \(y\) on \(x\) to estimate values of \(y\) when \(x\) is between 15.5 and 24.3 years is known as **interpolation**.

Using the line to estimate values of \(y\) when \(x\) is smaller than 15.5 or greater than 24.3 is known as **extrapolation**. Note that **extra care** must be taken when **extrapolation** is used. The more remote the prediction is from the range of values used to fit the model, the riskier the prediction becomes since there is no way to check that the relationship continues to be linear.

For instance, there is a strong correlation between the age in years and the 100 m race times of female athletes between the ages of 15.5 and 24.3 years. To extend the connection, the following figure would suggest that veteran athletes are quicker than athletes who are in their prime, and if they live long enough, they can complete the 100 m race in 0 seconds!

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|l|l|l|l|} \hline \(y\) & \multicolumn{1}{c}{} & \multicolumn{1}{c}{} & \multicolumn{1}{c}{} & \multicolumn{1}{c}{} & \multicolumn{1}{c}{} & \multicolumn{1}{c}{} & \multicolumn{1}{c}{}

**Example 11**: **[SRJC 2008 Prelim (Modified)]**

An engineer collected data on how the temperature, \(T\)\({}^{\circ}\)C, generated in the shoulder of a car tyre varies with its speed, \(V\) km/h, when the car is driven under specified conditions. He found that the two variables follow a linear model with regression line of \(T\) on \(V\) as

\(t=0.8667v+26.5833\) with product-moment correlation coefficient, \(r=0.9939\). As a backup, the engineer's assistant was also on site to record the temperature readings when the experiment was being carried out. The assistant submitted his observations as shown in the table below:

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|} \hline \(v\) & 20 & 30 & 40 & 50 & 60 & 70 & 80 & 90 \\ \hline \(t\) & 45 & 52 & 64 & 66 & 66 & 89 & 98 & 104 \\ \hline \end{tabular}

It came to the engineer's attention that his assistant's temperature readings contained an error. Having misplaced his original records, the engineer decided to work out the correct data. He is certain that the wrong \(t\) value (the corresponding \(v\) value remains correct) occurred in one of these three data points: (60, 66), (70, 89) or (80, 98).

(i) Which one of the above three data pairs is most likely to contain the wrongly entered value of \(t\)? Show clearly how you are able to identify the error.

(ii) Find the correct value of \(t\) recorded by the engineer giving your answer correct to 3 significant figures.

(iii) With the use of a suitable regression line, estimate the value of

(a) \(v\) when \(t=70\).

(b) \(t\) when \(v=300\)

Give a reason for the choice of line and comment on the reliability of your estimation.

**Solution:**

(i) By plotting the values recorded by the assistant on a scatter diagram, together with the regression line calculated by the engineer.

Of the 3 points suspected to be wrong, (60, 66) is the data point with the largest vertical distance from the line. Thus, it is most likely the point containing the wrong value of \(t\) is 66.

(ii) \(t=0.8667v+26.5833\)

Since \((\overset{\sim}{v},\overset{\sim}{t})\) lies on the regression line,

\(\overset{\sim}{t}=0.8667\overset{\sim}{v}+26.5833\)\(and\)\(\overset{\sim}{v}=\dfrac{\sum v}{n}=\dfrac{440}{8}=55\)

\(\overset{\sim}{t}=0.8667(55)+26.5833=74.2518\)

\(\sum t=8(74.2518)\)\(45+52+...+t^{\prime}=594.0144\)

\(518+t^{\prime}=594.0144\)

\(t^{\prime}=76.014\approx 76.0\) (\(\mathbf{3\,s.f.}\))

(iii)

(a) Since \(v\) is the independent variable (predetermined and controlled), use \(t\) on \(v\).

\(t=0.8667v+26.5833\)

When \(t=70\),

\(70=0.8667v+26.5833\)

\(v=50.09\approx 50.1\)

The answer obtained by interpolation is reliable as the value of \(r\) suggests a strong positive linear correlation between the two variables for this given range of data.

(b) Since \(v\) is the independent variable (predetermined and controlled), use \(t\) on \(v\).

\(t=0.8667v+26.5833\)

when \(v=300\),

\(t=0.8667(300)+26.5833\)

\(t=0.8667(300)+26.5833\)

\(=286.593\approx 287\)

The answer obtained by extrapolation is not reliable.

2. For a given set of data, 

2. For a given set of data, it is known that \(\overline{x}=10\) and \(\overline{y}=4\). The gradient of the regression line \(y\) on \(x\) is 0.6. Find the equation of this regression line and estimate \(y\) when \(x=12\). Solution: Equation of the regression line \(y\) on \(x\) is \(y=a+0.6x\). Substitute \(x=10\) and \(y=4\), we have \(a=-2\). Equation of the regression line \(y\) on \(x\) is \(y=-2+0.6x\). When \(x=12\), \(y=-2+0.6\bigl{(}12\bigr{)}=5.2\).

(iii)   From GC, \(x=0.9398y-10.558\)

i.e. \(x=0.940y-10.6\)

(iv) (a)   When \(x=28\), using the regression line of \(y\) on \(x\),

\(y=16.7+1.01\big{(}28\big{)}\)

\(=\$45.00\) (to 2 d.p.)

(iv) (b)   When \(y=198\), using the regression line of \(x\) on \(y\),

\(x=0.940\big{(}198\big{)}-10.6\)

\(=\) 176 km (to 3 s.f.)

(v)   The estimate for part (a) is reliable because 28 km falls within the range of values. However, the estimate for part (b) is not reliable because it is an extrapolation, since $198 falls outside of the range of \(y\)-values.

2*. After a major renovation at the computer-mart Sim Lum Square, the manager Keith carried out a study to investigate how the their sales figures in the first six months after re-opening depended on their renovation cost. The data below were collected from eight randomly chosen shops, in thousands of dollars. (i) Keith found the equation of the regression line of \(y\) on \(x\) for the above data is \(y=52.244+bx\). It was known that this line and the regression line of \(x\) on \(y\) both pass through the point (33.9, 74.3). Find the value of \(b\) to 5 significant figures and show that \(a\) is 62.6. (ii) Explain why it is not appropriate to use the regression line of \(x\) on \(y\) to predict the renovation cost when given the sales figures. (iii) Give a sketch of the scatter diagram for the data. Calculate the product moment correlation coefficient and comment on the value obtained. [Ans: (i) 0.65062 (iii) 0.663] Solution: (i) At (33.9, 74.3), 74.3 = 52.244 + \(b\)(33.9) \(\Rightarrow\)\(b\) = 0.65062 Since line passes through (33.9, 74.3), \(\overline{y}=74.3\) \(\Rightarrow\dfrac{\sum y+a}{8}=74.3\) \(\Rightarrow\dfrac{531.8+a}{8}=74.3\) \(\Rightarrow a=62.6\) (ii) Since the renovation cost is the independent variable, the line \(x\) on \(y\) is inappropriate for prediction purposes as the line \(y\) on \(x\) should be used. (iii)\(r=0.663\). It suggests that there is a moderately strong positive linear relation between renovation cost and sales.

**(iv)**: For each of the seven sample values of \(x\), \(Y\) is given by \(Y^{*}=a+bx\), where \(a\) and \(b\) are any real constants. Explain why \(\sum(y-Y^{*})^{2}\geq c\) where \(c\) is a constant to be determined.

**Solution:**:

Incorrect result is \(x=10\), \(y=42\).

From the scatter diagram, \(x=10\), \(y=42\) is an outlier.

(i) \(y=-14.16830+1.61302x\) and \(x=9.97265+0.59168y\)

Using GC to solve the above simultaneous equations,

\(x=34.8522\)\(\stackrel{{\rightarrow}}{{y}}=42.04899\)

Let \(k\) be the correct value when \(x=\)10,

\(k=42.04899\big{(}7\big{)}-(1.3+14.8+30.1+60.8+81.3+98.6)\)

\(=7.4\) (to 1 decimal place)

(ii) As \(x\) is the independent variable, \(y\) on \(x\) should be used.

(iii) When \(x=40\), \(y=50.3525\).

The estimate is reliable since \(r=0.977\) is close to 1, indicates a strong positive linear correlation between \(x\) and \(y\) and \(x=40\) is within data range.

4. \(c\) is the sum of least square deviation between the observed value \(y\) and the predicted value on the regression line \(y\) on \(x\). Using GC, \(c=401.541488=402\) (to 3 sig figs)

### Self-Reading Examples

**Example 12 [N2002/2/6 (Modified)]**

A random sample of five students is taken from those sitting examinations in English and History, and their marks, \(x\) and \(y\), each out of 100, are given in the table.

\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|c|c|c|} \hline English mark (\(x\)) & 56 & 41 & 75 & 88 & 84 \\ \hline History mark (\(y\)) & 32 & 24 & 70 & 65 & 47 \\ \hline \end{tabular}

Find, in any form, the equation of the regression line of

(i) \(y\) on \(x\) (ii) \(x\) on \(y\)

Hence, find the point of intersection of the two lines.

A sixth student scored 55 in the History examination, but missed the English examination.

Use the appropriate regression line to estimate what his English mark would have been.

**Solution:**

From GC,

(i) \(y=0.838x\) - 10.1,

(ii) \(x=0.822\)\(y+29.7\)

Solving (i) and (ii) simultaneously using GC, \(x=68.8\) and \(y=47.5\) (to \(3\) s.f.). (Note: \(\overline{x}=68.8\) and \(\overline{y}=47.6\) )

Since both \(x\) and \(y\) are random, and History marks \(y\) is given, we shall use the equation of \(x\) on \(y\). Hence, the English marks of the \(6^{\text{th}}\) student is given by \(x=0.822(55)+29.7=74.9\) (Ans)

* Obtain the value of the linear (product moment) correlation coefficient \(r\) for the data. Explain whether we can conclude that the rise in the big car premiums is due to the rise in the small car premiums.
* Plot a scatter diagram for the data and explain how its shape is related to the value of \(r\) obtained in (i).

**Solution:**

Even though \(r\) is close to 1, it does not mean that there is a cause and effect relationship between \(x\) and \(y\).
* The points on the scatter diagram lie close to a straight line with positive gradient. This agrees with the value of \(r\) obtained in part (i).

### Summary

1. A **scatter diagram** is useful in showing the general patterns and relationship (which may be linear or non-linear) between two variables. It is also useful for identifying outliers in the data set. To interpret scatter diagrams, we can comment on three things: type of relationship, strength of relationship, and direction of correlation.
2. The (Linear) Product-moment correlation coefficient, \(r\), indicates the **strength of linear correlation** between 2 variables. 
  If \(0<r<1\), there is a **positive** linear correlation, i.e. as \(x\) increases, \(y\) also increases. \(\mathbf{\succ}\)  If \(-1<r<0\), there is a **negative** linear correlation, i.e. as \(x\) increases, \(y\) decreases. \(\mathbf{\succ}\)  If \(r=1\), there is a **perfect positive** linear correlation. \(\mathbf{\succ}\)  If \(r=-1\), there is a **perfect negative** linear correlation. \(\mathbf{\succ}\)  If \(r\approx 1\), there is a **strong** positive linear correlation. \(\mathbf{\succ}\)  If \(r\approx-1\), there is a **strong** negative linear correlation. \(\mathbf{\succ}\) \(r=0\) indicates **no** linear correlation. But you can plot a **scatter diagram** to see whether there is a non-linear relationship.
* \(r\) does NOT provide information about causal relationship (or cause and effect) between variables. For example, if \(r\approx 1\), we cannot say that an increase in \(x\) causes \(y\) to increase. \(r\) is NOT affected by a linear transformation of \(x\) or \(y\) and it has no units.
* The value of \(r\) should be considered in conjunction with a **scatter diagram**.
3. Use of Least Squares Regression Lines 
  if 
  Note: For extrapolation, the estimated value of \(x\) or \(y\) may not be reliable as the given value of \(y\) or \(x\) is outside the range of the given \(y\) or \(x\) values.
4. (Estimated) Least squares regression lines* The **least squares regression line of \(\mathbf{y}\) on \(\mathbf{x}\)*
* The **least squares regression line of \(\mathbf{x}\) on \(\mathbf{y}\)*
* (\(x\) is the independent variable) is given by \(y=a+bx\)
* Common point is \((\,\overline{x},\overline{y}\,)\). Note: \(\overline{x}=\dfrac{\sum x}{n}\) and \(\,\overline{y}=\dfrac{\sum y}{n}\) for \(n\) pairs of sample data. By solving the 2 equations simultaneously, you can obtain \((\,\overline{x},\overline{y}\,)\).

## 5 Which type of regression line to use?

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|} \hline \(\mathbf{x}\) & \(\mathbf{y}\) & **Purpose** & **Equation of** & **Remarks** \\  & & & **Regression** & \\  & & & **Line** & \\ \hline Independent & Dependent & Predict \(y\) & \(y\) on x & \\  & & given \(x\) & & \\  & & Predict \(x\) & \(y\) on x & \\  & & given \(y\) & & \\ \hline Random & Random & Predict \(y\) & \(y\) on x & Treat \(x\) as the \\  & & given \(x\) & & independent variable \\ \cline{2-5}  & & Predict \(x\) & \(x\) on \(y\) & Treat \(y\) as the \\  & & given \(y\) & i.e. \(x=dy+e\) & independent variable \\ \hline \end{tabular}

## Appendix 1 Supplementary Notes

1. Valid conclusion on the relationship between two variables can only be derived based on both value of r and scatter diagram (see Anscombe's quartet).
2. Without a scatter plot, when asked to describe the relationship between two variables, avoid using definite terms. Instead we should use "there may be or may not be linear correlation..."
3. While deciding whether a variable is controlled, one must study carefully the method of data collection as described in the question.

**Anscombe's quartet** comprises four datasets that have identical simple statistical properties, yet appear very different when the scatter plot is being graphed. Each dataset consists of eleven (\(x\),\(y\)) points. They were constructed in 1973 by the statistician Francis Anscombe to demonstrate both the importance of graphing data before analysing it and the effect of outliers on statistical properties.Anscombe's quartet

Correlation and Linear RegressionThe regression line \(y\) on \(x\) is \(y-\overline{y}=b(x-\overline{x})\)

\(b\) = the regression coefficient of \(y\) on \(x\) (note: the gradient of the regression line \(y\) on \(x\))

The regression line \(y\) on \(x\) is \(x-\overline{x}=d(y-\overline{y})\)

\(d\) = the regression coefficient of \(x\) on \(y\),

(note: \(\dfrac{1}{d}\) is the gradient of the regression line \(x\) on \(y\))

\(r=\dfrac{\sum\left(x-\overline{x}\right)\left(y-\overline{y}\right)}{\sqrt{ \left[\sum\left(x-\overline{x}\right)^{2}\right]\left[\sum\left(y-\overline{ y}\right)^{2}\right]}}\) and \(\mathbf{b}=\dfrac{\sum\left(x-\overline{x}\right)\left(y-\overline{y}\right) }{\sum\left(x-\overline{x}\right)^{2}}\), \(d=\dfrac{\sum\left(x-\overline{x}\right)\left(y-\overline{y}\right)}{\sum \left(y-\overline{y}\right)^{2}}\)
