# H2 Topic 12b - Superposition

###### Abstract

A Water Spouting Bowl is a dramatic demonstration of standing waves. When damp hands run over the handles under the right conditions, resonance occurs and standing waves form around the circular bronze bowl, resulting in water glecting at antinodes around the rim.

(c) show an understanding of experiments which demonstrate stationary waves using microwaves, stretch strings and air columns (d) explain the formation of a stationary wave using a graphical method, and identify nodes and antinodes

### Stationary Waves

In H211 Waves, we learnt that a progressive wave transports energy. Here, we shall see how the superposition of two waves can cause interference such that energy is localised (confined within a region) despite wave motion. The waves formed are called _stationary_ waves or _standing_ waves.

The wave is stationary because the wave profile does not propagate although the particles still oscillate. Because the wave profile does not move, energy is not transmitted along the wave.

#### Region of Overlap

For the phenomena that we have seen earlier in H212a, we apply the Principle of Superposition at a _particular location_ on the screen. For standing waves, we apply the principle over the _entire length_ over which two waves meet and overlap.

#### Formation of Stationary Waves

A stationary wave is formed when

two waves of the same type, same amplitude, same frequency, wavelength and speed, travelling in opposite directions towards each other, meet and overlap to superpose across a length.

When asked to explain the formation of stationary waves in a particular set up, with the necessary features mentioned above in mind, be sure to describe:

* _how 2_ progressive waves of the same type are generated such that they are the same amplitude, frequency, wavelength and speed
* _how_ the 2 waves are travelling in opposite directions towards each other
* _where_ the 2 waves meet and overlap

**Example 20**

Two speakers connected in parallel to the same signal generator are directed facing each other to investigate stationary waves. Explain how a stationary wave is formed.

**Solution**

Both speakers output progressive longitudinal sound waves in opposite directions that have the same speed as they travel in the same medium of air and have the same wavelength and frequency as they are connected to same signal generator.

Both waves meet and overlap to superposes along the line joining the two speakers

**Example 21**

In the set up below, explain how the stationary wave is formed in the string.

**Solution**

oscillator sends out progressive transverse wave in string towards pulley wave reflects at the end of the string where pulley is, back towards oscillator

reflected wave has same speed, frequency and wavelength but travels in opposite direction meets and overlap with wave from oscillator to superpose along the string between the oscillator and the smooth pulley

**Note**: for both E.g. 20 and 21, check against the features mentioned at bottom of page 2.

#### 12.4.3 Reflection of Progressive Waves at Boundary Conditions

Stationary waves are often (but not always as per Example 20) formed when an _original_ wave meets and overlaps with a _reflected_ wave travelling in the opposite direction because the reflection preserves the type, amplitude, speed, frequency and wavelength.

_Boundaries_ are where the reflections take place. Different _boundary conditions_ result in different resultant amplitudes (from the superposition of original and reflected waves) at the boundary. Boundaries can be either _fixed ends_ or _free ends_.

For Example 20, the 2 waves meet and overlap into each other in free space. There are no boundary conditions in free space so a standing wave will always be formed. For Example 21, the boundary conditions are such that the two ends must be fixed ends along the string. Therefore, standing waves can _only_ be formed when the wavelength of the waves can fit into the boundaries and satisfy the boundary conditions.

#### Properties of Stationary Waves

When the two identical progressive waves meet and overlap with each other while travelling in opposite directions, some points will _never_ move and some others will move the most.

The resultant waveform has the following features:

1. Wave profile does not propagate.
2. Wave profile has a characteristic pattern of nodes and antinodes * node: a point where the amplitude is constantly zero * antinode: a point of maximum amplitude
3. Every particle of the wave, except nodes, oscillates with same frequency (same frequency as the incident or reflected progressive waves).
4. Distance between adjacent nodes (or adjacent antinodes) is \(\frac{1}{2}\lambda\).
5. Between two adjacent nodes, every particle oscillates in-phase.
6. Particles in adjacent inter-nodal segments oscillate in anti-phase.
7. Particles that are of same distance away from a node have the same amplitude.
8. The speed in \(\nu=f\lambda\) is the speed of the _incident or reflected progressive wave_.

_Particles of same distance away from a node have same amplitude._

_Particles in adjacent inter-nodal segments oscillate in anti-phase - as one reaches positive amplitude, the other negative amplitude._

_When this \(\lambda/2\) distance, all particles in-phase and reach individual differing amplitudes at same time._

_By convention, we use dotted lines ( ) to denote the wave profile half a period later._

**Example 22**

A detector is placed between microwave source and a metal reflector. At three adjacent points, R, S and T, the meter shows zero intensity. Find the frequency of the microwaves.

**Solution**

R, S, and T are nodes.

Distance between adjacent nodes is \(\dfrac{1}{2}\lambda\) so \(\lambda=3.2\) cm

\[\nu=f\lambda\] \[f=\dfrac{c}{\lambda}=\dfrac{3\times 10^{8}}{3.2\times 10^{-2}}=9.38 \times 10^{9}\ \mathrm{Hz}\]

**Note**: this is a bounded system -there is a standing wave formed when the source and the reflector are at some particular distances apart only.

A similar set up can be used to find the speed of sound.

Replace the microwave source with a speaker that is connected to a signal generator, and replace the microwave detector with a microphone connected to a cathode ray oscilloscope (c.r.o.).

1. Output a constant power voltage signal from signal generator to the speaker of known frequency \(f\).
2. Measure intensity of sound using a microphone connected to a cathode ray oscilloscope

Place microphone along a line perpendicular to the reflecting board joining up with speaker

Take preliminary measurements at different locations along the line to adjust for an input sensitivity on the c.r.o that can display the highest possible intensity that is the highest vertical trace on the c.r.o. display.
3. Move microphone along line joining board and speaker to detect positions of maxima and minima.

Keep distance between board and speaker constant.

Use metre ruler to measure the distance between several nodes.

Find average length of separation between adjacent nodes.

Wavelength \(\lambda\) is twice the separation between adjacent nodes.

Find speed of sound \(\nu=f\lambda\).

Vary the frequency \(f\) and repeat Steps 2, 3, 4 for 6 other frequencies to find average speed.

**Example 23**

A small amount of dust is scattered along the tube. When the frequency of sound is set to 512 Hz, the dust collects in small piles as shown below.

Find the wavelength of sound waves at 512 Hz in air.

Calculate the speed of sound in air in the tube.

Mark two points P and Q where the movement of air particles are \(n\) out of phase with the same amplitude.

**Solution**

(a) \(\lambda=\frac{2}{3.5}(119)=68.0\) cm

(b) \(\nu=f\lambda=512\left(68\times 10^{-2}\right)=348\) m s\({}^{-1}\)

(c) two points same distance from

either side of a node e.g.:

Example 23 is known as the Kundt's tube. A speaker sends sound waves along the inside of a tube. The sound is reflected at the other end (which may be open or closed - results in different modes). Note that the air column, which acts as the medium for sound waves to travel in, is _bounded_ by the tube: therefore stationary waves can only be set up at _certain_ wavelengths/frequencies.

When the standing wave is established, dust or fine powder that are originally at displacement antinodes get pushed away and accumulate at nodes where movement of air is zero. Therefore, the positions of nodes and antinodes can be clearly seen.

**Figure 7**: The sound is reflected at the other end (which may be open or closed - results in different modes). Note that the air column, which acts as the medium for sound waves to travel in, is _bounded_ by the tube: therefore stationary waves can only be set up at _certain_ wavelengths/frequencies.

When the standing wave is established, dust or fine powder that are originally at displacement antinodes get pushed away and accumulate at nodes where movement of air is zero. Therefore, the positions of nodes and antinodes can be clearly seen.

#### Comparing Stationary Waves and Progressive Waves

In unbounded systems (Example 20), stationary waves can form under all conditions so long as two waves of the same type, frequency, wavelength and speed, travel in opposite directions towards each other, meet and overlap.

More often, we work with systems that have boundary conditions: these systems can only support some fixed frequencies, which we alluded to as _natural frequencies_ in H210 Oscillations.

We come full circle and discuss situations when resonance occurs, when the external periodic driving force (waves) matches the natural frequency of the system (a length of string or air).

#### 12.4.6 Some Vocabulary Concerning Standing Waves in Bounded Systems

The rows in grey are less often seen at A-Levels H2 Physics:

mode of oscillation a particular pattern of nodes and antinodes

fundamental mode the mode of oscillation that has the lowest possible frequency of the standing wave fundamental frequency (or the longest possible wavelength of the incident/reflected wave)

overtone the _next_ possible mode of higher frequency from the fundamental mode

integer relation of the frequency to the fundamental frequency

e.g. the fundamental frequency of a system is 3 Hz

if the system supports a 9 Hz mode, the mode is the 3rd harmonic

therefore, the fundamental mode is also the first harmonic

#### 12.4.7 Problem Solving Strategies

Most questions involving stationary waves require some or all of the following steps:

1) Identify the boundary conditions (2 free ends, 2 fixed ends or 1-fixed-1-free)
2) Decide which mode of oscillation is required (fundamental mode or higher)
3) Sketch out the wave form needed based on mode and/or relationship between wavelength and system length
4) Generalise the relationship between wavelength and system length alongside \(\nu=f\lambda\)

You are expected to be able to demonstrate the process of determining the general relationship by first sketching the mode of oscillation. Therefore, _do not_ memorise the various relationships. Instead, practise the process of getting to them.

_It may seem counter-intuitive that longitudinal sound waves can reflect at an open end of a tube, since the direction of oscillations is parallel to the direction of energy transfer. The idea is that of impedance - how resistant a medium is to the transfer of a particular type of wave. When a pulse of compression travels down the tube and reaches the open end, it suddenly has the ability to spread out into the geometric shadow (diffract). The difference in impedance causes a partial reflection, some energy continues moving in the original direction out of the tube and the remnant is reflected back along the tube without a phase change. A continuous external periodic input of energy into the tube causes wavelengths of fixed lengths to grow in amplitude along the wave. This is in fact how anti-reflection coating works. When light goes from a medium of lower refractive index to higher refractive index, the partial reflection has a \(\pi\) phase change (no phase change when going from higher to lower refractive index analogous to sound waves above). A thin coating of thickness 1/4 is applied to lens to generate a reflected wave than destructively interferes with the partial reflectance; \(n_{air}<n_{coat}<n_{ens}\)._

**Example 24**: A taut wire is clamped at two points 3.0 m apart. It is plucked near one end.

1. State the three longest wavelengths present in the oscillating wire.
2. When the wire is plucked, many different modes are present in the wire at the same time. Suggest a method to make the 2nd longest wavelength the mode of oscillation.

**Solution**

(a) wavelengths (decreasing order): 6.0 m, 3.0 m, 2.0 m

(b) after plucking, make a node in the centre of wire

by placing finger lightly at the 1.5 m mark of wire

**Example 25**: Stationary waves are investigated via the set up below. It is known that the speed of waves in a stretched string \(\nu\) is directly proportional to square-root of tension in string \(\nu\propto\sqrt{T}\). The frequency of the oscillator is initially set to 0 Hz (no oscillation).

1. Explain how to obtain standing waves of lowest possible frequency in the string.
2. The distance from the oscillator to the pulley 2.4 m. At a frequency of 40 Hz, a stationary wave of the profile shown below is formed. Find the lowest frequency as in (a).

**Solution**

1. For a fixed mass providing constant tension, and a fixed distance between oscillator and pulley, slowly increase the frequency of oscillations until a standing wave with nodes at the oscillator and pulley is formed. Fine-tune the frequency such that the antinode in the middle of the string is maximum.
2. wavelength \(\lambda=\frac{2.4}{3}=0.8\) m

Fixed mass so speed is constant \(\nu=f\lambda=40(0.8)=32.0\) m s\({}^{-1}\)

wavelength at lowest frequency = 4.8 m

lowest frequency \(f_{0}=\frac{\nu}{\lambda}=\frac{32}{4.8}=6.67\) Hz

(40 Hz is the 6th harmonic)

**Note**: oscillator end can be considered a node because the amplitude is relatively small when compared to amplitude at antinodes. Work with information given in the question.

**Example 26**: A loud sound is heard when a speaker producing frequency of 280 Hz is placed near the end of a tube with both ends open, as shown in the figure below.

**Solution**

(a) integer multiples of \(\dfrac{2.5}{4}\)

**(b)**: \(\nu=f\lambda=280\left(\dfrac{2.5}{2}\right)=350\) m s\({}^{-1}\)

\(f_{0}=\dfrac{\nu}{\lambda}=\dfrac{350}{5}=70.0\) Hz

The length of an open-pipe (1 fixed and 1 free end) can be varied via a piston in hollow pipe. The sound waves reflect off the piston as a fixed end:

Another way is do vary the depth to which a hollow tube is submerged into water. The sound waves reflect off the water surface as a fixed end:

#### 12.4.9 Sound Waves are Pressure Waves

The wave profiles on page 10 depict the variation of displacement of particles. It is directly applicable for transverse waves. But for longitudinal waves e.g. sound, be aware that the wave profiles are merely _representations_ of the displacements.

This is not new information - it has been introduced in H211 Waves. The following section uses graphical relationships to show this in the context of stationary wave.

At the displacement node, the neighbouring air particles will be alternately crowding and separating away from it after half a period. The air particles at the displacement nodes are fixed in position.

Note, when a stationary wave is formed in a pipe, a loud sound is heard outside the tube - the whole air column is in resonance and acts as a long-ish source of sound. This is how wind musical instruments work. However, if we move a small-enough microphone down the length of the pipe, it will detect variations in audio volume as it will detect the _pressure_ (sound waves are pressure waves) nodes and antinodes.
