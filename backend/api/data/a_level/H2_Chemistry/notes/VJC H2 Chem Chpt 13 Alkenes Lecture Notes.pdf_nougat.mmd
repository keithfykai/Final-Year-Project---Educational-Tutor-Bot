### Dehydrohalogenation of Halogenoalkanes

* **Type of reaction:** Elimination
* **Reagents & conditions:** Heat with KOH in ethanol (or NaOH in ethanol)

**Making Thinking Visible**

**Question:** How are KX and H\({}_{2}\)O formed in the above reaction?

**Answer:** An acid-base reaction has happened as shown below:

HX (removed from halogenoalkane) + KOH \(\rightarrow\) KX + H\({}_{2}\)O

* The **major product** formed is the **more stable product** which is the **more substituted alkene.** E.g. There are **two ways to remove one HBr molecule** from the following halogenoalkane. **How to identify the more substituted alkene?** The more substituted alkene is the one with **more alkyl groups (-C\({}_{n}\)H\({}_{2n+1}\)) bonded to the C atoms in the C=C bond (inside the dotted boxes)** as shown in the example above. The enthalpy change of hydrogenation of the more substituted alkene to form the corresponding alkane has been found to be less exothermic than its isomeric alkene which is less substituted. This shows that more substituted alkenes are more stable. For instance, the enthalpy change of hydrogenation of but-2-ene (disubstituted alkene) is less exothermic compared to that of but-1-ene (monosubstituted alkene)

CH\({}_{3}\)CH\({}_{2}\)CH=CH\({}_{2}\) + H\({}_{2}\)\(\rightarrow\) CH\({}_{3}\)CH\({}_{2}\)CH\({}_{2}\)CH\({}_{3}\)\(\Delta\)H = -125.7 kJ mol\({}^{-1}\) (monosubstituted)

CH\({}_{3}\)CH=CHCH\({}_{3}\) + H\({}_{2}\)\(\rightarrow\) CH\({}_{3}\)CH\({}_{2}\)CH\({}_{3}\)\(\Delta\)H = -118.6 kJ mol\({}^{-1}\) (disubstituted)Reactions of Alkenes

### Electrophilic Addition

Candidates should be able to:

(a) explain the general reactivity of alkenes towards electrophilic reagents/electrophiles

* The **C=C bond** in alkenes consists of **a strong sigma bond (\(\sigma\))** and **a weak pi (\(\pi\)) bond**.

E.g. In CH\({}_{2}\)=CH\({}_{2}\),

sp\({}^{2}\) orbital from each C atom overlaps to form a \(\sigma\) bond in C=C bond

_Guiding questions:_

* _Which classes of reagents do alkenes react with? What types of reactions do alkenes undergo?_
* _How do alkenes react with electrophiles?_

Since the \(\pi\) **electrons** are much more exposed than those in the \(\sigma\) bond, this makes the \(\pi\) bond a good **source of electrons** and the C=C bond is also a **region of high electron density**. Hence alkenes are **more vulnerable to be attacked by electrophiles**.

**Note:** Electrophiles are **positively charged ions**, e.g. H\({}^{+}\) and NO\({}_{2}\)\({}^{+}\), or **polar molecules** which **carry a partial positive charge**, e.g. H\({}^{\beta+}\)C\({}^{\beta-}\).

* This **availability of \(\pi\) electrons in the C=C bond makes alkenes generally more reactive than alkanes.

Hence, the typical reaction of alkenes is **electrophilic addition** where **one weak \(\pi\) bond is broken** and **two strong \(\sigma\) bonds are formed**.

where Y\({}^{\beta+}\)-Z\({}^{\beta-}\) is an **electrophile** as it contains a **partial positive charged atom**, Y\({}^{\beta+}\) which has a tendency to attract electrons.

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:7]

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:8]

**Tertiary (3\({}^{\circ}\)) carbocation** is the **most stable** as it has **three electron donating alkyl (R) groups**, which exert **electron donating inductive effect** to help **disperse the positive charge on carbocation** more than that of the secondary (2\({}^{\circ}\)) and primary (1\({}^{\circ}\)) carbocations.

### Addition of water

Candidates should be able to:

(b) describe the chemistry of alkenes as exemplified, where relevant, by the following reactions of ethene:

(i) electrophilic addition of water/steam

**Type of reaction:** Electrophilic addition

**Reagent and condition:**

cold concentrated H\({}_{2}\)SO\({}_{4}\), followed by heat with water

**OR** steam, high temperature, high pressure, H\({}_{3}\)PO\({}_{4}\) catalyst

**Note:**

This is the reverse of the method used to prepare alkene from alcohol and concentrated H\({}_{2}\)SO\({}_{4}\).

### Reduction

Candidates should be able to:

(b) describe the chemistry of alkenes as exemplified, where relevant, by the following reactions of ethene:

(iii) reduction via catalytic hydrogenation (catalytic addition of hydrogen)

**Type of reaction:** Reduction

**Reagent & conditions:** H\({}_{2}\)(g) with Pt or Pd catalyst

**OR**

**Reagent & conditions:** Heat with H\({}_{2}\)(g) and Ni catalyst

### Oxidation

#### 4.3.1 Combustion

* In **excess oxygen**, alkenes burn to give **carbon dioxide and water**. E.g. \(\mathrm{C_{2}H_{4}(g)+3O_{2}(g)\to 2CO_{2}(g)+2H_{2}O(l)}\)
* In **limited oxygen**, alkenes may burn to give **carbon monoxide and water**. E.g. \(\mathrm{C_{2}H_{4}(g)+2O_{2}(g)\to 2CO(g)+2H_{2}O(l)}\)
* Combustion occurs with a **more smoky flame** than alkanes due to the greater C:H ratio in alkenes. [E.g. 1/3 in \(\mathrm{C_{2}H_{6}}\) vs 1/2 in \(\mathrm{C_{2}H_{4}}\)]

### Formation of diol (mild oxidation)

Candidates should be able to:

(b) describe the chemistry of alkenes as exemplified, where relevant, by the following reactions of ethene:

(iii) oxidation by cold, alkaline solution of manganate(VII) ions to form the diol

**Type of reaction:** Oxidation

**Reagents and conditions:** cold KMnO\({}_{4}\) in NaOH(aq)

**Observation:** Purple KMnO\({}_{4}\) decolourised with formation of brown precipitate, MnO\({}_{2}\)

When there is **no heating**, **mild oxidation of the C=C bond** will take place where **only the \(\pi\) bond is broken** and a diol is formed.

### Formation of carboxylic acids, ketones and/or CO\({}_{2}\) (strong oxidation)

Candidates should be able to:

(b) describe the chemistry of alkenes as exemplified, where relevant, by the following reactions of ethene:

(iv) oxidation by hot, acidified solution of manganate(VII) ions leading to the rupture of the carbon-to-carbon double bond in order to determine the position of alkene linkages in larger molecules

**Type of reaction:** Oxidative cleavage

**Reagents and conditions:** KMnO\({}_{4}\) in H\({}_{2}\)SO\({}_{4}\)(aq), heat

**Observation:** Purple KMnO\({}_{4}\) decolourised

When heated, there will be **strong oxidation of the C=C bond** and oxidative cleavage of C=C bond** occurs. The \(\pi\) bond in the C=C bond is first cleaved, followed by the cleavage of the C-C \(\sigma\) bond.
