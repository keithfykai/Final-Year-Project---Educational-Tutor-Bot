Resistance and Resistivity

Source of Electromotive Force (emf)

## Appendix B Electric Current

* the net flow of charge through a material
* The rate at which charge flows through a surface
* Symbol: I
* Sl unit: Ampere (A)
* Scalar

* The conventional direction of current = the direction of **flow of positive charges.** For negatively charges, the current direction is opposite to the conventional current.
* In a circuit, the conventional current flows from positive (+) to negative (-) terminal.
* conversely, the electron flows from (-) to (+) terminal.

\[V=\frac{M}{\rho}\to n=\frac{N_{A}\rho}{M}\]

Calculating for the drift velocity,

\[v_{d}=\frac{I}{nqA}=\frac{IM_{AI}}{qAN_{a}\rho_{AI}}=\frac{(10A)(26.98\ g/mol)}{(1.6\times 10^{-19}C)(3.5\times 10^{-6}m^{2})(6.02\times 10^{23}\ mol^{-1})(2.70g/cm^{3})}\]

Converting \(g\to kg\) and \(cm^{3}\to m^{3}\)

\[v_{d}=\frac{(10A)(0.0027\ kg/mol)}{(1.6\times 10^{-19}C)(3.5\times 10^{-6}m^{2})( 6.02\times 10^{23}\ mol^{-1})(2,700kg/m^{3})}\]

\[v_{d}=2.97\times 10^{-5}m/s\]

Important: always convert values in their corresponding SI units.

* Symbol: \(V\)
* SI unit: Coulomb (C) Scalar
* Conventional current flows from a point of higher (+ terminal) to lower (-terminal) potential.
* is a characteristic of the electric field only.
* does not depend on test charge just like electric field.
* is not measurable (not physically meaningful as it varies depending on the chosen reference point).
* Difference in potential is the quantity that is physically meaningful

* [label=*]
* Maximum possible voltage the battery (or any voltage source) can provide between its terminals
* Independent of \(I\) or \(R\)
* Disconceptions:
* is not a force
* a battery does not provide constant current in a circuit. The battery is a source of constant emf \(e\).

## Appendix B Electric Power

* The charge which flows past a point time \(t\) is the product of current and time
* Symbol: \(P\)
* Sl unit: Watt (W) = Joule/second (J/s)
* Scalar

\(P=\frac{dW}{dt}=IV=I^{2}R=\frac{V^{2}}{R}\)

* In general

\(P=\frac{E}{t}\)

* If power is delivered at constant rate

\(W\) (or \(E\)) = the amount of energy converted from electric potential energy to other forms of energy.

\(V=\) p.d across the device (or e.m.f.)

\(I=\) current passing through the device

\(R=\) resistance of the device/circuit

## 6 Resistability

* Is a measure of how strongly a material opposes electric current.
* It characterizes the resistance of materials at a fixed temperature regardless of the materials' dimension (shape and size).
* Its values is constant for a specific material, unlike resistance.

## Practice Example 6

The diameter of a Nichrome wire that is used as a heating element in an electronic device is equal to \(5.00\ mm\). In order to draw \(8.50\)-A current when the potential difference across its ends is \(120\ V\), what should be the

(Resistivity of Nichrome: \(\rho=1.00\times 10^{-6}\Omega\cdot m\))

\[A=\rho\frac{L}{R}\]

\[\pi r^{2}=\frac{\rho L}{R}\to r=\sqrt{\frac{\rho L}{\pi R}}\]

Note that \(R_{Al}=2R_{Cu}\) and \(L_{Al}=L_{Cu}=L\)

\[\frac{r_{Al}}{r_{Cu}}=\frac{\sqrt{\frac{\rho_{Al}L}{\pi 2R_{Cu}}}}{\sqrt{\frac{ \rho_{Cu}L}{\pi R_{Cu}}}}=\sqrt{\frac{\rho_{Al}}{2\rho_{Cu}}}\]

\[L=\frac{AR}{\rho}=\frac{(1.96\times 10^{-5}m^{2})(14.12\Omega)}{1.00\times 10^{-6 }\Omega\cdot m}=277.25m\]

\[L=\frac{AR}{\rho}=\frac{(1.96\times 10^{-5}m^{2})(14.12\Omega)}{1.00\times 10^{-6 }\Omega\cdot m}=277.25m\]

\[L=\frac{AR}{\rho}=\frac{(1.96\times 10^{-5}m^{2})(14.12\Omega)}{1.00\times 10^{-6 }\Omega\cdot m}=277.25m\]

\[L=\frac{AR}{\rho}=\frac{AR}{\rho}=\frac{AR}{\rho}=\frac{AR}{\rho}=\frac{AR}{ \rho}=\frac{AR}{\rho}=\frac{AR}{\rho}=\frac{AR}{\rho}=\frac{AR}{\rho}=\frac{AR} {\rho}=\frac{AR}{\rho}=\frac{AR}{Maximum Power Theorem

The power defined to the external load \(R\) is given by

\(P_{R}=r^{R}\)

The circuit is the same as the circuit in the discussion box for internal resistance so we can use the emf formula to obtain equation for current \(l=\frac{\epsilon}{R+r}\)

This gives us

\[P_{R}=\left(\frac{\epsilon}{R+r}\right)^{2}R=x^{2}\frac{R}{(R+r)^{2}}\]

At the maximum \(R\), the slope of the tangent line (which is a horizontal line) of the \(P_{R}\) vs \(R\) graph is zero. This means that to determine the value of \(R\) such that \(P_{R}\) is maximum, we have to solve for the gradient \(\frac{dP_{R}}{dR}=0\).

\[\frac{dP_{R}=0}{dR}\] \[\frac{d}{dR}[z^{2}\frac{R}{(R+r)^{2}}]=0\] \[z^{2}\frac{d}{dR}[R(R+r)^{-2}]=0\] Using product rule and cancelling \(z^{2}\)

\(-2RR+r)^{-3}+(R+r)^{-2}=0\)

\(2R(R+r)^{-3}=(R+r)^{-2}\)

Getting the inverse and cancelling common term

\(R+r=1\)

\(2R=R+r\)
## Practice Example 9

A battery has an internal resistance of \(0.01\Omega\) and emf of \(12.3V\). Given that a load resistance of \(5.0\Omega\) is connected to its terminals,

Note that the voltmeter reads the terminal voltage \(V_{T}\) of the batter.

For the first reading:

We have two equation with two unknowns. Subtracting the \(2^{nd}\) equation from the \(1^{st}\) equation of emf:
