**Introduction to the Imaginary Number i**

We know that the solution to the equation \(x^{2}+1=0\) cannot be a real number, as the square of a real number cannot be negative. We say \(x^{2}=-1\) has no real roots.

In order to solve the above equation, we need to find a "number" whose square is -1.

Let's suppose such a "number" exists.

Since we imagined it, let's call this number the **imaginary number i**.

We define i as

Hence the solutions to \(x^{2}+1=0\) are \(x=\pm\sqrt{-1}=\pm i\).

**Example 1**

**(a)** If i = \(\sqrt{-1}\), simplify i\({}^{2}\), i\({}^{3}\), i\({}^{4}\), i\({}^{2000}\), i\({}^{2010}\), i\({}^{2011}\), i\({}^{2012}\).

### Operations on Complex Numbers

In this section, let \(a,\ b,\ c,\ d\in\mathbb{R}\) and \(z_{i},\ z_{z},\ z_{y}\in\mathbb{C}\).

**(a)**: **Equality of Two Complex Numbers**

2 complex numbers are equal if and only if their corresponding real and imaginary parts are equal, i.e. \(a+\mathrm{i}b=c+\mathrm{i}d\)\(\ \ \ \ \Leftrightarrow\ \ \ a=c\) and \(b=d\).

For example, if \(x+\mathrm{i}y=5-3\mathrm{i}\), we have \(x\cdot\mathrm{i}\cdot\mathrm{i}\cdot\mathrm{i}\cdot\mathrm{i}\cdot\mathrm{i}\).
**(b)**: **Addition of Complex Numbers**

\((a+\mathrm{i}b)+(c+\mathrm{i}d)=(a+c)+\mathrm{i}(b+d)\)

Addition of complex numbers is commutative: \(z_{1}+z_{2}=z_{2}+z_{1}\)

Addition of complex numbers is associative: \((z_{1}+z_{2})+z_{3}=z_{1}+(z_{2}+z_{3})\)

For example, \((3+4\mathrm{i})+(1-\mathrm{i})=\)
**(c)**: **Subtraction of Complex Numbers**

\((a+\mathrm{i}b)-(c+\mathrm{i}d)=(a-c)+\mathrm{i}(b-d)\)

For example, \((3+4\mathrm{i})-(1-\mathrm{i})=\)
**(d)**: **Multiplication of Complex Numbers**

\((a+\mathrm{i}b)(c+\mathrm{i}d)=ac+\mathrm{i}ad+\mathrm{i}bc+\mathrm{i}^{2}bd= ac+\mathrm{i}ad+\mathrm{i}bc+(-1)bd\)

Multiplication of complex numbers is commutative: \(z_{1}z_{2}=z_{2}z_{1}\)

Multiplication of complex numbers is associative: \((z_{1}z_{2})z_{3}=z_{1}(z_{2}z_{3})\)

Multiplication of complex numbers is distributive over addition: \(z_{1}(z_{2}+z_{3})=z_{1}z_{2}+z_{1}z_{3}\)

For example, \((3+4\mathrm{i})(1-\mathrm{i})=\)

\((3+4\mathrm{i})^{2}=(3+4\mathrm{i})(3+4\mathrm{i})=\)

**Remarks:**: The above manipulations of complex numbers are the same as algebraic manipulations of expressions such as \(\big{(}a+b\big{)}\big{(}c+d\big{)},\big{(}a+b\big{)}\pm\big{(}c+d\big{)}\) and so on.

The only additional consideration is \(\mathrm{i}^{2}=-1\).

We can use the GC to perform operations on complex numbers

\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|} \hline
**Operation** & **Example** & **GC Screen** \\ \hline Multiplication of complex numbers & \((3+4i)(1-i)\) & \((3+4i)(1-i)\) \\ (Press [20d] to get i ) & & \\ \hline Square of a complex number & \((3+4i)^{2}\) & \((3+4i)^{2}\) \\ (Only works in Classic, not in MathPrint) & & \\ \hline \end{tabular}

How did the GC obtain \(\dfrac{3+4i}{1-i}=-0.5+3.5i\)?

**(e)** & **Division of Complex Numbers** \\ Recall when we tried to simplify \(\dfrac{2-\sqrt{3}}{1+\sqrt{2}}\), we multiply it by \(\dfrac{1-\sqrt{2}}{1-\sqrt{2}}\) so that we could **Tationalize the denominator.** \\ For \(\dfrac{3+4i}{1-i}\), we will multiply it by \(\dfrac{1+i}{1+i}\), so that \\ \(\dfrac{3+4i}{1-i}=\frac{(\frac{i+1}{1-i})(\frac{i+1}{1-i})}{\frac{i+1}{1-i}}: \frac{i+1}{1-i}:\frac{i+1}{1-i}:\frac{i+1}{1-i}\), \(\frac{i+1}{1-i}\) \\ In general, \(\dfrac{a+ib}{c+id}=\dfrac{a+ib}{c+id}\times\dfrac{c-id}{c-id}=\dfrac{\left(a +ib\right)\left(c-id\right)}{c^{2}-i^{3}d^{2}}=\dfrac{\left(a+ib\right)\left(c -id\right)}{c^{2}+d^{2}}\) \\ \(\mathbf{Remark:}\) & Note that \(c-id\) is chosen based on the denominator of \(\dfrac{a+ib}{c+id}\). \\ We call \(c-id\), the conjugate of \(c+id\).

\[\begin{split}\hline\varepsilon^{2}-5z^{2}+8z-6&=[z-(1+i)] \ [z-(1-i)](z-k)\\ &=(z^{2}-2z+2)(z-k)\\ &=z^{3}-(k+2)z^{2}+(2k+2)z-2k\end{split}\]

Comparing the constant, \(-6=-2k\Rightarrow k=3\)

The other 2 roots are 1+ i and 3.

## 4 Geometrical Representation of a Complex Number

Recall that we represent real number on a number line.

For complex numbers, since there are imaginary numbers, it makes sense for us to have a imaginary number line as well.

### Argand Diagram

A complex number \(z=x+iy\), \(x\), \(y\in\mathbb{R}\) can be represented by the point \(P(x,y)\). This idea was formally introduced by the French mathematician Jean-Robert Argand, and hence the diagram which represents a complex number in this way was named after him.

An **Argand diagram** is similar to the Cartesian plane with the

* Horizontal axis (labeled as Re) representing the real part of \(z\), and
* Vertical axis (labeled as Im) representing the imaginary part of \(z\).

**Remarks:**

Points on the horizontal axis represent real numbers and points on the vertical axis represent purely imaginary numbers.

On an Argand diagram, complex numbers behave (in terms of additions and subtractions) like 2-D vectors, but they are NOT vectors. In particular, we can divide complex numbers, but we cannot do the same to vectors.

PROOF OF RESULT THAT NON-REAL ROOTS OF A POLYNOMIAL EQUATION WITH REAL COEFFICIENTS OCCUR IN CONJUGATE PAIRS

Consider the equation

\[a_{n}z^{n}+a_{n-1}z^{n-1}+a_{n-2}z^{n-2}+...+a_{1}z^{2}+a_{0}=0\,,\]

where \(a_{n}\), \(a_{n-1}\), \(a_{n-2}\),..., \(a_{1}\), \(a_{0}\in\mathbb{R}\), \(a_{n}\neq 0\), \(n\in\mathbb{Z}^{*}\).

Suppose \(\beta\) is a non-real root of the equation,

i.e.

\[a_{n}\beta^{n}+a_{n-1}\beta^{n-1}+a_{n-2}\beta^{n-2}+...+a_{1}\beta+a_{0}=0\,.\]

Taking conjugates on both sides of the equation,

\[(a_{n}\beta^{n}+a_{n-1}\beta^{n-1}+a_{n-2}\beta^{n-2}+...+a_{1}\beta+a_{0})^{*}= 0\,*\]

\[(a_{n}\beta^{n})^{*}+(a_{n-1}\beta^{n-1})^{*}+(a_{n-2}\beta^{n-2})^{*}+...+(a_ {1}\beta)^{*}+a_{0}^{*}=0\,*\]

Now \((\beta^{k})^{*}=(\beta^{*})^{k}\
