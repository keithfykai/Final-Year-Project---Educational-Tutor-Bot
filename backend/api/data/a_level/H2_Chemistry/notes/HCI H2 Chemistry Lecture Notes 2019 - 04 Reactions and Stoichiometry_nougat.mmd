## 1 Formulae of Compounds

### Relative Masses of Compounds

In:Topic 1 Atomic Structure, we learnt the definition of the relative mass of an atom and an isotope.

The definitions may be extended to relative masses of molecules and ionic compounds as follows:

\[\begin{array}{c}\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{Relative molecular mass, $M_{r}=\frac{\text{average mass of one molecule of a substance}}{\frac{1}{12}\text{x the mass of one atom of ${}^{12}\text{C}$}}}\\ \end{array}\]

\[\begin{array}{c}\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{Relative formula mass $=\frac{\text{average mass of one formula unit of a substance}}{12}\text{x the mass of one atom of ${}^{12}\text{C}$}}\\ \end{array}\]

## 2 REACTIONS AND STOCHOIDETRY

Stoichiometry refers to the study of the quantitative aspects of chemical formulae and reactions. It involves both the determination of chemical formulae as well as calculations using balanced chemical equations based on the central idea of the mole.

### Law of Conservation of Matter

A chemical equation represents what happens during a chemical reaction. The law of conservation of matter is the fundamental principle governing the balancing of chemical equations.

When balancing chemical equations, we have to ensure that every atom of every element is accounted for since they are not destroyed or created, but rearranged. There must be the same number of atoms of each element on the right-hand side as there are on the left-hand side.

**Self-Practice 2:1**

Write balanced chemical equations for the following reactions.

[style=MyFrame]

**1.** lead + silver nitrate \(\rightarrow\) lead nitrate + silver

**2.** iron(II) chloride + chlorine \(\rightarrow\) iron(III) chloride

Similarly, when substances chemically react to form products, the sum of the masses of all the products is always found to be equal to the sum of the masses of the reactants.

[style=MyFrame]

**1.** A mixture of CuSO\({}_{\bullet}\)5H\({}_{2}\)O and MgSO\({}_{\bullet}\)7H\({}_{2}\)O is heated until a mixture of the anhydrous salt is obtained. If 5.00 g of the mixture gives 3.00 g of the anhydrous salts, what is the percentage by mass of CuSO\({}_{\bullet}\)5H\({}_{2}\)O in the mixture?

[style=MyFrame]

**1.** A mixture of CuSO\({}_{\bullet}\)5H\({}_{2}\)O and MgSO\({}_{\bullet}\)7H\({}_{2}\)O is heated until a mixture of the anhydrous salt is obtained. If 5.

The following set-up is first done with lead(II) nitrate solution in the test tube and potassium iodide solution in the conical flask. The entire apparatus is then weighed.

When the conical flask is shaken to mix the contents, a precipitation reaction occurs (Refer to Section 2.2) forming yellow solid lead(II) iodide. On re-weighing the conical flask with its content, the mass should be the same as its initial mass.

### Limiting reactants and Percentage Yield

A balanced equation shows the **mole ratios** in which reactants react to give products, and the mole ratios in which the products are formed. It indicates that fixed proportions of reactants will react to give fixed proportions of products. It does _not_, however, represent the actual amount or proportion in which the reactants are present in a mixture. Hence, you should first determine whether there is a reactant in excess.

For example,

The mole ratio (1 : 3 : 1), as shown by the **stoichiometric coefficients** in the balanced equation, tells us that 1 mole of H2 must react with 3 mole of O2 to give 1 mole of H2O.

If 1 mole of H2 is mixed with 1 mole of O2 then 3 mole of O2 must remain unreacted at the end of complete reaction. Reactants present in excess are not all consumed at the end of complete reaction. H2, on the other hand, is the limiting reactant. **Limiting reactants** are completely consumed in the reaction and limits how much products can form.

Many reactions do not, however, go to completion and there may also be a loss of product in practice (e.g. after purification or separation). Hence, the **actual yield** is usually less than 100% of the **theoretical yield** that is calculated based on the limiting reactant.

### Types of Reactions

In Chemistry, there are several different types of chemical reactions and more than one way of classifying them. From this section onwards, we will classify the reactions into the following reaction types:

**(a)**: Precipitation reaction
**(b)**: Precipitation reactions are reactions which involve the formation of an insoluble solid which is known as a precipitate, from the reaction of two solutions. The precipitate and the supernatant liquid can be separated by filtration or decanting. In calculations involving precipitation reaction, the mass of the solid will be obtained to find out the number of moles of the solid product formed.

Most of the reactions you learn at A-level fall into one or more categories. Remember that no classification is perfect and so it would be highly possible to find some reactions that do not fit nicely into any category.

In this section, we will classify the calculations according to:

(i) reacting masses (from formulae and equations)

(ii) volumes of gases (e.g. in the burning of hydrocarbons)

(iii) volumes and concentrations of solutions

However, it would be a good practice to try to identify the type of reactions taking place in each of the lecture exercises or self-practices given.

#### 2.3.1 Calculation using Reacting Masses and Moles

**Lecture Exercise 2.2**

1. Solid aluminium sulfide reacts with water to give aluminium hydroxide and hydrogen sulfide gas. Write a balanced equation for this reaction. What is the maximum mass of H\({}_{2}\)S that can form when 158 g of aluminium sulfide reacts with 131 g of water? Calculate the number of moles of the excess reagent remaining at the end of reaction.

1.

#### 2.3.2 Calculation using Volumes of Gases

In Topic 3 The Gaseous State, we learnt about the Avogadro's Law.

_Avogadro's Law: Equal volumes of all gases, under the same temperature and pressure, contain the same number of particles (atoms or molecules)._

Hence, for gases in a balanced equation, _volume ratio = mole ratio_

For example, for a given equation:

The balanced equation tells us that **20 cm\({}^{3}\)** of carbon monoxide will react with **10 cm\({}^{3}\)** of oxygen to give **20 cm\({}^{3}\)** of carbon dioxide.

Note that the ratio of volumes 20 cm\({}^{3}\) : 10 cm\({}^{3}\) : 20 cm\({}^{3}\) is, the same as the mole ratio 2:1:2 indicated by the stoichiometric coefficients in the balanced equation.

#### Calculations using Concentrations

When a solute is dissolved in a solvent, a solution is formed.

If the solvent is water, an aqueous solution is formed.

The concentration of a solution shows the amount of solute dissolved in a given volume of solution.

Notation for concentration of solute X in a solution in terms of mol dm\({}^{-3}\): [X]

A standard solution is a solution whose concentration is accurately known.

### Dilution

When a solution is diluted (by adding more solvent), the concentration of the solution decreases but the _number of moles of the solute in the diluted solution remains unchanged_.

### Lecture Exercise 2.4

14.3 g of hydrated sodium carbonate, Na\({}_{2}\)CO\({}_{3}\)*10H\({}_{2}\)O (\(M_{r}\) = 286.0) were dissolved in water and the solution made up to 500 cm\({}^{3}\) using a volumetric flask. What is the concentration of sodium ions in the solution?

## 3 ACID-BASE REACTIONS

Acids and bases are important in many chemical processes that occur around us, from industrial processes to biological ones and from reactions in the laboratory to those in our environment.

The concept of acids and bases has broadened over time as chemists seek to propose a more comprehensive model to classify, rationalise and predict acid-base chemistry. The current understanding of acids and bases is primarily based on the historical contributions of chemists such as Svante Arrhenius, Johannes Bronsted, Thomas Lowry, and Gilbert Newton Lewis.

### Definitions of Acids & Bases

#### 3.1.1 Arrhenius Theory of Acids & Bases

* An acid is a substance that dissociates in water to produce H\({}_{3}\)O\({}^{+}\)(aq). E.g. HC(\(\beta\)) + H\({}_{2}\)O(\(l\)) + H\({}_{3}\)O\({}^{+}\)(aq) + Cr(aq) **Note**: In aqueous solution, H\({}^{+}\) (a "bare" proton) does not exist on its own. Instead, it forms a dative bond with a water molecule to form H\({}_{3}\)O\({}^{+}\), called **hydronium** or **hydronium** ion. Chemists often use H\({}^{+}\)(aq) and H\({}_{3}\)O\({}^{+}\)(aq) interchangeably to refer to the solvated H\({}^{+}\) ion.
* A base is a substance that dissociates in water to produce OH\({}^{+}\)(aq). E.g. NaOH(aq) Na\({}^{+}\)(aq) + OH\({}^{+}\)(aq) When an acid is added to a base, according to Arrhenius, the H\({}^{+}\) ion reacts with the OH\({}^{+}\) ion to produce a molecule of water, and undergoes _neutralisation_. E.g. HC(\(\alpha\)) + NaOH(aq) \(\rightarrow\) NaCl/(aq) + H\({}_{2}\)O(\(l\)) _Ionic equation_: H\({}^{+}\)(aq) + OH\({}^{-}\)(aq) \(\rightarrow\) H\({}_{2}\)O(\(l\)) The Na\({}^{+}\)(aq) and Cl\({}^{+}\)(aq) ions do not take part in the reaction. They are called _'spectator ions'_.

The limitation of this model is that it is restricted to aqueous solutions only. This limitation could be addressed through the introduction of the Bronsted-Lowry acid-base model.

#### 3.1.2 Bronsted-Lowry Theory of Acids & Bases

* **An acid** is defined as any species which **donates a proton**, H\({}^{+}\). An acid must thus contain H in its formula. E.g. HNO\({}_{3}\) and H\({}_{2}\)PO\({}_{4}\).
* **A base** is defined as any species which accepts a proton, H\({}^{+}\). A base must contain a lone pair of electrons to bind the H\({}^{+}\) ion. E.g. NH\({}_{3}\) CO\({}_{3}^{+}\)-F and OH\({}^{+}\):

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:19]

The three models of acids and bases can be used to interpret different acid-base systems; Bronsted-Lowry and Lewis theories are often used to describe specific acid-base reactions whereas Arrhenius theory is used to describe whether isolated substances are acids, bases or neither.

For example, in the case of nitric acid:

Using Arrhenius model, nitric acid is an Arrhenius acid as it generates hydronium ions in the presence of water;

Using Bronsted-Lowry model, nitric acid can be either Bronsted-Lowry acid or base, as seen in Lecture Exercise 3.1. It depends on what nitric acid reacts with. For instance, it it reacts with an alkali such as aqueous sodium hydroxide, it acts as a Bronsted-Lowry acid. If nitric acid reacts with a stronger acid such as sulfuric acid, it behaves like a Bronsted-Lowry base. (The concept of'strength of acid' will be dealt with in Topic 15 Acid-Base Equilibria)

### Titrations

Titration (or volumetric analysis) is a technique where a solution is gradually added from a buret to a fixed volume of another solution, i.e: the aliquot (measured with a pipette and placed in a conical flask), until the reactants in the two solutions have reacted completely. Titration is suitable for reactions in which the reactants react rapidly and completely.

It is used to obtain quantitative information such as the concentration of a solution or to establish the stoichiometry of a reaction. Usually one of the solutions used must be of an accurately known concentration; and this is called the **standard solution**.

The **equivalence point** occurs when the reactants in the two solutions react according to the stoichiometry of the reaction. The volume of solution added from the buret is the **itre** volume.

For an acid-base titration, the completion of the reaction is often found by noting the colour change of an indicator added to the reaction flask. The point where the indicator changes colour is known as the **end point**.

Indicators for acid-base titration have distinct colours in the 'acid' and 'base' region as shown in Table 2. At certain pH, called the working range, the indicator will change its colour.

### Balancing Redox Equations

In a redox reaction, there is a transfer of electrons from the reducing agent (which loses electrons and is oxidised) to the oxidising agent (which gains electrons and is reduced).

Hence, in a balanced redox equation, the number of electrons lost by the reducing agent must be equal to the number of electrons gained by the oxidising agent, i.e. there are no free electrons in the overall balanced equation. Once again, the Law of Conservation of Mass applies here.

Here are two methods that can be used to balance redox equations:

**Method 1**:

**1.**: Divide the unbalanced ionic equation into two half-equations (an oxidation half-equation and a reduction half-equation).
**2.**: For each half-equation,

Balance all atoms other than O and H.
**3.**: Balance O by adding H\({}_{2}\)O.
**4.**: Balance H by adding H\({}^{+}\). For a redox reaction under basic conditions, additional steps to take include:

**3.**: add to both sides of the half-equation the same number of OH\({}^{+}\) to neutralise the H\({}^{+}\) present,

**4.**: combine H\({}^{+}\) and OH\({}^{+}\) to form H\({}_{2}\)O,

**4.**: simplify the half-equation by cancelling any extra H\({}_{2}\)O.
**5.**: Balance the charges by adding electrons. (The oxidation half-equation will have electrons on the right-hand side while the reduction half-equation will have electrons on the left-hand side.)
**3.**: Multiply each half-equation by an appropriate integer, if necessary, to make electrons lost = electrons gained (because number of electrons lost by reducing agent = number of electrons gained by oxidising agent);
**4.**: Add the two half-equations (electrons on both sides must cancel out each other).
**5.**: Simplify by cancelling any extra species appearing on both sides.
**6.**: Make a final check that the redox equation is balanced in terms of atoms and charge.

**7.**:

### Redox Titrations

In a redox titration, a known concentration of oxidising_agent is used to find an unknown concentration of reducing agent (or _vice versa_). Redox titrations are also used to establish the stoichiometry of redox reactions. The calculations involved are based on the mole concept, similar to acid-base titrations.

#### 4.4.1 Potassium Manganate(VII) titration

The KMnO\({}_{4}\) solution is usually placed in the burette and added into the conical flask containing the reductant (e.g. Fe\({}^{2+}\) determination).

2. Typical reducing agents that can react with KMnO\({}_{4}\) are: Fe\({}^{2+}\), C\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{4}\)\({}^{2-}\), H\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{2}\) and I\({}^{-}\)
3. Manganate(VII) titrations are usually carried out in _acidic_ conditions. The acid used is sulfuric acid (usually at 1 mol dm\({}^{-3}\)) and added into the conical flask.

**Note:**_Nitric acid and hydrochloric acid are both not suitable as nitric acid is itself an oxidising agent while hydrochloric acid can be oxidised by manganate(VII) ion to give chlorine._

Relevant half-equation:

\(\textbf{MnO}_{4}\) + 8H\({}^{+}\) + 5e\({}^{-}\) \(\textbf{Mn}^{2+}\) + 4H\({}_{2}\)O
4. During the titration, the purple MnO\({}_{4}\) turns colourless as it is reduced to Mn\({}^{2+}\) ions (colourless / pale pink).

5. When all the reductant is used up, the first extra drop of KMnO\({}_{4}\) makes the solution in the conical flask turn permanently **pink**. This sharp colour change indicates that the end-point is reached, Hence no other indicator is required.

## 4.4.2. **Looking AHEAD**

The stoichiometry concepts learnt in this topic will be applicable in almost all future topics where you are required to write balanced equations for all reactions, and work out quantities of reagents to be used (e.g. in organic synthesis) etc. Our knowledge of redox reactions and acid-base reactions will also be expanded in the extension topics of electrochemistry and acid-base equilibria.
