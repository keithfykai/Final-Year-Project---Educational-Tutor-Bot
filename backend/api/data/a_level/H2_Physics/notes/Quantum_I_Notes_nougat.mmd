## 1 Historical Background

Hundreds of years back, scientists were speculating about whether light was made up of particles or waves. By 1800s, it was generally accepted that light was a wave. The definitive feature of waves is their ability to diffract, suppose and produce interference patterns. Particles on the other hand, cannot superpose. Instead, they collide and bounce off each other.

In 1887 Hertz discovered the _photoelectric effect_. It was found that electrons, called _photoelectrons_, were emitted from a clean metal surface when high frequency light such as ultraviolet light fell on it. The experimental data could not be explained by treating light as a wave but they could be explained by treating light as particles.

Particles of light or packets of electromagnetic radiation are called _photons_. Each packet of energy or radiation is called a quantum. Since then, many quantities other than energy have been found to be quantised under certain conditions. This quantisation of physical quantities and the probabilistic nature of their measurements are two of the features of Quantum Physics that we will study.

In Quantum Physics, many phenomena seem very bizarre. This is because quantum behaviour is mostly encountered in the microscopic realm, of which we would normally have very little experience of.

## 2 Photoelectric Effect

A positive p.d creates an E-field that accelerates the electrons towards the collector. It also steers some electrons that would otherwise have collided with the casing and be absorbed towards the collector. When all the electrons reach the collector, the current is called _saturation current_.

Figure 2:

Figure 3:

Figure 1:A _negative_ p.d. causes some emitted electrons to slow down and even turn back to the emitter. Some fast enough electrons may still be able to reach the collector. A _more_ negative p.d. will cause more electrons to get turned back and thus the current to decrease. Eventually, when p.d. is -\(V_{\mathrm{s}}\), the fastest electrons just fail to reach the collector and the current goes to zero. These fastest electrons lost all their KE just before reaching the collector and the lost KE becomes electric PE (from 'Electric Field', \(\Delta\)EPE or \(\Delta U_{E}=\Delta\Delta V\) where \(\Delta V\)is p.d.). Thus

\[\frac{1}{2}\,m_{\mathrm{e}}v_{\mathrm{max}}^{2}=eV_{\mathrm{S}}\]

where \(m_{\mathrm{e}}\) & \(e\) are electron mass and charge respectively, \(v_{\mathrm{max}}\) is speed of the fastest electrons and \(V_{\mathrm{s}}\) is the magnitude of the negative p.d. known as _stopping potential._

Both theories expect that \(I\) increases, the rate of arrival of energy on metal increases. Hence more electrons per unit time can gain energy to escape. Thus current should increase as in Fig. 2.6 and 2.7.

Figure 2.6:

Figure 2.4:

For a given metal, regardless of intensity used, data in Fig. 2.8 show that when frequency of light is below \(f_{min}\), no electrons are emitted hence \(V_{s}=0\).

Earlier, we saw that when electrons are emitted, they emerged with a range of KE and \(K\!E_{max}=eV_{s}\). In Fig. 2.8, we see that for \(f\) above \(f_{min}\) as \(f\) increases, the electrons emitted have greater \(K\!E_{max}\). This should mean that the average KE of emitted electrons is greater.

The dependence of \(K\!E_{max}(=eV_{s})\) on \(f\) can also be seen in Fig. 2.9. The independence of \(V_{s}\) on intensity is shown in Fig. 2.7.

In short, whether electrons are emitted and also \(K\!E_{max}\) are determined by frequency of light.

### 2.2 _Wave Theory_

In short, whether electrons are emitted and also \(K\!E_{max}\) are determined by frequency of light.

A model and explanation based on Einstein's postulates:

Electrons in a metal are like tennis balls in a depression in the ground (Fig. 2.10). For a tennis ball to get out of the depression and thus further from Earth, it needs to overcome gravity and gain gravitational PE. Similarly, an escaping electron must overcome the metal's attraction and gain electric PE.

Using imaginary numbers, the topmost electron needs the least energy (work function \(\phi\)) of 6 J to get out. After absorbing 10 J from a photon, 6 J is converted to electric PE, the rest becomes KE upon escape, hence:

[MISSING_PAGE_POST]

Einstein's Photoelectric Equation:

\[KE_{max}=hf\text{- }\phi\]

It is important to note that electrons are emitted with a range of KE and Einstein's equation only deals with the maximum KE.

\[KE_{max}=hf\text{- }\phi\]

\[eV_{s}=hf\text{- }\phi\]

\[V_{s}=(h\text{e})\text{f- }\phi\text{e}\]

As e, \(h\) and \(\phi\) are constant, a graph of \(V_{s}\) against \(f\) will look like Fig. 2.11 where the y-intercepts are given by \(\phi\)/e and the gradient is \(h\)/e.

3 Wave-particle Duality

### Electron Diffraction

Since electromagnetic waves can behave like particles, can the reverse be true? In 1924, Louis de Broglie (pronounced "de Broy") hypothesised that wavelength of particles is given by

\[\lambda=\frac{h}{p}\]

where \(\lambda\) is the _de Broglie wavelength_ associated with the particle \(p\) is the momentum _mv_ of the particle & \(h\) is the Planck constant

Two key properties of waves are diffraction and superposition. The proof that particles have wave properties should be found in diffraction or interference patterns. Indeed a few years after de Broglie's hypothesis, experiments done by Davisson, Germer and G.P. Thomson showed that electrons can produce diffraction patterns after passing through a thin film of material. Different patterns are formed for crystalline and polycrystalline materials.

Before such electron diffraction patterns were observed, the same patterns had already been observed using X-rays, thus confirming that those electrons were behaving like waves as they pass through the target material.

The action of the target materials was similar to that of diffraction gratings. If a calculation were made for the de Broglie's wavelength of the electrons in the beam, you would get a value of \(\sim\)10\({}^{-10}\) m which is the typical spacing between atoms in crystals. This closeness of the wavelength to the atomic spacing is important for diffraction to be observable.

### Wave-particle Duality

We see that _photoelectric effect_ led to the conclusion that electromagnetic waves can behave like particles while _electron diffraction_ showed that electrons can have wave properties. Since those experiments, more experiments have confirmed that all matter have both wave and particle properties. Furthermore, in any setting, you will only observe one of the two natures but never both _simultaneously_. It is rather like the two sides of a coin; you can only see one side at a time and whichever side you look at, it is the same coin. This dual nature of light is known as a 'wave particle duality'.

De Broglie's equation is not just for finding the _wavelength_ of a particle of _known momentum mv_. The same equation is also used to find the _momentum_ of a packet of wave or photon of _known wavelength_\(\lambda\). However, in the latter case, it is important to note that \(p\) of a photon _cannot_ be written as _mc_ because photons are massless. These massless photons when absorbed or reflected by a surface can exert a force on the surface just like balls hitting the surface.

\[\lambda=\frac{h}{p}\]

gives wavelength \(\lambda\) of a particle of momentum _mv_ \[p=\frac{h}{\lambda}\]

gives momentum \(p\) (\(\mu mc\)) of a photon of wavelength \(\lambda\)

### Emission Spectrum

All objects with temperatures above absolute zero emit EM waves but we typically do not see most of it. Fig. 4.3 actually shows that as the temperature of an object increases from 3 500 K to 5 500 K, the dominant wavelength in the radiation shifts from about 800 nm(red-yellow hot) to about 500 nm(blue-white hot). Also, generally _solids_ and _liquids_ emit EM radiations which span a continuous range or spectrum like in Fig. 4.3. Such spectra are called _continuous emission spectra_.

Hot gases emit radiations with a finite number of wavelengths, including invisible ones. The set-up in Fig. 4.4 can reveal the visible part of the discrete spectrum. If the slit were replaced by a hole, the screen would have 3 dots instead of 3 lines.

Other than directly heating the gas, it can also be made to emit light by trapping it in a glass discharge tube and then applying a high voltage to it.

### Energy Levels of Atoms

The existence of a unique spectrum for each gas could not be explained by classical physics (in contrast to modern physics which includes relativity and quantum theory). In 1913, Niels Bohr proposed a model for the hydrogen atom that not only accounted for the presence of spectral lines, but predicted their wavelengths to a great degree of accuracy.

#### Bohr's Theory

Bohr's Theory was based on the following 2 ideas:

1 Electrons in an atom can only move in certain allowed orbits or radii.

2 Energy is radiated or absorbed when an electron switch orbits.

An electron orbiting a positive nucleus will have KE and electric PE. The total energy would get greater when the electron is found in orbits further away from the nucleus in a similar way that satellites have greater total energy when orbiting further from Earth.

Consider the hydrogen atom in Fig. 5.1. As the electron can only revolve the nucleus in allowed orbits, it must make a so called quantum jump to get to another orbit. When it jumps to an orbit near the nucleus, it loses energy in the form of a photon. It can also absorb energy to jump from a lower energy orbit to a higher energy orbit.

In Bohr's theory, electrons in an atom have only certain allowed orbits that corresponded to discrete atomic energy levels. For a photon to be emitted or absorbed, its energy must be equal to \(\mid E_{t}\cdot E_{t}\mid\).

Figure 5.1: The lowest energy level is assigned the quantum number \(n=1\). When the atom is in this lowest energy state, the atom or the electron is said to be in a _ground state_. By the principle of conservation of energy, the energy of the emitted or absorbed photon \(E_{0}\left(=\hbar t=\hbar c/2\right)\) must be given byAn electron or atom will only remain in an excited state for a very short time (in the order of 10\({}^{-10}\) s). Then it will spontaneously fall back to the ground state either in a single jump or multiple jumps giving off one or more photons.

Generally, an atom can gain energy in 2 ways -

1 Absorb a photon of _almost exactly_ the right amount of energy to jump to a higher level. Hence if the photon has energy slightly less or more than the exact amount needed, it will not be absorbed. Also, the probability of the atom absorbing 2 photons to make the jump is negligible.
2 Through collision with another particle. In this case, the other colliding particle transfers a portion of its KE to the atom to allow it to jump to a higher energy state.

### From Energy Levels to Spectrum

Hydrogen atom is the simplest atom as it is made up of a single electron orbiting a single proton. As such, for a basic understanding, we always start with the hydrogen atom. We will see that the _unique finite set of discrete energy levels_ determine the _unique positioning_ and _spacing of spectral lines_.

The energy levels of an _isolated_ hydrogen atom are shown below. As the energies are rather small in joules, it is more common to use the unit eV. 1 eV is the KE that an electron gains when it is accelerated across a p.d. of 1 V. As \(U_{E}\) = _OV_, \(\Delta\)KE = \(\Delta U_{E}\) = \(\alpha\)V = (1.6 \(\times\) 10\({}^{-19}\) C)(1 V) = 1.6 \(\times\) 10\({}^{-19}\) J.

Ionisation energy or energy to remove an electron from an atom is 13.6 eV for hydrogen.

Figure 5.2: (Lyman) series

In Fig. 5.3, with all the arrows lined up, we can more easily compare the photon energies(\(E_{p}=\hbar\hbar\)) and hence their frequencies. On the screen where frequency increases to the right, each arrow's length gives an _approximate_ indication of its position on the screen.

### Quantisation of Atom's Energy

An electron orbiting a nucleus can be treated as a wave along the orbit. An allowed orbit must have a certain length that supports the formation of a standing wave by constructive interference. Disallowed orbits are those where the electron's wave will interfere destructively. For an orbit to support a standing wave, the orbital length must be an integer number \(n\) of wavelengths i.e. \(2\pi r=n\lambda\). This condition leads to quantisation of the atom's energy.
