## Chapter 4 Stem Cells

H2 Biology

## Introduction

For a multicellular organism to function properly, it must _diversity cell types_, _control their_ _production_, and _eliminate aged/damaged cells_.

**Differentiation** is a process by which _a less specialised cell develops tissue-specific adaptation_ _that enables it to become a more specialised cell type_.

Many differentiated cell types have limited life spans. Disease can also lead to their loss.

Since differentiated cells do not usually divide, their supply must be replenished and this is achieved through _stem cells_.

## Introduction

All stem-cells have **three unique features**:

1. Stem cells are a group of **undifferentiated and unspecified cells**.
2. Stem cells can undergo **extensive proliferation** and are **capable of self-renewal through mitosis**.
3. Stem cells can differentiate into various **specialised cell types** upon stimulation by the **appropriate molecular signals**.

## Types of Stem Cells

In mammals, stem cells are commonly categorised according to their ability to differentiate/differentiation potential, i.e. **topipotent**, **pluripotent or multipotent**.

**Pluripotent Stem Cells**:

Has the ability to differentiate into **all of the cell types** that make up an organism except extraembryonic tissue such as the **placenta**.

Pluripotent stem cells alone cannot form the entire organism as extraembryonic tissues such as the placenta is required for foetal nonishment and development.

Pluripotent cells are also said to be multipotent.

**E.g.,** Embryonic stem cells (ESCs) are derived from cells of inner cell mass of blastocyst (200-300 cells), which forms at about 4 to 5 days post fertilisationApplications of Stem Cells

Multipotent and self-renewing nature of adult stem cells has been harnessed to provide therapy and treatment to a range of diseases.

Stem cell therapy involving adult stem cells has general advantages:

Multipotent nature of adult stem cells ensures that the adult stem cells differentiates into the respective specialised cell

type, thus restoring function of damaged or diseased tissue.

Self-renewing nature of stem cells ensures that transplanted stem cells constantly replicate in the patient to maintain a constant pool of stem cells. Hence, repeated stem cell transplants are not necessary to sustain the therapeutic effects.

There are two general approaches to stem cell therapies:

Stem cell transplant

Genetically modified stem cell transplant Applications of Stem Cells

**Stem Cell Transplant:**

Adult stem cells can be obtained directly from the donor organ or tissue in which they are found and have provided many different therapies for illnesses such as Parkinson's disease, leukemia, multiple sclerosis, lupus, sickle-cell anaemia, and heart damage.

These treatments carry a risk that the **(**denoted cells will be rejected**. Also, unlike pluripotent embryonic stem cells which have the ability to differentiate into all cell types that make up an (except for extra-embryonic tissues), **adult stem cells are limited to differentiating into different cell types of their tissue of origin**.

**Example:**

Transplant of bone marrow haematopoietic stem cells from normal healthy bone marrow donors to leukaemia patients

**Biocethics**

Ethics is a field of study that looks at the moral basis of human

**behaviour** ("Why do we act as we do?") and attempts to determine the best course of action in the face of conflicting choices ("How do we decide what to do when people disagree about a complex issue?").

**Biocethics** is a subfield of ethics that explores ethical questions related to the life sciences. **Biocethical analysis helps people make decisions about their behaviour and about policy questions** that governments, organizations, and communities must face when they consider how best to use new biomedical knowledge and innovations.

**Examples**:

"How should we decide who receives organ transplants?" or, "Should a terminally ill patient be allowed to end his/her life with physician prescribed medication?"

### Ethical Implications of Stem Cell Therapy and Research

Argument against using embryonic stem cells

Some assert that the embryo has the status of a human being as it has the potential to become one. They believe that embryonic stem cell research violates the sanctity of life and is tantamount to murder.

Some object to extracting stem cells from an embryo to make replacement body cells is treating the embryos just a source of spare parts. Embryonic stem cell research takes a purely utilitarian view of the embryo.

Current benign applications may lead to abuse in the future. Once human status is denied to embryos, this precedent may extend to other categories of human beings such as the profoundly disabled or the elderly inform.

## Bioethics

* Embryonic stem cells can **potentially treat a wide range of diseases** as they have the potential to grow indefinitely in a laboratory environment and can differentiate into almost all types of bodily tissue. Treatments that have been proposed include treatment for physical trauma, degenerative conditions (e.g. Parkinson's disease), and genetic diseases (in combination with gene therapy).
* **Emproves are not equivalent to human life**: something that can potentially become a person should not be treated as if it actually were a person. An early embryo therefore does not have any interests to be protected, and we can use it for the benefits of patients, who are people. **The embryo cannot develop into a child without being transferred to a uterus**. Some believe life only begins when the heartbeat develops (during the fifth week of pregnancy) or when the brain begins developing (at 54 days after conception).

## Biotechnics

### Induced pluripotent stem cells (IPSCs)

An alternative to ES Cells?

Differentiated and specialised adult somatic cells (e.g. skin cells) can be reprogrammed to become pluripotent stem cells called induced pluripotent stem cells (IPSCs).

The IPSC technology was pioneered by Shinya Yamanaka's lab in 2006; the introduction of four specific genes encoding transcription factors could'reprogramme' some specialised cells to become pluripotent so that they lose their specialist functions and behave in virtually the same way as embryonic stem cells.

### Advantages:

No destruction of embryos.

If obtained from same patient, no chance of rejection by immune system.

Easily obtained without risk to donor.

### Disadvantages:

Low efficiency

May pose cancer risk
