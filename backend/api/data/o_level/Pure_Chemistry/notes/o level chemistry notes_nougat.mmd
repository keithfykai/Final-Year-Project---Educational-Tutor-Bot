**Atomic structure**

**Structure of atom**

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|} \hline Subatomic particle & Symbol & Relative charge & Relative mass \\ \hline Proton & p & +1 & 1 \\ \hline Neutron & n & 0 & 1 \\ \hline electron & e & \(-\)1 & \(\mathbf{1840}\) \\ \hline \end{tabular}

**Isotopes**

Definition of isotopes: Isotopes are atoms of the same element with the same number of protons, but different number of neutrons

**Calculation of relative atomic mass**

Q: If chlorine has 2 isotopes with relative masses of 35 and 37 and relative abundance of 75% and 25% respectively, calculate the relative atomic mass of chlorine.

A: Relative atomic mass = 37 x 0.25 + 35 x 0.75 = 35.5

**Calculation of relative abundance**

Q: If boron has 2 isotopes with relative masses of 10 and 11, given that boron has a relative atomic mass of 10.8, calculate the relative abundance of boron-10 and boron-11.

A: Let the relative abundance of boron-10 be x

10x + 11(1 - x) = 10.8

x = 0.2

Therefore relative abundance of boron-10 is 20% and relative abundance of boron-11 is 80%.

\begin{tabular}{c|c|c|c|} \hline NA & Diamond (same explanation as mp and bp) & (same explanation as for mp and bp) & Pure metals are malleable/ ductile because the orderly layers of same-sized atoms \\  & Diamond has a giant covalent structure & (substance) has a giant ionic structure. & can slide easily over each other without disrupting the structure. \\  & Each carbon atom is covalently bonded to 3 other carbon atoms & (sub-) has a giant structure. & Alloys are harder and stronger than pure metals because alloys have atoms of different sizes. This disrupts the orderly arrangement of atoms and prevent the layers of atoms from sliding over each other \\ \hline \end{tabular}

**Uses of diamond and graphite**

### Strength of ionic bonds

* The hiaher the charge of the ions, the greater the strength of ionic bonds.
* The smaller the size of the ions, the greater the strength of ionic bonds.

**Example:** Why is the melting point of magnesium fluoride higher than that of sodium fluoride?

* Mg\({}^{2+}\) has a higher charge than Na\({}^{+}\).
* Mg\({}^{2+}\) is smaller than Na+.
* Therefore Mg\({}^{2+}\) has a higher charge density than Na\({}^{+}\).
* More energy is needs to overcome stronger electrostatic forces of attraction between oppositely charged ions.

### Strength of metallic bonds

* The hiaher the number of delocalised electrons, the greater the strength of metallic bonds.
* The hiaher the charge of metallic cation, the greater the strength of metallic bonds.
* The smaller the size of metallic cation, the greater the strength of metallic bonds.

**Example:** Why is the melting point of magnesium higher than that of sodium?

* Mg has more valence electrons and therefore more delocalised electrons than sodium.
* Mg\({}^{2+}\) has a hiaher charge than Na\({}^{+}\).
* Mg\({}^{2+}\) is smaller than Na+.
* Therefore Mg\({}^{2+}\) has a higher charge density than Na\({}^{+}\).
* More energy is needs to overcome stronger electrostatic forces of attraction between metallic cations and sea of delocalised electrons.

### Hydrogen bonding

#### Criteria for hydrogen bonding

1) Hydrogen atom covalently bonded to O, N or F

2) An O, N or F atom with available lone pair(s)

#### Effects of hydrogen bonding

1) Hiaher boiling point compared to most other simple molecules of similar molecular mass.

2) Density of ice is less than density of water.

**Example:** Why is the boiling point of water higher than methane, CH\({}_{4}\)?

* Water contains hydrogen bonding between water molecules.
* Methane has Van der Waals' forces between methane molecules.
* Hydrogen bonding is stronger than Van der Waals' forces, so more energy is required to overcome the hydrogen bonding in water.

**Example:** Why is ice less dense than water?

* To maximise hydrogen bonding in solid ice, the water molecules are arranged in a more orderly fashion/has an open structure.
* The water molecules in ice are further apart than the randomly arranged molecules in liquid water.

**Strength of Van der Waals' forces**

* The higher the Mr, the greater the strength of Van der Waals' forces

**Example:** Why is the boiling point of chlorine higher than that of fluorine?

* Chlorine has a larger relative molecular mass of 71 compared to the relative molecular mass of fluorine which is 38
* The larger the relative molecular mass, the stronger the Van der Waals' forces between discrete molecules.
* More energy is required to overcome the stronger Van der Waals' forces between chlorine molecules.

**Differences between compounds and mixtures**

\begin{tabular}{|c|p{142.3pt}|p{142.3pt}|} \hline  & Compounds & Mixtures \\ \hline Composition & A compound contains two or more elements chemically combined in a fixed composition. & A mixture contains two or more substances physically mixed together in any proportion. \\ \hline Separation & A compound can only be broken down into its elements or into simpler compounds by chemical processes. & The components of a mixture can be separated by physical means. \\ \hline Properties & The physical and chemical properties of a compound are different from its constituent elements. & The chemical properties of a mixture are the same as those of its components. \\ \hline Energy change & Chemical reactions occur when a compound is formed. There is usually an energy change. & No chemical reactions occur when a mixture is formed. There is usually little or no energy change. \\ \hline \end{tabular}

**Ionic equations**

**Steps for writing ionic equations**

1) Write chemical equation with state symbols

2) Split aqueous ionic compounds and aqueous acids/alkalis into ions (DONT split solids or molecules like l\({}_{2}\))

3) Cancel spectator ions

4) Rewrite ionic equation

**General forms for ionic equations (note that there are exceptions)**

**1) acid + metal**

_H\({}^{+}\) (aq) + _metal (s) -_H\({}_{2}\)_(g) + metal cation (aq)

**2) acid + alkali**

H\({}^{+}\) (aq) + OH\({}^{-}\) (aq) - H\({}_{2}\)O (_l_)

**3) acid + base**

_H\({}^{+}\) (aq) + _metal oxide (s) -_H\({}_{2}\)O_(_l_) + _metal cation (aq)

**4) acid + soluble carbonate**

2H\({}^{+}\) (aq) + CO\({}_{3}\)\({}^{2-}\) (aq) - CO\({}_{2}\) (g) + 2H\({}_{2}\)O_(_l_)

**5) acid + insoluble carbonate**

_H\({}^{+}\) (aq) + _metal carbonate (s) -_CO\({}_{2}\)_(g) + _H\({}_{2}\)O_(_l_) + _metal cation (aq)

**6) alkali + ammonium salt**

OH\({}^{-}\) (aq) + NH\({}_{4}\)\({}^{+}\) (aq) - NH\({}_{3}\) (g) + H\({}_{2}\)O_(_l_)

**7) precipitation reaction**

cation (aq) + anion (aq) - insoluble salt (s)

**8) metal displacement reaction**

_metal A (s) + _metal cation B (aq) -_metal cation A (aq) + _metal B (s)

**9) halogen displacement reaction**

halogen A (g/aq) + 2halide B (aq) - 2halide A (aq) + halogen B (aq)

**Redox**

**Electron transfer**

**Steps in constructing half equations**

1) Construct ionic equation (if necessary)

2) Identify elements that have experienced a change in their charges

3) Write the relevant half equations

4) Balance the equations by balancing number of atoms

5) Balance the equations by ensuring that sum of the charges on both sides of the equations are equal.

**Identifying substances oxidised/reduced**

a) Electrons are added on the left side of the equation \(\boldsymbol{\cdot}\) Reactant is reduced because it gained electrons

b) Electrons are on the right side of the equation \(\boldsymbol{\cdot}\) Reactant is oxidised because it lost electrons

**Example**

Cu (s) + 2AgNO\({}_{3}\) (aq) \(\boldsymbol{\cdot}\) Cu(NO\({}_{3}\))\({}_{2}\) (aq) + 2Ag (s)

1) Cu (s) + 2 Ag\({}^{+}\) (aq) \(\boldsymbol{\cdot}\) Cu\({}^{2+}\) (aq) + 2Ag (s)

2) Both copper and silver have experienced a change in their charges

3) Cu (s) \(\boldsymbol{\cdot}\) Cu\({}^{2+}\) (aq)

Ag\({}^{+}\) (aq) \(\boldsymbol{\cdot}\) Ag (s)

4) Atoms are balanced

5) Cu (s) Cu\({}^{2+}\) (aq) +2e

Ag\({}^{+}\) (aq) + e \(\boldsymbol{\cdot}\) Ag (s)

a) Cu is oxidised as Cu lost electrons to form Cu\({}^{2+}\) in Cu(NO\({}_{3}\))\({}_{2}\)

b) AgNO\({}_{3}\) is reduced as Ag\({}^{+}\) in AgNO\({}_{3}\) gained electrons to form Ag

**Oxidation states**

**Rules for assianina oxidation states**

**1) The oxidation state of fluorine in compounds is always -1.**

**2) The oxidation state of oxygen in compounds is usually -2, except in peroxides (OS = -1) and OF2 (OS = +2).**

**3) The oxidation state of hydrogen in compounds is usually +1, except in metal hydrides (OS = -1).**

**4) The oxidation state of group I, II and III metals in compounds is usually +1, +2 and +3 respectively.**

**5) The oxidation state of free element is 0.**

**6) The oxidation state of a simple ion is equal to the charge on the ion.**

**7) The sum of oxidation states of all the atoms in a compound is zero.**

**8) The sum of oxidation states of all the atoms in a polyatomic ion is equal to the charge on the ion.**

**Answering templates for redox questions**

**Gain/loss of H**

**(substance) is oxidized/reduced because it has lost/qained hydrogen to form (substance).**

**Gain/loss of O**

**(substance) is oxidized/reduced because it has gained/lost oxygen to form (substance).**

**Gain/loss of e**

**(substance) is oxidized/reduced because it has lost/qained electrons to form (substance).**

**Increase/decrease in oxidation state**

**(substance) is oxidized/reduced because the oxidation state of (element) has increased/decreased from (oxidation state) in (substance) to (oxidation state) in (substance).**

**Oxidising and reducing agents**

**(statement explaining why substance is oxidized/reduced). Since (substance) is oxidized/reduced, it is a reducing/oxidizing agent.**

* Si has a high melting point as Si has a _giant covalent structure_.
* A lot of _energy_ is required to break the large number of _strong covalent bonds_ between Si atoms in the _vast network_
* Phosphorus, sulfur, chlorine have low melting points as they all have _simple covalent structure_
* While _argon_ exist as monoatomic atoms
* Little _energy_ is required to break the weak Van der Waals' forces between the discrete molecules or atoms.

* Na, Mg and Al are able to conduct electricity as they have a giant metallic structure.
* There are strong electrostatic forces of attraction between the metallic cations and sea of delocalised electrons
* The delocalised electrons are mobile to conduct electricity
* The electrical conductivity increases from Na to Mg to Al as the number of delocalised electrons increases
* Si is a metalloid and so it is expected to have the properties of metals and non-metals.
* Si is a semiconductor
* Phosphorus, sulfur, chlorine have simple covalent structure
* While argon exist as monoatomic atoms
* They consist of electrical neutral molecules or atoms
* Therefore there are no mobile ions or electrons to conduct electricity.

## Effective nuclear charge

\(\mathrm{Zeff}=Z-S\)

### Trend in atomic radius across period 3

\(\bullet\) Nuclear charge increase as number of protons increase

\(\bullet\) Shielding effect is relatively constant (same number of shells)

\(\bullet\) Effective nuclear charge increases

\(\bullet\) Electrostatic forces of attraction between nucleus and valence electrons increases

\(\bullet\) Decrease in atomic radii

### Trend in ionic radius across period 3

\(\bullet\) The anions P\({}^{3-}\), S\({}^{2-}\), C\(f\) are larger than the cations Na\({}^{+}\), Mg\({}^{2+}\), A\({}^{\beta+}\) because the anions have 1 more quantum shell.

\(\bullet\) For the cations, shielding effect is constant because they are isoelectronic (same number of electrons)

\(\bullet\) Nuclear charge increases from Na\({}^{+}\) to Mg\({}^{2+}\) to A\({}^{\beta+}\) because number of protons increases

\(\bullet\) Effective nuclear charge increases

\(\bullet\) Electrostatic forces of attraction between nucleus and valence electrons increases

\(\bullet\) Ionic radii decreases

\(\bullet\) Similar explanation for the anions.

## Group I Physical properties

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|} \hline
**Physical Properties**: & **Trends** \\ \hline low melting points & Melting point decreases down the group \\ \hline low densities & Density generally increase down group \\  & Li, Na and K are less dense than water \\ \hline soft - soft enough to be cut with a knife & \\ \hline shiny and silvery only when freshly cut & \\ \hline good conductors of heat and electricity & \\ \hline malleable (can be beaten into sheets) and ductile (can be drawn into wires) & \\ \hline \end{tabular}

### Trend in melting point down group I

* Down group I, size of the metallic cations increase
* Charge density of metallic cations decrease
* Therefore electrostatic forces of attraction between metallic cations and delocalised electrons decreases,
* Causing the melting point to decrease down group I

### Chemical Properties

### Trend in reactivity

Reactivity of group I metals increase down the group.

### Explanation

* Down the group, the number of protons and number of electron shells increases
* Both the nuclear charge and shielding effect increases
* However, the shielding effect increases more than the nuclear charge
* Therefore effective nuclear charge decreases
* Hence the electrostatic forces of attraction between the valence electrons and the nucleus is weaker.
* making it easier for the element to lose electrons.
* Therefore the reactivity increases down the group.

### Reaction with water

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:17]

### Trend in reactivity

Reactivity of halogens decrease down the group.

Explanation:

* Down the group, the number of protons and number of electron shells increases
* Both the nuclear charge and shielding effect increases
* However, the shielding effect increases more than the nuclear charge
* Therefore effective nuclear charge decreases
* Hence the electrostatic forces of attraction between the valence electrons and the nucleus is weaker.
* making it harder for the element to gain electrons.
* Therefore the reactivity increases down the group.

### Reaction with water

Eg. C_L_ + H_2O > HC/ + HC/O

### Reaction with sodium (see above under chemical properties of group I metals)

### Group 0

Physical properties

Group 0 elements have low melting and boiling points.

Down group 0, melting points and boiling points increase.

### Explanation

* Down the group, the atomic size increases.
* This results in stronger Van der Waals' forces between the atoms.
* More energy is required to overcome the Van der Waals' forces.
* Hence the melting and boiling points increase down the group.

### Chemical Properties

Group 0 elements are inert/unreactive.

Explanation:

Group 0 elements have a stable noble gas (duplet or octet) electronic configuration.

Therefore they do not need to gain/lose/share electrons.

### Uses

\begin{tabular}{c|l} \hline \hline Noble gas & Uses \\ \hline He & Used in airships and weather balloons due to its low density and low flammability \\ \hline Ne & Used in advertising lights and signs because it is colourless but glows reddish-orange when a current is passed through it \\ \hline Ar & Used in electric bulbs because it will not react with the white-hot filament \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}

## Transition Metals

### Physical properties

* are shiny and silvery in appearance
* are good conductors of heat and electricity
* are very hard and strong
* are malleable and ductile
* have very high melting points and boiling points
* have high densities

### Chemical Properties

Property 1: Transition metals can form ions with variable oxidation states.

Property 2: Most transition metals form coloured compounds.

Property 3: Transition metals or their compounds are used as catalysts.

### Back titration

Q: 50.0 cm\({}^{3}\) of 0.5 mol/dm\({}^{3}\) potassium hydroxide were added to 25 cm\({}^{3}\) of ammonium chloride solution and mixed thoroughly. The resulting solution required 22.7 cm\({}^{3}\) of 0.22 mol/dm\({}^{3}\) nitric acid for complete neutralisation. Calculate the concentration of the ammonium chloride solution.

A: KOH + HNO\({}_{3}\)\(\rightarrow\) H\({}_{2}\)O + NaNO\({}_{3}\)

no. of moles of HNO\({}_{3}\) = (22.7/1000) x 0.22 = 4.994 x 10\({}^{-3}\) mol

From equation, 1 mole of KOH reacts with 1 mole of HNO\({}_{3}\)

no. of moles of remaining KOH = 4.994 x 10\({}^{-3}\) mol

no. of moles of KOH initially = (50/1000) x 0.5 = 0.025 mol

no. of moles of KOH reacted = 0.025 - 4.994 x 10\({}^{-3}\) = 0.02000 mol

NH\({}_{4}\)Cl + KOH \(\rightarrow\) NH\({}_{3}\) + H\({}_{2}\)O + KC/

From equation, 1 mole of NH\({}_{4}\)Cl/ reacts with 1 mole of KOH

no. of moles of NH\({}_{4}\)Cl = 0.02000 mol

concentration of NH\({}_{4}\)Cl = 0.02 \(\div\) (25/1000) = 0.8 mol/dm\({}^{3}\)

Q: 14.7 g of impure anhydrous sodium carbonate was dissolved in 1 dm\({}^{3}\) of distilled water to form a sodium carbonate solution. 24.0 cm\({}^{3}\) of this sodium carbonate solution required 29.8 cm\({}^{3}\) of 0.2 mol/dm\({}^{3}\) dilute nitric acid for complete reaction. Calculate the percentage purity of sodium carbonate.

A: Na\({}_{2}\)CO\({}_{3}\) + 2HNO\({}_{3}\)\(\rightarrow\) 2NaNO\({}_{3}\) + H\({}_{2}\)O + CO\({}_{2}\)

no of moles of HNO\({}_{3}\) = 0.2 x (29.8/1000) = 0.00596 mol

Since 1 mole of Na\({}_{2}\)CO\({}_{3}\) reacts with 2 moles of HNO\({}_{3}\)

no of moles of Na\({}_{2}\)CO\({}_{3}\) in 24 cm3 = 0.00596/2 = 0.00298 mol

no of moles of Na\({}_{2}\)CO\({}_{3}\) in 1 dm\({}^{3}\) = 0.00298 x (1000/24) = 0.1241 mol (4sf)

mass of Na\({}_{2}\)CO\({}_{3}\) = 0.1241 x 106 = 13.15 g (4sf)

% purity of Na\({}_{2}\)CO\({}_{3}\) = (13.15/14.7) x 100% = 89.5 % (3sf)

## Acids and Bases

### Definitions

**Acid:** An acid is a substance that dissolves and ionises/dissociates in water to form hydrogen ions (H\({}^{+}\) ions).

**Basicity:** The basicity of an acid is the total number of hydrogen ions that an acid molecule can form when it dissociates.

**Strong acid:** A strong acid ionises/dissociates completely in water to form ions.

**Weak acid:** A weak acid ionises/dissociate partially in water to form ions.

Note: Acids ONLY show acidic properties when dissolved in water. Eg. When hydrogen chloride is dissolved in an organic solvent, it does not display acidic properties.

**Colours of indications**

**Examples of 2 common indicators in the syllabus**

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|} \hline
**indicator** & **colour in** & **pH at which colour** & **colour in** \\  & **acidic solution** & **change occurs** & \\  & (pH \(<\) _x_) & (_x_) & \\  & & & (pH \(>\) _x_) \\ \hline litmus & red & 7 & blue \\ \hline methyl orange & red & 4 & yellow \\ \hline \end{tabular}

**Colours of Universal Indicator in Solutions of Various pH Values**

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|} \hline
**indicator** & **colour in** & **pH at which colour** & **colour in** \\  & **acidic solution** & **change occurs** & \\  & & & **alkaline solution** \\  & & & (pH \(>\) _x_) \\ \hline litmus & red & 7 & blue \\ \hline methyl orange & red & 4 & yellow \\ \hline \end{tabular}

**Colours of Universal Indicator in Solutions of Various pH Values**

### Physical properties of acids

1) Acids taste sour.

2) Acids change the colour of indicators (Universal Indicator, litmus, methyl orange etc.).

3) Solutions of acids dissolved in water can always conduct electricity because they contain mobile ions.

### Chemical properties of acids

1) acid + carbonate -> salt + water + carbon dioxide

2) acid + base -> salt + water

3) acid + reactive metal -> salt + hydrogen

Unreactive metals that do not react with acids are Cu, Ag, Au.

### Physical properties of alkalis

1) Alkalis taste bitter.

2) Alkalis are soapy/slippery.

3) Alkalis change the colours of indicators.

4) Solutions of alkalis dissolved in water are good electrical conductor because they contain mobile ions.

### Chemical properties of alkalis

1) alkali + ammonium salt -> ammonia + water + salt

### Titration curves

What a pH curve shows:

* describes how the pH changes during an acid-base titration
* the point where the solutions have been mixed in exactly the right proportions according to the chemical equation
* indicates the choice of a suitable indicator that changes colour near to the equivalence point
**Titration curve of HC/Na2CO3 reaction**

In the first part of the reaction, sodium carbonate is reacting with the acid to produce sodium hydrogencarbonate. No carbon dioxide gas is produced.

Na2CO3 (aq) + HC/(aq) NaCl/(aq) + NaHCO3 (aq)

The first part of the reaction is complete at A.

In the second part of the reaction, sodium hydrogencarbonate produced goes on to react with more acid, producing carbon dioxide gas.

NaHCO3 (aq) + HC/(aq) NaCl/(aq) + CO2 (g) + H2O (_l_)

The reaction is complete at B.

* manufacture of fertilisers
* battery acid in vehicles Uses of Sulfur Dioxide
* bleach / bleaching agent
* food preservative
* in the manufacture of sulfuric acid Types of oxides Definitions:

**Basic** oxides react with acids to form salt and water only.

**Acidic** oxides react with alkalis to form salt and water only.

**Amphoteric** oxides react with both acids and alkalis to form salt and water only.

**Neutral** oxides do not react with either acids or alkalis.

Identifying types of oxides:

Most **metallic** oxides are basic oxides except ZnO, AlJoJo and PbO which are amphoteric oxides Most **non-metallic** oxides are acidic oxides except CO, NO and H2O which are neutral oxides.

### Determining method of salt preparation

1) If the salt is insoluble, use precipitation method.

2) If the salt is a soluble group I or ammonium salt, use titration method.

3) If the salt is a soluble salt that is not group I or ammonium salt, use ABCm method.

### Procedure for precipitation method

* Mix aqueous lead(II) nitrate and sulfuric acid solution together and stir (One of the aqueous solutions must contain the cation while the other aqueous solution must contain the anion, of the salt to be prepared)
* Lead(II) sulfate is formed as precipitate
* Filter the mixture, retaining the residue (precipitate)
* Wash the residue with lots of distilled water (for 'purity')
* Dry the residue between filter papers (for 'dryness')
* Lead (II) sulfate is obtained

### Procedure for ABcm method

* Add copper (II) carbonate/copper (II) oxide/copper (II) hydroxide to sulfuric acid solution until no further amount of copper (II) carbonate/copper (II) oxide/copper (II) hydroxide can react anymore
* Filter off the excess copper (II) carbonate/copper (II) oxide/copper (II) hydroxide / Filter the mixture and retain the filtrate, aqueous copper (II) sulfate.
* Place the copper (II) sulfate filtrate on an evaporating dish
* Heat/warm the filtrate until saturation
* Let the saturated filtrate cool
* Crystals of copper (II) sulfate are formed (crystallisation) upon cooling
* Filter the mixture to remove the copper (II) sulfate crystals as residue
* Wash the copper (II) sulfate crystals with a small amount of cold distilled water (for 'purity')
* Dry the copper (II) sulfate crystals between filter papers (for 'dryness')
* Copper (II) sulfate is obtained

* Pipette 20.0 cm\({}^{3}\) of sodium hydroxide/sodium carbonate solution into a conical flask
* Add a few drops of methyl orange to sodium hydroxide/sodium carbonate solution
* Add sulfuric acid slowly to the sodium hydroxide/sodium carbonate, with constant swirling, using a burette
* Stop the titration when methyl orange turns from yellow to orange
* Record the volume of sulfuric acid used
* Repeat the previous step again to confirm that the end-point is determined accurately
* Repeat the entire procedure again, using 20.0 cm\({}^{3}\) of sodium hydroxide/sodium carbonate and the volume of sulfuric acid used at end-point, without any addition of methyl orange indicator
* Place the sodium sulfate solution on an evaporating dish
* Heat/warm the sodium sulfate solution until saturation
* Saturated solution is cooled
* Crystals of sodium sulfate are formed (crystallisation) upon cooling
* Filter the mixture to remove the sodium sulfate crystals as residue
* Wash the salt crystals with small amount of cold distilled water (for 'purity')
* Dry the salt crystals between filter papers (for 'dryness')
* sodium sulfate is obtained

### Common alloys

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|} \hline
**Alloy** & **Elements in alloy** \\ \hline Brass & Cu + Zn \\ \hline Bronze & Cu + Sn \\ \hline Steel & Fe + C \\ \hline Stainless steel & Fe + C + Ni + Cr \\ \hline \end{tabular}

### Explanation questions for alloys

#### Why are pure metals soft?

* Easy for orderly layers of same sized atoms to slide over one another.

#### Why are alloys harder than pure metals?

* Alloys consist of atoms of different size.
* The orderly arrangement of atoms is disrupted.
* The layers of atoms cannot slide over each other easily when a force is applied.
* Therefore, alloys are harder and stronger than pure metals.

#### Reactivity series

#### Reaction of metals with acid, steam and water

#### Answering template for observations:

#### Reaction with cold water

* (metal) reacts explosivelv/violently/readily/very slowly with cold water.
* Effervescence of a colourless odourless gas that extinguishes a burning solint with a 'pop' sound. (Production of hydrogen gas)
* (group I metal) darts around quickly and sizzles on the surface of the water. *Note that this is only relevant for group I metals

#### Reaction with steam

* (metal) reacts violently/readily/slowly with steam.
* (observation particular to the metal. E.g. for Mg a bright white glow is produced, for Zn an oxide that is yellow when hot and white when cold is formed, for Fe the iron will appear red hot when reacting with steam.)

#### Reaction with acid

* (metal) reacts explosivelv/violently/very quickly/moderately fast/slow/very slowly with acid
* Effervescence of a colourless odourless gas that extinguishes a burning solint with a 'pop' sound.

### Exception in reactivity series/oxide layer:

**Why does (reactive metal, usually aluminium) not react with (steam/acid)? (OR react only after some time if acid is added/after sandpaper is used)**

* (metal) reacts readily with oxygen to form a (metal oxide)
* Metal is covered with oxide layer which is highly adhesive and non-porous
* The layer protects the metal from reacting with (steam/acid)

### Displacement reactions (for solutions)

### Stating observations:

* A (colour) solid is deposited.
* The (colour) (name of chemical) solution turns (colour)

### Explaining observations:

* The (more reactive metal) is more reactive than (less reactive metal).
* Therefore (more reactive metal) displaces (less reactive metal) from (salt solution of less reactive metal).

## Stability of metal compounds

More reactive metals form more stable compounds

**Stability of metal carbonates**

\begin{tabular}{|p{142.3pt}|p{142.3pt}|} \hline
**Metal Carbonate** & **Observations upon heating** \\ \hline Potassium carbonate & Unaffected by heat; very high thermal stability \\ \hline Calcium carbonate & Eqn: CaCO\({}_{3}\) (s) \(\xrightarrow{}\) CaO (s) + CO\({}_{2}\) (g) \\  & Obs: A colourless odourless gas is evolved that forms white precipitate in limewater. \\  & The white solid remains white. \\ \hline Magnesium carbonate & Eqn: MgO\({}_{3}\) (s) \(\xrightarrow{}\) MgO (s) + CO\({}_{2}\) (g) \\  & Obs: A colourless odourless gas is evolved that forms white precipitate in limewater. \\  & The white solid remains white. \\ \hline Alumnium carbonate & Eqn: Al\({}_{2}\)(CO\({}_{3}\))\({}_{3}\) (s) \(\xrightarrow{}\) Al\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{3}\) (s) + 3CO\({}_{2}\) (g) \\  & Obs: A colourless odourless gas is evolved that forms white precipitate in limewater. \\  & The white solid remains white. \\ \hline Zinc carbonate & Eqn: ZnO\({}_{3}\) (s) \(\xrightarrow{}\) ZnO (s) + CO\({}_{2}\) (g) \\  & Obs: A colourless odourless gas is evolved that forms white precipitate in limewater. \\  & The white solid turns yellow when heated and white when cooled. \\ \hline Iron (II) carbonate & Eqn: FeO\({}_{3}\) (s) \(\xrightarrow{}\) FeO (s) + CO\({}_{2}\) (g) \\  & Obs: A colourless odourless gas is evolved that forms white precipitate in limewater. \\  & The green solid turns black. \\ \hline Lead (II) carbonate & Eqn: PbCO\({}_{3}\) (s) \(\xrightarrow{}\) PbO (s) + CO\({}_{2}\) (g) \\  & Obs: A colourless odourless gas is evolved that forms white precipitate in limewater. \\  & The white solid turns orange when heated and yellow when cooled. \\ \hline Copper (II) carbonate & Eqn: CuCO\({}_{3}\) (s) \(\xrightarrow{}\) CuO (s) + CO\({}_{2}\) (g) \\  & Obs: A colourless odourless gas is evolved that forms white precipitate in limewater. \\  & The green solid turns black. \\ \hline  & Eqn: 2Ag\({}_{2}\)CO\({}_{3}\) (s) \(\xrightarrow{}\) 4Ag (s) + 2CO\({}_{2}\) (g) + O\({}_{2}\) (g) \\  & Obs: A colourless odourless gas is evolved that forms white precipitate in limewater. \\ Silver carbonate & A colourless odourless gas is evolved that reliablits a glowing splint. \\  & FYI: The yellow solid turns grey. \\ \hline \end{tabular}

**Metal Oxide** & **Reaction with C/CO** & **Reaction with H\({}_{2}\)** & **Electolysis** \\ \hline Potassium oxide & & & Metal oxides are too stable to undergo chemical reduction. \\ \hline Magnesium oxide & & & These undergo electrolytic reduction. \\ \hline Aluminium oxide & & & \\ \hline Zinc oxide & & & \\ \hline Iron(III)oxide & & & Possible for electrolytic reduction; however option not chosen. Why? **expensive** \\ \hline Silver oxide & & & \\ \hline \end{tabular}

### Displacement reactions of metal oxides

More reactive metal will displace a less reactive metal from its oxides.

### Rusting

**Definition:** Rusting is the slow oxidation of iron to form hydrated iron (III) oxide (a reddish-brown solid)

**Conditions for trusting:** oxygen and water

**Factors affecting rate of trusting:**

1) Humidity

2) Presence of acidic pollutants

3) Presence of salts

Note: Rusting is only for iron. Other metals are said to corrode.

### Rust prevention

1) Using protective layer (eg paint, oil)

2) Sacrificial protection (eg. Electroplating or dip plating with zinc, attaching zinc blocks to hulls of ships, connecting magnesium blocks to underground pipelines)

## Recycling

\begin{tabular}{|p{142.3pt}|p{142.3pt}|} \hline
**Advantages** & **Disadvantages** \\ \hline The finite resources will last longer. & Additional costs incurred during operation. \\ Higher saving of energy - Production of aluminium from scrap aluminium compared to extracting aluminium by electrolysis & The cost of transportation of scrap metals to the processing plant. \\ Reduce land and air pollution - mining destroys the environment and produces an enormous amount of waste products. The smelling of ore also causes severe air pollution. \\ Less need for mining - land is freed up for other uses like agriculture and development. \\ Save landfill sites to dispose of waste products of mining. \\ \hline \end{tabular}

**Factors affecting rate of diffusion**

1. **Temperature:** the higher the temperature, the faster the rate of diffusion
2. **Mr:** the higher the Mr, the slower the rate of diffusion
3. **Gravity:** Gravity can aid or slow down diffusion depending on the direction of diffusion

**Examples of questions in kinetic particle theory**

1) When the pressure of a gas is increased, the volume decreases. [2]

* Gases can be compressed easily because there are a lot of empty space between particles.
* When the pressure is increased, the gas particles are pushed closer to each other and therefore volume decreases.

2) When the pressure on a solid is increased, there is almost no change in volume. [2]

* Solids cannot be compressed because there is very little space between particles.
* When pressure is increased, the particles cannot be pushed closer to each other and therefore there is almost no change in volume.

3) A solid has more mass than the same volume of gas. [2]

* In solids, there is very little space between particles while for gases, there are a lot of empty space between particles.
* As such, for solids, there will be more particles in the same volume of space as compared to gases and so a solid has more mass than the same volume of gas.

4) A small volume of water produces a much larger volume of steam. [2]

* In water, there is little space between particles while for steam, there are a lot of empty space between particles.

* As such, the particles in steam are further apart than the particles in water, and so a small volume of water will produce a much larger volume of steam.

5) A gas at constant pressure increases in volume when it is gently heated, but a solid does not. [4]

* Particles in a solid can only vibrate in fixed positions.

* When a solid is gently heated, the kinetic energy of the particles increase and they vibrate faster.

However, the average distance between particles does not increase and so the volume of the solid does not increase.

Particles in a gas are moving randomly at high speeds.

When a gas is gently heated, the kinetic particle energy of the particles increase and they move randomly at higher speeds.

Therefore the average distance between particles increase and the volume of the gas increases.

6) A liquid takes the shape of its container but a solid does not. [1]

A liquid can take the shape of its container because the particles in a liquid does not occupy fixed positions.

A solid does not take the shape of its container because the particles in a solid occupy fixed positions.

7) Solid ice loses its shape when it melts. [2]

Ice has a fixed shaped because the particles in ice occupy fixed positions.

As ice melts, the intermolecular forces between water molecules are weakened such that the particles are sliding and rolling over each other.

Since the particles in water do not occupy fixed positions, water does not have a fixed shape.

8) A gas is easier to compress than a solid. [2]

In solids, there is very little space between particles while for gases, there are a lot of empty space between particles.

As such, gases are easier to compress as gas particles can move closer to each other easily while it is much more difficult for solid particles to move closer to each other.

## 6.2 Simple Cell

**General simple cell**

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|} \hline  & Anode (-) & Cathode (+) \\ \hline Metal & More reactive metal & Less reactive metal \\ \hline Equations & M (s) \(\rightarrow\) M\({}^{n+}\) + ne & 2H\({}^{+}\) (aq) + 2e \(\rightarrow\) H\({}_{2}\) (g) \\ OR M\({}^{n+}\) (aq) + ne \(\rightarrow\) M (s) \\ \hline \end{tabular}

\({}^{*}\)M is a metal, the metal at the anode and cathode may be different.

**Simple Cell Examples**

**Zn/Cu simple cell with H\({}_{2}\)SO\({}_{4}\) electrolyte**

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|} \hline  & Anode (-) & Cathode (+) \\ \hline Metal & Zn & Cu \\ \hline Equations & Zn (s) \(\rightarrow\) Zn\({}^{2+}\) + 2e & 2H\({}^{+}\) (aq) + 2e \(\rightarrow\) H\({}_{2}\) (g) \\ \hline Observations & The zinc anode becomes smaller. & 
\begin{tabular}{c} Effervescence of a colourless \\ odourless gas that extinguish a \\ lighted splint with a 'pop' sound at \\ the copper cathode. \\ \end{tabular}

**Zn/Cu simple cell with CuSO\({}_{4}\) electrolyte**

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|} \hline  & Anode (-) & Cathode (+) \\ \hline Metal & Zn & Cu \\ \hline Equations & Zn (s) \(\rightarrow\) Zn\({}^{2+}\) + 2e & Cu\({}^{2+}\) (aq) + 2e \(\rightarrow\) Cu (s) \\ \hline Observations & The zinc anode becomes smaller. & 
\begin{tabular}{c} A reddish brown solid is deposited \\ at the copper cathode. \\ The blue copper(II) sulfate solution \\ turns colourless. \\ \end{tabular}

**Selective discharge at cathode**

* If an ion of a metal that is below hydrogen in the reactivity series is present, eg Ag\({}^{+}\) and Cu\({}^{2+}\), the metal ion is discharged to form the metal
* For all other electrolytes, H\({}^{+}\) is discharged to form H\({}_{2}\).

**Factors affecting voltage reading**

* Choice of metal (greater the difference in reactivity = greater voltage)
* Choice of electrolyte (Strong acid/alkali gives greater voltage than weak acid/alkali)

### Fuel Cell (Eg hydrogen fuel cell)

#### Overall equation for hydrogen fuel cell

2H\({}_{2}\) (g) + O\({}_{2}\) (g) \(\rightarrow\) 2H\({}_{2}\)O (_l_)

#### Where reactants come from

Oxygen: obtained from fractional distillation of liquid air

Hydrogen: catalytic cracking of long-chain hydrocarbons from petroleum

#### Advantages

1. Infinite lifespan as long as the reactants are supplied continuously.

2. Pollution-free because water is the only product formed.

3. Reactants are renewable.

Note that this only applies if hydrogen is obtained from water instead of petroleum.

#### Disadvantages

1. Expensive because of large amount of platinum metals used as catalyst required for electrode reaction.

2. The reactant, hydrogen, needs to be liquefied for both transport and storage, which will increase costs.

## Steps to write overall ionic equation and overall equation

1. Balance the number of moles of electrons in the half equations by multiplying the equations accordingly.
2. Add the two half equations together to form the **overall ionic equation**.
3. Add H+ or OH- on both sides of the equations to balance any H+ or OH- present on the left hand side of the equation. Combine the H+ and OH- to form H\({}_{2}\)O.
4. Cancel any H\({}_{2}\)O present on both sides of the equation.
5. Add back the spectator ions to form the **overall equation**.

## Example: Electrolysis of aqueous CuSO\({}_{4}\) using inert electrodes

### Standard template to explain why reactions are exothermic or endothermic Example:

#### 2H\({}_{2}\) + O\({}_{2}\) \(\rightarrow\) H\({}_{2}\)O

The total energy absorbed to break the bonds in 2 moles of H\({}_{2}\) and 1 mole of O\({}_{2}\) is lesser than the total energy released to form bonds in 2 moles of H\({}_{2}\)O. Therefore, energy is released to the surroundings (exothermic reaction).

#### Examples for calculating enthalpy change and energy change

Q: If the H-H bond energy is 436 kJ/mol, the O=O bond energy is 496 kJ/mol, and the O-H bond energy is 460 kJ/mol, calculate the enthalpy change for the following reaction:

2H\({}_{2}\) (g) + O\({}_{2}\) (g) \(\rightarrow\) 2H\({}_{2}\)O (g)

A: \(\Delta H_{\text{reaction}}\) = 2(+436) + 1(+496) + 4(-460)

= (+1368) + (-1840) = -472 kJ/mol

Q: If the mass of hydrogen reacted is 2g, calculate the energy change for the above reaction.

A: moles of H\({}_{2}\) = 2/2 = 1 mol

energy change = (1/2) x -472 = -236 kJ

Note: A sign is required for enthalpy and energy changes. No sign is required for bond energy, energy released, and energy absorbed.

Unit for energy is kJ, unit for enthalpy is kJ/mol

**Fermentation**

**Example:**

**Conditions: 37 \({}^{\circ}\)C, no light, anaerobic condition**

**Note:**

**Kept at 37 \({}^{\circ}\)C because yeast's enzymes will be denatured above this temperature.**

**Fermentation of sugars produces only a dilute solution of ethanol (up to about 15 %) because enzymes will also be denatured if percentage of ethanol goes beyond 15%. Ethanol can then be obtained from this liquid mixture by fractional distillation.**

**Anaerobic condition is used because yeast will adopt aerobic respiration when oxygen is present, resulting in formation of water and carbon dioxide instead of ethanol and carbon dioxide. The ethanol produced may also be oxidised by oxygen to produce ethanolic acid (turns sour).**

### Explanation of how petroleum fractions are separated

1. Petroleum is heated in a furnace and vapourised. The hot vapour will flow up the fractionating column and start to cool down.
2. Each fraction condenses at a different temperature and comes out of the column at different height depending on their boiling points.
3. The hydrocarbons with the lower boiling point range will distill over at the top of the column, where the temperature is lower, while the ones with the higher boiling point range will distil over at the bottom where the temperature is higher.

### Issues related to fossil fuels

* Petroleum is a finite non-renewable resource and the world's petroleum reserves are depleting.
* The supply of petroleum is being depleted very rapidly, and there is a need for its conservation.
* Petroleum, besides being used as fuel, has other important uses like being used as a raw material for the manufacture of essential chemical compounds like medicine and plastics.
* Combustion of petroleum also contributes to pollution (due to the production of CO and C) and global warming (due to the production of CO\({}_{2}\)).

### Alternative fuels

#### Possible sources of alternative fuels:

* Palm oil and ethanol (from sugarcane) from plants can be used as fuels for vehicles.
* Methane produced when organic matter (waste material from plants and animals) is allowed to decay in the absence of air.
* Hydrogen which can be obtained from photolysis of water (renewable) or from catalytic cracking of long chain hydrocarbon (non-renewable).

#### Advantages of using hydrogen as an alternative fuel:

1. Clean fuel, producing only water.
2. Renewable, can be manufactured. (Note that this only applies if hydrogen is obtained from water instead of petroleum)
3. Produces more energy per unit mass (reaction is more exothermic).

**Disadvantages of using hydrogen as an alternative fuel:**

1. Hydrogen needs to be liquefied for both transport and storage, which increases costs.

**Uses of ethanol**

* In alcoholic drinks
* As a fuel for motor vehicles
* As a solvent in pains, varnishes, deodorants and perfumes

**Uses of esters**

* Used as solvent for cosmetics and glue.
* Used in preparation of perfumes and artificial food flavouring because they are sweet smelling.

## Ozone layer

### Function

The ozone layer acts as a kind of shield, filtering out excess harmful UV radiation from the sun.

### How ozone is depleted

CFCs (chlorofluorocarbons), which are usually used as propellants for aerosol sprays and coolants in refrigerators and air conditioners, are very unreactive at sea level. But once they move up to the stratosphere, they will decompose, under strong UV radiation, to form chlorine atoms which destroy ozone.

Cl + O3 > ClO + O2

### Consequence of ozone layer depletion

Excess UV radiation will reach the surface of the earth, leading to a drastic increase in the cases of skin cancer, genetic mutation and eye damage (cataracts).

### Catalytic converter

* Contains rhodium and platinum catalyst

Reactions in catalytic converter:

* 2CO + O2 > 2CO2
* 2NO > N2 + O2
* 2NO + 2CO > N2 + 2CO2
* 2NO2 + 4CO > N2 + 4CO2
* Complete combustion of unburnt hydrocarbons to form carbon dioxide and water

**Reaction of calcium hydroxide with nitrogenous fertilisers**

* Calcium hydroxide can react with nitrogenous fertilisers to displace ammonia.
* Ionic Equation: OH-(aq) + NH4+ (aq) \(heat\)\(from\)\(sunlight\) NH4 (q) + H2O (l)
* Since ammonia is a gas, it escapes from the soil when warmed and this causes loss of nitrogen from the soil.

**Artificial details/common questions for paper chromatography**

**Principle of chromatography:** Different solutes have different solubilities in different solvents.

**Chromatogram:** Filter paper with separated components on it.

**Why should the base line be drawn using a pencil instead of a pen?**

* the solvent will not separate the pencil mark, unlike ink which contains soluble dyes
* the separated dyes from the ink will smudge, thus interfering with dyes from the test sample

**What are the advantages of using chromatography?**

* only a small amount of sample is required e.g. 1 X 10-12 g of sample
* inexpensive to set up and conduct, in the case of paper chromatographyHow can chromatography be applied to colourless substances?
* Use ultraviolet (UV) light to'see' the invisible dyes/ components (some substances are coloured under uv light, but colourless in white light)
* Use a locating aagent e.g. ninhydrin solution/ spray (ninhydrin forms a purple stain with amino acids which are originally colourless)

Why should the solvent front be near the end of the paper at the end of the experiment?

To ensure maximum separation of the components in the sample. Rf value calculated is more accurate.

Why should the spots and dyes on the starting line be small?

To ensure that there will not be any overlapping of the components

Why should the start line be above the solvent level?

So that the sample will not dissolve in the solvent before the components in the sample can be separated.

Why does the container need to be closed with a lid?

To minimize solvent evaporation and drying up before process is completed.

Describe with the aid of a diagram, how a chromatogram can be set up.

* Ensure the start line/base line is drawn in pencil and above the solvent level before the experiment starts.
* After the chromatogram has developed, indicate, with a pencil, the position of the solvent front and wait for it to dry.
* If necessary, use a locating a agent to make the chromatogram visible.
