## Chemistry

_Under standard conditions, substances are in their standard states. The standard state of a substance_is its most stable form under standard conditions._

_An enthalpy change stated under standard conditions is hence called standard enthalpy change, denoted by the symbol, \(\Delta H\theta\). The '\(\theta\)' indicates that \(\Delta H\) was measured and calculated under standard conditions, standard states.__Ertropy of a substanceincreases as it changes from a solid to a liquid to a gas._

_Dissolving of NaCl in water involves the disruption of the crystal lattice of solid NaCl and hydration of Na'and Cl ions disruption of the crystal lattice increases disorder._

_The hydration process however decreases disorder about Na'and Cl since it puts the hydrating water molecules into an orderly arrangement about the Na'and Cl ions._

_The entropy of a dissolved solid is usually greater than the entropy of the pure solute._

_For solids such as AIC\({}_{l}\) which contain more highly charged ions, the hydrating water molecules are more strongly ordered about the ions._

_Since the ordering process is more dominant, the overall dissolution process results in a net decrease in entropy._
