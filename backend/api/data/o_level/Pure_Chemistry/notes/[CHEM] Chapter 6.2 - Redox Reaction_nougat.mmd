IONIC-HALF-EQUATIONS

Steps:

1) Write out the balanced chemical equation for the reaction.

Mg (s) + CuSO\({}_{4}\)(aq) MgSO\({}_{4}\)(aq) + Cu (s)

2) Convert the chemical equation to its ionic equation.

Mg (s) + Cu\({}^{2}\)(aq) + Mg\({}^{2}\)(aq) + Cu (s)

3) identify the substance that undergoes oxidation and reduction respectively.

Ovidation: Mg (s) + Mg\({}^{2}\)(aq)

Reduction: Cu\({}^{2}\)(aq) + Cu (s)

4) Balance the number of charges on both sides of each half-equation using electrons.

Oxidation: Mg (s) + Mg\({}^{2}\)(aq) + 2e\({}^{2}\)

Reduction: Cu\({}^{2}\)(aq) + 2e\({}^{2}\) Cu (s)

* 13. In which reaction is substance X reduced? (N2019/P1/Q19)
* A Acidified potassium manganate(VII) is decolourised on addition to an aqueous solution of X.
* B Adding aqueous potassium iodide to an aqueous solution of X gives a brown colour.
* C X \(\rightarrow\) X\({}^{2+}\) + 2e\({}^{-}\)
* D XO\({}^{-}\) + O\({}_{2}\)\(\rightarrow\) XO\({}_{3}\)\({}^{-}\)

### Answer:

* B KI has been oxidised to produce I, which is brown in colour. In order for a redox reaction to occur, X must be an oxidising agent which has been reduced in the reaction by KI.

* 14. Colour changes are often observed when redox reactions occur. Which colour change is due to the reduction of the named reagent? (N2020/P1/Q18)
* A Black solid copper(II) oxide changes to blue aqueous copper(II) sulfate. B Colourless aqueous potassium iodide changes to become a brown solution. C Green aqueous iron(II) chloride changes to yellow/brown aqueous iron(III) chloride. D Purple acidified potassium manganate(VII) changes to become colourless. ( )
* 14. D The change in colour of potassium manganate(VII) is due to the reduction of the manganate(VII) ion to mangenses(II) ion.
