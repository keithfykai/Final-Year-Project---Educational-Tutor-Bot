(b) State that mitosis is a type of cell division giving rise to genetically identical cells in which the chromosome number is maintained (c) State the importance of mitosis in growth, repair and asexual reproduction * In organisms that reproduce asexually, mitosis plays a central role in generating offspring
* Mitosis is nuclear division that produces 2 daughter nuclei that is genetically identical to parent nucleus.
* Daughter nuclei have the same number of chromosomes and same amount of DNA as parental nucleus. Each daughter cells therefore contain diploid (2n) number of chromosomes.
* Dploid cells: contain two complete sets of chromosomes, one set inherited from each parent. (46 chromosomes; with 23 chromosomes inherited from each parent). Most somatic cells are diploid.

* Producing genetically identical cells is important so the daughter cells will have all the necessary genes
* Mitosis allows growth, repair and asexual reproduction that requires genetically identical cells.

1. Growth - Growth requires increase in number of new genetically identical cells within an organism, which is produced by mitosis for it to increase in size
2. Repair - New cells are produced to replace worn out cells that have been shed or to heal from wounds
3. Asexual reproduction - producing offspring that are genetically identical to the parents as well as to one another.

(d) Define sexual reproduction as the process involving the fusion of nuclei of male and female gametes to form a zygote and the production of genetically dissimilar offspring Sexual reproduction is the process involving the fusion of male and female gametes (one from each parents) to form a zygote during fertilisation. The outcome is genetically dissimilar offspring.

Therefore, gametes have a haploid (n) number of chromosomes, in order to restore diploid chromosome number in the zygote when gametes fuses. This is necessary for normal growth and development

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|} \hline Advantages & - Offspring may inherit beneficial qualities from both parents. \\  & - There is greater genetic variation in the offspring, thus species can be better adapted to changes in the environment. \\ \hline Disadvantages & - Two parents are required (except in plants with bisexual flowers) as fusion of gametes is required \\  & - Slower method of producing offspring as compared to asexual reproduction \\ \hline \end{tabular}

(f) State what is meant by homologous pairs of chromosomes

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:10]

(g) State that meiosis is a type of cell division that gives rise to genetically dissimilar cells in which the chromosome number is halved due to the separation of homologous chromosomes

(h) State that meiosis is used in the formation of gametes(I) Identify using a hand lens if necessary, the sepals, petals, stamens and carpels of insect-pollinated, dicotyledonous flowers, and examine the pollen grains under a light microscope

(J) State the functions of the sepals, petals, anthers and carpels(K) Identify, using a hand lens if necessary, the stamens and stigmas of wind-pollinated flowers, and examine the pollen grains under a light microscope 

# Structure of a lower plant

Wind-pollinated flowers are different in structure because they do not have to attract insects to them but do need to be exposed to the wind.

(L) Outline the process of pollination and distinguish between self-pollination and cross-pollinationPollination is the transfer of pollen grains from the anther to the stigma, enabling fertilisation.

Both self-pollination and cross-pollination are sexual reproduction as there is fusion of gametes.

Self pollination: transfer of pollen grains from the anther to the stigma of the same flower or from the anther of a flower to the stigma of another flower on the same plant.

It is favoured when:

* Bisexual flowers with anthers and stigma maturing at the same time
* Stigma being located directly below the anthers, allowing pollen grains to fall onto it

\begin{tabular}{|c|c c|} \hline \hline Advantages & \(\bullet\) & Not dependent on external agents of pollination \\  & such as insects or wind \\  & \(\bullet\) & Less wastage of pollen and energy. During wind and \\  & insect pollination, a great number of pollen grains \\  & are lost as only a few pollen grains come into \\  & contact with a stigma of a flower of the same \\  & species. \\  & \(\bullet\) & Only one parent plant is required \\ \hline Disadvantages & \(\bullet\) & There is less genetic variation, hence the offspring is \\  & less adapted to environmental changes. \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}

(M) Compare, using fresh specimens, an insect-pollinated and a wind-pollinated flower and explain their differences

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:20]

(N) Outline the growth of the pollen tube and its entry into the ovule followed by fertilisation (production of endosperm and details of development are not required)Fertilisation: The fusion of nuclei of the male gamete (pollen) and the female gamete (ovule)

1. After pollination, the pollen grains germinate in response to the sugary fluid secreted by stigma.
2. A pollen tube grows out from each pollen grain. The cytoplasm and the two nuclei of the pollen grain, namely generative nucleus and pollen tube nucleus, pass into the pollen tube

1. Pollen tube secretes enzymes to digest the surrounding tissue of the stigma and style.
2. The generative nucleus divides to form two male gametes.
3. The pollen tube enters the ovule in the ovary through the micropyle.
4. Within the ovule, the tip of the pollen tubes absorbs sap and bursts, releasing the two male gametes.
5. One male gametes fuses with the nucleus of the ovum to form the zygote, while the other male gametes with the definitive nucleus to form the endosperm nucleus.
6. The ovule will develop into a seed and the ovary will develop into a fruit.

(O) Identify the male reproductive system and state the functions of:

testes, scrotum, sperm ducts, prostate gland, urethra and penis 

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:25]

(P) Identify the female reproductive system and state the functions of:

ovaries, oviducts, uterus, cervix and vagina 
Female reproductive

(Q) Outline the menstrual cycle with reference to the alternation of menstruation and ovulation, the natural variation in its length, and the fertile and infertile phases of the cycle with reference to the effects of progesterone and oestrogen only 

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:30]

(R) Describe fertilisation and early development of the zygote simply in terms of the formation of a ball of cells which becomes implanted in the wall of the uterus 

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:32]

* State the functions of the amniotic sac and the amniotic fluid 

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:34]

(T) Describe the function of the placenta and umbilical cord in relation to exchange of dissolved nutrients, gases and excretory products (structural details are not required)* _After implantation, tissues growing out from the embryo grow into the endometrium, forming the placenta._
* _The placenta is an organ that contains both maternal and embryonic blood vessels._
* _it acts as a site of exchange of nutrients, gases and waste between the fetus and mother_
* _Functions of placenta_
* _Provide nutrients such as glucose, amino acids and mineral salts and oxygen from maternal blood to the embryo_
* _Remove waste materials such as urea and carbon dioxide from the foetus._
* _Allows protective antibodies to diffuse from maternal blood into embryonic blood/ prevent pathogens from crossing over from maternal blood to fetus_
* _Allow exchange of gases_
* _Produces progesterone which maintains endometrium during pregnancy_
* _Provides a barrier preventing the mixing of maternal blood and embryonic blood_
* _maternal blood pressure is much higher than embryonic blood pressure and would damage vital tissues_
* _embryo might have a different blood group, which can result in agglutination when blood is mixed which is fatal_
* A flexible, tube-like structure that connects the fetus to the placenta during pregnancy
* The umbilical cord attaches the embryo to the placenta.
* One umbilical vein transports oxygenated blood and food substances from the placenta to the foetus.
* Two umbilical arteries transport deoxygenated blood and metabolic waste products from the foetus to the placenta.

* (U) Discuss the transmission of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and methods to reduce transmission Transmission of HIV

* By sexual intercourse with an infected person
* By sharing and reusing contaminated needles during intravenous drug use, tattoos and piercing (that were poorly sterilised)
* By receiving a blood transfusion from an infected donor
* During pregnancy and breastfeeding
* Abstinence
* Have sex with only one partner
* Use a condom during sex (only reduces the risk of infection)
* Needles must be new and sterilised for tattoos, piercings or acupuncture
* Infected mothers should undergo antiretroviral therapies and give birth by caesarean section to minimise risk of transmission to the foetus.
* Reduce drug abuse as drug addicts usually share syringes to inject drugs
