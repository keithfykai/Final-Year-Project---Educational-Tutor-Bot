## 3 Properties of Aliphatic Amines

Note: When comparing the boiling points of two compounds, other than the different types of intermolecular forces of attraction, it is also important to consider their relative molecular mass or molar mass. \(M_{r}\) or M is an indicator of the number of electrons in a molecule. A molecule with higher \(M_{r}\) or M has more electrons. This will lead to higher boiling points due to stronger intermolecular instantaneous dipole - induced dipole forces of attraction (**id-id**) holding the molecules in the liquid together.

Aliphatic amines have **higher** boiling points than hydrocarbons of _comparable mass_ due to their ability to form intermolecular **hydrogen bonds** in addition to **id-id** **interactons** between the non-polar alkyl groups, whereas there are **only id-id** **interactions** between non-polar hydrocarbon molecules. Hence **more energy** is needed to separate amine molecules.

Aliphatic amines have **lower** boiling points than alcohols of comparable mass. While the no. of hydrogen bonds per molecule is the same, the N-H bonds are **less polar** than O-H bonds since N is **less electronegative** than O. As such, the **hydrogen bonds** between amine molecules are **weaker** than those between alcohol molecules.

Aliphatic amines are **soluble in water** as they can form **hydrogen bonds** with water molecules. Energy released can overcome the interactions between amine molecules (**hydrogen bonds and id-id** **interactons**) and the **hydrogen bonds** between water molecules.

However, solubility **decreases** with the increase in the number of carbon atoms in the R group due to **increasing strength** of **id-id** **interactions** between the non-polar hydrocarbon (alkyl) chains as **number of electrons** in the molecule increases, and so **more energy** is needed to overcome the attractions between the amine molecules, leading to lower solubility.

## 4 Properties of Enrylamine

Phenylamine, also known as aniline or aminobenzene, is an aromatic primary amine. Pure phenylalanine is a colourless liquid, but it darkens rapidly on exposure to light and air. It is normally a brown oily liquid.

Phenylamine and methylbenzene contain similar number of electrons but phenylalanine has a **higher** boiling point than methylbenzene. This is due to its ability to form **hydrogen bonds** between the amine groups in addition to **id-id** interactions between the **non-polar rings**. There are **only id-id interactions** between non-polar methylbenzene molecules. Hence **more energy** is needed to separate phenylamine molecules.

\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|c|} \hline  & \(M_{r}\) & melting point / \({}^{\circ}\)C & boiling point / \({}^{\circ}\)C \\ \hline C\({}_{6}\)H\({}_{8}\)NH\({}_{2}\) & 93 & -6.2 & 184 \\ \hline C\({}_{6}\)H\({}_{5}\)CH\({}_{3}\) & 92 & -95 & 111 \\ \hline \end{tabular}

Phenylamine is only slightly soluble in water. The energy released when phenylalanine form **hydrogen bonds** with the water molecules can overcome the attractions (hydrogen bonds and id-id interactions) between phenylalanine molecules and the hydrogen bonds between water molecules. However, energy is also needed to overcome the **id-id interactions** between the large non-polar benzene ring.

_Question 1 (SLS Quiz 1 / Q1)_

Which of the following explain why methylamine (CH\({}_{3}\)NH\({}_{2}\)) is much more soluble in water than ethyl ethanoate (CH\({}_{3}\)CO\({}_{2}\)CH\({}_{2}\)CH\({}_{3}\))?

**1**: A hydrogen bond forms between the hydrogen of the -NH group in methylamine and the hydrogen of a water molecule.

**2**: A hydrogen bond forms between the hydrogen of the -NH group in methylamine and the oxygen of a water molecule.

**3**: Methylamine is able to dissociate into hydrogen ions and methoxide ions but ethyl ethanoate is not able to dissociate.

**A**: 1 only **B**: 2 only **C**: 1 & 3 **D**: 2 & 3

_Question 2 (SLS Quiz 1 / Q2)_

Which of the following is the correct order of decreasing boiling point for compounds with comparable relative molecular mass?

**A**: CH\({}_{3}\)CH\({}_{2}\)CH\({}_{3}\) > CH\({}_{3}\)CH\({}_{2}\)OH > CH\({}_{3}\)CH\({}_{2}\)NH\({}_{2}\) > HCO\({}_{2}\)H

**B**: CH\({}_{3}\)CH\({}_{2}\)NH\({}_{2}\) > HCO\({}_{2}\)H > CH\({}_{3}\)CH\({}_{2}\)OH > CH\({}_{3}\)CH\({}_{2}\)CH\({}_{3}\)

**C**: HCO\({}_{2}\)H > CH\({}_{3}\)CH\({}_{2}\)OH > CH\({}_{3}\)CH\({}_{2}\)NH\({}_{2}\) > CH\({}_{3}\)CH\({}_{2}\)CH\({}_{3}\)

**D**: CH\({}_{3}\)CH\({}_{2}\)OH > CH\({}_{3}\)CH\({}_{2}\)NH\({}_{2}\) > HCO\({}_{2}\)H > CH\({}_{3}\)CH\({}_{2}\)CH\({}_{3}\)

## 5 Basic strength of amines

_Students should be able to:_

_Describe and explain the basicity of primary, secondary and tertiary amines in the gaseous phase (interpet as Lewis bases)_

_Explain the relative basicities of ammonia, ethylamine and phenylalanine in aqueous medium, in terms of their structures_

Amines are bases. Basic strength of amines can be compared in 2 ways:_

1. _availability of lone pair of electrons_ _on the nitrogen [Recall:_ Electron pair donors are Lewis bases_.]__
2. _stability of the conjugate acid_ _(protonated amine or alkylammonium ion) formed._

_Lone pair of electrons on N is_

_Protonated amine is more stable_

_more available_

_more easily formed, so amine is more_

_same is more basic_

_Factors affecting the_ **availability of lone pair of electrons** _on N_ _for donation to an acid._

1. _Inductive effect of substituents on N:_

_Alkyl groups on N will exert electron-donating inductive effect thus increasing availability of electron pair._
2. _Delocalisation of electron pair on N:_

_Aryl groups on N will make the lone pair of electrons on N less available for donation._
3. _Steric hindrance:_

_Bulky groups on N can hinder donation of the lone pair of electrons on N to the approaching H_\({}^{+}\) _ion, hence making it a weaker base._

_Note: It is importatnt to note the medium when comparing basicity. (See case 4)_

**Case 1**

Relative basicity of alkylmines (apilhatic amines) in gaseous phase: 1\({}^{o}\) amine \(<\) 2\({}^{o}\) amine \(<\) 3\({}^{o}\) amine

_Why is this so?_

* Basic strength increases with the **availability of the lone pair of electrons** _on N for donation._
* _Alkylamines contain alkyl groups which exert an_ **electron-donating inductive effect** _that will_ **increase the availability of the lone pair of electrons** _on N for donation to an acid._

_Hence, the_ **greater the number of alkyl groups**_, the_ **more basic** _will be the alkylamine._

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:7]

**Case 3 (Steric effect of substituents on N)**

_Why is this so?_

The 3 bulky groups on N atom will hinder donation of its lone pair of electrons to the approaching acid causing it to be a very weak base.

**Case 4**

_pK\({}_{0}\) of some bases in aqueous medium:_

\begin{tabular}{|l|c|} \hline
**Amines** & _pK\({}_{0}\)_ \\ \hline
3\({}^{\circ}\) trimethylamine, (CH\({}_{3}\))N & 4.2 \\ \hline
1\({}^{\circ}\) methylamine, CH\({}_{3}\)NH\({}_{2}\) & 3.34 \\ \hline
2\({}^{\circ}\) dimethylamine, (CH\({}_{3}\))NH & 3.27 \\ \hline \end{tabular}

Relative basicity of the 3 amines in aqueous phase (compare to case 1):

**Trimethylamine (3\({}^{\circ}\)) < Methylamine (1\({}^{\circ}\)) < Dimethylamine (2\({}^{\circ}\))**

_Why is this so?_

Dimethylamine has **more methyl groups** than methylamine. Methyl group exerts an **electron-donating inductive effect** that will **increase the availability of the lone pair of electrons** on N for donation to an acid.

Hence, dimethylamine is **more basic** than methylamine.

Methylammmonium ion formed has **more N-H bonds** than trimethylammonium ion. Hence methylammonium ion can form **more hydrogen bonds** with water molecules (more **hydrated or solvated**) leading to greater stability, and so it is more easily formed than trimethylammonium ion. So methylamine is **more basic** than trimethylamine.

\begin{tabular}{|l|c|} \hline
**RNH\({}_{2}\) + H\({}_{2}\)O \(\rightleftharpoons\)** **RNH\({}_{3}^{*}\) + OH\({}^{+}\)** \\
**R\({}_{3}\)N + H\({}_{2}\)O \(\rightleftharpoons\)** **R\({}_{3}\)NH\({}^{*}\) + OH\({}^{+}\)** \\ \hline \end{tabular}

_Question 3 (SLS Quiz 2/ Q1)_

Which of the following is a weaker base than ammonia?

**A** (CH\({}_{3}\))NH **B** CH\({}_{3}\)NH\({}_{2}\) **C** CH\({}_{3}\)CH\({}_{2}\)NH\({}_{2}\) **D** C\({}_{6}\)H\({}_{5}\)NH\({}_{2}\)

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:9]

**Note:**

* Using **excess NH\({}_{3}\)** gives rise to **primary amines**.
* In reality, the amines produced will further react with HC/ produced to form **alkylammonium** salts.

Hence during preparation, a **strong base** such as NaOH is _further_ added to the alkylammonium salt to obtain the amine.

\begin{tabular}{l l l l} RNNH\({}_{2}\) + HC/ & \(\rightarrow\) & RNNH\({}_{3}\)*C/- & alkylammonium chloride \\ RNNH\({}_{3}\)* & + OH & \(\rightarrow\) & RNNH\({}_{2}\) & + H\({}_{2}\)O \\ \end{tabular}
* Using **excess halogenalkane** gives rise to **higher order amines**.

## Appendix A Appendix

### 1 Structure and Nonnegative

Amino acids are organic compounds that contain both an **acidic** carboxyl group, **(-CO\({}_{2}\)H)** and a **basic** amine group (-NH\({}_{2}\)).

Amino acids are the basic building blocks of proteins and there are a total of **20** naturally occurring \(\alpha\)-**amino acids** (i.e. 2-aminocarboxylic acid) which make up all proteins.

In \(\alpha\)-amino acids, both functional groups are attached to the same carbon atom, known as the \(\alpha\)-**carbon**.

With the exception of glycine (where the R group is an H atom), all \(\alpha\)-amino acids contain at least a chiral carbon (ie the \(\alpha\)-carbon) and consequently are optically active.

### 2 Classification of Amino Acids

The **20** naturally occurring amino acids can be classified into **4 groups** according to the **nature** of their **R** (alkyl) group.

**Neutral amino acids with non-polar (hydrophobic) R groups**

These amino acids have aliphatic or cyclic hydrocarbons, or aromatic R groups which are hydrophobic (dislike water).

**Neutral amino acids with polar (hydrophilic; like water)** R groups

These amino acids have a variety of functional groups in the R groups but all have at least one heteroatom (N, O or S). All these amino acids, except cysteine, can form intermolecular hydrogen bonding.

**C.**: **Acidic amino acids with acidic / anionic R groups at physiological pH (pH \(\approx\) 7.4)**

These amino acids contain acidic R groups which will be deprotonated at physiological pH.

**d.**: **Basic amino acids with basic / cationic R groups at physiological pH (pH \(\approx\) 7.4)**

These amino acids contain basic R groups which are protonated at physiological pH.

## 3 Model-Base Nature of Amino Acids

_Students should be able to:_

_Describe the acid/base properties of amino acids and the formation of zwitterions_

### Formation of Zwitterions and their Physical Properties

Amino acids are **ambhoteric** as they contain **acidic -CO\({}_{2}\)H** and **basic -NH\({}_{2}\)** groups which can react with each other to form zwitterions.

A zwitterion is a **dipolar ion** with **a positive and a negative charge**, and is thus **electrically neutral**.

Zwitterions are formed when the basic -NH\({}_{2}\) undergoes **internal acid-base reaction** with the acidic -CO\({}_{2}\)H group.

Solid amino acids contain zwitterions. Hence they are

(1) crystalline solids with **high melting points**.

They have **giant ionic structures** containing dipolar ions held together by **strong electrostatic forces of attraction (ionic bonds)** between oppositely charged groups. A lot of energy is needed to separate the dipolar ions leading to a high melting point.

(2) **soluble in water** but **insoluble in non-polar solvents**.

The ionic nature of amino acids allows it to attract water molecules strongly through **ion-dipole interactions**, thus releasing large amounts of hydration energy to overcome the **ionic bonds** between amino acids and the **hydrogen bonds** between water molecules.

Amino acids are insoluble in non-polar solvents as the energy released from **ion-induced dipole attractions** between the _dipolar ions_ and non-polar solvent molecules is insufficient to overcome the **ionic bonds** between the dipolar ions.

### Acid-Base Properties

_Gel Electrophoresis_ is a technique for the separation of a mixture of amino acids using an electric current. In the presence of an electric current, the amino acids will migrate towards the electrodes and the rate of movement is inversely proportional to the mass of the amino acid.

Depending on the pH of the aqueous medium, amino acids can exist as **cationic**, **zwitterionic or anionic**.

The pH at which all amino acids exist as the **zwitterions** is called the **isoelectric point (pI)**.

At pI, the amino acids will **not** migrate in the presence of an electric field as they are **electrically neutral**.

When pH < pI of an amino acid, its weakly basic -CO2- group (along with the basic R-group if any) will react with the H+ ions in the medium to form **acidic cations**.

So, the **cationic amino acid** will migrate towards the **cathode (negative electrode)** in an electric field.

When pH > pI of an amino acid, its weakly acidic -NH3+ group (along with the acidic R-group if any) will react with the OH+ ions in the medium to form the **basic anions**.

So, the **anionic amino acid** will migrate towards the **anode (positive electrode)** in an electric field.

Each amino acid has a characteristic isoelectric point. The isoelectric point can be found from its titration curve. It is related to the nature of its R group too.

Amino acids with **acidic R** groups

**pI < 7 so that only one acidic group is deprotonated for the amino acid to be zwitterionic. E.g. aspartic acid = 3.0, glutamic acid = 3.2**

Amino acid with **basic R** groups

**pI > 7 so that only one basic group is protonated for the amino acid to be zwitterionic. E.g. lysin = 9.7, arginine = 10.8**

Amino acids with **neutral R** groups

**pI = 7**

E.g. glycine = 6.0, alanine = 6.0

#### 3.2.1 Titration Curve of a Fully Protonated Neutral Amino Acid, Glycine H3N^CH2CO2H

A fully protonated glycine, Gly+ is a **dibasic** acid as it has 2 acidic groups, the **a**-**carboxylic acid** and the **protonated **a**-**amine**.

The graph below shows the titration curve when aqueous NaOH is added to a solution of H3N^CH2COOH of the same molar concentration.

There are **two equivalence points** in the titration curve since a fully protonated glycine is dibasic.

Consider a weak acid, **HA**

HA(aq) = H^(aq) + A(aq)

\(K_{a}=\frac{\text{[H^{+}][A^{-}]}}{\text{[HA]}}\)

At mid-way of titration, [HA] = [A]

\(\Rightarrow K_{a}=\text{[H^{+}]}\)

\(\Rightarrow\text{-lg}\,K_{a}=\text{-lg}\,\text{[H^{+}]}\)

\(\Rightarrow\)**pK_a = pH**

Hence, at mid-way of titration pK_a = pHWhich of the two acidic groups in the fully protonated glycine is the stronger acid, i.e. has a lower pK\({}_{\text{a}}\) value?

* Addition of OH\({}^{-}\) to the fully protonated glycine led to **neutralisation of the \(\alpha\)-carboxylic acid** rather than the protonated \(\alpha\)-amine.
* Hence the **\(\alpha\)-carboxylic acid** is **more acidic** than the **protonated \(\alpha\)-amine**, and has a lower pK\({}_{\text{a}}\) value.
* The \(\alpha\)-carboxylic acid is more acidic than protonated \(\alpha\)-amine due to **resonance stabilisation** of the carboxylate ion produced which will not be exhibited by amine.

2.2 Titration Curve of a Fully Protonated Acidic Amino Acid, Glutamic Acid H\({}_{\text{3}}\)N\({}^{\text{*}}\)CH(CH\({}_{2}\)CH\({}_{2}\)CO\({}_{2}\)H)CO\({}_{2}\)H

A fully protonated glutamic acid, Glu\({}^{+}\) is a **tribasic** acid as it has 3 acidic groups. The 3 acidic groups are the \(\alpha\)-carboxylic acid, the **alkyl-carboxylic acid** and the **protonated \(\alpha\)-amine**.

The graph below shows the titration curve when aqueous NaOH is added to a solution of Glu\({}^{+}\) of the same molar concentration.

Based on the titration curve, arrange the 3 acidic groups in order of decreasing \(K_{\text{a}}\) value:

\(\alpha\)**-carboxylic acid > alkyl-carboxylic acid > protonated \(\alpha\)-amine**

**Carboxylic acids are **more acidic** than **protonated amines** due to resonance stabilisation of the carboxylate ions produced.

The \(\alpha\)-carboxylic acid is **more acidic** than the alkyl-carboxylic acid as it is **closer** to the **positive protonated \(\alpha\)-amine** which exerts an **electron-withdrawing inductive effect**, leading to **dispersal** of negative charge on the carboxylate ion produced. Hence it is easier to be formed as it is more stable.

As expected, there are **3** equivalence points.

From the graph, what is the approximate isoelectric point of glutamic acid?

2.3 Titration Curve of a Fully Protonated Basic Amino Acid, Lysine H\({}_{3}\)N\({}^{+}\)CH(CH\({}_{2}\)(CH\({}_{2}\))\({}_{3}\)nh\({}_{3}\))CO\({}_{2}\)H

A fully protonated lysine, Lys\({}^{2+}\) is **tribasic** as it has 3 acidic groups, namely the \(\alpha\)-**carboxylic acid**, the **protonated \(\alpha\)-amine** and the **protonated alkyl-amine**.

Below is the titration curve obtained on addition of aqueous NaOH to a solution of Lys\({}^{2+}\) of the same molar concentration.

Based on the titration curve, arrange the 3 acidic groups in order of decreasing \(K_{n}\) value:

\(\alpha\)-**carboxylic acid > protonated \(\alpha\)-amine > protonated alkyl-amine**

\(H_{3}\)N\({}^{-}\)C\({}_{-}\)CO\({}_{2}\)

\(\Phi\)**Carboxylic acids are more acidic** than protonated amines due to resonance stabilisation of the carboxyl groups produced.

The protonated \(\alpha\)-amine group is **more acidic** than the protonated alkyl-amine as it is **closer to partially positive C in the \(\alpha\)-carboxylate** ion which exerts an **electron-withdrawing inductive effect**, leading to **intensification** of positive charge on the protonated \(\alpha\)-amine, thus destabilising it (i.e. easier for it to react).

As expected, there are **3** equivalence points.

From the graph, what is the approximate isoelectric point of lysine?................

_Students should be able to:_

Describe the hydrolysis of protein

The primary structure of amino acids in proteins can be obtained by a combination of terminal residue analysis and partial hydrolysis.

Partial hydrolysis gives fragments that still retain sequence information. When these fragments are separated and identified, the overall amino acid sequence of the protein may be deduced from overlaps of the peptide sequence, just like pieces in a jigsaw puzzle.

The peptide/amide bond can be split by **hydrolysis.**

### Acid-Base Catalysed Hydrolysis

Hydrolysis can be achieved through the use of dilute acid or alkali. Heat is needed for acidic or alkaline hydrolysis.

### Enzymatic Hydrolysis

Hydrolysis can be also be catalysed by suitable **enzymes** such as **pepsin** (in stomach) or **trypsin** (in intestine). No heat is needed.

Enzymes are more selective, giving cleavage at predictable points in the chain.

Trypsin cleaves the chain at the carboxyl groups of the basic amino acids lysine and arginine.

Chymotrypsin cleaves the chain at the carboxyl groups of the aromatic amino acids phenylalanine, tyrosine and tryptophan.

By convention, the N-terminal amino acid residue (with the _free amino group_) is written on the left side and the C-terminal amino acid residue (with the _free carboxylic acid group_) is written on the right side.
