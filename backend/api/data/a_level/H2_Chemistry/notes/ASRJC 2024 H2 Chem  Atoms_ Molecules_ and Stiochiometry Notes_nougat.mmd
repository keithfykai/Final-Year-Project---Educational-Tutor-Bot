## Introduction

Chemistry is observed all the time. The chemical reactions occurring in your brain allows you to read and understand this statement. The food you ate is now providing you with energy through chemical reactions.

In the study of Chemistry, we learn about the structure and properties of matter, its interactions and transformation. During transformation of matter, a chemical and/or physical change takes place. _Matter and energy are conserved in all of such transformations_.

In this topic, we will focus on the _stoichiometry_ - study of the quantitative relationship between the amounts of reactants and products - in chemical reactions. This key concept is an important tool for chemists in the area of food, health, medicine and engineering.

### Relative Masses of Atoms And Molecules

What do the terms _relative isotopic_, _atomic_, _molecular_ and _formula_ mass mean? Can you calculate the relative atomic mass of an element given the relative abundances of its isotopes?

### Relative Masses of Atoms

Atoms have very small masses. For example, a hydrogen atom weighs 1.66 x 10-24 g.

Instead of using their actual masses, we measure how heavy one atom is compared with another atom. The carbon-12 isotope, 12C is used as the standard of reference.

**Relative isotopic mass** of an isotope = \(\frac{\text{mass of one atom of the isotope}}{\frac{1}{12}\times\text{mass of one atom of }^{12}\text{C isotope}}\)

Example: Relative isotopic mass of 13C = 13 Relative isotopic mass of 3C_l = 37

Most elements consist of a mixture of isotopes. The average of the relative isotopic masses of the element is equal to the relative atomic mass of the element.

_Recall: Isotopes are atoms of the same element with different number of neutrons. They have identical atomic (proton) numbers but different mass numbers._

### Relative Molecular Mass and Relative Formula Mass

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|} \hline Relative molecular mass of a substance, \(M_{\text{r}}=\frac{\text{average mass of one molecule of the substance}}{\frac{1}{12}\times\text{mass of one atom of }^{12}\text{C isotope}}\) \\ \hline \end{tabular}

The relative molecular mass of a compound is also the sum of the relative atomic masses of all the atoms in a molecule of a compound.

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|} \hline Example: & \(M_{\text{r}}\) of HC\(l=1\times 1.0+1\times 35.5=36.5\) (1 d.p.) \\ & \(M_{\text{r}}\) of O\({}_{2}=2\times 16.0=32.0\) (1 d.p.) \\ \end{tabular}

For giant ionic and giant covalent compounds, they do not consist of individual molecules.

Relative formula mass, with the same symbol \(M_{\text{r}}\) is used for such substances.

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|} \hline Relative formula mass of a substance, \(M_{\text{r}}=\frac{\text{average mass of one formula unit of the substance}}{\frac{1}{12}\times\text{mass of one atom of }^{12}\text{C isotope}}\) \\ \hline \end{tabular}

Similarly, the relative formula mass of a compound is the sum of the relative atomic masses of all the atoms in one formula unit of a giant ionic/giant covalent compound.

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|} \hline Example: & \(M_{\text{r}}\) of NaCl \(l=1\times 23.0+1\times 35.5=58.5\) (1 d.p.) \\ & \(M_{\text{r}}\) of SiO\({}_{2}=1\times 28.1+2\times 16.0=60.1\) (1 d.p.) \\ \end{tabular}

Note

* Since _relative_ masses are the _ratio_ of two masses, they have _no units_.
* Relative masses are given to _1 decimal place_.
* _You will learn more about the structures of giant ionic, giant covalent compounds in the topic of Chemical Bonding._

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|} \hline \multicolumn{2}{|c|}{**Worked Example 1**} \\ \hline Natural samples of krypton consist of mixtures of isotopes in the following percentage abundances. & \\ \hline \end{tabular}

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|} \hline Relative isotopic mass & Percentage abundance (\%) \\ \hline \(80\) & \(2.6\) \\ \hline \(82\) & \(11.6\) \\ \hline \(83\) & \(11.5\) \\ \hline \(84\) & \(56.9\) \\ \hline \(86\) & \(17.4\) \\ \hline \end{tabular}

Calculate the relative atomic mass of Kr using the data above.

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|} \hline \(A_{\text{r}}\) of Kr & \(=\frac{(80\times 2.6)+(82\times 11.6)+(83\times 11.5)+(84\times 56.9)+(86\times 17.4)}{(2.6+11.6+11.5+56.9+17.4)}\) \\ & \(=\) **83.9** (1 d.p) \\ \hline \end{tabular}

2024 JCI H2 The Mole Concept, Stoichiometry & Redox Reactions 2024/ASRJC/ChemistryThe Mole, The Avogadro Constant And Molar Mass

Chemists are often interested in measuring quantities of substances. In a chemical reaction, the number of particles (atoms, ions or molecules) involved is very large; hence the'mole' is used to describe a very large number. It is just like 'pair' refers to 2 items and 'dozen' refers to 12 items.

Questions to ponder:

* _What is a mole?_
* _Is the phrase "the mass of one mole of oxygen" ambiguous? Why?_

### The Mole, The Avogadro Constant

The chemist's **unit** of amount is the mole, with symbol **mol**, is defined as such,

One **mole** contains exactly 6.02 x 10\({}^{23}\) (or Avogadro constant) elementary entities.

_An elementary entity may be an atom, a molecule, an ion, an electron, any other particle or specified group of particles._

The number of particles (denoted by **N**) in one mole of any substance is a constant, known as **Avogadro constant** (denoted by **L** or **Na**), which is equal to **6.02 x 10\({}^{23}\) mol\({}^{-1}\)**.

N = number of particles

N = number of particles

L = Avogadro's constant (mol\({}^{-1}\))

n = amount / number of moles (mol)

Example:

1 mole of \({}^{12}\)C atoms (i.e. 12 g of \({}^{12}\)C) contains 6.02 x 10\({}^{23}\)\({}^{12}\)C atoms.

1 mole of H\({}_{2}\)O molecules contains 6.02 x 10\({}^{23}\) H\({}_{2}\)O molecules which are made up of 6.02 x 10\({}^{23}\) O atoms and **2 x 6.02 x 10\({}^{23}\) H atoms.

1 mole of Na\({}_{2}\)CO\({}_{3}\) contains 6.02 x 10\({}^{23}\) CO\({}_{3}\)\({}^{-}\) ions and **2 x 6.02 x 10\({}^{23}\) Na\({}^{+}\)** ions.

### _Molar Mass_

* The mass of one mole of a substance is called the **molar mass** (unit: g mol\({}^{-1}\)).
* Molar mass of a substance is **numerically equal** to the relative atomic mass, \(A_{t}\), relative molecular mass or relative formula mass, \(M_{t}\) of the substance.

**Worked Example 2**

What is the mass of 0.3 mol of CuSO\({}_{4}\).5H\({}_{2}\)O?

5 moles of water

\(M_{t}\) of CuSO\({}_{4}\).5H\({}_{2}\)O = 63.5 + 32.1 + (4 x 16.0) + (5 x 18.0) = 249.6

mass of 0.3 mol of CuSO\({}_{4}\).5H\({}_{2}\)O = 0.3 x 249.6 = 74.9 **q**

**Checkpoint 2**

1. How many moles of H\({}_{2}\)O molecules are there in 25 g of CuSO\({}_{4}\).5H\({}_{2}\)O?

n(CuSO\({}_{4}\).5H\({}_{2}\)O) in 25 g =

n(H\({}_{2}\)O) =

2. How many copper atoms are there in 6.24 g of CuSO\({}_{4}\).5H\({}_{2}\)O?

n(CuSO\({}_{4}\).5H\({}_{2}\)O) in 6.24 g =

n(Cu atoms) = n(CuSO\({}_{4}\).5H\({}_{2}\)O) =

number of Cu atoms =

3. How many oxygen atoms are there in 0.1 mol of CuSO\({}_{4}\).5H\({}_{2}\)O?

n(O atoms) =

number of O atoms =

Answers: Q1) 0.501 mol Q2) 1.51 x 10\({}^{22}\) Q3) 5.42 x 10\({}^{23}\)

## 3 **Stoichiometry**

**Stoichiometry** refers to the relationship (usually specified by the mole ratio) between the amounts of reactants and products involved in a chemical reaction. A reaction is stoichiometric if it proceeds exactly as in the balanced equation.

Questions to ponder:

* _What is the significance of a balanced equation?_
* _How do you determine the amount of reactants and products in a chemical reaction?_

### **Balancing Chemical Equations (Self-directed learning)**

Before understanding and applying stoichiometry, a chemical equation must be constructed. A chemical equation is a statement in formulas that expresses the identities and quantities of substances involved in a chemical or physical change.

In a chemical process, **atoms cannot be created, destroyed or changed.** Atoms can only be arranged into different combinations. Hence, **the number of atoms on left hand side of equation must equal to the number of atoms on right hand side of equation.

**Writing Balanced equations**

**Step 1:**: Translate the statement/phenomenon.

**Step 2:**: Balance the atoms. Start with the most complex substance, and end with the least complex substance (i.e. an element by itself)

**Step 3:**: Adjust balancing (stoichiometric) coefficients.** The smallest whole-number coefficients are preferred, unless the equations need to fulfill other functions (such as describing a specific definition e.g. enthalpy change).

**Step 4:**: Checking to ensure balancing of atoms on the left and right side of the equation (Mass Balance).

**Step 5:**: Specify the states of matter. The abbreviations are solid (s), liquid (l), gas (g) and aqueous solution (aq). (Note: only if specified by the question)

**Worked Example 3**

Magnesium burned in air to produce white magnesium oxide.

**Step 1:**: Translate the statement/phenomenon.

**Step 2:**: Balance the atoms.

**Mg + \(\_\) O\({}_{2}\)**\(\rightarrow\)**\(\underline{1}\) MgO

1 Mg + \(\_\) O\({}_{2}\)**\(\rightarrow\)**\(\underline{1}\) MgO

1 Mg + \(\_\) O\({}_{2}\)**\(\rightarrow\)**\(\underline{1}\) MgO

1 Mg + \(\_\) O\({}_{2}\)**\(\rightarrow\)**\(\underline{1}\) MgO

**Step 3:**: Adjust balancing (stoichiometric) coefficients.

(x2) 1 Mg + \(\_\) O\({}_{2}\)**\(\rightarrow\)**\(\underline{1}\) MgO

2 Mg + \(\_\) O\({}_{2}\)**\(\rightarrow\)**\(\underline{2}\) MgO

**Step 4:**: Checking (Mass Balance)

**Step 5:**: Specify the states of matter (if specified by question).

**Answer:**: 2 Mg (s) + O\({}_{2}\)**(g)**\(\rightarrow\)**\(\underline{2}\) MgO (s)

### _Stoichiometry involving Gases_

#### 3.2.1 Relationship between the Mole and Volume of Gases

**Avogadro's Law** states that equal volumes of all gases _under the same conditions of temperature and pressure_ contain the same number of molecules/atoms (valid for gases that behave ideally).

This means that 6.02 \(\times 10^{23}\) (Avogadro number) molecules/atoms (i.e. 1 mole) of any gas will occupy the same volume under the same conditions of temperature and pressure.

**Eg.** Volume of **1 mol** (or 20.2 g) of neon (Ne) gas = **x cm\({}^{3}\)**

Volume of **1 mol** (or 2.00 g) of hydrogen (H\({}_{2}\)) gas = **x cm\({}^{3}\)**

In a chemical equation, the **mole ratio** of gases involved in the chemical reaction is the same as the **volume ratio** of the gases involved.

**Eg.** 3H\({}_{2}\)(g) + N\({}_{2}\)(g) \(\rightarrow\) 2NH\({}_{3}\)(g)

Volume ratio = mole ratio: 3H\({}_{2}\equiv\) N\({}_{2}\equiv\) 2NH\({}_{3}\)

**3** moles of H\({}_{2}\) reacts with **1** mole of N\({}_{2}\) to give **2** moles of NH\({}_{3}\).

**3y**, dm\({}^{3}\) of H\({}_{2}\) reacts with **y** dm\({}^{3}\) of N\({}_{2}\) to give **2y** dm\({}^{3}\) of NH\({}_{3}\) under the same conditions.

#### 3.2.2 **Molar Volumes of Gases**

* From Avogadro's Law, the number of moles of gas can be determined by:

**n = **V****V****m** \(\mathbf{n}\) = number of moles of gas (dm\({}^{3}\))

* **N** scan this **QR code** to watch a video on how the knowledge of molar volume of gases is needed in everyday life.

**Molar volume is the **volume** that is occupied by **1 mole of any gas**

* **At s.t.p.**

**standard temperature and pressure of 10\({}^{5}\) Pa [1 bar] and 273 K [0 \({}^{\circ}\)C]**, molar volume is **22.7 dm\({}^{3}\) mol\({}^{-1}\)**.**

* **At r.t.p**

**room temperature and pressure of 101325 Pa [1 atm] and 293 K [20 \({}^{\circ}\)C]**, molar volume is **24 dm\({}^{3}\) mol\({}^{-1}\)**.**

* **Conversion of volumes:**

* **1000 cm\({}^{3}\) = 1 dm\({}^{3}\) = 10\({}^{-3}\) m\({}^{3}\)****
* **1** \(\times\) 10\({}^{6}\) cm\({}^{3}\) = 1000 dm\({}^{3}\) = 1 m\({}^{3}\)****
* **1**

**Worked Example 4**

1. How many methane (CH\({}_{4}\)) molecules are there in 5.6 dm\({}^{3}\) of the gas at s.t.p? (Volume of 1 mol of CH\({}_{4}\) molecules (or molar volume) at s.t.p. = 22.7 dm\({}^{3}\))  n(CH\({}_{4}\)) in 5.6 dm\({}^{3}\) at s.t.p. = \(\frac{5.6}{22.7}\) = 0.2467 mol  No. of CH\({}_{4}\) molecules in 5.6 dm\({}^{3}\) at s.t.p. = n x L = 0.2467 x 6.02 x 10\({}^{23}\) = **1.49 x 10\({}^{23}\)**
2. What is the volume of 6.55 g of xenon (Xe) gas at r.t.p? n(Xe) in 6.55 g = \(\frac{6.55}{131.3}\) = 0.04989 mol (Volume of 1 mol of Xe atoms at r.t.p. = 24 dm\({}^{3}\))  Volume of Xe at r.t.p. = 0.04989 x 24 = **1.20 dm\({}^{3}\)**
3. Determine the volume ratio of 1.70 g of ammonia (NH\({}_{3}\)) gas compared to 3.01 x 10\({}^{23}\) helium (He) atoms at s.t.p. n(NH\({}_{3}\)) = \(\frac{1.70}{14.0+1.0\times 3}\)= 0.1000 mol  n(He) = \(\frac{3.01\times 10^{23}}{6.02\times 10^{23}}\)= 0.5000 mol  Mole ratio: NH\({}_{3}\) \(\equiv\) He 0.1000 \(\equiv\) 0.5000 1 \(\equiv\) 5 Volume ratio of NH\({}_{3}\) to He = **1 : 5**

**Checkpoint 3**

n(O\({}_{2}\)) required =

volume of O\({}_{2}\) at s.t.p. =

Answer: 1) 1.52 x 10\({}^{4}\) cm\({}^{3}\); 2) 68.1 dm\({}^{3}\)

* General steps in solving problems involving chemical reactions.

**Worked Example 5**

* Barium carbonate (BaCO\({}_{3}\)) decomposes to form barium oxide (BaO) and carbon dioxide gas. What mass of barium oxide would be formed from decomposing 39.4 g of barium carbonate?

**Step 1: Write a balanced chemical equation for the reaction.**

**Step 2: Determine the mole ratio involved in the reaction.**

* Mole ratio: BaCO\({}_{3}\) \(\equiv\) BaO

**Step 3: Work out the answer based on stoichiometry.**

* Always use mole ratio to perform calculations and **not mass ratio**.**

* n(BaCO\({}_{3}\)) in 39.4 g = \(\frac{39.4}{137.3+12.0+16.0\times 3}\) = 0.2000 mol

### Theoretical, Experimental and Percentage Yield

* The **theoretical yield** of a product is the maximum amount of substance that can be obtained by a chemical reaction from the given amount of reactants. It is obtained by calculations.
* The **experimental yield** of a product is the amount of substance that can be obtained by a chemical reaction from the given amount of reactants under stated conditions. It is obtained only by experiments. It should be smaller than the theoretical yield.

Percentage Yield (%)=

## 4 Empirical and Molecular Formulae

* _What are the definitions of empirical and molecular formula?_
* _Is empirical formula always the same as molecular formula?_
* _How do we determine empirical and molecular formula using combustion data or composition by mass?_

The empirical formula is the _simplest_ formula that shows the relative number of atoms of each element present in a compound.

The molecular formula shows the _actual number_ of atoms of each element present in one molecule of the compound.

**Note:**

The molecular formula may be the same as the empirical formula or is an integral multiple of it.

### Determination of Empirical and Molecular Formulae using Composition by Mass

**Worked Example 8**

A hydrocarbon is found to contain 85.72% carbon and its relative molecular mass is 28.0. Calculate the empirical and molecular formula of the hydrocarbon.

\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|c|} \hline \multicolumn{1}{|c|}{_To find an empirical formula, you need to work out the ratio of the amounts (in moles) of atoms of each element present._} & \multicolumn{1}{|c|}{**C**} & \multicolumn{1}{|c|}{**H**} \\ \cline{3-5} \multicolumn{1}{|c|}{} & Mass (\%) & \multicolumn{1}{|c|}{} & Mass (\%) & \multicolumn{1}{|c|}{} \\ \multicolumn{1}{|c|}{} & Mass (assuming 100 g sample) & \multicolumn{1}{|c|}{85.72} & \multicolumn{1}{|c|}{14.28} \\ \cline{3-5} \multicolumn{1}{|c|}{} & Mass (assuming 100 g sample) & \multicolumn{1}{|c|}{85.72} & \multicolumn{1}{|c|}{14.28} \\ \cline{3-5} \multicolumn{1}{|c|}{} & Amount (mol) & \multicolumn{1}{|c|}{} & \multicolumn{1}{|c|}{} & \multicolumn{1}{|c|}{} \\ \cline{3-5} \multicolumn{1}{|c|}{} & Amount (mol) & \multicolumn{1}{|c|}{} & \multicolumn{1}{|c|}{} & \multicolumn{1}{|c|}{} & \multicolumn{1}{|c|}{} \\ \cline{3-5} \multicolumn{1}{|c|}{} & (i.e. mass/A) & \multicolumn{1}{|c|}{12.0} & \multicolumn{1}{|c|}{14.28} & \multicolumn{1}{|c|}{14.28} \\ \cline{3-5} \multicolumn{1}{|c|}{} & simplest ratio & \multicolumn{1}{|c|}{1} & \multicolumn{1}{|c|}{} & \multicolumn{1}{|c|}{} \\ \cline{3-5} \multicolumn{1}{|c|}{} & \(\therefore\) empirical formula is \(\mathbf{CH_{2}}\). & & & \\ \hline \multicolumn{1}{|c|}{_Molecular formula is an integral multiple of the empirical formula._} & \multicolumn{1}{|c|}{Let the molecular formula be (CH\({}_{2}\))\({}_{n}\)} & \multicolumn{1}{|c|}{\(M\) = n(12.0 + 2 x 1.0) = 28.0 \(\Rightarrow\) 14n = 28} & \multicolumn{1}{|c|}{\(\Rightarrow\) n = 2} \\ \cline{3-5} \multicolumn{1}{|c|}{} & \(\therefore\) molecular formula is \(\mathbf{C_{2}H_{4}}\). & & & \\ \hline \end{tabular}

**Note:**

From the formula of the compound, and the relative atomic masses of the elements in it, the percentage composition by mass of each element in the compound can be calculated.

### Determination of Molecular Formula using Combustion Data

* Sometimes, the molecular formula of a gaseous hydrocarbon, C\({}_{x}\)H\({}_{y}\), can also be determined if the volumes of the gases at each stage can be found. The following general chemical equation may be applied when the gaseous hydrocarbon is completely burnt in excess oxygen (and cooled to T \(<\) 100 \({}^{\circ}\)C) 

**Note:**

(x + \(\frac{Y}{4}\)) O\({}_{2}\) in the above equation represents the reacted oxygen.

Since excess oxygen is used for combustion, some unreacted oxygen will be left.

If the organic compound contains C, H and O, CO\({}_{2}\) and H\({}_{2}\)O will be formed upon complete combustion.

If there is incomplete combustion, other carbon containing product e.g C and CO may be formed.

**Worked Example 11**

15 cm\({}^{3}\) of a gaseous hydrocarbon were mixed with 90 cm\({}^{3}\) of oxygen and exploded. After cooling to room temperature, the residual gas occupied a volume of 75 cm\({}^{3}\) and after passing through an alkali, the volume was reduced to 45 cm\({}^{3}\). Explain the function of the alkali and determine the molecular formula of the hydrocarbon.

**Function of alkali: to absorb the acidic CO\({}_{2}\)**

Chemical equation: C\({}_{x}\)H\({}_{y}\) (g) + (x + \(\frac{Y}{4}\) ) O\({}_{2}\) (g) \(\rightarrow\) x CO\({}_{2}\) (g) + \(\frac{Y}{2}\) H\({}_{2}\)O (l)

15 cm\({}^{3}\) 45 cm\({}^{3}\) 30 cm\({}^{3}\) liquid

Vresidual gas (CO\({}_{2}\) and unused O\({}_{2}\)) = 75 cm\({}^{3}\)

V\({}_{CO_{2}}\) produced = 75 - 45 = 30 cm\({}^{3}\) V\({}_{O_{2}}\) reacted = 90 - 45 = 45 cm\({}^{3}\)

By Avogadro's Law: **volume ratio = mole ratio**

\(\frac{n_{CO_{2}}}{n_{C_{x}H_{y}}}\)\(=\)\(\frac{V_{CO_{2}}}{V_{C_{x}H_{y}}}\)

\(\frac{x}{1}\)\(=\)\(\frac{30}{15}\)\(\rightarrow\)\(x\)\(=\)\(2\)

\(\frac{n_{O_{2}}}{n_{C_{x}H_{y}}}\)\(=\)\(\frac{V_{O_{2}}}{V_{C_{x}H_{y}}}\)

\(\frac{x}{1}\)\(=\)\(\frac{45}{15}\)\(\rightarrow\)\(y\)\(=\)\(4\)Molecular formula of hydrocarbon: C\({}_{2}\)H\({}_{4}\)

**Checkpoint 7**

10 cm\({}^{3}\) of a gaseous hydrocarbon were mixed with 100 cm\({}^{3}\) of oxygen and exploded. After cooling to room temperature, the residual gas occupied a volume of 80 cm\({}^{3}\) and after passing through aqueous potassium hydroxide, a reduction of 30 cm\({}^{3}\) in gaseous volume was noted. Determine the molecular formula of the hydrocarbon.

\[\begin{array}{ccccc}\text{C}_{x}\text{H}_{y}&+&\left(\text{x}+\frac{\text{y}}{ 4}\right)\text{O}_{2}&\rightarrow&\text{x}\text{CO}_{2}&+&\frac{\text{y}}{ \text{z}}\text{H}_{2}\text{O}\\ \\ \text{V}_{\text{residual gas (CO}_{2}\text{ and unused }\text{O}_{2})}^{=}\\ \text{V}_{\text{CO}_{2}\text{ produced}}=\\ \text{V}_{\text{unused }\text{O}_{2}}=\\ \text{V}_{\text{reacted }\text{O}_{2}}^{=}\end{array}\]

By Avogadro's Law: **volume ratio = mole ratio**

\[\begin{array}{ccccc}\frac{n_{\text{CO}_{2}}}{n_{\text{Ca}\text{H}_{y}}}= \frac{\text{V}_{\text{CO}_{2}}}{\text{V}_{\text{Ca}\text{H}_{y}}}&\Rightarrow& \frac{\text{x}}{\text{i}}=\frac{30}{10}&\Rightarrow\text{x}=3\\ \frac{n_{\text{O}_{2}}}{n_{\text{Ca}\text{H}_{y}}}=\frac{\text{V}_{\text{CO}_ {2}}}{\text{V}_{\text{Ca}\text{H}_{y}}}&\Rightarrow&\end{array}\]

Molecular formula of hydrocarbon:

* Empirical formulae can be determined from combustion data, especially for organic compounds. In the case of _complete_ combustion of one mole of any hydrocarbon (i.e. an organic compound containing only carbon and hydrogen) with oxygen, CO\({}_{2}\) and H\({}_{2}\)O will be formed.

**Worked Example 12 (self-read)**

A 1.500 g sample of an organic compound containing only C, H and O was burned completely. The only combustion products were 1.738 g carbon dioxide and 0.715 g water. What would be its empirical formula?

\[\begin{array}{ccccc}\text{n(CO}_{2}\text{) in 1.738 g}=\frac{1.738}{44.0}=0.03950\text{ mol}\\ \text{Since CO}_{2}\equiv\text{C}\\ \text{n(C) in 1.738 g}=0.03950\text{ mol}\\ \text{mass of C in 1.500 g compound}=0.03950\text{ x 12.0}=\textbf{0.4740 g}\\ \\ \text{n(H}_{2}\text{O) in 0.715 g}=\frac{0.715}{18.0}=0.03972\text{ mol}\\ \text{Since H}_{2}\text{O}\equiv\text{2H}\\ \text{n(H) in 0.715 g}=0.03972\text{ x 2}=0.07944\text{ mol}\\ \text{mass of H in 1.500 g}=0.07944\text{ x 1.0}=\textbf{0.07944 g}\\ \text{mass of O in 1.500 g}=1.500-0.4740-0.07944=\textbf{0.9466 g}\\ \end{array}\]
On: What do you need to consider when choosing a suitable gas collection method?

Ans: The method used to collect and measure the volume of gas evolved depends on several factors such as the **solubility of the gas in water** and the **volume of gas expected**.

On: What other considerations do you need to take to ensure reliability of the volume measured?

Ans: The gas collected must be left to **equilibrate** to standard conditions (298 K and 1 bar) before recording the volume collected.

## 5 Volumetric Analysis

### Theory of Volumetric Analysis

**Volumetric analysis** or **titration** is a method of quantitative analysis which depends on the accurate measurement of volumes of two reacting solutions.

A measured volume of one solution placed in a conical flask (also known as analyte) and a second solution (also known as titrant) added bit by bit from a burette until the reaction is complete. The two solutions (**A** and **B**) have such characteristics.

* Solution **A**: **Standard** solution whose concentration is **accurately known** (usually known as the titrant).
* Solution **B**: **Unknown** concentration (usually known as the analyte).
* Once the two solutions have reacted in **stoichiometric amounts**, the solution undergoes a **colour change**. (In some reactions, the change in colour can be detected using a suitable indicator)

There are essentially four types of reactions that can be analysed using titrations:

* **Acid-base reaction**: involves the neutralisation of a base with an acid.

* **Arrhenius theory of acids and bases** An **Arrhenius acid** is a substance that **releases H+ ions** and an **Arrhenius base** is a substance that **releases OH** when they are dissolved in water.

* **Redox reaction**: involves the transfer of electrons from a reducing agent to an oxidising agent.
* **Precipitation**: involves the formation of an insoluble salt.
* **Complexation reaction:** involves the reaction between a metal ion and ligand to form a complex.

* **Note:**

* _For acid-base titrations_,
* 3 drops of indicator is usually sufficient for an acid-base titration.

* **For redox titrations (to be discussed later),*
* For all manganate(VII) titrations, an acid is added in excess. No indicator is required. (_refer to pg 44_)
* For iodometric titrations, I2(aq) is titrated against Na2S2O3(aq) until the solution changes from brown to pale yellow. 1 cm3 of starch solution (the indicator) is then added which gives an intense dark blue-black colour. After which, the titration is continued until the blue-black colouration disappears. (_refer to pg 47_)

### Solutions and Standard solutions

* A _standard solution_ is a solution of _known_ concentration. It can be prepared from \(\circ\) a **solid** (of known mass) or \(\circ\) a **solution** (of known concentration).
* A **standard flask** (also called volumetric flask or graduated flask) is used to prepare a standard solution.
* The **concentration** of a solution is measured in terms of the amount of solute (in g or mol) contained in a given volume of solution.

Concentration \(\left(\text{g dm}^{3}\right)\) = \(\dfrac{\text{mass of solute }\left(\text{g}\right)}{\text{volume of solution }\left(\text{dm}^{3}\right)}\) 1000 cm\({}^{3}\) 1 dm\({}^{3}\) 1000 cm\({}^{3}\) 1 dm\({}^{3}\) 1 1 10\({}^{6}\) cm\({}^{3}\) = 1000 dm\({}^{3}\) = 1 m\({}^{3}\) 1
* Relationship between concentrations in mol dm\({}^{-3}\) and g dm\({}^{-3}\): Concentration in g dm\({}^{-3}\) = Concentration (mol dm\({}^{-3}\)) \(\times\) molar mass (g mol\({}^{-1}\))

### Dilution and Sampling

* **Dilution** is the process of adding solvent (e.g. water) to a known volume of the solution.
* **Concentration of solute decreases** but amount of solute (mol) is unchanged.

* **Amount of solute in original solution** = **CaVa** = **CaVa** where **Ca: original concentration** **Va: original volume** **Ca: diluted concentration** **Va: diluted volume** **Note:**Va** is the diluted volume or final volume**, NOT the volume of water to be added to the original solution.
* **Example:** Determine the concentration of the diluted solution as prepared below.
* **Sampling** is the process of extraction a small portion of the solution for analysis. This portion that is sampled will have the same concentration but containing a different amount of solute.
* **Sampled amount (mol) = **Volume of portion sampled** \(\times\)**Original Amount (mol) Original Volume** Example: Given a 250 cm**\({}^{3}\) **solution containing 0.10 mol of hydrochloric acid, calculate the amount of hydrochloric acid present when 25 cm**\({}^{3}\) **is extracted from the beaker?** **n = 7???** **V = 250 cm**\({}^{3}\) **n (HC_I_) in 25 cm**\({}^{3}\) **extracted sample = (25/250) x 0.10 = 0.0100 mol**2024/ASRJC/Chemistry

**Checkpoint 8**

1. 2.50 g of a mixture of anhydrous sodium carbonate (Na\({}_{2}\)CO\({}_{3}\)) and sodium chloride (NaCI) were made up to 250 cm\({}^{3}\) with distilled water. 25.0 cm\({}^{3}\) of this solution required 20.00 cm\({}^{3}\) of 0.100 mol dm\({}^{-3}\) hydrochloric acid (HCI) for titration. Calculate the percentage by mass of sodium chloride in the anhydrous mixture.

**Step 1**: Write the balanced chemical equation for the reaction.

Chemical equation:

Na\({}_{2}\)CO\({}_{3}\)(aq) + 2HCl (aq) \(\rightarrow\) 2NaCl (aq) + CO\({}_{2}\)(g) + H\({}_{2}\)O(I)

**Step 2**: Determine the mole ratio involved.

Male ratio: Na\({}_{2}\)CO\({}_{3}\)\(\equiv\)HCI

**Step 3**: Work out the answer based on stoichiometry.

n(HCI) in 20.00 cm\({}^{3}\) =

n(Na\({}_{2}\)CO\({}_{3}\)) in 25.0 cm\({}^{3}\) =

mass of NaCl/ in 2.50 g mixture =

Percentage by mass of NaCl in mixture =

Answer: 57.6%1.250 g of concentrated sulfuric acid were made up to 250 cm\({}^{3}\). 25.0 cm\({}^{3}\) of this solution were neutralised by 24.85 cm\({}^{3}\) of 0.10 mol dm\({}^{-3}\) sodium hydroxide. Calculate the percentage purity of the concentrated sulfuric acid.

\begin{tabular}{l l} Chemical Equation: & NaOH + & H\({}_{2}\)SO\({}_{4}\) \(\rightarrow\) \\ n(NaOH) used & = 0.10 x \(\frac{24.85}{1000}\) \\  & = 2.485 x 10\({}^{-3}\) mol \\ n(H\({}_{2}\)SO\({}_{4}\)) in 25 cm\({}^{3}\) & = \\  & = 1.243 x 10\({}^{-3}\) mol \\ n(H\({}_{2}\)SO\({}_{4}\)) in 250 cm\({}^{3}\) & = \\ mass of H\({}_{2}\)SO\({}_{4}\) in 250 cm\({}^{3}\) = \\  & = \\ \% purity of H\({}_{2}\)SO\({}_{4}\) = \\  & = **97.5 \%** \\ \end{tabular}

### Back titration

Back titrations are used in cases where a direct titration is **not** possible, due to one of the reactants being an **insoluble solid**, **slow reaction between reactants**, **end-point is not distinct and sharp**, or a **lack of a suitable indicator** for the titration.

For example, calcium carbonate, being insoluble in water, reacts slowly with acid. As a result, there is no sharp end-point if titrated with an acid directly.

This problem is overcome by **back titration** via the following steps:

1) Add **known amount of acid (added in excess)** to dissolve calcium carbonate, CaCO\({}_{3}\).
2) The amount of **unreacted acid** (acid that did not react with CaCO\({}_{3}\)) can be found by titrating it with a soluble base such as sodium hydroxide.
3) The amount of acid that reacted with CaCO\({}_{3}\) is the **amount of acid added in (1) minus the amount of unreacted acid** **amount (in mol) of acid reacted with CaCO\({}_{3}=x-y\)** (This amt. can be determined by titration with NaOH in step (2))
4) The amount of CaCO\({}_{3}\) present can then be calculated based on stoichiometry for the reaction between CaCO\({}_{3}\) and acid.

**Worked Example 15 (self-read)**

1. To 25.0 cm\({}^{3}\) of a solution of magnesium hydroxide Mg(OH)\({}_{2}\), 50.00 cm\({}^{3}\) of 0.500 mol dm\({}^{-3}\) hydrochloric acid were added. The resulting solution required 22.30 cm\({}^{3}\) of 0.250 mol dm\({}^{-3}\) potassium hydroxide for neutralisation. Calculate the concentration of magnesium hydroxide solution in mol dm\({}^{-3}\).

**Step 1:** Write the balanced chemical equations for the reactions.

Chemical equations:

\[\begin{array}{l}\text{Mg(OH)}_{2}\text{(aq)}+\text{2HCl(aq)}_{\text{reacted}} \rightarrow\text{MgCl}_{2}\text{(aq)}+\text{2H}_{2}\text{O($l$)}\quad\text{------(1)}\\ \text{KOH(aq)}+\text{HCl(aq)}_{\text{remaining}}\rightarrow\text{KCl(aq)}+ \text{H}_{2}\text{O($l$)}\quad\text{------(2)}\end{array}\]

**Step 2:** Determine the mole ratio involved.

Mole ratio: \(\text{Mg(OH)}_{2}\equiv\text{2HCl}_{\text{reacted}}\)

KOH \(\equiv\text{HCl}_{\text{remaining}}\)

_from (1)_

_from (2)_

**Step 3:** Determine the amount of the reactant remaining after reaction by titration with the standard reagent.

n(KOH) in 22.30 cm\({}^{3}\) = (22.30 / 1000) x 0.250 = 0.005575 mol

_remaining n(HCI)_ for titration with KOH = 0.005575 mol

_initial n(HCI)_ in 50.00 cm\({}^{3}\) = (50/1000) x 0.500 = 0.02500 mol

**n(HCI) reacted with Mg(OH)\({}_{2}\)**: = _initial n(HCI) - remaining n(HCI)_

= 0.02500 - 0.005575

= 0.019425 mol

**Step 4:** Work out the answer based on stoichiometry.

n(Mg(OH)\({}_{2}\)) in 25.0 cm\({}^{3}\) = 0.019425 \(\div\) 2 = 0.0097125 mol

[Mg(OH)\({}_{2}\)] = \(\frac{0.0097125}{\frac{250}{1000}}\)= **0.389 mol dm\({}^{-3}\)**

#### 6.2.1 Definition of Oxidation Number

Each atom in a molecule (or ionic compound) is assigned an _oxidation number_ or _oxidation state_, which is the charge the atom would have _if_ electrons were not shared but were transferred completely. Note that an oxidation number contains _both the sign_ and the number. The '+' and '-' signs must be indicated _before_ the number.

All atoms in elements, ions/compounds can be assigned an oxidation number according to a set of rules as shown in **6.2.2**.

#### 6.2.2 Rules for Assigning Oxidation Number (O.N.)

The oxidation number of an atom in its **elemental state** is **zero**.

e.g. **0** in Fe **0** in O\({}_{2}\) **0** in P\({}_{4}\)

The oxidation number of any **monoatomic ion** is equal to the **charge on the ion**.

e.g. **-2** in O\({}^{2}\)- **-1** in F- **+3** in Al\({}^{3*}\) **+2** in Fe\({}^{2*}\)

The **algebraic sum** of the oxidation numbers of all atoms in a **neutral (uncharged) compound** must be **zero**.

1. Mass balance: The number of atoms on left hand side of equation must equal to the number of atoms on right hand side of equation.
2. Charge balance: The sum of the charges on left hand side of equation must equal to the sum of the charges on right hand side of equation.
3. Number of electrons lost = number of electrons gained

Two methods used to balance redox equations are the _oxidation number method_ and the _half-equation method_.

#### 6.5.1 The oxidation number method

* This method consists of five steps that use the changes in oxidation numbers to generate balancing coefficients.

\begin{tabular}{|p{142.3pt}|p{142.3pt}|} \hline
**Steps** & \multicolumn{2}{c|}{Example} \\ \multicolumn{2}{c|}{_Use the oxidation number method to balance the following equation: CU + HNO\({}_{3}\) \(\rightarrow\) Cu(NO\({}_{3}\))\({}_{2}\) + NO\({}_{2}\) + H\({}_{2}\)O_} \\ \hline
1. Assign oxidation numbers to all elements in the reaction & 0 +1 -2 +2 +5 -2 -2 +1 -2 Cu Cu + HNO\({}_{3}\) \(\rightarrow\) Cu(NO\({}_{3}\))\({}_{2}\) + NO\({}_{2}\) + H\({}_{2}\)O \\ \hline
2. From the changes in oxidation numbers, identify the species being oxidised and reduced respectively & Cu was oxidised: the O.N. of Cu increased from 0 (in Cu metal) to +2 (in Cu\({}^{2+}\)) HNO\({}_{3}\) was reduced: the O.N. of N decreased from +5 (in HNO\({}_{3}\)) to +4 (in NO\({}_{2}\)) \\ \hline
3. Compute the number of electrons lost in the oxidation and gained in the reduction from the oxidation number changes & Cu + HNO\({}_{3}\) \(\rightarrow\) Cu(NO\({}_{3}\))\({}_{2}\) + NO\({}_{2}\) + H\({}_{2}\)O \\ \hline
4. Multiply one or both of these numbers by appropriate factors to make the _number of electrons lost equal the number of electrons gained_, and use the factors as balancing coefficients & Cu lost 2e-, so the 1e- gained by N should be multiplied by 2. We put the coefficient 2 before NO\({}_{2}\) and HNO\({}_{3}\): Cu + 2 HNO\({}_{3}\) \(\rightarrow\) Cu(NO\({}_{3}\))\({}_{2}\) + 2NO\({}_{2}\) + H\({}_{2}\)O \\ \hline
5. Complete the balancing by inspection, if necessary & Balancing N atoms requires a 4 in front of HNO\({}_{3}\) because two additional N atoms are in the NO\({}_{3}\)-ions in Cu(NO\({}_{3}\))\({}_{2}\): Cu + 4 HNO\({}_{3}\) \(\rightarrow\) Cu(NO\({}_{3}\))\({}_{2}\) + 2NO\({}_{2}\) + H\({}_{2}\)O \\ \hline

**Step 2:** Multiply one or both half-equations by an integer (no. of e\({}^{-}\) lost = no. of e\({}^{-}\) gained)

**Step 3:** Combine (add) the balanced half-equations and cancel out the common terms (include state symbols if question specifies)

\begin{tabular}{l l} (3SO\({}_{2}\) + 6H\({}_{2}\)O + Cr\({}_{2}\)O\({}^{-}\)**+ 14H\({}^{+}\)**\(\rightarrow\)**3SO\({}_{4}\)\({}^{-}\)**+ 12H\({}^{+}\)**+ 2Cr\({}^{3+}\)**+ 7H\({}_{2}\)O \\ Overall: & **3SO\({}_{2}\) (g) + Cr\({}_{2}\)O\({}^{-}\)**(aq) + 2H\({}^{+}\)**(aq) \(\rightarrow\)**3SO\({}_{4}\)\({}^{2-}\)**(aq) + 2Cr\({}^{3+}\)**(aq) + H\({}_{2}\)O (I) \\ \end{tabular}

**The overall redox equation must not** contain the electron term.

**Checkpoint 14**

Hydrogen peroxide, H\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{2}\) was reduced to water when it was added to an aqueous solution of Fe\({}^{2+}\) in acidic medium. Fe\({}^{2+}\) was oxidised to Fe\({}^{3+}\). Construct the redox equation for this reaction.

Oxidation:

Since Fe\({}^{2+}\) was oxidised, H\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{2}\) will be reduced. Product is H\({}_{2}\)O.

## 7 Redox titrations

* A **redox titration** involves the **stoichiometric reaction** based on a **redox** reaction between the two solutions involved.
* Some redox titrations involving manganate(VII) and dichronate(VI) do not require the addition of an indicator to detect the end-point.

### Manganate(VII) (MnO\({}_{4}\) - Titration

* MnO\({}_{4}\) is a very strong oxidising agent and is usually placed in the burette and added into the conical flask containing the reducing agent.
* Typical reducing agents that can react with MnO\({}_{4}\) are Fe\({}^{2+}\), C\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{4}\)\({}^{-}\), H\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{2}\) and \(\Gamma\).
* titrations are usually carried out in **acidic** conditions. H\({}_{2}\)SO\({}_{4}\) is suitable to acidity it.
* as both will interfere with the experiment. HCl will be oxidised by KMnO\({}_{4}\) to give chlorine and HNO\({}_{3}\) is an oxidising agent._
* is used in the titration process. Alkaline or neutral MnO\({}_{4}\)
- is seldom used as incomplete reduction of MnO\({}_{4}\)
- occurs, causing precipitation of brown MnO\({}_{2}\).
* In **acidic medium**, the half-equation is \[\boxed{MnO_{4}^{-}+8H^{+}+5e^{-}\ \rightarrow\ Mn^{2+}+4H_{2}O}\qquad\text{ \emph{refer to Data Booklet}}\]
* itself acts as the indicator.
* turns colourless as it is reduced to Mn\({}^{2+}\) ions (colourless / pale pink)
* causes the solution in the conical flask to turn permanent pink (due to a slight excess of purple MnO\({}_{4}\) -). This sharp colour change indicates that the end-point is attained.

### Dichromate(VI) (Cr\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{7}\)\({}^{2}\)-) Titration

* Acidified Cr\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{7}\)\({}^{2}\)- (usually K\({}_{2}\)Cr\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{7}\)) is a strong oxidising agent but not as strong as MnO\({}_{4}\).
* H\({}_{2}\)SO\({}_{4}\) is a suitable acid to acidify Cr\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{7}\)\({}^{2}\)-.
* In **acidic medium**, the half-equation is 

**Worked Example 18**

A 0.1576 g piece of iron wire was converted into Fe\({}^{2+}\) ions and then titrated against acidified potassium dichromate(VI) solution of concentration 1.64 x 10-2 mol dm-3. If 27.30 cm3 of the oxidising agent was required, calculate the percentage purity of the iron wire.

Reduction: Cr\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{7}\)\({}^{2}\)- + 14H+ + 6e- \(\rightarrow\) 2Cr\({}^{3+}\) + 7H\({}_{2}\)O Oxidation: Fe\({}^{2+}\) - Fe\({}^{3+}\) + e- Overall: Cr\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{7}\)\({}^{2}\)-(aq) + 6Fe\({}^{2+}\)(aq) + 14H+(aq) \(\rightarrow\) 2Cr\({}^{3+}\)(aq) + 6Fe\({}^{3+}\)(aq) + 7H\({}_{2}\)O(\(l\))

Mole ratio: Cr\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{7}\)\({}^{2}\)\(\equiv\) 6Fe\({}^{2+}\)

n(Cr\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{7}\)\({}^{2}\)) reacted = 

n(Fe\({}^{2+}\)) reacted = 6 x 4.477 x 10-4 = 2.686 x 10-3 mol

n(Fe) = n(Fe\({}^{2+}\)) reacted = 2.686 x 10-3 mol

mass of pure Fe = 2.686 x 10-3 x 55.8 = 0.1499 g

% purity of wire = (0.1499 / 0.1576) x 100 %

= **95.1 %**

### _Isotropic Titration using Thiosulfate (S\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{3}\)\({}^{2}\))_

* This titration is used to determine the concentration of iodine or substances which liberate iodine from potassium iodide, KI, or potassium iodate(V), KIO\({}_{3}\).
* Half-equations: Oxidation: 2S\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{3}\)\({}^{2}\)\(\rightarrow\)  S\({}_{4}\)O\({}_{6}\)\({}^{2}\)\(+\) 2e\({}^{-}\)  refer to Data Booklet 

* The thiosulfate solution is usually placed in the burette and the brown iodine solution in the conical flask.
* During the titration, the thiosulfate added from the burette into the flask reduces the brown iodine (I\({}_{2}\)) solution into colourless iodide (I\({}^{-}\)) ions. The solution gradually fades to pale yellow.
* At this point, starch indicator is added into the flask. The solution turns blue-black as starch forms an intense blue-black complex with the remaining iodine.
* Titration then continues until all the iodine is used up and the colour changes from blue-black to colourless.
* Note :
* lodine is volatile and will vaporise easily at room temperature hence titration must be conducted immediately. Otherwise, cover all flasks containing iodine.
* Starch forms a blue-black water soluble complex with iodine where iodine is trapped within the starch molecules. Hence, it is important to only add starch at the end of the titration when there is a low concentration of iodine since some iodine may remain trapped in the starch even at the end-point.
* Sometimes, the blue-black colour slowly reappears after the titration as some I\({}^{-}\) ions are oxidised back to I\({}_{2}\).

**Worked Example 19**

A 15.0 cm\({}^{3}\) solution of H\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{2}\) was diluted to 1 dm\({}^{3}\). 25.0 cm\({}^{3}\) of this solution was added to excess potassium iodide and 10 cm\({}^{3}\) of dilute sulfuric acid were added to the flask. The iodine liberated was titrated using sodium thiosulfate with starch as the indicator. The end-point was reached when 20.00 cm\({}^{3}\) of 0.015 mol dm\({}^{-3}\) thiosulfate had been added.

What was the concentration of the original hydrogen peroxide solution?

**Reaction I between H\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{2}\) and excess I-**

Oxidation: 2I\({}^{-}\)\(\rightarrow\) I\({}_{2}\) + 2e\({}^{-}\)

Reduction:  H\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{2}\) + 2H\({}^{+}\) + 2e\({}^{-}\)\(\rightarrow\) 2H\({}_{2}\)O

Overall redox reaction: (1) + (2)

H\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{2}\) (aq) + 2H\({}^{+}\) (aq) + 2I\({}^{-}\) (aq) \(\rightarrow\) I\({}_{2}\) (aq) + 2H\({}_{2}\)O (\(I\))

**Reaction II between I\({}_{2}\) and S\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{2}\)\({}^{-}\)**

I\({}_{2}\) (aq) + 2S\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{3}\)\({}^{-}\) (aq) \(\rightarrow\) S\({}_{4}\)O\({}_{6}\)\({}^{2-}\) (aq) + 2I\({}^{-}\) (aq)

 mole ratio: H\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{2}\)\(\equiv\) I\({}_{2}\)\(\equiv\) 2 S\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{3}\)\({}^{-}\)

n(S\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{3}\)\({}^{-}\)) in 20.00 cm\({}^{3}\) = \(\frac{20.00}{1000}\)\(\times\) 0.015 = 3.000 \(\times\) 10\({}^{-4}\) mol

n(diluted H\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{2}\)) in 25.0 cm\({}^{3}\) = \(\frac{3.000\)\(\times 10^{-4}}{2}\)\(=\) 1.500 \(\times\) 10\({}^{-4}\) mol

n(diluted H\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{2}\)) in 1 dm\({}^{3}\) (1000 cm\({}^{3}\)) = \(\frac{1000}{25}\)\(\times\) 1.500 \(\times\) 10\({}^{-4}\)

n(6.000 \(\times\) 10\({}^{-3}\) mol

n(original H\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{2}\)) in 15 cm\({}^{3}\) = 6.000 \(\times\) 10\({}^{-3}\) mol

[H\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{2}\)] in original solution = \(\frac{6.000\)\(\times\) 10\({}^{-3}}{\frac{15.0}{1000}}\)

= **0.400 mol dm\({}^{-3}\)**

### Determination of unknown oxidation number

At times, the initial or final oxidation number of one of the species is unknown. The unknown initial or final oxidation number of **B** can be determined when a known amount of **A** (whose final and initial O.N. are known) reacts in stoichiometric amount with **B** in a redox reaction.

_Concept applied:_

**amount of electrons lost = amount of electrons gained**

**Worked Example 20**

Thallium(III) ion, T\({}^{\beta+}\) can oxidise iodide ions to I\({}_{2}\). In an experiment, 3.00 x 10\({}^{-3}\) mol of aqueous T\({}^{\beta+}\) was found to react with 30.00 cm\({}^{3}\) of 0.200 mol dm\({}^{-3}\) aqueous potassium iodide, KI. What is the oxidation number of thallium at end-point?

(I\({}^{-}\) is oxidised to I\({}_{2}\) while T\({}^{\beta+}\) is reduced; final O.N. of T\({}^{\prime}\) is unknown)

**Step 1: Calculate the amount (in moles) of each reactant**

n(T\({}^{\beta+}\)) = 3.000 x 10\({}^{-3}\) mol (given)

n(I\({}^{-}\)) in 30.00 cm\({}^{3}\) = \(\frac{30.00}{1000}\) x 0.200 = 0.006000 mol

METHOD 1 (PREFRRED METHOD)

**Step 2: Calculate the amount (in moles) of e\({}^{-}\) lost from oxidation**

2I\({}^{-}\)\(\rightarrow\) I\({}_{2}\) + 2e\({}^{-}\)

n(e\({}^{-}\)) lost from oxidation = n(I\({}^{-}\)) = 0.006000 mol

**n(e\({}^{-}\)) gained in reduction = n(e\({}^{-}\)) lost from oxidation = 0.006000 mol**

**Step 3: Derive mole ratio between e\({}^{-}\) gained (or lost) and oxidising (or reducing) agent**

\[\text{{\rm mole ratio:}}\ \ \ \frac{n(\text{e${}^{-}$ gained})}{n(\text{T${}^{\beta+}$})}=\ \frac{0.00600}{0.00300} =\frac{2}{1}\]

Therefore, T\({}^{\beta+}\) + 2e\({}^{-}\)\(\rightarrow\) T\({}^{\beta+}\)

n = 1, i.e. the final O.N. of T\({}^{\prime}\) is +1.

METHOD 2

**Step 2: Derive mole ratio between oxidising and reducing agents**

\[\text{{\rm mole ratio:}}\ \ \ \frac{n(\text{I${}^{-}$})}{n(\text{T${}^{\beta+}$})}= \ \frac{0.00600}{0.00300}=\frac{2}{1}\]

\[\text{{\rm mole ratio:}}\* **General strategy in performing mole concept calculations**
