## 1 Introduction to Carbonyl Compounds

* **Natural Occurrence*
* Carbonyl compounds are prevalent in nature. They appear as natural fragrances and flavourings, and in other naturally-occurring compounds like vitamins, hormones and carbohydrates.
* **Carbonyl compounds*
* contain the carbonyl functional group.
* **Carbonyl carbon is sp2 hybridised*
* and lies on the **same plane as the three atoms directly attached to it*
* (_i.e._ **trigonal planar*
* arrangement of atoms).
* The bond angle is approximately 120o.

* Boiling points of carbonyl compounds are **higher** than that of the **corresponding alkanes or alkenes having similar \(M_{r}\)**. Explanation: More energy is needed to overcome the **stronger permanent dipole--permanent dipole interactions between carbonyl molecules** than the **weaker instantaneous dipole-induced dipole interactions between alkane molecules** (or **alkenes**).
* Boiling points of carbonyl compounds are **lower** than that of the **corresponding alcohols or carboxylic acids** having **similar \(M_{r}\)**. Explanation: Less energy is needed to overcome the **weaker permanent dipole--permanent dipole interactions between carbonyl molecules** than the **stronger hydrogen bonds between alcohols molecules** (or **carboxylic acids**).

### Solubility

* Aldehydes and ketones with **smaller number of C atoms** such as methanal, ethanal, and propanone are **completely miscible** with water. Reason:** Aldehydes and ketones can **form hydrogen bonds with water molecules**.
* **Solubility of aldehydes/ketones in water decreases for aldehydes/ketones with larger number of C atoms**. Reason: The **larger non-polar alkyl/aryl group makes the molecule less soluble**. The **permanent dipole-induced dipole interactions** between the hydrophobic group and water molecules do not release sufficient amount of energy** to overcome the strong **hydrogen bonds** between the water molecules. In addition, the larger alkyl group also **hinders the formation of hydrogen bonds between the carbonyl functional group and water molecules**.
* **Eunoa Junior College**

**At the end of these sections, you should know that:**

* The carbonyl carbon in the aldehyde and ketone functional groups is sp\({}^{2}\) hybridised, trigonal planar shape with bond angle of 120\({}^{\circ}\).
* The lone pair of electrons on the C=O group can form hydrogen bonds with water molecules. In general, aldehydes and ketones of lower molecular weight are soluble in water.
* However, aldehydes and ketones of higher molecular weight are insoluble in water due to the presence of large hydrophobic alkyl group. Hence, they are unable form favourable interactions with water molecules.

## 5 Reactions of Carbonyl Compounds

### Oxidation

[FIGURE:S5.F1][EN

### Reduction

**Reagents and conditions:**: LiA_H_4, dry ether, r.t. **OR**

NaBH_4, ethanol, r.t. **OR**

H_2(g), Ni, r.t. **OR**

H_2(g), Pd or Pt, r.t. **Type of reaction:** Reduction

**Note:**

* LiA_H_4 must be used in dry conditions as it _reacts violently with water_: LiA_H_4 + 4H_2O_- LiOH + A_I_(OH)_3 + 4H_2
* LiA_H_4 is also _thermally unstable_ above 120 \({}^{\circ}\)C and hence, no heating_.

**Note:**

* **LiAlH\({}_{4}\) and NaBH\({}_{4}\) cannot reduce alkenes and alkynes (C=C). Both LiAlH\({}_{4}\) and NaBH\({}_{4}\) provide :H- nucleophiles which attack electron-deficient C atom of the reactant molecule. The C=C bond of alkenes and C=C bond of alkynes are electron-rich but non-polar and hence will not react with these reagents. (See Page 27 for the simplified version of the mechanism!)**

Step 1:

* **NaBH\({}_{4}\), a weaker reducing agent than LiAlH\({}_{4}\), can only reduce aldehydes and ketones.**
* **Why LiAlH\({}_{4}\) is a stronger reducing agent than NaBH\({}_{4}\)?**

As A/I is more electropositive than B, the \(\overset{\text{s-}}{\text{H}}\) bond is more polar and the H in A/H-\({}_{4}^{-}\) will have a larger partial negative charge (\(\delta\)-) and hence more nucleophilic than that in BH\({}_{4}^{-}\). Recall: the more electronegative an atom, the less likely it will share or give up electrons.

**At the end of these sections, you should know that:**

* Aldehydes can be prepared via oxidation from 1o alcohol using "K\({}_{2}\)Cr\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{7}\), H\({}_{2}\)SO\({}_{4}\), heat with **immediate distillation**" as oxidising agent.
* Aldehyde can be prepared via oxidation to carboxylic acid using "K\({}_{2}\)Cr\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{7}\), H\({}_{2}\)SO\({}_{4}\), heat or KMnO\({}_{4}\), H\({}_{2}\)SO\({}_{4}\), heat" as oxidising agent.
* Ketones can be prepared via oxidation from 2o alcohol using "K\({}_{2}\)Cr\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{7}\), H\({}_{2}\)SO\({}_{4}\), heat or KMnO\({}_{4}\), H\({}_{2}\)SO\({}_{4}\), heat" as oxidising agent.
* Aldehydes and ketones can be reduced to the respective 1o and 2o alcohols using the following reducing agengs: "LiAlH\({}_{4}\) in dry ether, r.t." or "NaBH\({}_{4}\) in ethanol, r.t." or "H\({}_{2}\) with Ni/Pt catalyst".
* **"LiAlH\({}_{4}\) in dry ether, r.t." is a stronger reducing agent than "NaBH\({}_{4}\) in ethanol, r.t." because only "LiAlH\({}_{4}\) in dry ether, r.t." can reduce carboxylic acids.**

### Nucleophilic Addition Reactions

* Due to the high electronegative of the O atom, and contribution of the dipolar resonance structure, the C=O bond of the carbonyl group is **highly polar**. The **partially positive carbonyl C atom (C3+)** acts as an **electron-deficient site**, which will be **attacked by a nucleophile**.
* Since the C of C=O is **unsaturated**, it can undergo **addition reaction** readily. Hence, carbonyl compounds (_i.e._ aldehydes & ketones) undergo **nucleophilic addition**.

LO (c) explain the differences in reactivity between carbonyl compounds and alkenes towards nucleophilic reagents, such as lithium aluminium hydride and hydrogen cyanide

**At the end of these sections, you should know that:**

Aldehydes are more susceptible to nucleophilic addition than ketones because the carbonyl carbonyl carbon of aldehydes are more electron-deficient and experiences less steric hindrance when undergoing nucleophilic attack.

A racemic mixture can result from the nucleophilic addition of an aldehyde or an asymmetrical ketone.

### Reaction with Fehling's Solution

Identification Test for Aliphatic Aldehydes

Balanced equation:

**Note:**

1) Fehling's solution is an _alkaline Cu\({}^{2+}\) complex_ which is _deep blue_ in colour.

2) This is a _redox_ reaction since _aldehyde is oxidised_ to carboxylic acid while the _Cu\({}^{2+}\) complex in the Fehling's solution is reduced_ to Cu\({}_{2}\)O(s) (_i.e._ O.N. of Cu decreases from **+2** in deep blue Cu\({}^{2+}\) complex to **+1** in brick-red Cu\({}_{2}\)O(s)).

The carboxylic acid formed then _undergoes acid-base_ reaction with the base in the mixture.

**Fehling's solution is always freshly prepared in laboratory. It is made initially as two separate solutions, known as Fehling's A and Fehling's B.**

**Fehling's A: blue solution of CuSO\({}_{4}\)**

**Fehling's B: colourless solution of potassium sodium tartrate (_i.e._ Rochelle salt) and strong alkali (e.g. NaOH(aq)).**

**Equal volumes of two solutions are mixed to get the final deep blue Fehling's solution.**
