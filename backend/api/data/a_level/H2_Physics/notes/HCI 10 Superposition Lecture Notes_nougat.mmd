### Introduction

In your secondary schools, you have seen that all waves exhibit _reflection_ and _refraction_.

For the A-levels, we extend our understanding of waves by looking at two other phenomena that are exhibited by waves: _interference_ and _diffraction_.

We will learn about _Young's double slit experiment_, _the measurement of wavelengths_ of light and sound, and the formation of musical notes in strings and woodwind instruments through the formation of _stationary waves_.

### Principle of Superposition

Imagine throwing two pebbles into a still pond. Each pebble makes its own ripples and as the ripples spread out, they kind of overlap. What determines the resultant "ripple" that we see?

The **displacement** of the resultant wave is determined by the **Principle of Superposition**:

_Principle of Superposition:_

The principle of superposition states that **when two or more waves of the same kind overlap**, the **resultant displacement** at any point at any instant is given by the **vector sum of the individual displacements** that each individual wave would cause at that point at that instant.

\[y_{resultant}=y_{1}+y_{2}+y_{3}+....+y_{N}\]

where \(y_{resultant}\)is the displacement of the resultant wave and \(y_{1}\), \(y_{2}\),..., \(y_{N}\) are the individual displacements of the waves at the point of consideration.

The statement of the Principle of Superposition is a popular exam question. Be careful to use the word "**displacement**" and not "amplitude" in your statement.

Fig. 10.2.1 and 10.2.2 are pictorial representations of the superposition of two wave pulses, \(y_{1}\) and \(y_{2}\), travelling in opposite directions. When the waves begin to overlap, the resultant displacement of the waveform on the string at every point at any time is given by \(y_{1}+y_{2}\).

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:5]

Note that when interference is neither fully constructive nor fully destructive, it is called _intermediate interference_ or _partially constructive or destructive interference_. The amplitude of the resultant waveform will be between the maximum and minimum amplitudes possible (not inclusive).

**Example 10.3.1**

Two pulses are travelling toward each other, at 10 cm s-1 on a long string, as shown in the figure below. Sketch the shape of the string after 0.6 s.

**Solution:**

**Figure 10.3.4**: Two identical longitudinal waves that are out of phase undergo destructive interference at every point when they superimposed 

### Interference of Two Wave Sources

#### 10.4.1 Interference of Waves from Two Sources that are in Phase

Consider two identical sources of monochromatic waves \(S_{1}\) and \(S_{2}\) as shown in Fig. 10.4.1. The two sources produce waves of _same amplitude_, _same frequency_ and are permanently oscillating _in phase_. Both waves have the same speed.

### Path Difference between the Two Wave Sources

Before we derive the general conditions for _constructive interference_ or _destructive interference_ to be observed at any point \(P\), we first define what we mean by _path difference_:

**Path difference \(\delta\)** between the two waves,

\(\delta\) = \(\left|\text{Distance travelled by wave from }S_{i}\text{ to }P-\text{ Distance travelled by wave from }S_{2}\text{ to }P\right|\)

\(=\) \(\left|S_{1}P-S_{2}P\right|\)

Figure 10.4.2: Path difference between waves from \(S_{1}\) and \(S_{2}\) is the difference between the distances travelled by wave from \(S_{1}\) and wave from \(S_{2}\).

Figure 10.4.1: Interference pattern of 2 waves sources oscillating in phase. Solid lines represent the crests while dotted lines represent the troughs of the waves produced by the two sources

### Conditions for Constructive Interference

Consider the lines \(\mathbf{A_{o}}\), \(\mathbf{A_{1}}\), \(\mathbf{A_{2}}\) and \(\mathbf{A_{3}}\).

Along these lines, the crests of the wave from \(\mathbf{S_{1}}\) (See Fig. 10.4.1) will always meet with crests from \(\mathbf{S_{2}}\). Similarly the troughs of the wave from \(\mathbf{S_{1}}\) will meet with the troughs from \(\mathbf{S_{2}}\).

From the Principle of Superposition, at the points where a crest meets another crest, we will get a resultant crest that is twice as high of that of the component waves. Similarly, at the points where a trough meets another trough, the resultant wave will have a trough that is twice as low as that of each component wave.

Therefore along the lines \(\mathbf{A_{o}}\), \(\mathbf{A_{1}}\), \(\mathbf{A_{2}}\) and \(\mathbf{A_{3}}\), the waves will always meet in phase and hence **constructive interference** occurs. \(\mathbf{A_{o}}\), \(\mathbf{A_{1}}\), \(\mathbf{A_{2}}\) and \(\mathbf{A_{3}}\) are also known as the **antinodal lines**.

**For a point P on the antinodal line \(\mathbf{A_{o}}\), two waves from \(\mathbf{S_{1}}\) and \(\mathbf{S_{2}}\) travel to P over the same distance, therefore they meet in phase. We see that for all points on line \(\mathbf{A_{o}}\)**

\[\text{Path difference between the 2 waves at P:}\hskip 36.135pt\delta=\left|S_{1}P-S_{2}P\right|=0\]

\[\text{Phase difference between the 2 waves at P:}\hskip 36.135pt\Delta\phi=0\]

**For any point P on the antinodal line \(\mathbf{A_{1}}\),** we see that the path (distance) travelled by one wave to P is always longer than the other wave by **one wavelength**.

\[\text{Path difference between the 2 waves,}\hskip 36.135pt\delta=\left|S_{1}P-S_{2}P\right|=\lambda\]

\[\text{Phase difference between the 2 waves at P:}\hskip 36.135pt\Delta\phi=2\pi\]

**Similarly for antinodal lines \(\mathbf{A_{2}}\),** for all points P on the line, the path travelled by one wave is always longer than the other wave by **two wavelengths**.

\[\text{Path difference between the 2 waves,}\hskip 36.135pt\delta=\left|S_{1}P-S_{2}P\right|=2\lambda\]

\[\text{Phase difference between the 2 waves at P:}\hskip 36.135pt\Delta\phi=4\pi\]

In general,

### Conditions for Constructive Interference:

1. **Looking at Phase difference (independent of phase difference at the sources)**:

**Phase difference between the two waves meeting at point P is** \[\Delta\phi=0,2\pi,4\pi,6\pi,...=2m\pi\]
2. **Looking at Path difference (dependent on phase difference at the sources)**:

For two waves sources \(\mathbf{S_{1}}\) and \(\mathbf{S_{2}}\) that are oscillating **in phase**,

**Path difference between the two waves travelling from the sources to the point P is:**

\[\delta\hskip 5.690551pt=\hskip 5.690551pt\left|S_{1}P-S_{2}P\right|\hskip 5.690551pt= \hskip 5.690551pt0,\lambda,2\lambda,3\lambda,...\hskip 5.690551pt=m\lambda\]

**where \(m\) = 0,1,2,3,... and \(\lambda\) is the wavelength of the individual waves.**

### Note:

1. **The points of constructive interference are also known as points of maxima.**
2. \(m\) **is also commonly known as the** _order_**.*** The central maximum is known as the _zeroth order maximum_. (_m_ = 0)
* The two maxima on either side of the zeroth order maximum are known as the **1st order maxima** (_m_ = 1). The next maxima further away are then known as the **2nd order maxima** and so on.
* ) to distinguish the "directions" of the order e.g. the orders observed to the right of the zeroth order may be given a positive sign (+) and therefore those orders observed to left of the zeroth order may be given a negative (-) sign.

### Destructive Interference

Consider each point along lines **N\({}_{\text{1}}\), N\({}_{\text{2}}\)**, and **N\({}_{\text{3}}\)** (See Fig 10.4.1). We notice that, along these lines, the crest of a wave from S\({}_{\text{1}}\) will always meet with a trough from S\({}_{\text{2}}\).

Hence, the two waves will always meet in **antiphase** and therefore **destructive interference occurs. N\({}_{\text{o}}\), N\({}_{\text{1}}\), N\({}_{\text{2}}\)** and **N\({}_{\text{3}}\)** are also known as **nodal lines**.

We follow the same procedure to derive the general condition for a destructive interference to be observed at any point **P** from the two sources by examining the nodal lines.

For a particular nodal line N\({}_{\text{1}}\), the wave from S\({}_{\text{1}}\) travels one-half of a wavelength (\(\lambda\)/2) more than the wave from S\({}_{\text{2}}\) to P, so if initially the waves were produced at the source to be in phase (phase difference is zero), this additional \(\lambda\)/2 will cause an equivalent phase difference of 180\({}^{\circ}\) and hence the two waves will meet in antiphase. Therefore a destructive interference will be observed at P.

Figure 10.4.4: For a particular nodal line N\({}_{\text{1}}\), the wave from S\({}_{\text{1}}\) travels one-half of a wavelength (\(\lambda\)/2) more than the wave from S\({}_{\text{2}}\) to P, so if initially the waves were produced at the source to be in phase (phase difference is zero), this additional \(\lambda\)/2 will cause an equivalent phase difference of 180\({}^{\circ}\) and hence the two waves will meet in antiphase. Therefore a destructive interference will be observed at P.

Figure 10.4.3: Two wave sources interfere with each other to produce points of constructive and destructive interference in a two dimension area. Point \(b\) is a point where constructive interference is observed. Point \(c\) is a point where destructive interference is observed. The antinodal lines (lines that join points of constructive interference of the same order) are indicated as well with the value of the order \(m\) shown. Here orders which lie above the zeroth order maximum are given a (+) sign and orders which lie below the zeroth order maximum are given a (-) sign.

**Conditions for Destructive Interference:**

1. **Looking at Phase difference (independent of phase difference at the sources):** Phase difference between the two waves meeting at point P is given by: \[\Delta\phi=\pi,\,3\pi,\,5\pi,\,7\pi,...=(m-\frac{1}{2})\,2\pi\]
2. **Looking at Path difference (dependent on phase difference at the sources):** For two waves sources \(\mathbf{S_{1}}\) and \(\mathbf{S_{2}}\) that are oscillating in **phase**, **Path difference** between the two waves travelling from the sources to the point P is: \[\delta = \left|\mathbf{S_{1}P-S_{2}P}\right|\,\,=\,\,\frac{\lambda}{2},\, \frac{3\lambda}{2},\,\,\frac{5\lambda}{2},\,...\,\,\,=(m-\frac{1}{2})\lambda\] where the order, \(m\) = 1,2,3,... and \(\lambda\) is the wavelength of the individual waves.

**Note :**

1. The points of **destructive interference** are also known as points of **minima**.
2. Notice that because there is no destructive interference in the central line, there is **no zeroth order minimum observed**.

**10.4.2 Accounting for Phase Difference at the Sources**

**Question:**

The conditions for constructive and destructive interference stated above are for the case that _the sources started out in phase_. If the **original sources** _are 180\({}^{\circ}\) out of phase_ (i.e. in anti-phase or equivalent to an additional path difference of \(\frac{\lambda}{2}\)), will the **conditions for path difference** change and why?

**Answer:**

(The phase difference between the 2 wave trains arriving at P)

= (Phase difference at the source) + (Phase difference due to the equivalent path difference)

All the points where the waves meet in phase previously, the waves will now meet in antiphase.

All the points where the waves meet in antiphase previously, the waves will now meet in phase.

Hence, the conditions for constructive and destructive interference **looking at path difference** are interchanged

For Constructive Interference :

For **two waves sources S\({}_{1}\) and S\({}_{2}\)** that are oscillating **in anti-phase**,

**Path difference** between the 2 waves trains arriving at P,

\(\delta\) = \(\left|S_{1}P-S_{2}P\right|\) = \(\frac{\lambda}{2}\), \(\frac{3\lambda}{2}\), \(\frac{5\lambda}{2}\),...

= (\(m\)-1/2)\(\lambda\). where m = 1, 2, 3, 4,....

_m: \(m\)_th order maxima

**Note: Phase difference** between the two waves **meeting at point P** is still given by:

\(\Delta\phi\) = \(2\pi,4\pi,6\pi,...\) = \(2m\pi\)

Note : In this case, the zeroth order is a minimum and there is no zeroth order maximum.

**Example 10.4.1: Two Source Interference**

The figure (Fig. 10.4.5) shows two sources X and Y which emit identical sound waves of wavelength 2.0 m. The two sources emit in phase, and the waves emitted have equal amplitudes, each \(A\).

## 10.5 Interference of Light Waves - Young's Double Slit Experiment

The interference pattern produced by two _water waves_ of the same wavelength can be readily seen in a ripple tank1. However, interference pattern is generally not easily observable when two light waves overlap.

Footnote 1: Read more about the Ripple Tank in Appendix C (Pg. 48).

### So can light waves interfere with each other?

When two independent light sources are placed side by side, no interference pattern is observed because the light waves emitted by each of the sources are not **coherent** (i.e. they do not maintain a constant phase relationship with each other over the time of observation).

Light from an ordinary source undergoes random phase change about once every 10-8 s. Therefore, conditions for constructive interference, destructive interference, or some intermediate state last for times of the order of 10-8 s.

Since the eye cannot follow such short-term changes, no interference pattern is observed.

**Conditions for two waves to produce an Interference Pattern**

1. The sources must be **coherent**; i.e. they must maintain a _constant phase difference_ with respect to each other.
2. The two wave sources must also emit waves of roughly the same amplitude.
3. For transverse waves, they must be unpolarised, or share a common direction of polarisation.

**Note:**

1 **Coherence:**

Two waves are said to be **coherent** if they have a **constant phase difference** between them.

* When two sources are coherent, it does not necessarily imply that they are in phase with each other.
* The constant phase difference may be non-zero.
* Therefore, if 2 sources are coherent, this necessarily implies that the frequencies and wavelengths (and hence speeds) of the waves emitted must be the same.

#### 10.5.1 Description on Young's Double Slit Experiment

It was Thomas Young who first demonstrated that light can also interfere with each other to produce an interference pattern as predicted by wave theory and hence demonstrating that light is a wave. A schematic diagram of the apparatus that Young used is shown in Fig. 10.5.1.

* To produce light sources which are coherent in Young's interference experiment, a point source of monochromatic light is incident on 2 slits. As light reaches the two slits, it is diffracted2 by slits S\({}_{1}\) and S\({}_{2}\), which then act as 2 point sources. Since there is only one primary point source, the light waves emerging from S\({}_{1}\) and S\({}_{2}\) are always coherent. If S\({}_{1}\) and S\({}_{2}\) are equidistant from S\({}_{0}\), then the 2 sources are in phase. Footnote 2: Diffraction will be discussed in more detail in Section 10.7
* The light waves travelling from S\({}_{1}\) and S\({}_{2}\) overlap and undergo interference, forming an interference pattern of **maxima** and **minima**.
* On the screen, points of visible bright rows called _bright bands, bright fringes_, or _maxima_ are formed. The dark regions are called _dark bands, dark fringes_, or _minima_.
* The pattern of bright and dark fringes on the screen is called an **interference pattern**. (Fig.10.5.2)
* A point source is obtained usually by placing another slit S\({}_{o}\) between the double-slit and an extended light source.

Figure 10.5.1: Setup for Young’s Double Slit Experiment

### Conditions for Maxima and Minima

Let us now derive the conditions for the positions of the maxima and minima of the Young's Double Slit experiment.

In Fig. 10.5.2, a screen is placed at a perpendicular distance \(L\) from the double-slits. The double slits are separated by a _slit separation_ of \(d\). Because the wave through S\({}_{1}\) originate from the same wavefront as the wave through S\({}_{2}\), the two waves at S\({}_{1}\) and S\({}_{2}\) are always **in phase**.

Consider an arbitrary point **P** on the viewing screen,

* For **a maximum to be observed at P**, the wave from S\({}_{1}\) needs to **constructively interfere** with the wave from S\({}_{2}\). Hence, the path difference \(\delta\)between the two waves when they meet at P needs to be: \[\delta=\left|r_{1}-r_{2}\right|=0,\lambda,2\lambda,3\lambda,...=m\lambda\qquad \text{where }m:\text{order }(m=0,1,2,3,...)\]
* Similarly, for **a minimum to be observed at P**, the wave from S\({}_{1}\) needs to **destructively interfere** with the wave from S\({}_{2}\). Hence, the path difference \(\delta\)between the two waves when they meet at P needs to be: \[\delta=\left|r_{1}-r_{2}\right|=\frac{\lambda}{2},\frac{3\lambda}{2},\frac{5 \lambda}{2},\frac{7\lambda}{2}=(m-\frac{1}{2})\lambda\qquad\text{where }m:\text{order }(m=1,2,3,...)\]

However, for the experiment, the **separation between the slits \(d\) is often negligible compared to the distance \(L\) between the screen and the slits_**, i.e. \(L>>d\). Therefore the rays from S\({}_{1}\) and S\({}_{2}\) to \(P\) are almost parallel to each other. (Fig. 10.5.3)

_Point to Note: What are the typical orders of magnitude for slit separation, d, slit widths S\({}_{1}\) and S\({}_{2}\) and distance \(L\) for Young's double slits experiment with light?Approximating the rays to be parallel to each other, the _path difference_\(\delta\) may thus be _approximated_ by:

\[\delta=d\,\sin\theta\]

where \(d\) is _the separation between the slits_, and \(\theta\) is the _angular displacement of the position of interference fringe observed from the principal axis QO_.3

Footnote 3: The _principal axis_ is a line joining the midpoint of the two slits perpendicularly to the viewing screen.

The conditions that define whether _bright_ or _dark_ fringes are observed at point P is thus given by

**1**: **Conditions for Constructive or Destructive Interference**

**Condition for Constructive Interference (Maxima or Bright Fringes):**

\[d\,\sin\theta=m\lambda\qquad\qquad\text{ where }m:\text{order number }(\ m=0,1,2,3,...)\]
**Condition for Destructive Interference (Minima or Dark Fringes):**

\[d\,\sin\theta=(m-\frac{1}{2})\lambda\qquad\text{where }m:\text{order number }(\ m=1,2,3,...)\]
**The assumption made during the derivation of these two equations is \(L>>d\)**

**Note:**

* Similar to the two source interference introduced earlier, \(m\) is called the _order number_.
* \(m=0\) corresponds to \(\theta=0\). In this case, a central bright fringe is observed and hence it is known as the _zeroth order maximum_. The first maximum on either side is called the _first-order maximum_, and so forth.
* Sometimes, a sign is assigned to the order to help distinguish the positions of the maxima or minima. For example, in this case, maxima located at one side (suppose above) of the zeroth order maximum may have values of \(m=1\), \(2\), \(3\), \(4\).... while maxima located at the other side (below) the zeroth order maximum may have values of \(m=\) -1, -2, -3, -4,...
**2**: **Positions \(\boldsymbol{\nu}\) of Bright and Dark Fringes**

It is often useful to obtain expressions for the positions \(y\) along the screen of the fringes measured vertically from O to P.

In a typical Young's Double Slit experiment, constructive interference occurs when

\[d\,\sin\,\theta=m\lambda\Rightarrow\sin\,\theta=m\lambda d\]
**if \(\boldsymbol{\lambda<<d}\), the value of \(\boldsymbol{\theta}\) would be very small for low order fringes (i.e. small \(m\))**, hence we can use small angle approximation (\(\sin\,\theta\!\approx\!\tan\,\theta\)) to arrive at \(\tan\,\theta=m\lambda d\)

From triangle OPQ (Fig. 10.5.2), we have \(\tan\theta=\frac{\gamma}{L}\)\(\Rightarrow\)\(\frac{m\lambda}{d}=\frac{\gamma}{L}\)

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:21]

**Example 10.5.1** : **Determination of wavelength of light using Young's Double Slit**

A screen is separated from the double-slit source by 1.2 m. The distance between the two slits is 0.03 cm. The second-order bright fringe (\(m=2\)) is measured to be 4.5 mm from the centre line

(i) What is the fringe separation between 2 neighbouring bright fringes formed on the screen?

(ii) Determine the wavelength of light. Ans: (i) 2.25 mm (ii) 5.63 x 10\({}^{-7}\) m

**Solution:**

**Effects of Diffraction on Double Slit**

The slits used in the double slit experiment in practice cannot be considered as point sources. As a result, each slit produces a diffraction pattern as shown in Fig. 10.7.5. Fig. 10.5.4 illustrates the interference pattern of two slits superposed on the intensity pattern of a single slit. The interference fringe pattern due to the double slit gets moderated by the diffraction pattern.

**Fig. 10.5.4**

This can sometimes result in missing orders in the interference fringe pattern. When the minima of the diffraction envelope coincide with the maxima of the interference pattern, the "maxima" of the interference pattern go missing because they are too dim to be seen.

### Diffraction Grating

We have seen that the Young's double-slit experiment is able to allow us to determine the wavelength of light. However, a more commonly used tool is the _diffraction grating_. A diffraction grating has many fine, parallel, closely spaced and equidistant slits/rulings inscribed on a sheet of glass or metal. A typical diffraction grating has several hundreds to thousands of slits per mm.

To see how a diffraction grating pattern differs from a Young's double-slit pattern and why it is so useful, we will analyse the diffraction pattern for various number of slits of the same slits-separation \(d\).

Figure 10.6.1:From Fig. 10.6.2(a) above, we make the following observations:

* For the same slit separation \(d\), the **positions of the maxima remain the same**.
* As the number of slits increase, the maxima become narrower (i.e. the fringes become sharper on the screen).
* As the number of slits increase, the intensity of the maxima increases.

Therefore, we can infer that for a grating (no. of slits \(\rightarrow\infty\)) the **fringe pattern will have very good contrast** (narrower and brighter maxima separated by broad regions of dark minima).

Figure 10.6.2: This shows the diffraction pattern of one slit, then two, then three, four, five, six, and more. When there are many slits, we call it a diffraction grating. The more slits, the narrower the fringes become. The pictures (a) above were taken with monochromatic light. The intensity distribution is shown in (b).

**Condition for Maxima for a Diffraction Grating**

From Fig. 10.6.2(b) above, we notice that for same value of \(d\), the positions of the maxima (bright fringes) of a grating coincide with the positions of the maxima for a double slit:

We can therefore infer the equation that determines the positions of the maxima for a _diffraction grating pattern_.

**Condition for Constructive Interference (Maxima) for a Diffraction Grating**

For the _nth order maxima_,

\[d\sin\theta=n\lambda\]

where \(d\) : separation between the slits

\(\theta\) : angular position of the bright fringe from the principle axis

\(n\) : order number (_n=0, 1, 2, 3,..._)

\(\lambda\) : wavelength of light passing through the grating

Commercially available gratings are labelled by the _no. of lines per unit length, N_. The relationship between \(N\) and \(d\) are given by

**Note :**

In this case, we _do not define_ the conditions for _destructive interference_ as the width of the region between the bright fringes is very large.

For most of the gratings in the laboratory, the slit separations are much smaller than that of the double slits. Hence, _you will notice that the positions of the first and higher orders of the bright fringes lie much further away from the central bright fringe and hence small angle approximation (that \(d\) is small) does not hold_. Therefore, in most questions for diffraction grating it is not meaningful to talk about the _fringe separation_ as the angular separation between consecutive fringes are not constant, in fact _they increase as the order increases_.

Although the formula for constructive interference for the double slit and the diffraction grating is the same, the formula for fringe separation for double slits, \(\Delta y=\frac{\lambda L}{d}\), CANNOT

be used in a grating, unless the fringes are shown to be regularly spaced.

**3 Grating vs. Young's Double Slit**

The grating is often the preferred choice over the double-slit for the following reasons. For a diffraction grating,

* Fringes are sharper and positions are more precisely determined. There is therefore less uncertainty in measuring the position of the fringes, and less uncertainty in the computation of wavelength.

* Typically the angular displacements are large, so percentage uncertainty in measuring the angular displacement becomes relatively lower. This translates to a relatively lower percentage uncertainty in measuring wavelength as well.
* 4 Determination of Wavelength Using Grating4
* **Advantages and disadvantages of using the higher orders to determine the wavelength as compared to first order:*
* Using \(d\sin\theta=m\lambda\)**, if we know the value of the slits separation \(d\), we can generally determine the wavelength of the light used by measuring the value of \(\theta\) for a particular order of fringe. There are both advantages and disadvantages in using the higher orders to determine this wavelength.
* **Advantages :*
* angular displacement \(\theta\) is larger, therefore there is less percentage uncertainty in measuring the angle.
* **Disadvantages :*
* May not be as bright as the first order bright fringe.

White light from a source passes through a filter which transmits only wavelengths of 400 nm to 600 nm. When the filtered light falls normally on a diffraction grating, light of wavelength 600 nm in one order of the spectrum is diffracted at the same angle, 30\({}^{\circ}\), as the 400 nm light in the adjacent order.

### 10.7 Diffraction of Waves

What is diffraction?

Diffraction is the _spreading_ of a wave (into the "geometrical shadow") after passing through a slit or around an obstacle.

Diffraction effects become more apparent when the width of the opening is small enough compared to the wavelength.

#### 10.7.1 Diffraction of water waves

When waves meets a barrier in which there is an opening, if the width of the opening is much larger than the wavelength of the waves, the wave emerging from the opening continues to move in a straight line (apart from some small spreading at the edge). If the width of the opening is comparable or smaller than the wavelength, then the bending is a lot more obvious, and emergent wave becomes more circular.

What is meant by "Geometrical Shadow"

Consider a series of particles projected (diagram below) separately into an aperture and obstacle.

Diffraction is also observed for waves meeting an obstacle in its path. Again, **the relative size of the obstacle to the wavelength will determine the effect of diffraction** as shown in Figure 10.7.3. It is found that in order for the waves to spread around the edges of the obstacle to extend into the geometric shadow of the obstacle, the width of the obstacle should be small enough compared to the wavelength.

Figure 10.7.2:

Figure 10.7.1: Waves of identical wavelengths meet gaps of different widths. When the **width of the gap** is **comparable** to the **wavelength**, diffraction effects are more obvious.

Since light and sound demonstrate diffraction effects, they are said to behave like waves. This diffraction effect cannot be explained by particle theory (i.e. diffraction effect is unique to waves).

### 10.7.2 Single Slit Diffraction Pattern

#### Diffraction Pattern of a Single Slit

We might expect that light passing through a small aperture would result in a broad region of light on a screen, due to the spreading of the light as it passes through the opening.

We actually find something more interesting.

A diffraction pattern consisting of light and dark areas is observed (see Figure 10.7.4), somewhat similar to the interference pattern discussed earlier.

This pattern consists of a broad intense central band (called the central maximum), flanked by a series of alternating bright and dark bands.

Figure 10.7.4:

Figure 10.7.3: The waves will bend if the length of the obstacle is comparable to the wavelength of the waves.

In a single slit diffraction, **light waves of wavelength \(\lambda\)** passing through a **single slit of width \(b\)** undergoes diffraction to produce a broad intense central band with an intensity profile that is maximum at the centre, and tapers off towards both sides as shown in Figure 10.7.5.

You are not required to explain formally these observations for the A-level Physics syllabus.

Nonetheless, for those interested, these observations can be explained by means of Huygen's Principle, which explains how the slit can be modeled as row of secondary point sources, the waves from which interfere with one another to create an interference pattern.

A detailed explanation can be found in Appendix A.

The **first minimum intensity of the single slit diffraction pattern** occurs at **angle \(\theta\)** from the central maximum where

\[\sin\,\theta=\frac{\lambda}{b}\]

This angle \(\theta\) is important because it tells us the angular spread (\(2\theta\)) which contains most of the energy of the wave. It can be seen from this that as \(b\) **(the slit width) is reduced, \(\theta\) gets larger and the pattern is more spreads out**. The **pattern also gets dimmer as less light energy passes through a smaller slit**. A more complete analysis of the diffraction pattern can be found in Appendix B.

### Width of the single slit pattern

For small angles the **angular spread of the diffraction pattern** is inversely proportional to the **slit width \(b\)** or, more precisely, to the **ratio of \(b\) to the wavelength \(\lambda\)**. Figure 10.7.6 shows graphs of intensity / as a function of the angle for three values of the ratio \(b\,/\lambda\).

Figure 10.7.5:

## 10.7.3 Resolving Power and Rayleigh's Criterion

The resolving power of an optical instrument is the ability of the instrument to differentiate clearly between the images of two close objects, i.e., the two images are seen as two distinct images. The resolving power is measured in terms of angular separation (units in radians) of the two images.

As most images are viewed through an aperture as in the case of microscoppes and telescopes, it is identical to viewing the diffraction pattern produced. Hence, the diffraction of light affects greatly or limits the resolving power of an optical instrument.

To understand this limitation, let us consider two light sources far away from a narrow slit of **slit width**\(b\)**, with angular separation of \(\alpha\).

Since the two sources are usually incoherent (such as two distant stars), let's assume that no interference occurs between the two light passing through the slit. So each light source simply produces its own diffraction pattern on the screen. What is observed on the screen will be the summation of two diffraction patterns, one from each source. If the sources are close together, their diffraction patterns overlap; if their angular separation is small enough, their diffraction patterns overlap almost completely and cannot be distinguished. (see Fig. 10.7.8 part c)

Figure 10.7.8: Individual diffraction patterns of two point sources (solid curves) and the resultant patterns (dashed curves) for various separation of sources as light passes through a circular aperture. In each case, the dashed curve is a summation of the two solid curves.

The generally accepted criterion for whether two images are distinguishable is the **Rayleigh criterion**, which states that **two images are just resolved or distinguishable when the central maximum of one image coincides with the first minimum of the other image** (see Fig. 10.7.8 part b).

Hence according to the Rayleigh criterion, **two images are just resolved or distinguishable** when the **angular separation between the two sources, \(\alpha\)** is (approximately) equal to the **angular separation \(\theta_{min}\)** between the central maximum and the first minimum of the images (See Fig. 10.7.9).

From section 10.5.2 (single slit diffraction pattern), we learnt that the **first minimum** for a single slit diffraction occurs at an angle \(\sin\theta_{\rm min}=\frac{\lambda}{b}\) where \(b\) is the slit width.

When \(\theta_{\rm min}\) is small, we can use the approximation \(\sin\theta_{\rm min}\approx\theta_{\rm min}\). The **Rayleigh criterion for the resolving power of a single aperture** is thus given by

\[\theta_{\rm min}\approx\frac{\lambda}{b}\]

where \(b\)**is the slit width and \(\theta_{\rm min}\) is in radians**.

Hence we can also say that **the angle subtended by the two sources, \(\alpha\) must be greater than \(\frac{\lambda}{b}\) if the images are to be resolved**.

**Note:**

1. The resolving power of a telescope can be improved by using an objective lens of wide aperture (i.e. large diameter). Besides reducing the diffraction effects, more light is also transmitted through the telescope and a brighter image is observed.
2. In microscopes, the resolving power is improved by using radiation of much smaller wavelengths than visible light, such as ultra-violet. In electron microscopes, the wavelength of the electron beam is \(10^{5}\) times smaller than visible light, resulting in much higher resolution in the images. The wavelength associated with the electron beam will be covered in Chapter 17 Quantum Physics.
3. For circular lens aperture (e.g. telescope), the formula becomes \(\sin\theta_{\rm min}=\frac{1.22\lambda}{D}\), where \(D\) is the diameter of the circular lens. **Not required for A Level, for information only.**

**Example 10.7.2**

The resolving power of the eye may be determined by drawing two parallel lines at a distance of say 2 mm apart on a piece of card. The card is slowly moved away from the eye until the eye just cannot see the two lines as separate lines. The distance of the card from the eye is measured. Suppose for a particular person, the distance of the card from his eye is 5 m when his eye just fail to see the two lines distinctly. [Ans: (a) 0.0004 rad (b) 1.25 mm] (a) Determine the angle subtended at the eye by the two lines. (b) By approximating the wavelength of the visible light to be 500 nm, estimate the aperture of the pupil of the eye.

## 10.8 Stationary Waves

Consider two identical waves moving in opposite directions overlapping in the same region of space. Figure 10.8.1 shows wave P moving towards the right and wave Q moving towards the left. By applying the principle of superposition, we know that during the time the two waves overlap, the resultant displacements is given by the vector sum of the displacements of the primary waves at that location.

Because the wave pattern does not appear to move in either direction along the wave, the resultant waveform is known as a **standing wave** or **stationary wave**.

We can observe from the diagram that amplitude of vibration for every point of the resultant wave varies.

* There are particular points called **nodes** (\(N\)) that never move, i.e. the amplitude of vibration is zero.
* Midway between the nodes are points called **antnodes** (\(A\)), where the amplitude of vibration is greatest.

### Formation of Stationary Wave (or Standing Wave)

**Stationary Waves**

When two identical waves of the **same amplitude**, **frequency** and **speed** but travelling in **opposite directions** are superposed together, the resultant wave obtained is called a stationary wave.

### Characteristics of Stationary Wave

Let us examine the properties of the stationary wave by comparing it with a travelling wave.

\begin{tabular}{|p{113.8pt}|p{113.8pt}|p{113.8pt}|} \hline
**Diagram** & **Standing Wave** & **Progressive Wave** \\ \hline
**Waveform** & **Does not advance.** & **Waveform advances with the velocity of the wave.** \\ \hline
**Amplitude** & **Varies according to position from zero at the nodes (permanently at rest) to a maximum of 2** \(A\) **at the antinodes.** & **Apart from attenuation, it is the same for all particles in the path of the wave.** \\ \hline
**Frequency** & **All the particles vibrate in SHM with the same frequency as the component waves (except for those at the nodes which are at rest).** & **All particles vibrate in SHM with the frequency of the wave.** \\ \hline
**Phase** & **A segment (loop) refers to points between two adjacent nodes.** & **All particles within one wavelength have different phase.** \\ \hline
**Wavelength** & **2 x distance between a pair of adjacent nodes or antinodes.** & **Distance between two adjacent particles that are vibrating in phase.** \\ \hline
**Energy** & **No propagation of energy, but there is energy associated with the wave.** & **Energy propagates in the direction of the wave travel.** \\ \hline \end{tabular}

**Example 10.8.1** : **Stationary Waves**

Fig 10.8.2 shows a car driven at a speed of 30 m s-1 along a straight road between 2 radio transmitters. The transmitters T\({}_{1}\) and T\({}_{2}\) are sending out the same programme, using a frequency of 1.50 MHz. The radio is heard to fade and strengthen regularly.

**Figure 10.8.2**

What is the period of this regular fading?

**Solution:**

#### Stationary Waves in Strings

Consider a string, fixed at one end, and the other end attached to an oscillator. If the oscillator moves up and down in simple harmonic motion, it will produce a continuous wave-train down the string. As the wave-train reaches the fixed end, it gets reflected back. The reflected wave-train will interfere with the wave-train from the source to form a resultant waveform on the string. It is observed that at certain frequencies of vibration of the source, we will be able to see some unique waveforms on the string as illustrated in Fig. 10.9.3(a)-(c).

The frequencies at which standing waves are produced are known as the natural frequencies or resonant frequencies of the string.

The different standing wave patterns shown in Fig. 10.8.3 are the different "resonant modes of vibration". When the driving frequency matches that of the natural frequency of the string, the amplitude of oscillation generated are the largest.

This principle is very important as it is used in the generation of music in many stringed instruments like guitar and violin.

### Resonant modes of vibrations in a stretched string fixed at two ends

Consider a wire stretched between 2 points and plucked in the middle, a transverse wave travels along the wire and is reflected at the ends. The reflected and re-reflected waves from the ends will continually interfere with each other to produce a stationary wave on the string.

The two _ends of the strings are fixed and thus must have zero displacement_ and hence must be displacement nodes.

This additional constraint or boundary condition results in the string being allowed to have only certain wavelengths and frequencies of oscillations.

Figure 10.8.4:Fig. 10.8.4 shows the largest possible wavelength of stationary wave that can be produced on the wire - corresponding to the smallest frequency. This mode of oscillation is known as the **fundamental mode** and the lowest frequency of vibration \(f_{i}\) is known as the **fundamental frequency**.

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|} \hline
**Mode of Vibration** & **Wavelength** & **Frequency** & **Harmonic** & **Overtone** \\ \hline \(\lambda_{1}=2L\) & \(f_{i}=\frac{\nu}{\lambda_{1}}=\frac{\nu}{2L}\) & 1st & - \\ \hline \(\lambda_{2}=L\) & \(f_{2}=\frac{\nu}{\lambda_{2}}=\frac{\nu}{L}\) & 2nd & 1st \\ \hline \(\lambda_{3}=\frac{2}{3}L\) & \(f_{3}=\frac{\nu}{\lambda_{3}}=\frac{3\nu}{2L}\) & 3rd & 2nd \\ \hline \end{tabular} Generally the _nth_ harmonic is given by: \(f_{n}=n\bigg{(}\frac{\nu}{2L}\bigg{)}\), where \(n\) = 1, 2, 3, 4,...

**Note:**

1. **Fundamental Frequency and Harmonics**

All resonant frequencies of vibrations that can be generated are called harmonics. The harmonics are numbered according to the ratio of their frequencies to the first natural frequency \(f_{i}\). Thus if the 1st harmonic is 110 Hz, then 220 Hz, 330 Hz, 440 Hz etc. are the 2nd, 3rd, 4th  etc harmonics respectively.

The first natural frequency is the lowest possible frequency and is known as the _fundamental frequency_ (or 1st harmonic)

The frequencies of the harmonics are related to the fundamental frequency \(f_{i}\) by \(f_{n}=nf_{i}\) where \(f_{n}\) is the frequency of the _nth_ harmonic.

Note that all harmonics are present for the string shown above.

2. **Overtones**

Overtones are the frequencies (excluding the fundamental) that can be produced by an instrument accompanying the 1st harmonic that is played.

The tuning fork and frequency generator are the only examples that can produce a pure note.

The lowest overtone is known as the 1st overtone, the next overtone is the 2nd overtone. Hence, in this case, the 1st overtone of the string corresponds to the 2nd harmonic of the string.

3. **Speed of a wave on a string**

The speed of a wave on a string is given by \(\nu=\sqrt{\frac{T}{\mu}}\) where \(T\) is the tension in the string and \(\mu\) is the mass per unit length of the string. **Not required for A Level, for information only.**

**Example 10.8.2: Resonant Wavelengths of a Wire**

A 1.0 m wire stretched between 2 points is plucked near one end. What are the three longest wavelengths present on the vibrating wire? [Ans: 2.0 m, 1.0 m, 0.67 m]

**Solution:**

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:53]

### Resonant Frequencies of Air Columns

There are generally 2 types of air columns we want to concern ourselves with:

* open pipe
* closed pipe ( closed at one end)

Recall that the open end of the pipe, we have a displacement antinode, and at the closed end of the pipe, we have a displacement node.

### Resonant Vibrations in an Open Pipe

The _nth_ harmonic can be expressed as: \(f=n\bigg{(}\dfrac{\nu}{2L}\bigg{)}\), where \(n\) = 1, 2, 3, 4,...

### Resonant Vibrations in a Closed Pipe

The _nth_ harmonic is given by: \(f_{n}=n\bigg{(}\dfrac{\nu}{4L}\bigg{)}\), where \(n\) = 1, 3, 5,...

**Note:**

1. The fundamental frequency of an open pipe is twice that of a closed pipe of the same length.
2. Only odd harmonics are present in closed pipe.
3. Assuming that we have a closed pipe and an open pipe with characteristics the same in all aspects inclusive of length, the following table presents a possible situation for the combination of frequencies emitted.

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|} \hline Harmonics & Frequency emitted from a Closed & Frequency emitted from an Open \\  & Pipe /Hz & Pipe / Hz \\ \hline
1 & 256 & 512 \\ \hline
2 & - & 1024 \\ \hline
3 & 768 & 1536 \\ \hline
4 & - & 2048 \\ \hline
5 & 1280 & 2560 \\ \hline \end{tabular} The quality of sound emitted is a mixture of these harmonics for each system. Hence we see that the "note" from an open pipe is "richer" than that from a closed pipe.

**Example 10.8.3 Serway p18.37.**

Calculate the length of a pipe that has a fundamental frequency of 240 Hz if the pipe is

#### What about the pressure?

Earlier in Waves topic, we discussed the pressure variations in a progressive sound wave; now we can consider how pressure varies in a stationary sound wave.

Fig. 10.8.7(a) shows the two extreme curves of the displacement-position graph for a stationary wave for times when the displacements are greatest. As before, we will take displacements of air molecules to the right to be positive.

How does the pressure vary at displacement node N?

* Consider the instant in time when the wave corresponds to the dashed line in Fig. 10.8.7 (a).
* At position node N\({}_{1}\), air molecules to the left of N\({}_{1}\) are displaced positively and hence to the right towards N\({}_{1}\); air molecules to the right of N\({}_{1}\) has a negative displacement and hence to the left toward N, as well; air molecules at N\({}_{1}\) has zero displacement and remain at their equilibrium positions. **At this instant in time, the air at N\({}_{1}\) is compressed and the pressure is greater than normal.**
* Half a period later, the wave would correspond to the solid line in Fig. 10.8.7 (a),
* At position node N\({}_{1}\), air molecules to the left of N\({}_{1}\) are displaced negatively and hence to the left away from N\({}_{1}\); air molecules to the right of N\({}_{1}\) has a positive displacement and hence to the right away from N\({}_{1}\) as well. Air molecules at N\({}_{1}\) has zero displacement and remain at their equilibrium positions. **At this instant in time, the air at N\({}_{1}\) is rarefied and the pressure is lower than normal.**
* This illustrates the fact that **pressure variation is greatest at displacement nodes.**
* **Displacement node** is subjected to large pressure changes and hence it is a **pressure antinode.**

How does the pressure vary at displacement antinode A\({}_{1}\)?

* At position antinode A\({}_{1}\), air molecules to the left of A\({}_{1}\), to the right of A1 and at A1 are always displaced in the same direction. This means that at antinode A\({}_{1}\), the separation between air molecules is maintained constant and **the pressure remains at normal all the time**.
* **Displacement antinode** is subjected to zero pressure changes and hence it is a **pressure node.**

**Example 10.8.5: End Corrections**

A source of sound of frequency 250 Hz is used with resonant tube, closed at one end, to measure the speed of sound in air. The two shortest resonant lengths are found to be 0.30 and 0.96 m. Calculate

(a) the speed of the sound, and

(b) the end correction of the tube. [Ans: (a) 330 m s-1 (b) 3.0 cm]

**Solution:**

#### Investigating the speed of sound using stationary waves

We can determine the speed of sound wave by setting up a stationary wave and measure the corresponding frequency and wavelength as described by the experiment below. A stationary sound wave is set up by reflection from a reflector.

The experimental setup is shown in Fig. 10.8.9.

* The signal generator (See Appendix E, Pg. 49) connected to a speaker delivers a note of frequency \(f\) towards a reflector (e.g. a metal sheet).
* The sound wave gets reflected off the reflector and interference occurs between the forward and reflected waves and a stationary wave pattern with nodes and antinodes is established between the speaker and reflector.
* The positions of antinodes are determined using a microphone connected to the oscilloscope (See Appendix A of waves lecture notes for the write-up on oscilloscopes). The microphone is slowly moved away from the reflector until a trace of maximum amplitude is obtained. This denotes the position of a pressure antinode. The distance \(x_{1}\) of the microphone from the reflector is measured using a metre rule.
* The microphone is next moved slowly further away from the reflector until the amplitude of the trace on the C.R.O. is once again maximum. The distance of the microphone from the reflector, \(x_{2}\), is again measured. Therefore, Distance between 2 successive pressure antinodes, \(d=x_{2}-x_{1}=\lambda/2\) Waelength of the sound wave, \(\lambda=2d\)
* If the frequency \(f\) of the sound wave is known, the speed of sound \(\nu\) can be determined from \(\nu=f\lambda\)

### D3 N2017/1/17

The speed of a wave on a stretched string is proportional to the square root of the tension in the string. The string is held under tension between a clamp and a pulley 90 cm apart by a mass \(m\) of 400 g hanging from the end of the string.

When the frequency \(f\) of the mechanical oscillator close to the clamped end is 15 Hz, the stationary wave shown is set up between the clamp and the pulley. The hanging mass \(m\) and frequency \(f\) are varied until another stationary wave is formed.

## Appendices

### Appendix A: Huygens' Principle

But how can one explain the bending of waves due to diffraction? Why does the spreading of waves become increasingly more obvious with the width of the aperture decreases to about the same order as the wavelength? This phenomenon may be explained using _Huygens' Principle_.

The _Huygens' Principle_ is a geometrical method for finding, from the known shape of a wave front at some instant, the shape of the wave front at some later time. Huygen assumed that

**every point of a wave front may be considered the source of secondary wavelets that spread out in all directions with a speed equal to the speed of propagation of the wave**.

The new wave front at a later time is found by constructing a surface _tangent to the secondary wavelets_, called the _envelope_ of the wavelets.

The following diagram shows how Huygens' construction is used to determine the new wavefronts for a plane wave and for a spherical wave.

Through Huygens' construction, we can now see how the subsequent wavefronts'reconstruct' themselves when incident plane waves pass through a slit.

Figure 1: Huygens’ construction for (a) a plane wave propagating to the right and (b) a spherical wave propagating to the left.

Let us now apply Huygens' construction to explaining diffraction.

Consider first the case where the obstacle or opening is much larger than the wavelength of the waves (Fig. 2), we find that the wavelets emerging forms wavefronts that is essentially straight. Diffraction is not very apparent.

If, however, the size of the opening becomes comparable to the wavelength, the waves proceed to "bend through" or around the opening or obstruction as shown in Fig. 3.

Finally, as the obstruction or opening equals the wavelength, the diffraction becomes quite pronounced as shown in Fig 4.

## Appendix B Single Slit Diffraction Pattern

To analyze the diffraction pattern of the single slit, let us divide the slit into two halves as shown.

Consider ray 1 and 3. As the two rays travel towards the screen, ray 1 travels an additional path difference of \(\dfrac{b}{2}\text{sin}\theta\) where \(b\) is the width of the slit and \(\theta\) is the angle with the principle axis. Similarly, the path difference between rays 2 and 4, as well as between rays 3 and 5, is also \(\dfrac{b}{2}\text{sin}\theta\).

If this path difference is exactly half a wavelength, then destructive interference occurs. This cancellation occurs for any two rays that originate at the points separated by half a slit width because the phase difference between 2 such points is 180\({}^{\circ}\). Therefore the waves from the upper half of the slit interfere destructively with the waves from the lower half when

\[\dfrac{b}{2}\text{sin}\theta=\pm\dfrac{\lambda}{2}\] \[\text{or}\;\;b\text{sin}\theta=\pm\lambda\]

Dividing the slit into 4 equal parts and using the same reasoning, we find that destructive interference also occurs when \(\dfrac{b}{4}\text{sin}\theta=\pm\dfrac{\lambda}{2}\) or \(b\text{sin}\theta=\pm 2\lambda\).

This same argument can be applied when the slit is divided into 6, 8 and so on equal parts, and we obtained the general condition for **destructive interference** (or **dark region**) to be

\[b\text{sin}\theta=m\lambda\text{ where m = }\pm 1,2,3,...\]

## Appendix C: Ripple Tank

One way to observe interference of water waves is in a ripple tank. Generally a ripple tank could be used to investigate various properties of water waves.

1. **Eccentric:** An eccentric (off-centre) metal disc on the axle of the motor causes the beam to vibrate at the same frequency as the revolutions of the motor. The speed of the motor is controlled by a rheostat in series with a low-voltage d.c. supply, or a dry battery (usually 3.0 or 4.5 V).
2. To generate continuous straight wave, a vibrating beam just touching the water is used.
3. To generate circular waves, a small spherical dipper is fixed to the beam instead.
4. The speed of the motor may be adjusted to vary the frequency and wavelength of continuous wave train.
5. The progressive waves move quite quickly across the water surface and any attempt to measure the wavelength or draw the wave diagrams from the moving water shadows would be very difficult. A standard method of freezing or slowing down rapid motion would be to use a stroboscope.
