**What is the relationship between the 3?**

Let's understand how all 3 are distinct yet related.

Let's run through each of them individually and keep it simple.

## Strength of acid

Strength of acid depends on the **nature** of the acid.

**Strong acids** have the ability to **dissociate fully** in water to produce a **high concentration of H' ions.

_Examples_: nitric acid, hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid

**Weak acids** only have the ability to **dissociate partially** in water to produce a **low concentration** of H' ions.

_Examples_: citric acid, hydrofluoric acid, organic acid such as ethanolic acid

**Weak acids** only have the ability to **dissociate partially** in water to produce a **low concentration** of H' ions.

_Examples_: citric acid, hydrofluoric acid, organic acid such as ethanolic acid

**Weak acids** only have the ability to **dissociate partially** in water to produce a **low concentration** of H' ions.

_Examples_: citric acid fully dissociate in water to produce a **high concentration**of H' ions.

_While for hydrofluoric acid, not all of them have dissociated, so there are much larger H' ions._

So if you were to compare the strength of the acid, **hyferochloric acid is the stronger acid, since it produces more H' ions.

Concentration of acid

Concentration of an acid is dependent on the **dilution factor of the solution**, or put in simple terms, the **amount of water added**.

Concentration refers to **the number of acid molecules present per water molecule**.

Concentration is usually expressed in **moldm3**. It can in detail in chapter "Moldm Cooper."

_Wissolies this:_

A strong acid like nitric acid can be very corrosive and dangerous at high concentrations.

However, students use nitric acid on a regular basis in the school laboratories.

To make it safer, the lab staff adds a large amount of water to dilute the nitric acid.

Dilute nitric acid will then be able to be used in the chemical experiments, also being safe to use for the students as it is diluted.

_Gather example:_

We buy ribena syrup from NTUC. Do we drink it straight? No, that will be too sweet because it is so concentrated.

So, what we do is to dilute the syrup by adding water. This is exactly the same for acid!

## Basicity of acid

The basicity of an acid depends the acid's chemical formula.

**Basicity refers to the number of H' ions produced per molecule.**

## What is the relationship between the 3?

**Strength of acid depends on the nature of the acid. Concentration of an acid depends on the dilution factor. Basicity of an acid depends the acid's chemical formula.**

**Can a strong acid have a low concentration of H-ions?**

Yes, use a strong acid like nitric acid and add a large amounts of water to it.

**If we were to compare nitric acid & sulfuric acid, both strong acids, which one will produce a higher concentration of H-ions?**

Even though both strong acids will dissociate fully in water, sulfuric acid would produce a higher concentration of H-ions.

Sulfuric acid is disbasic and has a formula of H\({}_{3}\)SO\({}_{n}\) producing 2 H-ions per molecule.

Nitric acid is monobasch and has a formula of HNO\({}_{3}\), producing 1 H-ions per molecule.

BASE vs ALKALINE

A base is defined as a substance which reacts with an acid to form a salt and water only.

ACID = BASE + SALT + WATER

H\({}_{50}\)+ MgO \(>\) MgSO\({}_{4}\) + H\({}_{5}\)O

Bases are usually the oxides and hydroxides of metals.

Alkaline are a special group of bases that are **soluble in water**. Hence, alkaline have the ability to dissociate fully in water to produce **OH ions**, giving rise to its alkaline properties.

in other words, **alkaline is a subset of base**.

MWHZ

All metal oxides and hydroxides are bases, but not all of them are soluble in water. Only those that are soluble are known as alkaline.

Group metals, such as potassium and sodium, always form alkaline as their oxides and hydroxides are highly soluble.

Group II metals, such as calcium, are slightly soluble, and can be an alkaline as well.

## 6 pH scale

The pH of a solution is a quantitative measure of the extent of acidity or alkalinity. The pH scale ranges from 0 to 14. pH actually stands for,

\[\text{pH}=-\log\left[\text{H+}\right]\]

To simplify, means that if pH values change by a factor of 1, the concentration is changed by a factor of 10. pH 1 is 10 times more acidic than pH 2.

Importance of pH

Food preservatives

Food decompose when it is attacked by bacteria.

Edible acids added and are used as preservatives as bacteria cannot grow well in acidic solutions.

_For example._

ethanoic acid (integer): to preserve vegetables like kimchi

pH levels in soil

If the soil is too acidic, limestone, also known as calcium carbonate CaCO\({}_{y}\) can be added to neutralise the acidity.

Quick lime (CaO) or slaked lime, Ca(OH\({}_{2}\)) can be used too.

pH in human body

Gastric juices in the stomach are acidic due to hydrochloric acid, with a pH of 1.5-2.0.

Fluids in the small intestine are alkaline with a pH of 8+.

Blood is slightly alkaline with a pH in the range of above 7.

_(easy to understand if you take Biology, 'Digestive System'.)_

* [17] Dilute sulfuric acid is added to separate samples of solid substances. Which row is correct? (N2020/P1/Q19)

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|} \hline  & copper & magnesium & zinc oxide & sodium carbonate \\ \hline A & ✓ & ✓ & x & x & key \\ B & ✓ & x & ✓ & x & ✓ = gas evolved \\ C & x & ✓ & x & ✓ & x = no gas evolved \\ D & x & x & ✓ & ✓ & \\ \hline \end{tabular}

### Answer:

* [17] **C** Acids react with (reactive) metalls and metal carbonates to produce hydrogen and carbon dioxide respectively.
