## Relations & Functions

A **relation** is a rule that maps elements of a given set A (input) to elements of a given set B (output). Set A is known as the domain and set B the codomain of the relation.

A **function**! X! X! Y is a relation which maps each element \(x\) in the set X to **one and only one** element \(y\) in the codomain Y (i.e. every input has exactly one output). Functions are subsets of relations.

**Domain (X-Values)**

Set X, the set of x values is called the **domain** of f, denoted by D\({}_{r}\) This is usually defined in the question.

**Range (Y-Values)**

if the element \(e\in X\) is mapped to the element \(b\in Y\), then we write f (\(o\)) = \(b\). \(b\) is called the image of \(o\) under f.

The **range** of f is the set of images of X under f, denoted by R\({}_{r}\)(i.e. the set of y values found when the domain is put into the function).

**Representing Functions**

To define a function, both the rule and domain have to be clearly stated. It is not necessary to state the range of the function. At 'A' Levels most functions considered are relations between real numbers.

E.g. we write:

(1) f : x! -> x + 2, x \(\in\) R+

(2) f (\(o\)) = x + 2, x \(\in\) R+
### Composite Functions

The **composite function**\(g\) is defined as \(g\) f (\(\omega\)) = g [ f (\(\omega\)) ]

If it is a function which maps set X to set Y and g is a function which maps set Y to set Z, then the composite function \(g\) maps set X to set Z

gf denotes applying the mapping of the inner function f followed by the mapping of the outer function g.

The range of gf is the range of g whose domain has been restricted to the range of f. To find the range of gf:

1. Use the domain of f (inner function) to find the range of f

2. Set the range of f to be the new domain of g (outer function)

3. With this new domain of g, find the new range of g

4. This new range of g is the range of gf
