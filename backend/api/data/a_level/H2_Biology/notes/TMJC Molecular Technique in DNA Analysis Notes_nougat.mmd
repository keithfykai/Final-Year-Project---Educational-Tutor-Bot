## Narratives

An understanding of _Genetics and Inheritance_ that would help make sense of the transition from molecular to organismal level. _Genetics and Inheritance_ provides the molecular basis to the understanding of how variations in populations arise and this is important in the study of biological evolution. At the cellular level, expression of genes involves cellular structures such as the nucleus, endoplasmic reticulum and ribosome. Many essential products of gene expression are enzymes involved in biochemical pathways which control physiological functions. As such, mutation of genes may give rise to dysfunctional proteins which in turn could result in diseases. Sickle cell anemia and cancer are raised as examples of a monogenic and a multi-genic disease respectively.

The following questions should help students frame their learning:

* How does the genetic make-up of an organism influence its appearance, behavior and survival?
* How can we ensure continuity of human as a species?

_Heritable information, in the form of DNA (and in some cases RNA), provides for continuity of life_

Genetic information is stored in an organism's DNA; expression of genes results in the synthesis of functional products, such as rRNA, tRNA and proteins. These products play a role in intra- and extra-cellular biochemical pathways and influence the physiological processes in organisms.

Genomes contain heritable information necessary for continuity of life at all levels: cell, organism and system. This information is stored and passed on to subsequent generations via DNA. Reproduction can occur at the cellular or organismal level; each progeny needs to receive heritable genetic information from its parents. Gene expression can be studied using fundamental techniques of molecular biology such as the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), gel electrophoresis, Southern blotting and nucleic acid hybridization.

## 1 Polymerase chain reaction (PCR)

### _Introduction_

The molecular biologist studying a particular gene faces a challenge. Naturally occurring DNA molecules are very long and a single molecule carries many genes. Moreover, in many eukaryotic genomes, genes only occupy a small portion of the chromosomal DNA, the rest being noncoding nucleotide sequences. Hence to work directly with specific genes or other DNA segments, scientists have developed laboratory techniques to obtain **multiple identical copies of a specific DNA sequence**, a process known as _DNA cloning_. The production of multiple copies of a single gene is called _gene cloning_.

DNA cloning can be achieved using cells (e.g. _E.coli_ bacteria) or through **polymerase chain reaction (PCR)** using a thermal cycler. DNA cloning using cells remains the best method for preparing large quantities of a particular gene or DNA sequence. However, when DNA sample for cloning is in small quantities or impure, PCR is a quicker and more selective method by which large quantities of a specific DNA sequence can be obtained in a short time.

Devised in 1985 by Dr. Kary Mullis, PCR revolutionized DNA research. For inventing this method, Dr. Mullis was award the 1993 Nobel Prize in Chemistry.

**Polymerase chain reaction (PCR)**

**Polymerase chain reaction (PCR)** is a technique in which a sequence of DNA is **amplified** (copied many times) _in vitro_ (outside of living organism) using a thermal cycler.

In this method, any specific DNA target segment within one or many DNA molecules can be quickly amplified in a test tube. With automation, PCR can make billions of copies of a target segment of DNA in only a few hours (e.g. 2-3 hours).

#### (b) Three major steps for each PCR cycle

Seps and essential conditions.

One PCR cycle consists of 8 steps (Fig. 1.2a)

* DNA mixture is heated to 95'C
* The double-stranded DNA is separated into 2 complementary single-stranded DNA.
* This is done by **breaking the hydrogen bonds between the complementary base pairs** holding the two strands together.

* The DNA mixture is subsequently **cooled to 55'C**
* This allows the **2 DNA primers to hybridize with/anneal to 3' regions of the single-stranded target DNA via complementary base pairing, and thus **flank** the target DNA.
* **Excess DNA primers** present would also **prevent the DNA strands from reannealing.**

* The DNA mixture is subsequently **heated to 72'C**.

* _Taq polymerase adds_ deoxyribonucleotides to the free 3' OH ends of the DNA primers._
* Both strands of DNA are replicated in **5' to 3' direction** and thus, there are now 2 copies of the original DNA molecule.

* **Each cycle** of the above steps is **repeated 30-40 times**. Each time the cycle is repeated, the amount of DNA is **doubled**. Hence, there is **exponential increase of target DNA sequences** as products.
* **Note:** The target sequence is actually not obtained until the 3' cycle (Fig. 1.2b).

Figure 1: **2b:** The Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR)

### Advantages and Limitations of PCR Advantages:

1. Only **minute amounts of DNA** needs be present in the starting material.
2. A particular gene or DNA sequence of interest can be **amplified to large quantities without using cells** (eg. bacteria).
3. Hence, this is a **faster and more efficient** method since DNA can be **cloned and amplified exponentially within a few hours rather than in days.**
4. PCR is a very **specific** process that **targets only the desired DNA sequence to be copied**. This is because each DNA primer is designed to **anneal to only the 3' regions** that **flink the target DNA sequence** / gene of interest and **not to any other regions** of the genomic DNA.

**Limitations:**

1. PCR is **sensitive**, so **contamination** of sample with extraneous (foreign) DNA can result in unintended sequences being amplified.
2. **The sequence flanking the target DNA needs to be known** for **suitable DNA primers** to be synthesized. Hence, PCR cannot serve as the starting point for the analysis of genes or genomic regions that have not yet been cloned and sequenced.
3. _Taq_ DNA polymerase has **low replication fidelity** since it **lacks a 3' to 5' exonuclease proofreading activity**. There is an error rate of about one in 9,000 nucleotides. Hence, the amplified DNA contains errors which are different from the original sequence, imposing limits on the number of good copies that can be made. * However other thermostable DNA polymerases such as _Pfu_ polymerase, has been discovered in recent years. Unlike _Taq_ DNA polymerase, _Pfu_ DNA polymerase has 3' to 5' exonuclease proofreading activity. Hence, use of _Pfu_ DNA polymerase overcomes this limitation as it gives rise to a lower error rate.
4. Standard PCR **only copies DNA fragments up to 25 kb (25000 bases) in length**; it **cannot amplify longer regions** of interest.

### Applications (FY1)

1. To amplify DNA for cloning or for analysis from small quantities of DNA. Example -

* from extinct organisms (eg. fragments of ancient DNA from a 40,000-year-old frozen wooly mammoth)
* for forensic investigations. From tiny amount of blood, semen or tissues found at the scenes of violent crimes, the tiniest amount of DNA can be amplified for analysis. This helps in the identification of suspects.
2. To test for/detect the presence of specific disease-causing genes. Example -
* an easy, quick and non-intrusive way of making a diagnosis which gives the treatment a much better chance of success.
3. To detect infections. * Amplifying the DNA from a single bacterium or virus using PCR can provide a speedy and accurate diagnosis for serious infections, where getting the right treatment quickly can mean the difference between life and death. PCR is already used in the diagnosis of AIDS, viral meningitis, TB, etc. * To test for the presence of a particular virus in a tissue sample, the virus genome in the sample is tested by using PCR primers that will hybridize to it. If the PCR reaction generates a product, the virus is present. If the virus is not present, the PCR primers will not hybridize and no product will be generated.

* [1] Is PCR a naturally occurring process?
* [2] Differentiate between PCR and DNA Replication:
The average IQ score of humans range between 90 to109. Less than 0.5% of the human population possesses an IQ of above 140. In 2006, a study of a Dutch family indicated a significant correlation between the _CHRMZ_ gene on chromosome 7 and intelligence. You are part of a team of scientists attempting to clone this gene for further, large scale investigation. Since only a very small amount of DNA is available, you decided to use PCR to obtain many copies of this gene.

The figure below shows the DNA nucleotide sequence of the _CHRMZ_ gene (region shaded in grey). The unboxed regions represent sequences flanking the gene.

1. Based on your knowledge of DNA replication, design primers which are 20 nucleotides long to amplify the _CHRMZ_ gene. Write your answer in the figure and state clearly the direction of the primers.

_Points to consider:_

1. Why should there be 2 primers?

2. Where should each primer anneal to?

3. In which direction are the primers extended by _Taq_ polymerase?

4. On which side of strand 1 should primer 1 anneal to? Why?

5. On which side of strand 2 should primer 2 anneal to? Why?

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:13]

### Principles and Procedures

Step (Fig. 22c)

1. Obtain **DNA samples** to be analysed. Each sample is a solution containing DNA fragments of various lengths. The DNA fragments of different lengths are obtained either via PCR or restriction digestion (_Section 3_).
2. The DNA samples are mixed with **loading dye**, which contains **bromophenol blue** and **glycerol.** The mixture is then loaded in the well at one end of a slab of agarose gel.
3. For some experiments, a solution containing **DNA ladder** is loaded into a separate well on the gel (Fig. 2.2c).
4. The gel is submerged in aqueous **buffer** solution (e.g. TAE buffer) in the gel electrophoresis chamber.
5. A **negatively charged electrode (cathode)** is then attached to the chamber at the **DNA-containing end** of the gel and a positive electrode (anode) to the other end. The **DNA molecules** which are **negatively charged** will **migrate towards the positive electrode (anode)** and are **separated according to molecular size.**
6. Gel electrophoresis will separate the **DNA fragments** by their **molecular size/weight** (i.e. length of the DNA fragment). Hence, each sample forms a characteristic pattern of bands on the gel after gel electrophoresis.
7. **Bromophenol blue -** a dye that ** aids in visualizing the loading of DNA sample into the wells**. It also moves ahead of DNA fragments, allowing us to **track the progress of electrophoresis** to ensure that DNA molecules will not migrate out of gel.
8. **Glycerol - increases the density of the mixture, to allow the sample to **sink** to the bottom of the well and not float away into the buffer solution.
9. **DNA ladder -** DNA fragments of **known size/lengths** which serve as **reference** to **estimate the fragment sizes** of the sample.
10. **Buffer -** Contains **ions** which **allow electricity to pass through** the solution. It also **maintains a relatively constant pH** so that **DNA retains its negative charge**, which allows it to **migrate to the positive electrode.**
11. DNA molecules have a high **negative charge** due to the presence of **phosphate groups**.
12. The **DNA molecules** are pulled towards the positive end by the current and through the agarose gel which acts as a **molecular sieve** to separate the DNA fragments by molecular weight.
13. The **smaller molecules** are able to move through the pores of the agarose gel **faster** than the larger molecules, so they will travel **further** in the gel, and vice versa.

### Applications (FYI)

1. Estimate size of DNA molecules \(\circ\) By comparing the bands in a DNA sample to the bands from the DNA ladder, the size of the DNA fragments can be estimated.
2. Analysis of PCR products \(\circ\) Electrophoresis can be carried out on products of PCR on an agarose gel, to determine the results of the amplification (e.g. presence or absence of PCR products). \(\circ\) The amount of DNA in a sample can be estimated. The thicker and more distinct the DNA band, the larger the amount of DNA present.
3. Isolation and Purification of a DNA Sample \(\circ\) After gel electrophoresis, DNA can be recovered undamaged from gels. Hence this procedure provides a way to prepare pure samples of individual fragments. DNA fragment purified from the gel can be subjected to further DNA analysis. (e.g. DNA sequencing to determine nucleotide sequence).

## 3 Southern Blotting and Nucleic acid hybridisation

### Introduction

Nucleic acid gel electrophoresis is widely used to separate DNA/RNA molecules. After gel electrophoresis, there is often a need to **detect one or more DNA/RNA fragments** containing a **specific nucleotide sequence** (e.g. a gene sequence) among many other fragments.

This is often done through **Southern blotting** followed by **nucleic acid hybridization.**

**Southern blotting and nucleic acid hybridization**

* Southern blotting was invented by E.M. Southern in 1975.
* for RNA fragments).
* **Nucleic acid hybridization** is then carried out, where the **DNA** is **denatured and then hybridized** to **a short, single-stranded, radioactively-labelled / fluorescent-labelled DNA/RNA probe**. The probe has a specific sequence that is **complementary to the target DNA** sequence.
* Southern blotting and nucleic acid hybridization are often used when total / genomic DNA undergoes restriction digestion before nucleic acid gel electrophoresis. This is because **too many DNA fragments would be produced to be visualized distinctly using ethidium bromide or DNA-binding dyes**.

### Principles and Procedure

Stets (Fig. 2.2 and Fig. 2.3)

* Obtain the **DNA samples** to be analysed.
* E.g. **extract** the **total DNA** from different organisms or from different cell types.
* Digest the DNA samples with the **appropriate restriction enzyme(s)** (also called endonuclease). This produces restriction fragments of various lengths (Fig 2.2b)
* Each restriction enzyme (Eg. _EcoRJ_) recognizes a **specific** sequence of 4 to 8 nucleotide bases on the DNA molecule, known as a **restriction site.** (_Note: Even a point mutation within one of its restriction sites will prevent the restriction enzyme from recognising it_)
* The restriction enzyme acts on the restriction site by **breaking the phosphodieser bond** between 2 specific nucleotides. It acts like a molecular scissors, cutting up DNA molecules into smaller fragments to produce **restriction fragments of different lengths**.

* Restriction enzymes are **synthesized naturally in bacteria**.

* Each sample is loaded into separate wells in an agarose gel, and then separated by **nucleic acid gel electrophoresis**.

* The DNA fragments **are separated by molecular weight/size**. Hence, each sample containing DNA fragments of varying lengths would form a characteristic pattern of bands.

* **DNA fragments** from the gel are transferred to a sheet of nitrocellulose membrane by capillary action. This means that the nitrocellulose membrane will contain **DNA fragments in a pattern** that is a **replica of** / identical to the agarose gel.
* The DNA fragments on the nitrocellulose membrane are then **denatured** into **single-stranded DNA** by adding **sodium hydroxide (NaOH) solution.**
* **NaOH** causes the hydrogen bonds between the complementary base pairs of the double-stranded DNA to **break**.

* **Carry out nucleic acid hybridization:**

* Incubate the nitrocellulose membrane with **many copies** of **short, single-stranded, radioactively/floorescent-labelled DNA/RNA probe**
* The probe undergoes complementary base pairing** by forming **hydrogen bonds** with the target DNA sequence.

* **Probes are labelled to detect the presence and/or location** of specific DNA fragment that it hybridizes to.**

* **Complementary base pairing ensures specificity of the probe to the target DNA with the target DNA sequence.**

**and not to other DNA sequences.**

Figure 2.2b: EcoRI (a restriction enzyme) detects a specific sequence GATTC (_E_coRI restriction site) on the DNA and cuts it, generating restriction fragments.

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:20]

Figure 3.2b: Various steps in Southern Blotting and Nucleic acid hybridization.

### Applications (FYI)

1. To determine the presence or absence of a target DNA sequence (e.g. a gene) in a DNA sample.
2. To isolate DNA fragment containing the target sequence for further analysis: Example - \(\circ\) Carry out sequencing to determine the full length sequence of a specific gene, or \(\circ\) Discover functionally related genes with similar sequence.
3. To test genetically modified organisms (GMOs) to ensure that the specific gene inserted has been successfully incorporated into the genome of the host organism.
4. To allow for DNA fingerprinting through analysis of restriction fragment patterns. * When a sample of DNA is digested by a certain restriction enzyme and the fragments are separated by electrophoresis, a band pattern characteristic of that DNA molecule and the restriction enzyme used is obtained. This unique pattern of DNA fragments which differ from individual to individual is known as DNA fingerprint. * DNA fingerprinting is used in - 1. Crime Scene Investigation-In solving criminal cases, this method can be used to compare DNA samples from the crime scene, suspect and victim. 2. Paternity Testing- In paternity testing, comparison between the DNA of mother, child and supposed father can determine parentage. Each DNA band from the child must coincide with either the father or the mother. (Fig. 3.3) 3. Phylogenetic relationship for evolutionary study- In determining phylogenetic relationship / molecular homology among different species of organisms. The more closely related two species are, the more similar the band patterns (Refer to lecture on Biological Evolution).
