## 1 Introduction

### Reversible Reaction

[lines=1pt,leftmargin=*]

LO (a) Explain, in terms of rates of the forward and reverse reactions, what is meant by a _reversible reaction_ and _dynamic equilibrium_

[lines=1pt,leftmargin=*]

**Notation:** A reversible reaction is denoted by using the \(\rightleftharpoons\) sign in the equation.

1. A **reversible reaction** is a reaction where the _reactants form products that can react with each other to re-form the reactants_. In other words, the reaction proceeds in either direction.

_E.g._ Haber Process: N2(g) + 3H2(g) \(\rightleftharpoons\) 2NH3(g)

* Both forward and backward reactions occur.
* As soon as NH3 molecules are formed (_forward reaction_), some of the NH3 molecules formed will decompose to form N2 and H2 (_backward reaction_).
* Thus, in a reversible reaction, the reactants are _never completely_ converted to the products. Instead, a mixture of products and reactants will be obtained.
2. Convention: A + B \(\rightleftharpoons\) C + D \(\Delta H\) = endothermic or exothermic * A & B are referred to as _reactants_ and C & D as _products of the forward reaction_.
* A + B \(\rightarrow\) C + D is called the _forward_ reaction.
* C + D \(\rightarrow\) A + B is called the _backward_ reaction.
* \(\Delta H\) indicates the enthalpy change of the _forward_ reaction.
* If \(\Delta H\) is positive, the forward reaction is _endothermic_.
* If \(\Delta H\) is negative, the forward reaction is _exothermic_.
3. Some processes proceed in a _single direction_ or are _irreversible_ because they take place in an _open_ system (see Fig. 1(a)), where some of the products can escape, making the backward reaction impossible.

_E.g._ Mg(s) + 2HC_k_(aq) \(\rightarrow\) MgC_k_(aq) + H2(g)

Chemical reactions, in principle, are all reversible in a _closed_ system, though some may appear to go to completion (see Fig. 1(b)).

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:4]

### Characteristics of a State of Dynamic Equilibrium

1. When a system is at a state of equilibrium, the _concentration of all reactants and products remain constant_ and an equilibrium mixture is obtained.
2. At equilibrium, the _rate of forward reaction is equal to the rate of the backward reaction_.
3. _Equilibrium can only be achieved in a closed system_, where there is no loss or gain of substances to and from the surroundings.
4. _Equilibrium can be established from either direction_. In an equilibrium mixture, all species are present and A state of equilibrium can be established from any initial system e.g. in its properties (_i.e._ ) products only (Fig. 2(b))
5. a mixture of reactants and products (Fig. 2(c))

When the equilibrium for each of the systems is reached, you can observe a certain ratio between the equilibrium concentration for the reactant and product species. However, the concentration of each species present at equilibrium will depend on how much of each species was present in the system initially (_this will be discussed in detail in the later part of the notes_).

## 2 Equilibrium Constants, \(K_{\text{c}}\) and \(K_{\text{p}}\)

The equilibrium constant indicates the proportion of products to reactants in an equilibrium mixture. It applies only to a system in equilibrium and is written based on the given chemical equation.

### Equilibrium Constant \(K_{\text{c}}\)

Consider the following general reversible reaction:

\[a\mathbf{A}\ +\ b\mathbf{B}\rightleftharpoons\mathbf{c}\mathbf{C}\ +\ d\mathbf{D}\]

A series of experiments can be carried out using different initial amounts of \(\mathbf{A}\) and \(\mathbf{B}\) and allowing the reaction to reach equilibrium at the same temperature. For each experiment, the **equilibrium concentrations** of reactants and products can be measured to determine the **equilibrium constant (\(K_{\text{c}}\))**.

\[K_{\text{c}}=\frac{[\mathbf{C}]_{\text{eqm}}^{\text{c}}[\mathbf{D}]_{\text{eqm }}^{d}}{[\mathbf{A}]_{\text{eqm}}^{\text{a}}[\mathbf{B}]_{\text{eqm}}^{\text{b }}}\]

where \([\ ]_{\text{eqm}}\) denotes the **equilibrium concentration** of the substance in mol dm\({}^{-3}\)and the value of \(K_{\text{c}}\) is **non-zero**.

### Eunoa Junior College

Figure 2: Equilibrium \(\mathbf{A}\rightleftharpoons\mathbf{C}\) is established **(a)** from only \(\mathbf{A}\), **(b)** only \(\mathbf{C}\) **(c)** a mixture of \(\mathbf{A}\) and \(\mathbf{C}\)
#### 2.1.1 Homogeneous vs. Heterogeneous Equilibrium

* A **homogeneous equilibrium** involves substances that are **all in the same phase**. This include aqueous solution in which water is the solvent.
* A **heterogeneous equilibrium** involves substances that are **in different phases**.

_Phase: Any uniform part of a system which is different from the rest of the system and separated from it by a distinct boundary. E.g. solid, liquid, gas and aqueous are different phases._

_How many phases are there for a glass of oil floating on water?_

LO (d) deduce expressions for equilibrium constants in terms of concentrations, \(K\), and partial pressures. \(K_{\rm c}\) [treatment of the relationship between \(K_{\rm\varphi}\) and \(K_{\rm c}\) is **not** required]

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:8]

**For heterogeneous equilibria:**

* \(K_{\text{c}}\) **expression does NOT include the concentration of solids and liquids.**
* **Why are concentrations of solids omitted in the** \(K_{\text{c}}\) **expression?**

The concentration of a solid is a constant.

\[\text{Derivation:}\] **Since** \[[\text{solid}]=\frac{\text{amount}}{\text{volume}}\text{ and amount}=\frac{\text{mass}}{\text{ molar mass}}\] \[\text{Therefore, }[\text{solid}]=\frac{\text{mass}}{\text{volume}\times \text{molar mass}}=\frac{\text{density}}{\text{molar mass}}=\text{constant}\]

**Although the concentration of these species (solid or water [if aqueous medium]) are not included in the equilibrium expression, they do participate in the reaction and must be present in order for an equilibrium to be established.**

\[\text{LO}\] **(e) calculate the values of equilibrium constants in terms of concentrations or partial pressures from appropriate data**

**(f) calculate the quantities present at equilibrium, given appropriate data (such calculations will not require the solving of quadratic equations)**

#### 2.1.2 Calculation of \(K_{\text{c}}\) from Concentrations

**Equible 2:**

**In a vessel, the initial concentrations of H**\({}_{2}\)**(g), I**\({}_{2}\)**(g) and HI (g) are 0.75, 0.83 and 0.11 mol dm**\({}^{-3}\) **respectively. Concentration of H**\({}_{2}\)**(g) is 0.15 mol dm**\({}^{-3}\) **when equilibrium is established at 731 K. Calculate** \(K_{\text{c}}\) **for the reaction, H**\({}_{2}\)**(g) + I**\({}_{2}\)**(g) \(\rightleftharpoons\) 2HI (g).**

**Example 2:1** (N=276/50)

For the reaction CH\({}_{3}\)CO\({}_{2}\)H(\(\beta\)) + C\({}_{2}\)H\({}_{5}\)OH(\(\beta\)) \(\rightleftharpoons\) CH\({}_{3}\)CO\({}_{2}\)C\({}_{2}\)H\({}_{5}\)(\(\beta\)) + H\({}_{2}\)O(\(\beta\)), the value of the equilibrium constant, \(K_{\rm c}\), is 4.0.

**Solution**

**(a)**: CH\({}_{3}\)CO\({}_{2}\)C\({}_{2}\)H\({}_{5}\)(\(\beta\)) + H\({}_{2}\)O(\(\beta\)) = CH\({}_{3}\)CO\({}_{2}\)H(\(\beta\)) + C\({}_{2}\)H\({}_{5}\)OH(\(\beta\))

where \(V\) is the volume of the reaction vessel.

(Note: S1 means Step 1, S2 means Step 2... and the sequence is unique to this question)

\[K_{\rm c}^{\prime}=\frac{\left[\text{CH}_{3}\text{CO}_{2}\text{H} \right]\left[\text{C}_{2}\text{H}_{5}\text{OH}\right]}{\left[\text{CH}_{3} \text{CO}_{2}\text{C}_{2}\text{H}_{5}\right]\left[\text{H}_{2}\text{O}\right] }=\frac{\left(\frac{x}{V}\right)\left(\frac{x}{V}\right)}{\left(\frac{2-x}{V} \right)}\] \[\frac{1}{4.0}=\left(\frac{x}{2-x}\right)^{2}\] \[\frac{x}{2-x}=\pm\frac{1}{2}\] \[x=\frac{2}{3}\text{ or }-2\text{(rejected)}\]

## 2.2 Calculation of Partial Pressures from \(K_{\rho}\)

### 2.3 Interpreting and Working with Equilibrium Constants

1. The value of equilibrium constant \(K_{\rm c}\) or \(K_{\rm b}\) is **not affected** by concentration or partial pressure of reactants and products, pressure of the system, the presence of catalysts, and does not depend on reaction mechanism.

The value of \(K_{\rm c}\) or \(K_{\rm b}\) for a reversible reaction only depends on TEMPERATURE

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:15]

* However, equilibrium constants do not give any information on:
* rates of forward and backward reactions
* time required for the reaction to reach equilibrium.
* These two sets of data can only be obtained experimentally.
* Equilibrium constants can only be determined _experimentally_.

### Experimental determination of \(K_{c}\) [N83/P1/O3(part)]

Describe, with essential experimental details, how you would determine the equilibrium constant, \(K_{c}\), for the following reaction:

\[\text{CH}_{3}\text{COOH}(l)+\text{CH}_{3}\text{CH}_{2}\text{OH}(l)\rightleftharpoons CH_{3}\text{COOCH}_{2}\text{CH}_{3}(l)+\text{H}_{2}\text{O}(l)\]

Mix a known amount of CH3COOH and CH3CH2OH in a conical flask. Allow the solution to stand for some time to establish equilibrium (why?). When equilibrium is established at a fixed temperature, the reaction mixture is then rapidly cooled (why?), followed by titrating a fixed volume of the mixture rapidly (why?) with standard NaOH(aq) to determine the concentration of CH3COOH in the equilibrium mixture. The concentrations of other species in the equilibrium mixture are then calculated and hence, \(K_{c}\) can be calculated.

\[K_{c}=\frac{\left[\text{CH}_{3}\text{COOCH}_{2}\text{CH}_{3}\right]_{\text{ eqn}}\left[\text{H}_{2}\text{O}\right]_{\text{eqn}}}{\left[\text{CH}_{3}\text{COOH}\right]_{\text{eqn}} \left[\text{CH}_{3}\text{CH}_{2}\text{OH}\right]_{\text{eqn}}}\]

The above procedure is repeated at the same temperature by using different initial amounts of CH3COOH and CH3CH2OH so that an average value of \(K_{c}\) at that particular temperature can be obtained.

## 3 Gibbs Free Energy and Equilibrium Constant

Important concepts to remember:

1. _I need to know that ALL equilibrium constants are temperature dependent._
2. _I need to know that larger the equilibrium constant, the greater the extent of the reaction i.e. position of equilibrium lies towards the product side._
3. _I need to know that equilibrium constant DOES NOT indicate the kinetics of the reaction, i.e. it doesn't tell us how fast the reaction is._
4. _I need to know how plan an experiment to determine the equilibrium constant._

LO (g) show understanding that the position of equilibrium is dependent on the standard Gibbs free energy change of reaction, \(\Delta G\). [Quantitative treatment is not required]

## 3 Gibbs Free Energy and Equilibrium Constant

### \(\Delta G^{\circ}\) and State of Dynamic Equilibrium

Whether a reaction is spontaneous or not depends on the value of \(\Delta G\) at that particular composition.

* If \(\Delta G^{\circ}<0\), the reaction proceeds in the direction of **forward reaction** which is **spontaneous**; the forward reaction occurs at a faster rate than the backward reaction (when equilibrium has yet to reach).
* If \(\Delta G^{\circ}>0\), the reaction proceeds in the direction of **backward reaction** which is **spontaneous**; the backward reaction occurs at a faster rate than the forward reaction (when equilibrium has yet to reach).
* If \(\Delta G=0\), the system is in **dynamic equilibrium**; rate of forward reaction is equal to rate of backward reaction (at equilibrium).

Hence, the **condition for a system in a state of dynamic equilibrium at a particular**

**constant temperature and pressure is \(\Delta G=0\)** (i.e. \(G\) is at its minimum).

### \(\Delta G^{\circ}\) and Equilibrium Constant

\(\Delta G\) represents the change in Gibbs free energy of a reaction at any composition of the reaction mixture at a particular constant temperature (which may not be under standard conditions).

\(\Delta G\) is also related to the change in _standard_ Gibbs free energy \((\Delta G^{\circ})\) as follows:

\(\Delta G=\Delta G^{\circ}+RT\ln Q\)

where \(Q\) is the reaction quotient.

When a system is at a state of equilibrium at a particular constant temperature, \(Q=K\) and \(\Delta G=0\) where \(K\)is the equilibrium constant. Hence \(\Delta G^{\circ}\) is related to equilibrium constant of a reaction as:

\(\Delta G^{\circ}=-RT\ln K=-2.303\) RT \(\lg K\)

So the sign and value of \(\Delta G^{\circ}\) provides information on the position of equilibrium:

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|} \hline \(\Delta G^{\circ}\ll 0\) & \(K\gg 1\) & position of equilibrium lies to **far right** \\  & (reaction goes almost to completion) & \\ \hline \(\Delta G^{\circ}\gg 0\) & \(K\ll 1\) & position of equilibrium lies to **far left** \\  & (reaction hardly proceeds) & \\ \hline \end{tabular}

Take note that the **sign of**

\(\Delta G^{\circ}\) only provides

information about whether a reaction is spontaneous or not

under **standard** conditions.

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:18]

## 3 Gibbs FreeEnergyand Equilibrium Constant

_Why is this so?_:

**At a constant temperature**,** \(K_{\text{c}}\) **is a constant** and** \(K_{\text{c}}=\frac{[\text{C}]}{[\text{A}]}\)**.**

**Supposing denominator [A] is increased, the fraction** \(\frac{[\text{C}]}{[\text{A}]}\) **decreases at that instant. The system is no longer at equilibrium. To re-establish equilibrium, [A] would need to decrease (react away some A) while [C] would increase (more C is formed) until the fraction** \(\frac{[\text{C}]}{[\text{A}]}\) **becomes equal to** \(K_{\text{c}}\) **again.**..System is at equilibrium once again.

**Example 4A**.

**State and explain the effect of the following changes on the position of equilibrium of**

\(N_{2}(g)\) **+** \(3H_{2}(g)\) **** \(2NH_{3}(g)\)****

**(a)**: **Addition of ammonia******

**When ammonia is added, the** **position of equilibrium******shifts to the** **left****** **to******remove****** **some******of the ammonia that was added.****
**(b)**: **Removal of nitrogen******

**When nitrogen is removed, the** **position of equilibrium******shifts to the** **left****** **to******form some******of the nitrogen that was removed.****
**(c)**: **Increase partial pressure of hydrogen******

**When partial pressure of hydrogen is increased, the** **position of equilibrium******shifts to the** **right****** **to******\(P_{\text{h}_{\text{c}}}=\frac{n_{\text{h}}RT}{V}\) **(**\(V\) &** \(T\) **constant)******

**remove some******of the hydrogen******added******.** **.** \(\therefore\) **\(\uparrow\) **in** \(P_{\text{h}_{\text{c}}}\Rightarrow\) **addition of H**\({}_{2}\)****

**(2)**: **Note that:**

**If a large excess of one reactant is used, the position of equilibrium can be made to shift towards the right-hand-side.**
**If the product in the equilibrium mixture is continuously removed, the forward reaction can go to** _completion_ **because the position of equilibrium is continuously shifted to the right.**

**(3)**: **The concentration of reactants and products in the** _new equilibrium_ **can be calculated:**

## Chapter 3 Gibbs Free Energyand Equilibrium Constant

### 3.1 Example 4.1

The system \(\mathbf{A}\rightleftharpoons\mathbf{B}\) is in equilibrium at 75 \({}^{\circ}\)C with 10 mol dm\({}^{-3}\) of \(\mathbf{A}\) and 5 mol dm\({}^{-3}\) of \(\mathbf{B}\). If the concentration of \(\mathbf{A}\) in the equilibrium mixture is increased by 7.5 mol dm\({}^{-3}\), what will be the concentration of \(\mathbf{A}\) and \(\mathbf{B}\) when equilibrium is established again at the same temperature?

Given \(K_{\text{c}}=0.50\) at 75 \({}^{\circ}\)C.

### Effect of Temperature Changes

1. According to Le Chatelier's principle, if the temperature of an equilibrium mixture _increases_, the system will respond to _decrease_ the temperature by _absorbing_**some of the heat**, hence shifting the position of equilibrium towards the _endothermic_ direction.
2. \(K_{c}\) **and \(K_{b}\) are only affected by changes in temperature**. Consider the equilibrium \(aA(g)\ +\ bB(g)\rightleftharpoons cC(g)\ +\ dD(g)\) Given, \(K_{c}=\frac{[C]_{\text{e}orn}^{c}\left[D\right]_{\text{e}orn}^{d}}{[A]_{\text{ e}orn}^{a}\left[B\right]_{\text{e}orn}^{b}}\) and \(K_{b}=\frac{P_{c}^{c}\times p_{b}^{d}}{P_{\text{a}}^{a}\times p_{\text{b}}^{b}}\) 1. If \(\Delta H\) is negative (_exothermic_): * As temperature _increases_, the position of equilibrium shifts to the left to favour the endothermic reaction so as to \(\underline{\text{absorb}}\) some heat, resulting in less products at equilibrium, hence \(K_{c}\) (or \(K_{b}\)) decreases.

Changes to concentration and rate when temperature increases for an exothermic reaction: \(3H_{2}+N_{2}\rightleftharpoons 2NH_{3}\)

* As temperature _decreases_, the position of equilibrium shifts to the right to favour the exothermic reaction so as to \(\underline{\text{produce}}\) some heat, resulting in more products at equilibrium, hence \(K_{c}\) (or \(K_{b}\)) increases.
* If \(\Delta H\) is positive (_endothermic_):
* As temperature _increases_, the position of equilibrium shifts to the right to favour the endothermic reaction so as to \(\underline{\text{absorb}}\) some heat, resulting in more products at equilibrium, hence \(K_{c}\) (or \(K_{b}\)) increases.

### Effect of Addition of Catalyst

A catalyst is a substance which **increases** the **rate of a reaction** by providing an _alternative reaction pathway with a lower activation energy_, without itself undergoing any permanent chemical change. Thus, catalysts generally do not appear in the overall chemical equation as reactants or products.

As shown in Fig. 4, catalyst lowers the activation energy of the forward and backward reactions **by the same extent**. This means the rate constant of the forward and backward reactions will be increased by the same extent** (recall Arrhenius equation, \(k=A\textbf{e}^{\frac{E_{a}}{RT}}\)).

Since rate is directly proportional to rate constant, presence of catalyst increases the rates of both the forward and backward reactions by the same extent. This implies that the presence of catalyst does not affect the position of equilibrium and the system merely reaches equilibrium faster (see Fig. 5).

To conclude, the presence or absence of catalyst _does not affect the position of equilibrium and equilibrium constant_, \(K_{c}\) or \(K_{b}\).

Important concepts to remember:

1. _[label=()]_
2. _I need to know that catalyst DOES NOT affect the_ \(K_{c}\)__
3. _I need to know that catalyst increase both forward and backward rate by same extent, hence, system reach equilibrium in a shorter time._

The Haber Process

LO (h) describe and explain the conditions used in the Haber process, as an example of the importance of an understanding of chemical equilibrium in the chemical industry

## 5 The Haber Process

Industrial Equilibrium Reactions

Many important industrial reactions are reversible reactions.

* The principles of reaction kinetics and chemical equilibria are important in the design and working conditions of industrial processes
* The speed, efficiency and economy with which products can be obtained from starting materials determine the economic and commercial competitiveness of the process.
* The aims of the chemist are to convert the reactants into products:
* as quickly as possible : **KINETICS*
* with as high a yield as possible : **EQUILIBRIUM*
* as cheaply as possible
* Costs can be minimised by:
* using the cheapest reagents (_e.g._ air and water)
* making the reaction as rapid as possible (_e.g._ by using catalysts)
* avoiding very high temperatures, if possible
* avoiding very high pressures, if possible

### Operating Conditions

The classic example of the practical use of the Le Chatelier's Principle is the **Haber Process**.

\(\text{N}_{2}(\text{g})\) + \(3\text{H}_{2}(\text{g})\)\(\rightleftharpoons\) 2NH\({}_{3}(\text{g})\)\(\Delta H\) = -92.4 kJ mol-1

The operating conditions are typically as follows:

* Temperature: **450 \({}^{\circ}\)C**
* Pressure: **250 atm**
* Catalyst: **Finely divided iron**

### Explaining the Conditions

1. **Temperature** When temperature decreases, the position of equilibrium will shift to the **right** to favour the **exothermic** reaction so as to produce some heat, thereby **increasing** the yield of ammonia. However, the reaction is **slow** at low temperature _due to low frequency of effective collisions between molecules_ arise from the energy needed to break the strong N=N bond. Therefore, a **compromise** temperature of 450 \({}^{\circ}\)C (_not too high or too low_) is used to achieve reasonably high yield of ammonia at reasonably high rate.

## Annex A

### Annex A (For pleasure reading)

\(\mathbf{A1:\Delta G^{\oplus}}\) and Equilibrium Constant

Determining whether a reaction goes to completion: Threshold \(\Delta G^{\oplus}\) value

An effectively complete reaction is one that gives a yield of 99.99% products.

Hence, for a reaction \(R\rightleftharpoons P\) that goes to completion at 298 K,

\[\Delta G^{\oplus} =-RT\ln K=-RT\ln\frac{[P]}{[R]}=-RT\ln\frac{99.99}{0.01}=-8.31 \times 298\times\ln 9999\] \[=-22.8\ kJ\ mol^{-1}\]

In other words, at 298 K, any reaction with a value of \(\Delta G^{\oplus}<-22.8\ kJ\ mol^{-1}\) will go to completion.

Using the same mathematical relationship, reactions with \(\Delta G^{\oplus}>+22.8\ kJ\ mol^{-1}\) will not occur to any noticeable extent (yield of 0.01% products). This value of \(\Delta G^{\oplus}\) is called the threshold value.

Based on this mathematical relationship, we can deduce that the magnitude of the threshold value of \(\Delta G^{\oplus}\) increases (_i.e._ becomes more positive or more negative) as the temperature increases.

For example, for a reaction to go to completion at 750 K,

\[\Delta G^{\oplus} =-RT\ln K=-RT\ln\frac{[P]}{[R]}=-8.31\times 750\times\ln 9999\] \[=-57.4\ kJ\ mol^{-1}\]

### A2: Effect of Temperature Changes on Equilibrium Constant

Quantitative illustration of effect of changing temperature on the position of equilibrium

In Section 4, we established the relationship between standards Gibbs energy change, \(\Delta G^{\oplus}\) for a reaction and the equilibrium constant, \(K\), \(\Delta G^{\oplus}=-RT\ln K\). In the topic of thermodynamics, we have learnt that \(\Delta G^{\oplus}=\Delta H^{\oplus}-T\Delta S^{\oplus}\).

Equating both equations will give us

\[-RT\ln K =\Delta H^{\oplus}-T\Delta S^{\oplus}\] \[\ln K =\frac{\Delta S^{\oplus}}{R}-\frac{\Delta H^{\oplus}}{RT}\]

Since \(\Delta S^{\oplus}\) is independent of temperature,

\[\ln K =\text{constant}-\frac{\Delta H^{\oplus}}{RT}\text{, where the constant is }\frac{\Delta S^{\oplus}}{R}\] \[\text{For an exothermic reaction }\left(\Delta H^{\oplus}<0\right)\text{, }-\frac{ \Delta H^{\oplus}}{RT}\text{ is positive}\]

As temperature increases, \(-\frac{\Delta H^{\oplus}}{RT}\) becomes less positive

In \(K\), and hence \(K\) decreases

A larger proportion of reactants will form (_i.e._ position of equilibrium shifts to left)

Eunoa Junior CollegeThe slope of the graph corresponds to \(\Delta\)G. When substances are mixed together, the reaction will proceed in the direction where there is a decrease in Gibbs free energy (\(\Delta\)G is negative) and hence spontaneous. They will react until **a state of equilibrium is reached where the system's Gibbs free energy is at its minimum** (i.e. \(\Delta\)G = 0).

As can be seen from Fig. 8 above, \(\Delta\)G is equal to zero at a certain ratio of products to reactants (_i.e._ composition). This explains why when a system at equilibrium is disturbed by the addition or removal of reactants or products, the position of equilibrium shifts to restore equilibrium.
