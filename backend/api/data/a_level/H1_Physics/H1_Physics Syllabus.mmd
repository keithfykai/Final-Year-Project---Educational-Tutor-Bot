Physics

(Syllabus 8867)

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:2]

## Introduction

The syllabus has been designed to build on and extend the content coverage at O-Level. Candidates will be assumed to have knowledge and understanding of Physics at O-Level, either as a single subject or as part of a balanced science course.

### Aims

The aims of a course based on this syllabus should be to:

1. provide students with an experience that develops their interest in physics and builds the knowledge, skills and attitudes necessary for them to become scientifically literate citizens who are well-prepared for the challenges of the 21st century.
2. develop in students the understanding, skills, ethics and attitudes relevant to the _Practices of Science_, including the following: 1. understanding the nature of scientific knowledge 2.2 demonstrating science inquiry skills 2.3 relating science and society
3. develop in students an understanding that a small number of basic principles and core ideas can be applied to explain, analyse and solve problems in a variety of systems in the physical world.

## Practices of Science

Science as a discipline is more than the acquisition of a body of knowledge (e.g. scientific facts, concepts, laws, and theories) it is a way of knowing and doing. It includes an understanding of the nature of scientific knowledge and how this knowledge is generated, established and communicated. Scientists rely on a set of established procedures and practices associated with scientific inquiry to gather evidence and test their ideas on how the natural world works. However, there is no single method and the real process of science is often complex and iterative, following many different paths. While science is powerful, generating knowledge that forms the basis for many technological feats and innovations, it has limitations.

The Practices of Science are explicitly articulated in this syllabus to allow teachers to embed them as learning objectives in their lessons. Students' understanding of the nature and the limitations of science and scientific inquiry are developed effectively when the practices are taught in the context of relevant science content. Attitudes relevant to science such as _inquistiveness_, _concem for accuracy_ and _precision, objectivity, integrity_ and _perseverance_ should be emphasised in the teaching of these practices where appropriate. For example, students learning science should be introduced to the use of technology as an aid in practical work or as a tool for the interpretation of experimental and theoretical results.

The Practices of Science comprise three components:

1. Understanding the Nature of Scientific Knowledge

1.1 Understand that science is an evidence-based, model-building enterprise concerned with the natural world

1.2 Understand that the use of both logic and creativity is required in the generation of scientific knowledge

1.3 Recognise that scientific knowledge is generated from consensus within the community of scientists through a process of critical debate and peer review

1.4 Understand that scientific knowledge is reliable and durable, yet subject to revision in the light of new evidence

2. Demonstrating Science Inquiry Skills

2.1 Identify scientific problems, observe phenomena and pose scientific questions/hypotheses

2.2 Plan and conduct investigations by selecting appropriate experimental procedures, apparatus and materials, with due regard for accuracy, precision and safety

2.3 Obtain, organise and represent data in an appropriate manner

2.4 Analyse and interpret data

2.5 Construct explanations based on evidence and justify these explanations through reasoning and logical argument

2.6 Use appropriate models1 to explain concepts, solve problems and make predictions

2.7 Make decisions based on evaluation of evidence, processes, claims and conclusions

2.8 Communicate scientific findings and information using appropriate language and terminology

3. Relating Science and Society

3.1 Recognise that the application of scientific knowledge to problem solving could be influenced by other considerations such as economic, social, environmental and ethical factors

3.2 Demonstrate an understanding of the benefits and risks associated with the application of science to society

3.3 Use scientific principles and reasoning to understand, analyse and evaluate real-world systems as well as to generate solutions for problem solving

## CORE IDEAS IN PHYSICS

* Physics encompasses the study of systems spanning a wide scale of distances and times: from 10-15 m (e.g. sub-atomic particles) to larger than 1030 m (e.g. galaxies), from near-instantaneous events such as current flow with a flock of a switch to slow-evolving phenomenon such as the birth and death of a star.
* A small number of basic principles and laws can be applied in the study and interpretation of this wide variety of simple and complex systems. Similarly, a few core ideas that cut across traditional content boundaries can be introduced in the curriculum to provide students with a broader way of thinking about the physical world.
* These _Core Ideas_ are fundamental in the study of physics and help students integrate knowledge and link concepts across different topics. They provide powerful analytical tools which can explain phenomena and solve problems.

### Systems and Interactions

#### Defining the systems

under study (by specifying their _boundaries_ and making explicit a _models_ of the systems) provides tools for understanding and testing ideas that are applicable throughout physics.

#### Objects

can be treated as having no _internal structure_ or an internal structure that can be ignored. A _system_, on the other hand, is a collection of objects with an internal structure which may need to be taken into account.

Physical events and phenomena can be understood by studying the _interactions_ between objects in a system and with the environment.

Students should be able to identify _causal relationships_ when analysing interactions and _changes_ in a system.

Interactions between objects in a system can be modelled using _forces_ (e.g. a system of forces being applied to move a mass; a system of two masses colliding; a system of the moon orbiting around the earth; a system of electrical charges; a system of current in a straight wire placed in a magnetic field).

Fields existing in space are used to explain interactions between objects that are not in contact. Forces at a distance are explained by fields that can transfer _energy_ and can be described in terms of the arrangement and properties of the interacting objects. These forces can be used to describe the relationship between electrical and magnetic fields.

#### Equilibrium

is a unique state where the relevant physical properties of a system are balanced (e.g. equilibrium in a single particle arises if there is no resultant force acting on it, a rigid body is considered to be in equilibrium if, in addition, there is no resultant moment about any point).

Simplified _microscopic_ models can explain _macroscopic_ properties observed in systems with complex and random interactions between a large number of objects:

Microscopic models are applied in the study of electricity. Macroscopic properties (e.g. current) are used to investigate interactions and changes in these systems.

These macroscopic properties can be linked to complex interactions at the microscopic level, for example: the half-life of unstable nuclei decaying randomly.

Such complex systems may also be better characterised by _statistical averages_ (e.g. half life) as these quantities may be more meaningful than the properties and behaviours of individual components (e.g. which unstable nuclei is decaying and when).

## 2 Models and Representations

### Models

use reasonable _approximations_ to simplify real-world phenomena in order to arrive at useful ways to explain or analyse systems.

The awareness of the approximations used in a proposed model allows one to estimate the _validity_ and _reliability_ of that model.

Models are tested through observations and experiments and should be _consistent with available evidence_; models can evolve and be refined in the light of new evidence.

The assumptions made in defining a system will determine how interactions are described and analysed. Understanding the limits of these assumptions is a fundamental aspect of modelling.

The use of _representations_ is inherent in the process of constructing a model. Examples of representations are pictures, motion diagrams, graphs, energy bar charts and mathematical equations.

Mathematics is an important tool in physics. It is used as a _language_ to describe the relationships between different physical quantities and to solve numerical problems.

Representations and models help in analysing phenomena, solving problems, making predictions and communicating ideas.

#### Conservation Laws

Conservation laws are fundamental among the principles in physics used to understand the physical world.

When analysing physical events or phenomena, the choice of system and associated conservation laws provides a powerful set of tools to use to predict the possible outcome of an interaction.

Conservation laws _constrain_ the possible behaviours of objects in a system, or the outcome of an interaction or process.

Associated with every conservation law in classical physics is a physical quantity, a scalar or a vector, which characterises a system.

In a _closed_ system, the associated physical quantity has a constant value independent of interactions between objects in the system. In an _open_ system, the changes of the associated physical quantity are always equal to the transfer of that quantity to or from the system by interactions with other systems.

In physics, charge, momentum, mass-energy and angular momentum are conserved.

#### Examples of how conservation laws are used in our syllabus:

7.1 conservation of momentum in collisions and explosions allowing prediction of subsequent motion of the objects or particles.

7.2 conservation of energy to calculate change in total energy in systems that are open to energy transfer due to external forces (work is done).

7.3 conservation of mass-energy, charge and nucleon number in nuclear reactions to enable the calculation of relevant binding energies and identification of the resulting nuclides.

## 3 CURRICULUM FRAMEWORK

The _Practices of Science, Core Ideas_ in physics and _Learning Experiences_ are put together in a framework (**Fig. 1**) to guide the development of the H1 Physics curriculum.

The _Practices of Science_ are common to the natural sciences of physics, chemistry and biology. These practices highlight the ways of thinking and doing that are inherent in the scientific approach, with the aim of equipping students with the understanding, skills, and attitudes shared by the scientific disciplines, including an appropriate approach to ethical issues. The _Core Ideas_ help students to integrate knowledge and link concepts across different topics, and highlight important themes that recur throughout the curriculum. The syllabus content is organised into sections according to the main branches and knowledge areas of physics, i.e. _Newtonian Mechanics, Electricity and Magnetism_, and _Nuclear Physics_ to allow for a focused, systematic and in-depth treatment of topics within each section.

The _Learning Experiences2_ refer to a range of learning opportunities selected by teachers to link the physics content with the _Core Ideas_ and the _Practices of Science_ to enhance students' learning of the concepts. Rather than being mandatory, teachers are encouraged to incorporate _Learning Experiences_ that match the interests and abilities of their students and provide opportunities to illustrate and exemplify the _Practices of Science_, where appropriate. Real-world contexts can help illustrate the concepts in physics and their applications. Experimental activities and ICT tools can also be used to build students' understanding.

## Glossary of Terms Used in Physics Papers

It is hoped that the glossary will prove helpful to candidates as a guide, although it is not exhaustive. The glossary has been deliberately kept brief not only with respect to the number of terms included but also to the descriptions of their meanings. Candidates should appreciate that the meaning of a term must depend in part on its context. They should also note that the number of marks allocated for any part of a question is a guide to the depth of treatment required for the answer.

1. _Define (the term(s)...)_ is intended literally. Only a formal statement or equivalent paraphrase, such as the defining equation with symbols identified, being required.
2. _What is meant by..._ normally implies that a definition should be given, together with some relevant comment on the significance or context of the term(s) concerned, especially where two or more terms are included in the question. The amount of supplementary comment intended should be interpreted in the light of the indicated mark value.
3. _Explain_ may imply reasoning or some reference to theory, depending on the context.
4. _State_ implies a concise answer with little or no supporting argument, e.g. a numerical answer that can be obtained 'by inspection'.
5. _List_ requires a number of points with no elaboration. Where a given number of points is specified, this should not be exceeded.
6. _Describe_ requires candidates to state in words (using diagrams where appropriate) the main points of the topic. It is often used with reference either to particular phenomena or to particular experiments. In the former instance, the term usually implies that the answer should include reference to (visual) observations associated with the phenomena. The amount of description intended should be interpreted in the light of the indicated mark value.
7. _Discuss_ requires candidates to give a critical account of the points involved in the topic.
8. _Deduce/Predict_ implies that candidates are not expected to produce the required answer by recall but by making a logical connection between other pieces of information. Such information may be wholly given in the question or may depend on answers extracted in an earlier part of the question.
9. _Suggest_ is used in two main contexts. It may either imply that there is no unique answer or that candidates are expected to apply their general knowledge to a 'novel' situation, one that formally may not be 'in the syllabus'.
10. _Calculate_ is used when a numerical answer is required. In general, working should be shown.
11. _Measure_ implies that the quantity concerned can be directly obtained from a suitable measuring instrument, e.g. length, using a rule, or angle, using a protractor.
12. _Determine_ often implies that the quantity concerned cannot be measured directly but is obtained by calculation, substituting measured or known values of other quantities into a standard formula.
13. _Show_ is used when an algebraic deduction has to be made to prove a given equation. It is important that the terms being used by candidates are stated explicitly.
14. _Estimate_ implies a reasoned order of magnitude statement or calculation of the quantity concerned. Candidates should make such simplifying assumptions as may be necessary about points of principle and about the values of quantities not otherwise included in the question.

* 15. _Sketch_, when applied to graph work, implies that the shape and/or position of the curve need only be qualitatively correct. However, candidates should be aware that, depending on the context, some quantitative aspects may be looked for, e.g. passing through the origin, having an intercept, asymptote or discontinuity at a particular value. On a sketch graph it is essential that candidates clearly indicate what is being plotted on each axis.
* 16. _Sketch_, when applied to diagrams, implies that a simple, freehand drawing is acceptable: nevertheless, care should be taken over proportions and the clear exposition of important details.
* 17. _Compare_ requires candidates to provide both similarities and differences between things or concepts.
