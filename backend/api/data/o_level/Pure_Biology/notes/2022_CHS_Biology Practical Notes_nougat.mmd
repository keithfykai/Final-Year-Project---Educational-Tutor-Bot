## Practical Assessment

### Paper 3 (1 h 50 min, 40 marks)

This paper will comprise two or three compulsory practical questions, based mainly on experimental skills and investigations.

* Planning (P)
* Manipulation, measurement and observation (MMO)
* Presentation of data and observations (PDO)
* Analysis, conclusions and evaluation (ACE)

One or more of the questions may incorporate assessment of Planning (P) and require candidates to apply and integrate knowledge and understanding from different sections of the syllabus. The assessment of PDO and ACE may include questions on data-analysis which do not require practical equipment and apparatus.

The assessment of Planning (P) will have a weighting of 15%. The assessment of skill areas MMO, PDO and ACE will have a weighting of 85%. This accounts for **20%** of the total weighting in the subject for the GCE O-Level assessment.

Candidates are not allowed to refer to notebooks, textbooks or any other information during the assessment.

## 6 Competency List

Candidates may be asked to carry out exercises comprising:

1. simple physiological experiments, involving tests for food substances, enzyme reactions, hydrogencarbonate indicator solution, cobalt(II) chloride paper and so on;
2. simple physiological experiments, involving the use of sharp instruments on plant or animal materials (accurate observations of these specimens will need a hand lens of not less than \(\times\)6 magnification for each candidate);
3. manipulative skills in assembling apparatus, in using chemical reagents and in using such instruments as mounted needles, scalpels and razor blades, forceps and scissors;
4. measurements using appropriate instruments (e.g. thermometer, syringe, measuring cylinder, ruler and so on) and simple arithmetical calculations;

(D) Analysis, conclusions and evaluation (ACE)

(D1) Analyse and interpret data or observations appropriately in relation to the task

* Looking for **patterns and trends**
* e.g. finding gradients to determine rate of reaction / x-intercept to find water potential of a tissue
* Draw **dotted line** on graph when finding corresponding value
* All data values, including the coordinates on the line drawn and the intercept, should also be read to an accuracy within one half of the smallest squares on the grid * Describing processed results
* Explain the findings by relating to what that is learnt in theory
* Suggest how the findings (to what extent) support the hypothesis or address the aim of the investigation

(D2) Draw conclusion(s) from the interpretation of experimental data or observations and underlying principles

* Describe the trend observed from data obtained or graph drawn
* Express your conclusion as a generalisation (**claim**) based on the trend of your results (**evidence**)
* Give an explanation (**reason**) of the trend based on known scientific theories

E.g.

* Rate of photosynthesis decreases when light intensity decreases. (**claim**)
* As distance of plant from lamp increases, number of oxygen bubbles decreases. (**evidence**)
* Oxygen is a by-product of photosynthesis and lesser oxygen bubbles is a result of a decrease in rate of photosynthesis. (**reason**)_Worked example:_

Some students carried out a similar investigation to find the effect of pH on the production of apple juice using this enzyme.

Fig. 13 shows a graph of their results.

(a) State the optimum pH for the action of this enzyme.

(b) State the pH values when 7 cm\({}^{3}\) of apple juice is collected.

pH 4.3 and pH 5.7 (dotted lines drawn)

(c) Describe and explain the effect of pH on the production of apple juice, using this enzyme.

As pH increases from 3 to 5, volume of apple juice collected increases from 4 cm\({}^{3}\) to 9.2 cm\({}^{3}\). As pH increases beyond 5 to 7, volume decreases to 3 cm\({}^{3}\). **[trend + evidence]**

At pH away from the optimum pH, more enzymes are denatured.

Active site shape changes and substrates can no longer bind to form

**EXERCISE 13:**

Flies lay eggs which hatch into maggots. An investigation was carried out to find out the effect of temperature on the respiration rate of maggots.

Fig. 14 shows some living maggots in a large test-tube.

**Fig. 14**

Soda lime absorbs carbon dioxide. During the investigation, the drop of coloured liquid moved along the capillary tube **towards** the test-tube.

CHS | Adapted by Mr. Lee Joon Kiat | Updated Nov 2019Figure 15 shows the results of the investigation.

Figure 15:

* Error refers to the difference between measured value and 'true' value
* Lack of precision in the equipment
- Problems in experimental procedure
- Inconsistencies of biological specimens
- Interference from external environmental factors (e.g. wind, humidity, temperature)
* Not a precaution/ incompetence in practical skills/ carelessness (e.g. parallax error or solutions are not fresh); usually cannot be eliminated by repeating the experiment
* Avoid writing results as being inaccurate for the effect when it can be more specific (e.g. evaporation of water in sucrose solution) lower water potential faster rate of osmosis water level drops faster)
* Explain on inaccuracy even when effect cannot be predicted or specified (e.g. subjectivity in colour judgment) inaccurate results)

(D5) State and explain how significant errors may be overcome or reduced, as appropriate, including how experimental procedures may be improved

* For a measured value to be accurate, it should be very close to the true value
* For a set of measured values to be reliable, the variation within the values must be small
* Use a more precise measuring equipment to improve on accuracy (i.e. Vernier Caliper to measure length over ruler)
- Improve experimental procedure (i.e. find average from repeats/ replicates to increase reliability of results)
- Use same biological specimen to eliminate biological variability
- Maintain a constant external environmental conditions as far as possible (i.e. conducting experiment indoors such as a greenhouse)
Some students measured respiration in yeast using a culture of active yeast. Yeast produces a gas during respiration. Two syringes were filled with 20 cm3 of the active yeast culture and each syringe was placed into a large test-tube containing water at 35 \({}^{\circ}\)C. Both were placed in a water-bath at 35 \({}^{\circ}\)C as shown in Fig. 16.

The volume of gas in each syringe was measured every 5 minutes for 25 minutes.

A student was provided with five Petri dishes labelled S1 to S5. Each contained a different concentration of sucrose solution. They were also provided with 10 potato strips, each exactly 50 mm long. Two strips of potato were placed in each solution and left for thirty minutes. Then the strips were removed and blotted carefully. Their lengths were re-measured and recorded.

State two ways in which this experiment could be improved to make the results more reliable. (ACE)

**5.** A student investigated the effect of increasing the concentration of carbon dioxide on the rate of photosynthesis of Cabomba, an aquatic plant. The figure below shows the apparatus that the student used.

The concentration of carbon dioxide in the water surrounding the plant was changed by adding different concentrations of sodium hydrogencarbonate solution to the water.

The student recorded the time taken for the meniscus to travel 50 mm down the tubing.

The rate of photosynthesis was calculated as:

rate of photosynthesis = 1000/t

where t = time taken in seconds for the meniscus to travel 50 mm.

The student's results are shown in the table below.

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|} \hline _Concentration of_ & _T, time taken for_ & _Rate of photosynthesis_ \\ _sodium_ & _meniscus to travel 50_ & _(1000/t)_ _s-1_ \\ _hydrogencarbonate_ & _mm/s_ & \\ _solution/ mol per dm3_ & & \\ \hline

## Appendix D Microscopy techniques

Steps to making a wet mount

1. Gather a thin piece of specimen and spread out evenly on the slide. Otherwise, the coverslip will wobble on top of the specimen and will not be viewable under High Power

2. Place one drop of water directly over the specimen.

3. Place the coverslip at an approximately 45-degree angle with one edge touching the water drop and then gently let go. Ensure that no bubbles are trapped under the coverslip.

4. Remove any excess solution that has spilled out of the cover slip with a piece of filter paper.

Temporary mount of plant tissue video - [http://tinyurl.com/yd7a8kps](http://tinyurl.com/yd7a8kps)

Staining a slide

1. Place a drop of stain (i.e. iodine) on the edge of the coverslip.

2. Place the flat edge of a piece of filter paper on the opposite side of the coverslip. The cohesion of water will draw the stain under the slide, to the other side.

3. Remove excess stain on the slide with a filter paper.

## Appendix F

Prepare leaf to test for the presence of starch

1. Half fill a beaker with water and heat. When the water boils, turn off the heat.

2. Put the green leaf into the hot water for 5 minute.

3. Put the boiled leaf in a boiling tube containing ethanol so that it is fully submerged. Use a glass rod to push the leaf into the ethanol.

4. Place the boiling tube in the beaker of hot water.

5. When the leaf turns pale yellow in colour or colourless, carefully remove the brittle leaf using the forceps. Then immerse it in warm water for a few seconds to soften it.

6. Remove the leaf from the warm water and place it on a white tile. Carefully spread out the leaf using the forceps.

7. Cover the leaf with iodine solution, leave for a while and then wash away the iodine solution.

**Background:** & Living organisms naturally produce hydrogen peroxide during metabolism. This chemical is toxic to cells if left to accumulate. While it can naturally break down into water and oxygen, this process is very slow. To prevent this toxic chemical from accumulating and causing harm to the organism, living cells produce an enzyme known as catalase. Catalase will speed up the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide into water and oxygen. \\ \hline
