## 2 Relative Masses

### The carbon-12 scale

* The masses of atoms are very small, from 10-24 to 10-22 grams. Chemists use a relative atomic mass scale to compare the masses of different atoms.
* In 1961, the carbon-12 atom was adopted by the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) as the reference standard for relative atomic masses.
* On the carbon-12 scale, atoms of the isotope \({}^{12}\)C are assigned a relative atomic mass of 12 and the relative masses of all other atoms are obtained by comparison with the mass of the carbon-12 atom.

### Relative isotopic mass

* The relative isotopic mass of a particular isotope of an element is defined as follows: [frame=single,width=0.5cm] 

* Why is the relative isotopic mass of an isotope very close to a whole number? Reason: On the carbon-12 scale, the relative masses of the proton and neutron are both very close to one and the electron has a negligible mass. It therefore follows that all relative isotopic masses will be very close to whole numbers which are essentially the corresponding nucleon numbers of the isotopes.
* In calculations, the relative isotopic mass of an isotope is often approximated by the nucleon number of that isotope. The two are assumed to be identical in all but the most accurate work.

### Relative atomic mass (Symbol: \(\boldsymbol{A_{\text{r}}}\))

* The relative atomic mass (\(\boldsymbol{A_{\text{r}}}\)) of an element is defined as follows: [frame=single,width=0.5cm] 

* The \(\boldsymbol{A_{\text{r}}}\) values can be found in the Periodic Table given in the Data Booklet. Example: \(\boldsymbol{A_{\text{r}}}\) of chlorine = 35.5 

* The relative atomic mass of an element may not be close to a whole number. Why is this so? Reason: This is because naturally occurring elements often consist of a mixture of isotopes and the relative atomic mass of an element takes into consideration the different isotopes and their relative abundances.

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|} \hline \multicolumn{2}{|c|}{**Worked Example 2**} \\ \hline \multicolumn{2}{|c|}{Calculate the relative atomic mass of chlorine from the given data.} \\ \hline Isotope & Relative isotopic mass & Percentage abundance \\ \hline \({}^{35}\)Cl & 34.97 & 75.53 \\ \({}^{37}\)Cl & 36.95 & 24.47 \\ \hline \end{tabular} Solution

\(A_{r}\) of Cl = \(\dfrac{\big{(}75.53\big{)}\big{(}34.97\big{)}+\big{(}24.47\big{)}\big{(}36.95 \big{)}}{75.53+24.47}=\underline{\textbf{35.5}}\) (3 s.f.)

\begin{tabular}{|c|} \hline \multicolumn{2}{|c|}{**Worked Example 3**} \\ \hline \multicolumn{2}{|c|}{The isotopes \({}^{79}\)Br and \({}^{81}\)Br have accurate isotopic masses of 78.918 and 80.916 respectively. Given that the \(A_{r}\) of bromine is 79.904, calculate the percentage abundances of these two isotopes.} \\ \hline \end{tabular} Solution

Let x be the percentage abundance of \({}^{79}\)Br and (100 - x) be the percentage abundance of \({}^{81}\)Br.

\(A_{r}\) of Br =

\(\dfrac{\text{Percentage abundance of ${}^{79}$Br}=\text{x}=}{\text{Percentage abundance of ${}^{81}$Br}=100-\text{x}=}\)

### Relative molecular mass (Symbol: \(M_{r}\))

* This is the term used when referring to the relative masses of molecular elements or covalent compounds.

\begin{tabular}{|c|} \hline \multicolumn{2}{|c|}{Relative molecular mass = \(\dfrac{\text{(weighted) average mass of 1 molecule of the substance}}{\text{12 x mass of 1 atom of carbon-12}}\)} \\ \hline \(\bullet\) & \(M_{r}\) of a substance = sum of the \(A_{r}\) of all the constituent atoms shown in the molecular formula \\ \(\bullet\) & Examples: \(M_{r}\) of O\({}_{2}\) = (2)(16.0) = 32.0 \\ \(M_{r}\) of aspirin, C\({}_{6}\)H\({}_{8}\)O\({}_{4}\) = (9)(12.0) + (8)(1.0) + (4)(16.0) = 180.0 \\ \end{tabular}

### Relative formula mass (Symbol: \(M_{r}\))

* This is the term used when referring to the relative masses of ions or ionic compounds.

\begin{tabular}{|c|} \hline \multicolumn{2}{|c|}{Relative formula mass = \(\dfrac{\text{(weighted) average mass of 1 formula unit of the substance}}{\text{12 x mass of 1 atom of carbon-12}}\)} \\ \hline \(\bullet\) & \(\bullet\) & \(\bullet\) \\ \hline \end{tabular}

* Note: A formula unit is the smallest collection of atoms from which the formula of a compound can be established.
* Examples: Relative formula mass of NaC/ = 23.0 + 35.5 = 58.5 \\ \(M_{r}\) of CuSO\({}_{4}\).5H\({}_{2}\)O = 63.5 + 32.1 + (4)(16.0) + (10)(1.0) + (5)(16.0) = 249.6 \\ \end{tabular}

### Definitions

* The empirical formula of a compound is the formula that shows the simplest whole number ratio of the atoms of different elements present in one molecule or formula unit of the compound.
* The molecular formula of a compound is the formula that shows the actual number of atoms of each element present in one molecule of the compound.

* The empirical formula of a compound may be calculated from experimental data obtained from combustion analysis or elemental analysis.
* The molecular formula can be determined from the empirical formula, provided the molar mass or the relative molecular mass of the compound is known.

### Calculations using combustion data

\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|} \hline
**Worked Example 5** & **Worked Example 5** & **Worked Example 5** \\ \hline
0.500 g of an organic compound **X** containing carbon, hydrogen and oxygen gave on complete combustion 0.6875 g of CO\({}_{2}\) and 0.5625 g of H\({}_{2}\)O. & (a) Determine the empirical formula of **X**. (b) If the relative molecular mass of **X** is 32.0, \\  & & determine its molecular formula. \\ \hline \end{tabular}

Solution

\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|c|} \hline
**Element** & **C** & **H** & **O** \\ \hline Mass in 0.500 g of \(\mathbf{X}\)/ g & \(\begin{array}{c}0.6875\\ 12.0+(2)(16.0)\\ =0.1875\end{array}\) & \(\begin{array}{c}0.5625\\ (2)(1.0)+16.0\end{array}\) & \(\begin{array}{c}0.5625\\ =0.250\end{array}\) \\ \hline Amount / mol & \(\begin{array}{c}0.1875\\ 12.0\end{array}\) & \(\begin{array}{c}0.01563\\ 1.0\end{array}\) & \(\begin{array}{c}0.0625\\ 1.0\end{array}\) & \(\begin{array}{c}0.250\\ 16.0\end{array}\) & \(\begin{array}{c}0.01563\\ 16.0\end{array}\) \\ \hline Molar ratio & 1 & 4 & 1 \\ \hline \end{tabular}

Hence the empirical formula of **X** is CH\({}_{4}\)O.
2. Let molecular formula of **X** be \((\text{CH}_{4}\text{O})_{n}\). \(M_{r}\) of \((\text{CH}_{4}\text{O})_{n}=32.0\) \([12.0+4(1.0)+16.0]\) n = 32.0 \(\begin{array}{c}\text{Hence molecular formula of **X** is CH\({}_{4}\)O.}\) \\ n = 1 \\ \hline \end{tabular}

\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|} \hline \multicolumn{4}{|c|}{**Some important points to take note of**} \\ \hline \end{tabular}

* In the calculation of empirical formula from experimental data, it is a common procedure to round off figures to the corresponding nearest whole numbers in order to get the simplest ratio. The rounding off procedure is usually justified, taking into consideration the possibility of experimental errors.
* However, when figures such as those listed below are encountered, the usual rounding off process may lead to an incorrect empirical formula. Great care should be exercised when these figures are obtained. These figures are usually multiplied by a factor in order to get the correct simplest ratio.

**Note:** Hypothetical data are used here.

\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|c|} \hline Ratio & \multicolumn{2}{|c|}{**Incorrect**} & \multicolumn{2}{|c|}{**Actual**} \\ calculated & simplest ratio deduced & simplest ratio & Remarks \\ \hline
1.51 : 3.07 : 1.00 & 2 : 3 : 1 & 3 : 6 : 2 & 1.5 = 3/2 & (multiply by a factor 2) \\ \hline
1.33 : 3.07 : 1.00 & 1 : 3 : 1 & 4 : 9 : 3 & 1.33 = 4/3 & (multiply by a factor 3) \\ \hline

### Limiting reagent

* In carrying out chemical reactions, the reactants present may not be in stoichiometric amounts.
* One or more reactants may be in excess of that theoretically needed for complete reaction. The deficient reactant is called the limiting reagent and is consumed completely in the reaction.
* The maximum or theoretical yield of a product is thus determined based on the limiting reagent.

**Worked Example 8**

Consider the following reaction: Mg(s) + 2HC/(aq) \(\rightarrow\) MgC_l_z(aq) + H_z(g).

What will be the amount of H_z produced when 3.0 moles of Mg(s) are added to 4.0 moles of HCl(aq)?

Solution

Amount of HC/(aq) used = 4.0 mol

Amount of Mg required to react with 4.0 mol of HC_l_ = (\(\%\)_z_)(Amount of HC_l_) = (\(\%\)_z_)(4) = 2.0 mol

Since the amount of Mg available > the amount of Mg required, Mg is present in excess.

The limiting reagent is HC_l_(aq).

Hence, amount of H_z produced = (\(\%\)_z_)(Amount of HC_l_ reacted) = (\(\%\)_z_)(4.0 mol) = **2.00 mol**

### Percentage yield

* The mass of a product formed in a chemical reaction is called the yield.
* The theoretical yield of a product refers to the mass of product calculated from the chemical equation based on the amount of limiting reagent used.
* The actual yield refers to the mass of product that is actually obtained in the reaction during an experiment. It is usually less than the theoretical yield.
* The percentage yield relates the actual yield to the theoretical yield and is expressed as follows:

**Worked Example 9**

Ethanol can undergo esterification with ethanoic acid in the presence of concentrated sulfuric acid to yield ethyl ethanoate:

**(a)**: In an experiment, 23.0 g of ethanol (the limiting reagent) were used for esterification. Calculate the theoretical yield of ethyl ethanoate.
**(b)**: If 30.0 g of ethyl ethanoate were obtained in the above experiment, determine the percentage yield.

Solution

**(a)**: Amount of ethyl ethanoate produced (b) = Amount of ethanol used %Yield = \(\frac{30.0}{44.0}\times 100\%=\frac{68.2\%}{2(12.0)+6(1.0)+16.0}=0.500\) mol

.: Theoretical yield of ethyl ethanoate = 0.500 [4(12.0) + 8(1.0) + 2(16.0)] = \(\frac{44.0\,\mathrm{g}}{2}\)

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:12]

**Worked Example 10**

In the preparation of hydrogen chloride by the reaction

NaC/(s) + H2SO4(l) -> HCI(g) + NaHSO4(s),

what mass of sodium chloride is required for the production of 10.0 dm\({}^{3}\) of hydrogen chloride (at s.t.p.)?

Solution

Amount of HCI(g) produced = \(\frac{10.0}{22.7}\) = 0.4405 mol

Amount of NaCl(s) required = Amount of HCI(g) produced = 0.4405 mol

Molar mass of NaCl = \(23.0\) + \(35.5\) = \(58.5\) g mol\({}^{-1}\)

Hence, mass of NaCl / required = (0.4405)(58.5) = \(\underline{25.8}\)\(\underline{\mathbf{q}}\)

### **Calculations involving combustion of hydrocarbons**

* General equation for the complete combustion of a hydrocarbon: **Note:**
* The state symbol for C4H7 can either be (g) or (l) depending on the hydrocarbon analysed.
* H2O(l) if volume measurement is done at room temperature.
* H2O(g) if volume measurement is done at a temperature equal to or greater than 100 \({}^{\circ}\)C.

[MISSING_PAGE_POST]

**Worked Example 12**

10 cm\({}^{3}\) of a hydrocarbon was burnt in 100 cm\({}^{3}\) (an excess) of oxygen gas. After reaction, the volume of the gaseous mixture was found to be 80 cm\({}^{3}\) when cooled to room temperature. Upon passing the gaseous mixture through aqueous potassium hydroxide, its volume decreased to 50 cm\({}^{3}\).

What is the molecular formula of the unknown hydrocarbon?

Solution

Let the hydrocarbon be C\({}_{x}\)H\({}_{y}\).

After reaction, the gaseous mixture contained CO\({}_{2}\) and unreacted O\({}_{2}\).

When the gaseous mixture was passed through KOH(aq), only the acidic CO\({}_{2}\) gas reacted with KOH.

CO\({}_{2}\)(g) + 2OH(aq) \(\rightarrow\) CO\({}_{3}\)\({}^{2}\)(aq) + H\({}_{2}\)O(l)

Volume of unreacted O\({}_{2}\) = 50 cm\({}^{3}\)

Volume of CO\({}_{2}\) produced = 80 - 50 = 30 cm\({}^{3}\)

Volume of O\({}_{2}\) reacted = 100 - 50 = 50 cm\({}^{3}\)

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|} \hline  & C\({}_{x}\)H\({}_{y}\)(g) + (\(x+\frac{y}{4}\)) O\({}_{2}\)(g) \(\rightarrow\)\(x\) CO\({}_{2}\)(g) + \(\frac{y}{2}\)H\({}_{2}\)O(l) \\ \hline Volume of gas / cm\({}^{3}\) & 10 & (negligible) \\ \hline Volume ratio & : & : \\ \hline Molar ratio & : & : \\ \hline Molar ratio (from equation) & 1 & : (\(x+\frac{y}{4}\)) & : \\ \hline Hence, x = & and (\(x+\frac{y}{4}\)) = & :, the molecular formula of the hydrocarbon is \\ \hline \end{tabular}

Amount of NO\({}_{3}^{-}\) ions = \(\dfrac{250}{1000}\times 0.250=6.25\times 10^{-2}\) mol

Amount of Mg(NO\({}_{3}\))\({}_{2}\).6H\({}_{2}\)O required = \(\dfrac{1}{2}\times 6.25\times 10^{-2}=3.125\times 10^{-2}\) mol

Mass of Mg(NO\({}_{3}\))\({}_{2}\).6H\({}_{2}\)O required = \(3.125\times 10^{-2}\times\left[24.3+2(14.0+3\times 16.0)+6(2\times 1.0+16.0)\right]\)

**(c)**: Determine the concentration in g dm\({}^{-3}\) of the thiosulfate ions in the solution.
**(d)**: If 40.00 cm\({}^{3}\) of the solution is removed and made up to 250 cm\({}^{3}\) in another volumetric flask using deionised water, what is the concentration of thiosulfate ions in the new solution?

**(a)**: Na\({}_{2}\)S\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{3}\).5H\({}_{2}\)O(s)+aq.\(\rightarrow\)Na\({}_{2}\)S\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{3}\)(aq)+5H\({}_{2}\)O(l)

Amount of Na\({}_{2}\)S\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{3}\).5H\({}_{2}\)O = \(\dfrac{6.45}{2\times 23.0+2\times 32.1+3\times 16.0+5(2\times 1.0+16.0)}=2.599 \times 10^{-2}\) mol

Amount of Na\({}_{2}\)S\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{3}\) = Amount of Na\({}_{2}\)S\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{3}\).5H\({}_{2}\)O = \(2.599\times 10^{-2}\) mol

Concentration of Na\({}_{2}\)S\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{3}\) = \(\dfrac{2.599\times 10^{-2}}{250\times 10^{-3}}=\dfrac{0.104\text{ mol dm}^{-3}}{250\times 10^{-3}}\)

## 8 Acid-Base Titrations

### **Volumetric Analysis**

* _Volumetric analysis_ (or titrimetric analysis) is a method of quantitative analysis which depends essentially on the accurate measurements of the volumes of two solutions which react together completely.
* _In volumetric analysis, a standard solution_ (i.e. a solution of known concentration) is used to determine the concentration of another solution.
* _This is done through a titration process which involves the gradual addition of one solution (from a burette) to a fixed volume of another solution (in a conical flask) until stoichiometric amounts of the two reactants have reacted._
* _The solution that is placed in the burette is sometimes referred to as the titrant._
* _The solution that is pipetted into the conical flask is less commonly referred to as the titrand._
* _In practice, the completion of a titration is usually detected by a distinct colour change brought about by the use of a suitable indicator. The point at which this distinct colour change occurs is called the end-point of the titration._
* _In an acid-base titration, the indicator used is usually added in a small quantity. Common indicators include methyl orange, screened methyl orange, thymol blue and thymolphthalein. Each indicator has a pH range over which it changes colour._
* _The common apparatus used in a titration are shown below._

### Acid-base titrations

* Acid-base titrations are carried out in order to establish the stoichiometric amounts of acid and base which are required to neutralise each other.
* Basicity of an acid

### Back titration

* Back titrations are usually employed when the determination of the amount of a substance poses some difficulty in the direct titration method, e.g. solid substances (CaCO\({}_{3}\)) where the end-point is difficult to detect, and volatile substances (ammonia, iodine) where inaccuracy arises due to loss of substance during titration.
* In a typical acid-base back titration, the following steps are involved:
* A known excess of an acid A is added to a quantity of a base B (or vice versa).
* Upon mixing, the base B reacts completely while only some of the acid A reacts.
* The acid A remaining is then titrated with a standard alkali C and its amount determined.
* From the results, the amount of acid A which has reacted with the base B can be found and the amount of base can then be calculated.
