Group 17 elements have **seven valence electrons** and thus **have the tendency to accept one electron to achieve noble gas configuration**. Hence they are able to act as oxidising agents (they oxidise other compounds) \(X\) + 2e' \(\rightarrow\) 2\(X\)

* As the electronegativity decrease down the group, the atoms are less likely to accept electrons
* Hence there is an decreasing ease of the element to undergo reduction
* Hence the strength of the oxidising power decreases down the group

General Trend Down the Group (only for HCI = H) : **Increase** (same as its element)

Hydrogen halides are simple covalent structures

Down the Group the size of the electron cloud of the halide increases

Resulting in more intensive id-id & p-dp interactions

Melting & Boling Point increase as more energy is required to break more

ki-id interactions

Note: HF is not included in the general trend as it has the highest

melting boiling point among the other hydrogen halides. This is due to the

presence of H-bonding forming between the HF molecules, which are

strong than the id-id & p-dp interactions between the other hydrogen

BOND ENERGY

General Trend Down the Group : **Decrease** (same as its element)

Down the group the size of the halide increase

The effectiveness of the orbitals overlap decrease and bond length increase

Weaker covalent bonds are formed between hydrogen and halide

Bond energy thus decrease as lesser amount of energy is required to

break the weaker covalent bonds

**THERMAL STABILITY**

**Group 17 hydrogen halides exist as white fumes with sharp odours**

2HK (s) - \(\chi_{2}\) (g) + H\({}_{2}\) (g)

General Trend Down the Group : **Decrease**

Down the group bond energy of the hydrogen halides decrease

Easier to break the covalent bond

Easier of thermal decomposition thus increases down the group

Leading to an decrease in thermal decomposition temperature

Hence thermal stability decreases down the group

## Practice Questions

Question: Which of the following have the largest radius; P\({}^{3}\), Cl; AP\({}^{5}\), K?

_Answer: P\({}^{3}\)_

Question: Arrange the first ionisation energy of Radon (Ra), Francium (Fr) and Radium (Ra) in increasing order. Explain your answer.

_Answer: Fr, Ra, Rn_

_Rn is in Group 18, Fr is in Group 1 and Ra is in Group 2._

_Rn is in the period before Fr and Ra. Fr and Ra have higher nuclear charge than Rn since they have more protons and greater shielding effect than Rn as they more inner electron shells. The increase in shielding effect outweighs the increase in nuclear charge. Therefore Fr and Ra have smaller effective nuclear charge than Rn. Valence electrons in Rn is thus more strongly attached to the nucleus as compared to Fr and Ra._

_Fr and Ra are both in the same period. Ra has higher nuclear charge than Fr due to higher number of protons. Both Fr and Ra have approximately the same shielding effect as they have the same number of inner electron shells. Hence Ra has a higher effective nuclear charge than Fr. Valence electrons in Ra is thus more strongly attached to the nucleus as compared to Fr hence greater amount of energy is required to remove the outermost electron in Ra as compared to Fr._

## Appendix A Practical Questions

Question: Which of the following statements are correct?

1. The ionic radius of the cation increases from calcium to barium.

2. The energy required for the formation of the cation increase from calcium to barium.

_Answer: 1_

Question: Compare the relative radii of the atom and ion of sodium (Na) and chlorine (C).

_Answer: Na has a larger atomic radius than Cl since it has fewer number of proton and thus lower nuclear charge. They both have approximately the same shielding effect since they have the same number of inner shell electrons. Hence Na has a lower effective nuclear charge and its variance electrons are less strongly affected to its nucleus resulting in it have a larger atomic radius than Cl. Cl has a larger ionic radius than Na' since it has more protons and thus higher nuclear charge. It also experience a higher shielding effect by the additional inner shell electrons. The increase in shielding effect outweights the increase in nuclear charge hence the effective nuclear charge for Cl is lower than that of Na'. The valence electrons in Cl is less strongly attracted to the nucleus than that of Na' hence Cl has a larger ionic radius than Na'._

## Appendix A Practical Questions

Question: The oxide and chloride of an element E are mixed separately with water. The two resulting solutions have the same effect on litmus. What is element E?

1. Mg

2. Al

3. Si

4. P

_Answer: 4_

Question: With reference to the Data Booklet, explain why copper (Cu) is much less reactive than calcium (Ca).

_Answer: From the Data Booklet, the first and second ionisation energy of Cu is higher than that of Ca, indicating more energy is required for Cu to lose 2moles of electrons as compared to Ca, thus it is less reactive. This is also supported by the more positive E(C)(C)(C) value as compared to the E(C)(C)(C) value, indicating that Cu is oxidised less readily than Ca._

## Appendix A Practical Questions

Question: Similar to the decomposition of Group 2 carbonates, anhydrous barium nitrate and anhydrous magnesium nitrate both decompose on heating, forming an oxide and evolving a brown gas and another gas that relights a glowing spirit. Which of the following statement(s) is/are correct?

1. The brown gas is evolved at a lower temperature from magnesium nitrate than from barium nitrate.
2. For both nitrates, the volume of the brown gas evolved is four times greater than the volume of gas that relights a glowing split.
3. The melting point for magnesium nitrate is smaller than the melting point for barium nitrate.

_Answer: 1 and 2._

Question: HCI is stable to heat, but HI decomposes into its element when heated. What is responsible for this difference?

1. HI is a stronger reducing agent than HCI.
2. HI is more volatile than HCI.
3. The H+ bond is weaker than the H-CI bond.
4. The H- bond is weaker than the CI-CI bond.
