Candidates should be able to:

1. show an understanding of and use the terms position, distance, displacement, speed, velocity, and acceleration.
2. use graphical methods to represent distance, displacement, speed, velocity, and acceleration.
3. identify and use the physical quantities from the gradients of position-time or displacement-time graphs, and areas under and gradients of velocity-time graphs, including cases of non-uniform acceleration.
4. derive, from the definitions of velocity and acceleration, equations which represent uniformly accelerated motion in a straight line.
5. solve problems using equations which represent uniformly accelerated motion in a straight line, e.g. for bodies falling vertically-without air resistance in a uniform gravitational field.
6. show an understanding that mass is the property of a body which resists change in motion (inertia).
7. define and use linear momentum as the product of mass and velocity.
8. state and apply each of Newton's laws of motion;

1st law: a body at rest will stay at rest, and a body in motion will continue to move at constant velocity, unless acted on by a resultant external force;

2nd law: the rate of change of momentum of a body is (directly) proportional to the resultant force acting on the body and is in the same direction as the resultant force; and

3rd law: the force exerted by one body on a second body is equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to the force simultaneously exerted by the second body on the first body.

1. recall the relationship resultant force \(F=ma\) for a body of constant mass, and use this to solve problems.

Graphs in Kinematics

Graphs are very useful in representing the changes that occur during the motion of an object. There are three possible graphs that can provide useful information:

displacement-time (s-f) graph

velocity-time (v-f) graph

acceleration-time (a-f) graph

Information from the graphs is often obtained from

1. direct reading of a point on the line / curve,
2. the gradient of the graph, and
3. the area under the graph.

The physical quantities obtained depend on what is being plotted on the graph. **Always look at the axes of a graph very carefully.**

## 3 Conversion between graphs

In order to analyze the motion of objects fully, it is important to be able to convert the graphs from one form to another.

**Case 1: Constant velocity**

### Uniformly accelerated linear motion

The motion of an object whose velocity is increasing at a steady-rate is called **uniformly accelerated motion**. The graph below shows the velocity-time graph of an object moving with constant acceleration. Its initial velocity is \(u\) and its velocity at.time \(t\) later is \(v\).

An object starts from rest and experiences a uniform acceleration of 0.50 m s-2 while moving down an inclined plane 9.0 m long. When it reaches the bottom, the object moves up another plane with uniform acceleration, where, after moving 15.0 m, it comes to rest.

### Mass and linear momentum

* Mass and inertia

The inertia of a body can be described as its reluctance to start moving, or to change its motion once it has started.

The **mass**\(m\) of a body is the intrinsic property of a body which resists change in motion, i.e. it is a measure of the inertia of a body. The same force, when applied to a body of larger mass will cause a smaller change in motion.

* Momentum

In ancient times, the term'motion of a body was quantified based on the velocity of the body, 'However, during the late 17\({}^{th}\) and early-18\({}^{th}\) centuries, as the science of dynamics was being established, the kinematic concept of motion was deemed unsatisfactory. Jean Buridan (1295 -1358), about four centuries before itssac Newton was born.

The concept of momentum was actually first introduced by the French philosopher Jean Buridan (1295 -1358), about four centuries before itssac Newton was born.

The momentum of a body is defined as the product of its mass, \(m\), and its velocity, \(\nu\).

Since velocity is a vector, momentum is also a vector. Its direction follows the direction of the velocity. The S.I. unit of momentum is **kg m s\({}^{4}\)** or **N s**.

If we have a system of \(m\) bodies with masses \(m_{1}\), \(m_{2}\), e.t.c., the total momentum \(p\) of the system is the vector sum of the momenta of the individual bodies.

**Example 8**

A body of A of mass 2.0 kg is moving to the left with a speed of 5.0 m s\({}^{-1}\). A body B of mass 4.0 kg is moving to the right with a speed of 2.5 m s\({}^{-1}\).

Calculate

**(a)** the momentum of A,

**(b)** the momentum of B,

the total momentum of the system of A and B.

### Newton's Laws of motion

Newton's 1* Law

The law states that a body continues in its state of rest or uniform motion in a straight line, unless a resultant external force acts on it.

The first law implies that

1. the **state of rest** requires no resultant force to maintain.
2. the **state of uniform velocity** also requires no resultant force to maintain.

The first law gives rise to the concept of force, whereby force is a quantity that can cause a body to undergo a change in velocity (or momentum).

Newton's 1* Law

A body continues in its state of rest or uniform motion in a straight line, unless a resultant external force acts on it.

## 10 Newton's 2nd Law

The law states that the rate of change of momentum \(p\) of a body is proportional to the resultant force \(F_{R}\) acting on it and occurs in the direction of the force.

Mathematically,

\[F_{R}=k\frac{\mathrm{dp}}{\mathrm{df}}\]

where \(k\) is the constant of proportionality.

In S.I. units, we set \(k=1\). Thus,

\[F_{R}=\frac{dp}{dt}=\frac{d\left(mv\right)}{dt}\]

The above mathematical description of Newton's 2nd law provides us with the concept of force - a force changes the motion of the body.

Newton's 2nd law implies that a body with a larger momentum would require either

* a larger force to stop (in the same time as one with a smaller momentum), or
* a longer time to stop with the same force.

The rate of change of momentum of a body is proportional to the resultant force acting on it and occurs in the direction of the force.

### Case 1: Constant Mass

When the resultant force \(F_{R}\) acts on a body of constant mass \(m\),

\[F_{R}=m\frac{dv}{dt}=ma\]

One newton (N) is the force acting on a body of mass 1 kg which causes the body to accelerate at 1 m s\({}^{-2}\) in the same direction of the force.

### Case 2: Constant Mass Flow

When a continuous flow of mass experienced a change in velocity \(\Delta v\), the resultant force \(F_{R}\) acting on the mass is given by* Newton's 3rd Law

The law states that whenever body A exerts a force \(\vec{F}_{\text{A\,on\,B}}\) on body B, body B exerts an equal and opposite force \(\vec{F}_{\text{B\,on\,A}}\) on body A.

Mathematically,

\[\left|\vec{F}_{\text{A\,on\,B}}\right|=\left|\vec{F}_{\text{B\,on\,A}}\right| \text{(equal in magnitude)}\]

\[\vec{F}_{\text{A\,on\,B}}=-\vec{F}_{\text{B\,on\,A}}\text{( opposite in direction)}\]

\(\vec{F}_{\text{A\,on\,B}}\) and \(\vec{F}_{\text{B\,on\,A}}\) are known as **action-reaction** pair of forces.

Newton's 3rd law has applications in every branch of physics and in everyday life. Walking or running would not be possible if Newton's 3rd law does not apply. The force exerted by the runner on the ground (Fig: 3.5) is equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to the force exerted by the ground on the runner which propels the runner forward.

On the other hand, although the normal contact force \(N\) exerted by the ground on the (lady) (Fig. 3.6) is equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to weight \(W\) of the lady, these two forces are not action-reaction pair of forces because the two forces are acting on the same body and they are not of the same type of forces.

Figure 3.6:

**RARFILES INSTITUTION**

**YEAR 56 PHYSICS DEPARTMENT**

For two forces to be an action-reaction pair of forces,

1. The two forces must be of the **same type**.
2. The two forces act on **different** bodies and they therefore do not cancel** each other out.

**Newton's 3rd Law**

If a body A exerts a force on body B, then body B exerts an equal and opposite force on body A.

**Solving Dynamical Problems**

1. Select a body or a system of bodies for analysis.
2. Draw a free-body diagram of the body or system showing all the forces acting on the body or system.
3. Select a direction to be positive: (It will be more convenient to take the direction of the acceleration as positive.)
4. Determine \(F_{ret}=\sum\) (all forces)
5. Apply Newton's 2nd Law \(F_{ret}=ma\) to the chosen body or system.

**Example 9**

Two blocks X and Y, of masses \(M\) and \(3M\) respectively, are accelerated along a smooth horizontal surface by a force \(F\) applied to block X as shown. In terms of \(F\), determine the magnitude of the force exerted by block Y on block X during this acceleration.
