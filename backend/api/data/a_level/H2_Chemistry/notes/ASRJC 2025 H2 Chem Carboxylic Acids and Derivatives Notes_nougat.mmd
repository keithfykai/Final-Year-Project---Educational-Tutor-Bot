## 3 Reactions of carboxylic acids

What type of reactions do carboxylic acids undergo and why?

The characteristic chemical behaviour of carboxylic acid is determined by the functional group \(-\)CO\({}_{2}\)H.

The C=O and O-H groups of the carboxylic acid group are in such close proximity that they modify each other's properties. Hence, carboxylic acids do not behave exactly like carbonyl compounds or alcohols.

The reactions of carboxylic acids almost invariably involve the hydroxy group, which either undergoes reactions involving the breaking of the O-H bond or C-O bond.

### Formation of salts

Carboxylic acids form ionic carboxylate salts with reactive metals, alkalis, carbonates and hydrogencarbonates.

3. Reaction of benzoic acid with liquid thinonyl chloride

Note: (refer to 'Hydroxy Compounds' lecture notes)

1. Reactions resemble those in alcohols. The \(C\)_I_ in PCI\({}_{3}\), PCI\({}_{5}\), and SOC\(l_{2}\) will substitute the -OH group in alcohols.

2. Alcohols will also react with PCI\({}_{5}\) and SOC\(l_{2}\) to form white fumes of HC_I_.

Exercise 3

Citric acid, which causes the sharp taste of lemon juice, has the following formula.

What reacts completely with 1 mol of citric acid?

A 3 mol of PCI\({}_{5}\)(s)

B 4 mol of HC\(I\)(g)

C 4 mol of Na(s)

D 4 mol of NaOH(aq)

### Oxidation of Methanoic Acid and Ethanoliotic acid

ONLY TWO exceptions are considered in our study on carboxylic acids that can undergo oxidation - **methanoic acid and ethanoloic acid**. Both acids will be oxidized to CO\({}_{2}\) and H\({}_{2}\)O.

## 4 Acidity of carboxylic acids

How do we compare the acidity of organic compounds in aqueous medium?

Carboxylic acids are classified as **weak acids**.

The dissociation equilibrium for carboxylic acid is written as:

\(\begin{array}{c}\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{the-BIG IDEA}\\ \includegraphics[width=142.

* **FYI: The following shows how the lone pair on the O atom of phenoxide ion can delocalize into the benzene ring.**

**In carboxylic acid,**

**The p-orbital containing the lone pair on the oxygen atom overlaps with the adjacent carbonyl (C=O) group, allowing the lone pair to be delocalized into the carbonyl group.**

**As a result, the negative charge is evenly shared between the two highly electronegative oxygen atoms**

**In the phenoxide ion (C**\({}_{6}\)**H**\({}_{5}\)**O**\({}^{-}\)), part of the negative charge is delocalized into the carbon-containing benzene ring, which is less electronegative and less effective at stabilizing the negative charge compared to an oxygen atom.**

**The carboxylate ion is more stable than the phenoxide ion, which makes carboxylic acids (RCOOH) more likely to release H**\({}^{+}\)** and, therefore, stronger acids compared to phenol.**

**Exercise 5**

**Predict the relative pK**\({}_{\text{a}}\) **values for the following compounds.**

**Relative K**\({}_{\text{a}}\) **values**

**Relative pK**\({}_{\text{a}}\) **values**

**[0.25]****

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:15]

#### 4.2.2 Strength of electron-withdrawing effect

\begin{tabular}{l l}
**More electronegative atom** \\ \(\succ\) & exerts & electron-withdrawing effect on the on the carboxylate group (-COO-) \\ \(\succ\) & disperses the negative charge on anion to a greater extent \\ \(\succ\) & stabilises anion to a greater extent \\ \(\succ\) & increases acid strength \\ \end{tabular}

\begin{tabular}{l l} Example \\ \hline Carboxylic acid & p\(K_{\text{a}}\) \\ \hline CICH\({}_{2}\)COOH & 2.86 \\ BrCH\({}_{2}\)COOH & 2.90 \\ \hline \end{tabular}

\begin{tabular}{l l} _Recall from 'Acid-base Equilibria':_ & \(K_{\text{a}}=\frac{\text{[H}^{+}\text{][A}^{-}\text{]}}{\text{[HA]}}\) \\ \end{tabular}

\[\text{p}K_{\text{a}}=-\text{log}_{10}\ K_{\text{a}}\]

The higher the p\(K_{\text{a}}\), the smaller the \(K_{\text{a}}\). Hence, the acid dissociates to a smaller extent and therefore is weaker.

#### 4.2.3 Number of electron-withdrawing groups

\begin{tabular}{l l} Greater number of electron-withdrawing groups \\ \(\succ\) & exerts & electron-withdrawing effect on the on the carboxylate group (-COO-) \\ \(\succ\) & disperses the negative charge on anion to a greater extent \\ \(\succ\) & stabilises anion to a greater extent \\ \(\succ\) & increases acid strength \\ \end{tabular}

\begin{tabular}{l l} Example \\ \hline Carboxylic acid & p\(K_{\text{a}}\) \\ \hline CICH\({}_{2}\)COOH & 2.86 \\ \hline CCI\({}_{3}\)COOH & 0.65 \\ \end{tabular}

#### 4.2.4 Position of electron-withdrawing groups

\begin{tabular}{l l} **Closer distance** between the electron-withdrawing group and the carboxylate group (-COO-) \\ \(\succ\) & disperses the negative charge on anion to a greater extent \\ \(\succ\) & stabilises anion to a greater extent \\ \(\succ\) & increases acid strength \\ \end{tabular}

\begin{tabular}{l l} Example \\ \hline Carboxylic acid & p\(K_{\text{a}}\) \\ \hline CH\({}_{3}\)CH\({}_{2}\)CH\({}_{3}\)COOH & 2.84 \\ \hline CH\({}_{3}\)CH\({}_{2}\)COOH & 4.06 \\ \end{tabular}

Exercise 6

Consider the following four compounds.

1. bromoethanoic acid

2. chloroethanoic acid

3. phenol

4. propanoic acid

What is the relative order of decreasing acidity of these compounds?

A 1 2 4 3

B 2 1 3 4

## 2 Reaction of carboxylic acid derivatives

What type of reactions do acid chlorides and ester undergo and why?

### Esters

#### 2.1.1 Hydrolysis

The reaction is the REVERSE of esterification. In the presence of water only, it is a VERY slow reaction.

Therefore, reaction is performed in the **presence of an acid or base** to speed it up

(a)Acid hydrolysis

Note:

Acid hydrolysis is reversible

Example

CH3-C-O-CH2CH3+H2OCH3-C-O-H+H-O-CH2CH3

ethylethanolamineoate ethanoic acid ethanol

### Food industry: as flavouring Flavour refers to a combination of smell and taste.

Blending a mixture of appropriate esters reproduces odours of fruits.

These are then mixed with food products like bread, ice-cream, sweets and drinks to impart an attractive smell and introduce novelty to the product.

Methyl cinnamate - an ester that gives matsutake mushrooms their spicy aroma.

### Medical field: in anesthetics

Benzocaine (ester) and marcaine (amide) are **local anesthetics** that play the role of numbing small areas of the body (making them insensitive to touch and pain) so as to make an operation more bearable for the patient.

### Solvents

Ethyl ethanoate is used as an industrial solvent.

### Polyesters

Synthetic fibres used in textile.

### Polyesters

#### Condensation polymerisation

Occurs when smaller molecules known as monomers join together to form a condensation polymer, with the elimination of small molecules such as HC/, H/O or NH3.

Polyesters fall in this category of polymers.

Each monomer must have TWO reactive ends

### Monomer 1 - 2 carboxylic acid groups (diacid) H--O--C--A--C--O--H

Monomer 2 - 2 alcohol groups (diol) H--O--B--O--H

2025/ASRJC/Chemistry
1. Why phenol cannot react with carboxylic acid to form ester? * Phenol is a weaker nucleophile than alcohol as the lone pair of electrons on the oxygen is delocalised into the benzene ring. * Hence, it is not nucleophilic enough to react with a carboxylic acid to form ester.
2. Why can alcohol react with acid chloride to form ester under a milder condition as compared to the reaction with carboxylic acid? * In carboxylic acid * Overlap of 2p orbital of the C atom with the 2p orbitals of the two neighbouring O atoms is more effective. * Delocalisation of lone pair of electron from O atom is more effective and diminishes the electron deficiency in C. * C is less electron deficient and less susceptible to a reaction with a nucleophile * Hence, **more vigorous condition** is required for reaction to take place. for reaction to take place.
