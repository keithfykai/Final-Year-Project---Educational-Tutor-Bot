The added lines to the graph are tangent lines (we add tangent lines to help find the gradient of a particular point on the curve (concept from E-Math)). Finding the gradient of these tangent lines will tell us about the overall general curvature (gradient profile) of the curve

Based on the drawn tangent lines, we can see that the gradient is slowing increasing and getting steeper; implying that the gradient is increasing

Why is the gradient decreasing for the graph?

Similar reasonings above. Based on the drawn tangent lines, we can see that the gradient is slowly getting more and more shallow, implying that the gradient is decreasing

## Application 3: Gradients, Tangents & Normals

Gradient of a line can be found using 2 methods

* Reading off the equation of the line (if the equation is provided)

\[y=\begin{pmatrix}x+c\\ \end{pmatrix}\]

Differentiating the equation of the line, and substituting the \(x\)-coordinate of the point in question, into the derivative

\[\left.\frac{dy}{dx}\right|_{x=a}\]

A normal to a point cuts the same point as to where the tangent is taken from. This normal is also perpendicular to the tangent to the line of that point.

Let the gradient of the tangent be \(m\) and the tangential point be \((x_{1},y_{1})\)

\[\begin{array}{c}\text{Type of line}\\ \text{Tangent Line}\\ \end{array}\]

\[y-y_{1}=m(x-x_{1})\]

## Application 4: Maxima & Minima

All concepts are same (as stationary point) where

Rate of Change questions are also very distinctive. Questions will always have the element of time, and have rates introduced in them

\[\frac{dy}{dx}=\frac{dy}{dt}\times\frac{dt}{dx}\]

Tips on solving such questions:

Start the process by writing the term on the left and expanding it out to the right. The denominator of the first fraction on the right, and the numerator of the second fraction should be left blank

\[\frac{dy}{dx}=\frac{dy}{dx}\times\frac{dt}{dx}\]

Do note that the blanked term must be the same. Always read around the question and find the elements that have not been used yet. Most of the time it will be the time-element or one of the (not-used) expressions in the question

* **Decreasing Rate of Change*
* If the question states that the rate of change is decreasing, students must take into account that the value is **negative**. However, if the question is asking for the time of decrease of something the value should be **positive**. DO NOT confers between the two
* **Final Statements*
* For all rate of change questions, a final concluding statement should be written (with the necessary value) as this is to answer the question.
