Key Concept

Digestive System

Digestion

## Overview of digestive system

1. Mouth and buccal cavity (a) Teeth: chewing, breakdown large pieces of food to smaller size. * **Increase surface area to volume ratio of the food** that enzyme can act on more efficiently. (b) Salivary glands: Secrete saliva into mouth via salivary ducts. * saliva contains salivary amylase that **digest starch to maltose** (c) Tongue: mix food with saliva into bolus **Maltose**
2. Oesophagus * A narrow muscular tube that connects the buccal cavity and stomach * It is made up of two layers of muscle. The external layer is the **longitudinal muscle** and the inner layer is the **circular muscle**.

Overview of digestive system

Stomach

Stomach wall has pits that lead to **gastric gland**, which secretes

(I) mucus which protects the stomach walls

(2) gastric acid/dilute hydrochloric acid

* Gastric acid is pH 2, **denatures salivary amylase** thus stop its activity
* changes the **inactive pepsinogen into the active form, pepsin
* provides an acidic environment as pepsin **optimum pH** is 2
* **kills germs and bacteria.**

(3) pepsinogen (inactive form)

* dilute HCl activates pepsinogen to pepsin
* pepsin **digest proteins to polypeptides**

* Food normally remains in the stomach for about three to four hours. The partly digested food becomes liquefied, forming chyme.
* The pyloric sphincter is located at the place where the stomach joins the small intestine. When the muscle contracts, the entrance to the small intestine closes. When the ring relaxes, chyme passes in small amounts into the duodenum Overview of digestive system

Small Intestine

* The small intestine is divided into three parts: the duodenum, jejunum and ileum.
* In the duodenum, chyme from the stomach mixes with

1. **Pancreatic juice** secreted from pancreas
2. **Intestinal juice** secreted by epithelial cells of small intestine
3. **Bile** from gall bladder
* all three juices are alkaline, thus they neutralise the acidic chyme from stomach and provide an optimum alkaline environment for pancreatic and intestinal enzymes

Bile
* Bile is produced by the liver and stored in the gall bladder.
* It passes into the small intestine through the bile duct.
* Bile **emulsifies large fat droplets** into **smaller** fat droplets,

**increasing the surface area to volume ratio** of the fats for **lipase** to work on and **speeds up fat digestion**Overview of digestive system

## 4 **Detoxification**

* The liver breaks down **toxic substances** for **excretion** in urine or bile.
* E.g. alcohol is broken down **acetaldehyde**, catalysed by **alcohol dehydrogenase**.
* **Aetaldehyde** is then converted to harmless **acetic acid** by **acetaldehyde dehydrogenase**.

* Alcohol irritates oesophageal, stomach and intestinal linings, leading to inflammation and ulcers
* When liver cells are inflamed and damaged, liver cells are replaced with fibrous scar tissues. This is called liver cirrhosis.
* reduced ability of previous 6 functions has very serious complications
* Alcohol is also a depressant, which inhibit the central nervous system (CNS), impairs and slows the activity of the brain and nervous system leading to a slower reaction time and reduced self control.
* Greater risk taking and poor decision making
* vulnerable to unintentional accidents and injuries.
