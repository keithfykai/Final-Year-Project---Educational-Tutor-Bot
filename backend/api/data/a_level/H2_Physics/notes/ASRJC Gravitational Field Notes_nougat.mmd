## Introduction

Before 1686, much data had been collected on the motions of the Moon and the planets, but scientists had yet to understand the forces which governed those motions. Isaac Newton knew that, from his laws of motion, a net force had to be acting on the Moon. Otherwise, the Moon would move in a straight-line path rather than in its almost circular orbit. Along with other reasons, this led Newton to postulate the Universal Law of Gravitation.

### Newton's Law of Gravitation

Newton's Law of Gravitation:

The mutual force of attraction between any two point masses is proportional to the product of the masses and inversely proportional to the square of their separation.

Mathematically, the magnitude of the gravitational force \(F\) between two masses \(M\) and \(m\), separated by a distance \(r\), is given as

where \(G\) is the universal gravitational constant. (_G_ = 6.67 x 10\({}^{\text{-}11}\) N m\({}^{2}\) kg\({}^{2}\))

Note that:

When stating the law, you must specify that the masses are point masses.

In practice, point masses are not possible, but the law applies to masses whose separation is much greater than their dimensions (separation >> radius). The law also applies to spheres of _uniform_ densities, given their separation is much greater than their dimensions. In which case, the mass of the sphere is taken to be concentrated at its _centre_.

Gravitational forces are always attractive. Sometimes a negative sign is used to indicate the attractive nature of the force. The magnitude of the gravitational force between two masses is actually given by:

\[F=G\frac{Mm}{r^{2}}\]

The force acts along the line joining the centres of the bodies.

The mutual attractive forces between the two bodies form an action-reaction pair.

_M is attracted towards m with a force F towards the right. At the same time, m is attracted by M with an equal force F but in the opposite direction._ (Newton's 3\({}^{\text{rd}}\) Law)

Since the value of G is very small, gravitational forces are significant only when the bodies have significant masses.

### Worked example 1

Two identical lead spheres of mass 3.00 kg each are placed such that the separation is 10.0 m from the centre of one sphere to another. They attract each other with a gravitational force \(F\). Calculate the force \(F\). (6.00 x 10\({}^{\text{-12}}\)N)

### Solution

\[F =G\frac{Mm}{r^{2}}\] \[=6.67\times 10^{\text{-11}}\times\frac{3.00\times 3.00}{\left(10.0 \right)^{2}}\] \[=6.00\text{ x 10}^{\text{-12}}\text{ N}\]

### Example 1

Find the force between

(a) the Earth and a 50 kg girl

(b) a 60 kg boy and a 50 kg girl, one metre apart.

[mass of Earth = \(6.0\times 10^{24}\) kg, radius of Earth = \(6.4\times 10^{6}\) m]

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:4]

**Learning Point:**

\(F_{12}=\frac{GM_{1}M_{2}}{r^{2}}\) is the gravitational force that \(M_{1}\) exerts on \(M_{2}\). If there is a third mass \(M_{3}\), then \(M_{3}\) also exerts a gravitational force on \(M_{2}\). To find the net gravitational force acting on \(M_{2}\), the resultant of the 2 forces must be found.

## Appendix A The Gravitational Field

* A _field_ is a model used by physicists to help them understand how objects not in direct contact with each other (called _action-at-a-distance_) can affect each other's behaviour.
* An action-at-a-distance effect in which one body A exerts a force on another body B not in contact with it, can be regarded as due to a 'field of force' in the region around A.
* **Field of force** is a region of space where a body experiences a force.
* The gravitational field is an example of a field of force.
* A mass \(M\) creates a force field around itself. Any other mass \(m\) placed in this field would be attracted towards \(M\). The force field round mass \(M\) is called the gravitational field of \(M\).

#### a.2.1 Definition of a Gravitational Field

* Gravitational field is a region of space where a mass experiences a force. The direction of the field is the direction of the force on the mass.

#### Representing gravitational field by field lines

Field lines can be drawn to visualize a gravitational field.

### Gravitational field around the Earth can be represented as shown:

* **Note:**
* Closer lines of force indicates stronger gravitational field.
* The field is actually three dimensional in nature.
* The field is directed towards the centre of the Earth and it gets stronger as it gets closer to the Earth's surface.

**ANDERSON SERANGOON JUNIOR COLLEGE**

**PHYSICS 9749**

#### a.2.2 Gravitational Field Strength, \(g\)

* To _quantif_ the strength of a mass's gravitational field at a certain point, the term _gravitational field strength_, \(g\) is introduced.
* The gravitational field strength at a point is defined as the _gravitational force exerted_ per unit mass placed at that point.
* \(g=\frac{F}{m}\)

unit of \(g\): **N kg\({}^{-1}\)** or **m s\({}^{-2}\)**

\(g\) is a _vector_ quantity.

Its direction is that which a small test mass would move when placed in the field.
* Gravitational field strength is always associated with an attractive force only (compare with electric field, where the forces may be attractive or repulsive).
* Derivation of \(g=\frac{GM}{r^{2}}\) for the gravitational field strength of a **point mass**\(M\)(or spherical mass) By definition, the gravitational field strength at any point \(r\) from a point mass (or uniform sphere) \(M\) is, \(g=\frac{F}{m}\) By Newton's law of gravitation, \(F=\frac{GMm}{r^{2}}\) therefore, \(g\ =\ \frac{F}{m}\ =\ \ \frac{GMm}{r^{2}m}\ \ \Rightarrow\ \ \ \ \ \boxed{g=\frac{GM}{r^{2}}}\)

**Note:**

* When using the above equation \(g=\frac{GM}{r^{2}}\) to calculate gravitational field strength, the mass used should be that of the mass generating the field.
* Gravitational field strength is a _vector_ quantity. Its direction is towards the mass which generates the field as gravitational forces are always attractive.

**Anderson Serangoon Junior College**

**Physics 9749**

**Worked example 2**

Two point masses \(m_{i}\) and \(m_{2}\) are a distance \(r\) apart. Determine the magnitude of the gravitational field strength caused by \(m_{i}\) at position of \(m_{2}\).

**Thinking Process**

\(g=\frac{F}{m}=\frac{GM}{r^{2}}\) (where \(G\) is the gravitational constant, 6.67 x 10\({}^{-11}\) N m\({}^{2}\) kg\({}^{2}\), \(M\) is the mass of the body causing the field, \(m\) is the mass of the body in the field)

For this question, to get the field strength by \(m_{i}\) at position of \(m_{2}\), take note that \(m_{i}\) is causing the field.

**Solution**

Force which \(m_{1}\) exerts on \(m_{2}\), \(F_{i_{2}}=\frac{Gm_{i}m_{2}}{r^{2}}\)

Force per unit mass on \(m_{2}\) due to \(m_{i}\)'s field

\(g_{1}=\frac{F_{i_{2}}}{m_{2}}=\frac{Gm_{i}m_{2}}{r^{2}}\times\frac{1}{m_{2}}= \frac{Gm_{i}}{r^{2}}\)

**A.2.3 Graph of Gravitational Field Strength due to a spherical mass \(M\)**

\(g=\frac{GM}{r^{2}}\) of a point mass \(M\) is known as an **inverse square law field** since \(g\propto\frac{1}{r^{2}}\)

When \(r\) gets larger, the magnitude of the gravitational field at that point decreases.

Gravitational field strength is largest at the surface of \(M\).

**Note:**

The equation \(g=\frac{GM}{r^{2}}\) is only valid for \(r\geq R\), i.e. from the surface of the mass and above.

## 11 Anderson Serangoon Junior College

### Worked example 3

An object weighs 270 N at the Earth's surface. Determine its weight at an **altitude equal to twice the radius of the Earth**.

(30 N)

Thinking Process

For this question, \(M\) will be mass of the earth (because earth is the body causing the field)

The mass of the object is not known, thus it is necessary to express the weight of the object

at the surface (which is known) first, then express the weight of the object at the desired

point in terms of this weight.

Solution

\(W_{surface}=mg_{surface}\)

\(270=m\frac{GM_{E}}{R_{E}^{2}}\)

\(W\ \propto\ \frac{1}{r^{2}}\)

\(\frac{M_{3RE}}{W_{surface}}=\frac{{f_{surface}}^{2}}{{f_{3RE}}^{2}}=\frac{1} {9}\)

\(W_{3RE}=30\) N

### 11.4 Gravitational field strength near the Earth's surface

* Near the Earth's surface, the field strength does not change very much over small distances and so the field can be regarded as uniform and the field lines are parallel as shown.
* The gravitational field strength near the Earth's surface is approximately constant and has a numerical value of about 9.8 N kg-1 and this causes an acceleration due to gravity, so the acceleration of free fall is numerically equal to the gravitational field strength since \(F\)=\(ma\)=\(mg\).

To show g is approximately constant near Earth:

[Radius of Earth= 6.4 x 10\({}^{6}\) m; Mass of Earth = 6.0 x 10\({}^{24}\) kg] At a height \(h\) (a few km) close to the surface of the Earth,

\(g=\frac{GM}{r^{2}}\)

\(=\frac{GM}{\left(R+h\right)^{2}}\)

where \(M=\) mass of Earth, \(R=\)radius of Earth

\(\approx\frac{GM}{R^{2}}\)

(\(\because R>>h\))

\(=\frac{(6.67\times 10^{-11})(6.0x10^{24})}{(6.4\times 10^{6})^{2}}=9.8\) m s-2 or N kg-1

**ANDERSON SERANGOON JUNIOR COLLEGE**

**PHYSICS 9749**

#### a.3.1 Gravitational Potential Energy \(U\)

* The gravitational potential energy of a mass at a point is the work done on the mass by an external force in moving it from infinity to that point.

Note that there is no contradiction between this formula and the commonly used formula \(\Delta U\)=_mgh_. Their reference point taken is different.

\(U=-\frac{GMm}{r}\)At \(\infty\), \(U\)= 0

Gravitational potential energy is **negative** because, by convention, the zero of gravitational potential energy is taken to be zero at infinity. Since all gravitational forces are attractive, work done by the external force on the mass in moving it from infinity is negative.

**Note:**

* The work done by the external force does not accelerate the mass, so there is no increase in KE of the mass.
* The negative sign here indicates that the external force is in opposite direction to the motion of the mass. (Recall work done = \(f\,d\,\cos\,\theta\))
* As mentioned in 'Work, Energy, Power', the choice of reference point for gravitational potential energy is arbitrary. The convention is to take gravitational potential energy to be zero when \(r\to\infty\).

#### 4.3.2 Gravitational Potential \(\phi\)

The gravitational potential at a point is the work done per unit mass in bringing a small test mass from infinity to that point.

In equation form,

\(\phi\)=\(\frac{U}{m}\)

\(\phi\) is a **scalar**.

Unit of \(\phi\)_is_: **J kg\({}^{-1}\)**

**Note:**

The gravitational potential at infinity is zero.

Gravitational potential can also be understood as gravitational potential energy per unit mass, \(\phi\) = \(\frac{U}{m}\) = \(\frac{-\frac{GMm}{r}}{m}\) = \(-\frac{GM}{r}\)

\(\phi\) = \(-\frac{GM}{r}\)

\(\circ\) **All** values of gravitational potential are **negative**. Gravitational potential is always **negative** because the gravitational potential is taken to be zero at infinity and gravitational forces are attractive, work done by the external agent on the point mass moving it from infinity is negative.

A body placed in a gravitational field will tend to move from a point of higher potential (less negative) to a point of lower potential (more negative).

**Gravitational potential is a property of a point in the field** and does not depend on the mass at the point

Consider the variation of gravitational potential \(\phi\) due to a spherical uniform mass M with the distance \(r\) from its centre of mass:

\(\phi\)/J kg\({}^{-1}\)

When comparing potential, consider the negative sign as potential is a scalar quantity e.g. - 4 J kg\({}^{-1}\) is larger than \(-8\) J kg\({}^{-1}\)

When \(r\) gets bigger, the point is further from the source of the field, the gravitational potential at that point is **higher**.

The largest value for gravitational potential is 0 J kg\({}^{-1}\) and it occurs when \(\frac{r\to\infty}{r}\)

**Example 5**: A satellite of mass 50 kg moves from a point where the gravitational potential due to the Earth is -20 MJ kg-1, to another point where the gravitational potential is -60 MJ kg-1.

In which direction does the satellite move and what is its change in potential energy?

**A**: closer to the Earth and a loss of 2000 MJ of potential energy.

**B**: closer to the Earth and a loss of 40 MJ of potential energy.

**C**: further from the Earth and a gain of 2000 MJ of potential energy.

**D**: further from the Earth and a gain of 40 MJ of potential energy.

**Example 6**: The two masses of 200 kg and 600 kg are rearranged such that they lie on the vertices of a right angle triangle, as shown in the diagram.

**Calculate at point P: (a) the magnitude of the gravitational field strength (b) the gravitational potential 200 kg (c) 40.0 m**

**Learning Point:**

Since gravitational field strength is a vector, the resultant gravitational field strength at a point is the **vector** sum of the gravitational field strength due to the different masses at that point. However, since gravitational potential is a scalar, the resultant gravitational potential at a point is the **algebraic** sum of the gravitational potential due to the different masses at that point.

**ANDERSON SEARANGOON JUNIOR COLLEGE**

**PHYSICS 9749**

#### a.3.3 Equipotentials

* Beside field lines, a gravitational field may also be visualised using equipotential lines (or surfaces).
* The line (or surface) where all points on it has the same gravitational potential is known as an **equipotential line (or surface)**.

For a _non-uniform_ radial field such as that produced by a sphere like the Earth,

gravitational potential \(\phi=-\frac{GM}{r}\)

\(\Rightarrow\) all points at the same distance from the centre of the earth have the same \(\phi\)

The equipotential surfaces are just _spherical shells_ as shown.

**Note**

1. Regular increments of equipotential lines are _not equally spaced_ due to the non-uniform field.
2. _No work_ is done along the same equipotential. Thus the equipotential lines are always _perpendicular_ to the field lines.
3. The field lines always act in the direction of _decreasing_ potential.
4. Near the Earth's surface (_uniform_ field), the equipotentials are just planes _parallel_ to the surface.

**Example 7**

The figure shows the Earth's gravitational field. The dashed lines represent equipotential lines. The gravitational potential is as shown for each of the equipotential lines.

Calculate the work done by the gravitational field in bringing a spacecraft of mass 5000 kg (a) from A to C,

(b) from A to B.

#### a.3.4 The relationship between \(U\) and \(F\)

The negative of the potential energy gradient at a point in the field is equal to the gravitational force at that point.

* Mathematically, \[F=-\frac{dU}{dr}\]
* The potential energy gradient is numerically the gravitational force. The **minus sign** indicates that the _direction_ of gravitation force F is the same as the direction of decreasing potential energy, i.e. direction of \(F\) is from higher GPE to lower GPE

#### a.3.5 The relationship between \(\phi\) and \(g\)

* The negative of the potential gradient at a point in the field is equal to the gravitational field strength at that point.
* Mathematically, \[g=-\frac{d\phi}{dr}\]
* The potential gradient is numerically the gravitational field strength. The **minus sign** indicates that the _direction_ of the field is the same as the direction of decreasing potential, i.e. direction of \(g\) is from higher potential to lower potential.

### Applications of the Law of Gravitation

In this final section of the topic, we will explore several practical applications of Newton's universal law of gravitation.

#### b.1.1 Conservation of Energy

A mass \(m\) that is moving further away from (or closer to) another mass \(M\), leads to a change in its gravitational potential energy (\(U=-\frac{GMm}{r}\) ). In order for the total mechanical energy (gravitational potential energy and kinetic energy) to be conserved, there is a corresponding change in its kinetic energy. In other words, a gain or loss in its GPE is equal to its respective loss or gain in KE.

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:19]

**Anderson Serangoon Junior College**

**Physics 9749**

**Esscape Speed**

* Escape speed is defined as the _minimum speed needed to project a mass m from the surface of a planet such that it would just come to rest at infinity_.
* In order to escape the influence of the field, the body must travel infinitely far from the gravitational source.
* Neglecting air resistance and by _conservation of energy_, the escape speed can be calculated.
* As we are interested in the minimum speed required, the speed of the body should be zero as it approaches infinity.

Consider a projectile of mass \(m\), leaving the surface of a planet of mass \(M\) and radius \(R\) with an escape speed \(v\).

Neglecting air resistance and by _conservation of energy_,

Total initial GPE and KE = total final GPE and KE

\(\left(-\frac{GMm}{R_{M}}\right)+\frac{1}{2}mv^{2}=0+0\)

\(\frac{1}{2}mv^{2}=\frac{GMm}{R_{M}}\)

\(\Rightarrow\) escape speed \(v\) = \(\sqrt{\frac{2GM}{R_{M}}}\)

Note that the expression for escape speed needs to be derived and shown before using it to solve questions.

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:21]

#### b.1.2 Satellites (Circular Orbits)

* Since the satellite \(m\) is undergoing uniform circular motion, there must be a resultant force acting on it.
* The only force that is experienced by \(m\) is due to the gravitational force which _M_exerts on \(m\).

* The statement above in equation form:

* Gravitational force provides centripetal force.

\(F_{net}\) on \(m=\frac{mv^{2}}{r}\) or \(m\acute{e}^{2}\)

\(\frac{GMm}{r^{2}}=\frac{mv^{2}}{r}\Rightarrow\) linear velocity \(\nu=\sqrt{\frac{GM}{r}}\)

\(\frac{GMm}{r^{2}}=m\acute{e}^{2}\Rightarrow\) angular velocity \(\omega=\sqrt{\frac{GM}{r^{3}}}\)

\(\frac{GM}{r^{3}}\)

period of orbit \(T=\frac{2\pi}{\omega}=2\pi\sqrt{\frac{r^{3}}{GM}}\)

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:23]

**Anderson Serangoon Junior College**

**Physics 9749**

**Note**

1. The negative sign for \(E_{\rm f}\) denotes that the satellite is _bounded_ to the Earth by gravitational attraction. In other words, energy has to be supplied before the satellite can be dislodged from the gravitational pull of the Earth. If a satellite loses energy, it will fall towards Earth.
2. \(E_{\rm f}=-\frac{GMm}{2r}\)\(E_{k}=\frac{GMm}{2r}\)\(E_{\rm p}=-\frac{GMm}{r}\) By comparison, \(E_{\rm f}\)\(=\)\(-\)\(E_{\rm k}\)\(=\)\(\gamma_{2}\)\(E_{\rm p}\)
3. A satellite orbiting close to the Earth's atmosphere will lose energy (i.e. \(E_{\rm f}\)) due to atmospheric friction and moves towards lower orbits (i.e. \(r\) decreases). Amazingly, the reduction of \(E_{\rm f}\) is accompanied by an increase in \(E_{\rm k}\) causing the satellite to spiral faster and faster towards the Earth until the satellite either hits the ground or burns up in the atmosphere. Thus, although \(E_{\rm f}\) decreases, it is possible for \(E_{\rm k}\)to increase because the loss in \(E_{\rm p}\) is twice the gain in \(E_{\rm k}\). (Since - \(E_{\rm k}=\gamma_{2}\)\(E_{\rm p}\)\(\Rightarrow\)\(\Delta E_{\rm p}\)= - 2\(\Delta E_{\rm k}\).)

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:25]

**Worked example 6**

An Earth satellite is moved from one stable circular orbit to another stable circular orbit at a greater distance from the Earth. Which one of the following quantities increases for the satellite as a result of the change?

**A** gravitational force

**B** gravitational potential energy

**C** angular velocity

**D** linear speed

**E** centripetal acceleration

**Thinking Process**

Key question on objective:

**is energy a vector or scalar? So if energy is getting less negative, is the energy increasing or decreasing?**

Energy is a scalar. So if energy is getting less negative, the energy is increasing.

Key questions to solve the question:

**is A correct?**

\(F\) = \(\frac{GMm}{r^{2}}\), when \(r\) increases, \(F\) decreases (so A is wrong)

**is C correct?**

\(\frac{GMm}{r^{2}}\) = \(m\omega^{2}r\)\(\Rightarrow\)\(\omega\) = \(\sqrt{\frac{GM}{r^{3}}}\)

When \(r\) increases, \(\omega\) decreases (so C is wrong)

**is D correct?**

\(\frac{GMm}{r^{2}}\) = \(\frac{mv^{2}}{r}\)\(\Rightarrow\)\(\nu\) = \(\sqrt{\frac{GM}{r}}\)

When \(r\) increases, \(\nu\) decreases (so D is wrong)

**is E correct?**

\(F\) = \(ma\), since \(F\) decreases, \(a\) decreases too (so E is wrong)

**is B correct?**

GPE of satellite = \(\frac{GMm}{r}\), when \(r\) increases, GPE becomes less negative (closer to 0 J, the largest possible GPE) (so B is the answer)

Solution

(Refer to Page 23)

Answer: B

## Appendix

### What is _weightlessness_?

True weightlessness vs Weightlessness

\begin{tabular}{p{142.3pt} p{142.3pt}} \hline True weightlessness & Weightlessness \\ \hline Occurs when **true weight is zero**. This will only occur if the mass is at a point where **g = 0 N kg\({}^{1}\)**. & **Weightlessness is the situation when a person experiences free fall and has zero contact force on him.** \\ Examples: & & \\ \(\bullet\) Mass is outside the earth's gravitational field. & & \\ \(\bullet\) Mass at a point between two masses where _resultant g_ is zero. & & \\ \end{tabular}

Why does an astronaut in orbit experience weightlessness?

Both the satellite and the astronaut are falling freely with the same acceleration, the force the satellite exerts on the astronaut is zero, hence the astronaut experiences weightlessness.

**Note:** If there is contact force \(N\) between them, the equations for the spaceship and the astronaut in the spaceship can be written as \(m_{\text{astronaut}}\,g-N=m_{\text{astronaut}}\,a_{\text{c}}\,\) and \(m_{\text{spaceship}}\,g+N=m_{\text{spaceship}}\,a_{\text{c}}\). Since \(g\) and \(a_{\text{c}}\) are the same for them, \(N\) has to be zero.

\begin{tabular}{p{142.3pt} p{142.3pt}} \hline \(m_{\text{spaceship}}\,g\) \\ Planet \\ \hline \end{tabular}

Assuming the Earth is a homogeneous sphere of radius \(\text{R}_{\text{E}}\), show that for \(r\) < \(R_{\text{E}}\), the gravitational field strength, **g**, is proportional to \(r\). Sketch the variation of **g** with distance **r** from the centre of the Earth.

\begin{tabular}{p{142.3pt}} \hline \(g\) \\ If density of earth, \(\rho\) is constant (homogeneous) \(\Rightarrow\,g\propto r\) where 4/3G\(\pi\rho\) is a constant (shown) & \(g\propto 1/r^{2}\) \\ \hline \end{tabular}

## 3 Change in Gravitational Potential Energy, \(\Delta U\) near the surface of the Earth

The change in gravitational potential energy near the surface of the Earth, \(\Delta U\) is given by _mgh_ where \(g\) is the gravitational field strength at the surface of the Earth and \(h\) is the height above the surface of the Earth.

Since \(U_{RE}=-\frac{GM_{E}m}{R_{E}}\) and \(U_{RE+h}=-\frac{GM_{E}m}{R_{E}+h}\)

\(\Delta U=-\frac{GM_{E}m}{R_{E}+h}\) - \((-\frac{GM_{E}m}{R_{E}})=\frac{-GM_{E}mR_{E}+GM_{E}mR_{E}+GM_{E}mh}{(R_{E}+h)R _{E}}\)

\(=\frac{GM_{E}mh}{(R_{E}+h)R_{E}}\)

Near the surface of the Earth, h << R\({}_{E}\),

\(\Delta U=\frac{GM_{E}mh}{R_{E}}^{2}=(\frac{GM_{E}}{R_{E}})mh=gmh=mgh\)

## 4 Experiment to determine the acceleration of free fall, \(g\) using a falling body

The experimental set up is as shown:

1. Electronic timer is used to measure the time taken, \(t\), for a small steel ball to fall through a known distance of s.
2. A small heavy object with smooth surfaces, such as a small steel ball, is usually used in order to minimise the effects of air resistance.
3. When the switch is in position A, the electromagnet holds up a small steel ball.
4. When the switch is moved quickly to position B, the electromagnet releases the ball and the timer starts timing.
5. When the ball hits the trapdoor, the timer circuit is opened at C and the timer stops.
6. Using the equation of motion \(s=u\,t+\,\%\,g\,t^{2}\) Since \(u=0\quad\Rightarrow\quad s=\%\,g\,t^{2}\)
7. The experiment can be repeated a number of times with different s. Plot a graph of \(s\) against \(t^{2}\), \(\text{Gradient }=\%\,g\) \(g=2\,x\) (gradient) This approach helps to reduce the effects of random errors.

## 5 Application of Geostationary Satellites

### Telecommunications

Communication satellites are placed in the geostationary orbits for relaying telephone, radio, and television signals round the curve surface of the Earth. Geostationary communication satellites could remain at the same relative location, in constant electronic line-of-sight, to the stations on the Earth's surface, which facilitates telecommunications.

### Summary
