## 1 Introduction

The study of energy changes which take place during chemical reactions is called chemical energetics or thermochemistry.

### 1 **Enthalpy Change, \(\Delta H\)**

**Learning Objective:**

Able to explain that most chemical reactions and physical processes are accompanied by changes in heat energy which is a result of the breaking and forming of chemical bonds; \(\Delta H=H_{\text{final}}-H_{\text{initial}}\)

When there is a net release in energy, the reaction is exothermic (\(\Delta H\), negative)

When there is a net absorption in energy, the reaction is endothermic (\(\Delta H\), positive).

The sign in \(\Delta H\) enable you to deduce whether the reactant or product is more stable (lower in enthalpy (\(H\)))

The following are concepts and terms related to understanding of enthalpy change:

**Enthalpy, \(H\)**

A measure of energy content in any species, given the symbol \(H\).

Forming stronger bonds (stronger forces of attraction) reduces energy content (smaller value of \(H\)) => greater stability.

**Enthalpy Change, \(\Delta H\)**

Enthalpy change refers to the _overall energy absorbed or released_ in a chemical reaction for 1 mole of a particular substance or molar quantities indicated in a written equation. Its units is usually expressed in kJ mol\({}^{-1}\).

In all chemical reactions, bonds are broken and formed.

**(a)** bond breaking absorbs energy (i.e. endothermic)

**(b)** bond forming releases energy (i.e. exothermic)

\(\Delta H=\)

* \(\Delta H\) is either determined experimentally by measuring the temperature change or via application of Hess' law.

**Heat Change, \(q\)**

Heat change refers to the overall energy absorbed or released in a chemical reaction. Its units is usually expressed in J or kJ

**More examples** & Combustion, freezing, condensation, thermite reaction & Photosynthesis, melting, vapourisation \\ \hline \end{tabular}

_Note:_

* Reactions which are energetically feasible **may still not take place** because the reaction is **too slow** i.e. such reactions are kinetically not feasible due to high activation energy (energetically feasible VS kinetically feasible).

### _Therrochemical Equation_

_Note:_

A thermochemical equation is a balanced chemical equation that shows the state symbols of substances and the associated enthalpy change.

Example:

CH4(g) + 2O2(g) \(\longrightarrow\) CO2(g) + 2H2O(_f_) \(\Delta H=-890.4\) kJ mol-1

_Worked Example 1_

**Given the following reaction:**

Fe2O3(s) + 3CO(g) \(\longrightarrow\) 2Fe(s) + 3CO2(g) \(\Delta H=-27\) kJ mol-1

**Calculate the amount of heat released, q, when**

**(a) 1 mol each of CO(g) and Fe2O3(s) are added together.**

CO is the limiting agent.

According to the above written equation, when 3 moles of CO react, 37 kJ of heat energy is released.

. for 1 mole of CO, heat energy released = 27 + 3 = 9 kJ

**(b) 4 mol of Fe(s) is formed.**

According to the above written equation, when 2 moles of Fe is formed, 37 kJ of heat energy is released.

. for 4 mole of Fe, heat energy released = 27 + 2 = 54 kJ

### _Standard Conditions for \(\Delta H\)_

**Changes in energy content of a system are most easily compared when there is a set of reference conditions.**

**Hence most enthalpy changes are quoted under standard conditions of:**

**(298 K or 25 *C**

**(b) 10\({}^{5}\)Pa or 1 bar**

**Standard conditions are denoted by the symbol e in superscript. (e.g. \(\Delta H_{c}^{e}\))**

**The element in its natural physical state and its most stable allotropic form (when applicable) at 298 K and 10\({}^{5}\)Pa is said to be in its standard state.**

**Example: S(s) / S(s), C(s) in graphite.**

**Similarly, a compound in its natural physical state at 298 K and 10\({}^{5}\)Pa, is said to be in its standard state.**

**Example: H\(\alpha\)O(_f_), Brz(_f_)National Junior College

### Magnitude and sign of \(\Delta H\)

\begin{tabular}{c c c}  & sum of energy & sum of energy \\ \(\Delta H=\) & absorbed during & + released during \\  & bond breaking & bond forming \\ \end{tabular}

* Types and number of moles of each type of chemical bonds broken and formed can only be deduced from a written thermochemical equation.

Therefore, the following affects the value of \(\Delta H\).

**(a) Amount of substance**

If we multiply both sides of a thermochemical equation by a factor \(n\), then \(\Delta H\) (energy change **per molar quantity of a written equation**) must change by the same factor.

\[\begin{array}{ll}\mbox{CH}_{4}(\mbox{g})+2\mbox{O}_{2}(\mbox{g})\longrightarrow \mbox{CO}_{2}(\mbox{g})+2\mbox{H}_{2}\mbox{O}(l)&\Delta H_{1}=-890.4\mbox{ kJ mol}^{-1}\\ 2\mbox{CH}_{4}(\mbox{g})+4\mbox{O}_{2}(\mbox{g})\longrightarrow 2\mbox{CO}_{2}( \mbox{g})+4\mbox{H}_{2}\mbox{O}(l)&\Delta H_{2}=2\mbox{ x }(-890.4)\mbox{ kJ mol}^{-1}\\ \end{array}\]

**(b) Physical states of reactants and products**

\[\begin{array}{ll}\mbox{CH}_{4}(\mbox{g})+2\mbox{O}_{2}(\mbox{g})\longrightarrow \mbox{CO}_{2}(\mbox{g})+2\mbox{H}_{2}\mbox{O}(l)&\Delta H_{1}=-890.4\mbox{ kJ mol}^{-1}\\ \mbox{CH}_{4}(\mbox{g})+2\mbox{O}_{2}(\mbox{g})\longrightarrow\mbox{CO}_{2}( \mbox{g})+2\mbox{H}_{2}\mbox{O}(\mbox{g})&\Delta H_{1}=-802.4\mbox{ kJ mol}^{-1}\\ \end{array}\]

**(c) \(\Delta H\) of forward and backward reactions**

\begin{tabular}{l c c}  & Same magnitude but opposite in sign. i.e. \(\Delta H_{\rm backward}=-\Delta H_{\rm forward}\) \\ \(\mbox{CH}_{4}(\mbox{g})+2\mbox{O}_{2}(\mbox{g})\longrightarrow\mbox{CO}_{2}( \mbox{g})+2\mbox{H}_{2}\mbox{O}(l)&\Delta H=-890.4\mbox{ kJ mol}^{-1}\\ \mbox{CO}_{2}(\mbox{g})+2\mbox{H}_{2}\mbox{O}(l)\longrightarrow\mbox{CH}_{4 }(\mbox{g})+2\mbox{O}_{2}(\mbox{g})&\Delta H=+890.4\mbox{ kJ mol}^{-1}\\ \end{tabular}

**Checkpoint 1**

Given the equation: \(\mbox{H}_{2}(\mbox{g})+\mbox{I}_{2}(\mbox{s})\longrightarrow 2\mbox{HI} (\mbox{g})\)\(\Delta H=+52.96\mbox{ kJ mol}^{-1}\) \\ \end{tabular}

Calculate \(\Delta H\) for the reaction HI (g) \(\longrightarrow\), \(\gamma_{2}\) Hz(g) + \(\gamma_{2}\) Li(s) [-26.48 kJ mol\({}^{-1}\)]

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:6]

_Worked Example 2_

Given that the equation that represents the standard enthalpy change of formation of solid copper: Cu(s) \(\rightarrow\) Cu(s)

Explain why the value of \(\Delta H^{o}_{T}\) solid copper is 0 kJ mol\({}^{-1}\)

The initial and final states are the **same**, hence **no change** in energy level.

**More about \(\Delta H^{o}_{T}\):**

* \(\Delta H^{o}_{T}\) of all elements in standard states = 0 kJ mol\({}^{-1}\)
* Enthalpy changes of formation are often theoretical. Such reactions may not take place in practice. E.g. C\(\mu\)sOH cannot be formed by just mixing C, H\({}_{2}\) and O\({}_{2}\).
* For elements that can exist in several allotropic forms, only the most stable form under standard conditions is given zero standard enthalpy change of formation.

E.g. C (graphite) \(\longrightarrow\) C (graphite) \(\Delta H^{o}_{T}\) (graphite) = 0 kJ mol\({}^{-1}\)

C (graphite) \(\longrightarrow\) C (diamond) \(\Delta H^{o}_{T}\) (diamond) = +2 kJ mol\({}^{-1}\)

### Standard enthalpy change of combustion, \(\Delta H^{o}_{c}\)

The standard enthalpy change of combustion is the heat released when one mole of a substance is completely burnt in excess oxygen at 298 K and 1 bar.

E.g. C(s) + O\({}_{2}\)(g) \(\longrightarrow\) CO\({}_{2}\)(g) \(\Delta H^{o}_{c}\) = -393 kJ mol\({}^{-1}\)

393 kJ of heat is released when 1 mole of carbon (graphite) is burnt in excess oxygen under standard conditions of 298 K and 1 bar.

Even though substantial amount of energy is absorbed to overcome the C-C bonds in graphite, energy absorbed to overcome O=O is significantly less than energy released from formation of C=O bonds in carbon dioxide. Hence there is a net release of heat energy. \(\Delta H^{o}_{c}\) is always negative.

_Worked Example 3_

Write thermochemical equation that represents the following standard enthalpy changes, given that both are exothermic reactions.

\(\Delta H^{o}_{c}\) is per mole of fuel

(a) standard enthalpy change of combustion of CH\({}_{4}\)(g)

CH\({}_{4}\)(g) + 2O\({}_{2}\)(g) \(\longrightarrow\) CO\({}_{2}\)(g) + 2H\({}_{2}\)O(\(\hbar\) \(\Delta H^{o}_{c}\) (CH\({}_{4}\)(g)) < 0\)

(b) standard enthalpy change of formation of CH\({}_{4}\)(g)

C(s) + 2H\({}_{2}\)(g) \(\longrightarrow\) CH\({}_{4}\)(g) \(\Delta H^{o}_{T}\) (CH\({}_{4}\)(g)) < 0

### Standard enthalpy change of neutralisation, \(\Delta H^{\alpha}_{n}\)

The standard enthalpy change of neutralisation is the heat released when one mole of water is formed from the reaction between an acid and an alkali at 298 K and 1 bar.

NaOH(aq) + HC/(aq) \(\longrightarrow\) NaC(aq) + H\(\alpha\)O(_l_) \(\Delta H^{\alpha}_{n}=-57.3\) kJ mol-1

57.3 kJ of heat is released when 1 mole of water is formed as a result of the reaction between NaOH and HC/ under standard conditions of 298 K and 1 bar.

Strong acids and strong bases completely ionise (or dissociate) in aqueous solution. Hence the reaction is essentially:

\[\text{H}^{+}\text{(aq) + OH}\text{(aq) }\longrightarrow\text{H}_{2}\text{O(_l_) \Delta H^{\alpha}_{n}=-57.3\ kJ mol-1}\]

Weak acids and weak bases are only partially dissociated in aqueous solution.

For example, for a weak acid HA,

HA(aq) \(\Rightarrow\) H\({}^{+}\text{(aq) + A}\text{(aq) }\)\(\Delta H\)

H\({}^{+}\text{(aq) + OH}\text{(aq) }\longrightarrow\text{H}_{2}\text{O(_l_) \Delta H}=-57.3\ kJ mol-1}\)

Part of the heat released from H\({}^{+}\text{(aq)}\) reacting with OH\({}^{+}\text{(aq)}\), \(\Delta H_{2}\), is used to provide the energy to complete the dissociation of the weak acid or base, \(\Delta H_{1}\). Hence the enthalpy change is less exothermic than that of a strong acid-strong base neutralisation.

Strong acid-strong base neutralisation:

NaOH(aq) + HC/(aq) \(\longrightarrow\) NaC(aq) + H\(\alpha\)O(_l_) \(\Delta H^{\alpha}_{n}=-57.3\ kJ mol-1}\)

Weak acid-strong base neutralisation:

NaOH(aq) + CH\({}_{3}\)COOH(aq) \(\longrightarrow\) CH\({}_{3}\)COONa(aq) + H\({}_{2}\)O(_l_) \(\Delta H^{\alpha}_{n}=-55.2\ kJ mol-1}\)

(less exothermic)

### Bond Energy (_Be_)

_Note:_

_BE_ are always positive values (i.e. endothermic) since breaking of bonds always require energy.

_Note:_

The magnitude of _BE_ is directly proportional to the bond strength. The stronger the bond, the larger the magnitude of BE.

**Important Concept**

For diatomic gases, \(\chi_{2}\): _BE_(X-X) = 2 x \(\Delta H^{*}_{at}\) X\({}_{2}\)(g)

E.g. \(\ F\)-F(g) \(\longrightarrow\) 2F(g)

\(\Delta H^{*}_{at}\) = +79 kJ mol\({}^{-1}\)

_For polyatomic molecules_:

Unlike diatomic molecules, the bond energy values of polyatomic molecules found in page 46 of the _Data Booklet_ are **average values**. This is because, a same type of covalent bonds in different polyatomic molecules can have different bond energy values due to the different types of chemical environment the bond may be in.

Hence, the bond energy given in the _Data Booklet_ is an average value, taking into account all the different types of chemical environment the bond is in. This can result in discrepancies between enthalpy change calculated using bond energy data and their actual values (see tutorial questions).

E.g. \(\ H\)-CC\({}_{b}\longrightarrow\ H\)(g) + CC\({}_{b}\)\(\ B\)E(C-H) = +400 kJ mol\({}^{-1}\)

\(\ H\)-CHC\({}_{b}\longrightarrow\ H\)(g) + CHC\({}_{b}\)\(\ B\)E(C-H) = +414 kJ mol\({}^{-1}\)

\(\ H\)-CHC\({}_{b}\longrightarrow\ H\)(g) + CHC\({}_{b}\)\(\ B\)E(C-H) = +422 kJ mol\({}^{-1}\)

### Lattice Energy, _L.E._

Lattice energy (_L.E._) of an ionic compound is the _energy_ released when _one mole of ionic solid is formed from its constituent gaseous ions.

E.g. \(\ Na^{*}\)(g) + C\({}^{\prime}\)(g) \(\longrightarrow\ NaC\)(s)\(\ L.E.\) (NaC\({}_{b}\)) = -776 kJ mol\({}^{-1}\)

**Recall:**

The larger the charge of the cation and anion, the more exothermic the lattice energy. The smaller the ionic radii of the cation and anion, the more exothermic the lattice energy

#### 3.1.1 Calculations of enthalpy changes using calorimetry

_Worked Example 4a: Determine enthalpy change of reaction, \(\Delta H\), for acid-metal reaction_

0.560 g of zinc powder was added to 30.0 cm\({}^{3}\) of 0.500 mol dm\({}^{-3}\) hydrochloric acid in a polystyrene cup. The initial temperature of the acid was 25.0 \({}^{\circ}\)C and the highest temperature reached was 35.5 \({}^{\circ}\)C.

Assume that the density of the solution is 1.00 g cm\({}^{-3}\) and its specific heat capacity is 4.18 J g\({}^{-1}\) K\({}^{-1}\).

Calculate the enthalpy change of reaction represented by the following equation:

\[\text{Zn(s) + 2HC(aq) }\longrightarrow\text{ZnC}_{b}(\text{aq})+\text{H}_{2}( \text{g})\]

_Approach:_

**Step 1:** (Already given in the question)

Construct balanced

**Step 3:**

Determine the unknown

\(\Delta H\) using

\(\Delta H\) = \(\frac{mcT}{n}\)

_Note:_

**m = mass of solution in g (ignore mass of any solid added)**

\(\Delta H\) = \(\frac{mcT}{n_{limiting reagent}}\times\text{coefficient of limiting reagent}\)

\(\Delta H\) = \(\frac{(30)(4.18)(35.5-25.0)}{1.50\times 10^{-2}}\times 2\) = - \(175\) 560 J mol\({}^{-1}\)

\(\Delta H\) = - \(176\) kJ mol\({}^{-1}\) (3 s.f)
_Worked Example 4b: (Determine enthalpy change of neutralisation, \(\Delta H_{0}\))_

When 50 cm\({}^{3}\) of 1.00 mol dm\({}^{-3}\) sodium hydroxide is added to 100 cm\({}^{3}\) of 1.00 mol dm\({}^{-3}\) hydrochloric acid in a polystyrene cup, the temperature of the mixture was found to increase from 25.0 \({}^{\circ}\)C to 29.5 \({}^{\circ}\)C. Assuming the specific heat capacity and density of the reaction mixture is 4.18 J g\({}^{-1}\) K\({}^{-1}\) and 1 g cm\({}^{-3}\) respectively, calculate the enthalpy change of neutralisation.

_Approach:_

respective \(\Delta H\)

**Step 3:**

Determine the unknown

\(\Delta H\) using

\(\Delta H\) = - \(\frac{mcAT}{n}\)

\(\Delta H\) = - \(\frac{mcAT}{n_{H_{2}0}}\) = - \(\frac{(150)(4.18)(29.5-25.0)}{0.0500}\) = - \(\frac{2821.5}{0.0500}\) = - \(56430\) J mol\({}^{-1}\)

\(=\) -56.4 kJ mol\({}^{-1}\) (exothermic)

_Note:_

The enthalpy change of neutralisation is the heat released **when one mole of water**

is formed from the reaction between an acid and an alkali.

**Checkpoint 3**

Zinc metal reacts with silver nitrate to give zinc nitrate and silver metal. 1.40 g of zinc powder was added to 50.0 cm\({}^{3}\) of 0.100 mol dm\({}^{-3}\) AgNO\({}_{3}\) in a polystyrene cup. Initially the temperature was 21.1 \({}^{\circ}\)C and subsequently rose to 25.4 \({}^{\circ}\)C. Determine the enthalpy change of reaction for one mole of Zn.

Assume that the density of the solution is 1.00g cm\({}^{3}\) and its specific heat capacity is 4.18 J g\({}^{-1}\) K\({}^{-1}\).

**[-359 kJ mol\({}^{-1}\)]**

#### 3.1.2 Determination of enthalpy change of combustion of liquid fuel using calorimetry

* A spirit burner containing liquid fuel is used. Weighing the spirit burner before and after burning gives the mass of fuel used for combustion.
* A known volume of water is placed in a copper calorimeter and its temperature taken.
* The wick is lighted and the water in the calorimeter is stirred with the thermometer. When the temperature has risen by about 10 \({}^{\circ}\)C, the flame is put out and the spirit burner is reweighed immediately.

The experimental value obtained for the enthalpy change of combustion of methanol using the above setup is **less exothermic** (**smaller** in **magnitude**) than the actual (true) value due to the following reasons:

\begin{tabular}{|p{113.8pt}|p{113.8pt}|p{113.8pt}|} \hline Reasons & Effect on \(\Delta H_{k}\left(\propto\right.\) & \(\frac{mc\Delta T}{n_{substance\_burst}}\) \\ \hline The assumption that methanol undergoes complete combustion to form CO\({}_{2}\) and H\({}_{2}\)O may not always be true. & \\ When inadequate oxygen is supplied, some methanol undergoes incomplete combustion to form carbon monoxide or carbon (soot). & \\ Thus, for the same mass of fuel burnt, less energy is released. & \(\Delta T\) measured will be smaller than expected and thus the magnitude of \(\Delta H_{k}\) calculated is smaller than actual. \\ \hline The assumption that all the heat released from combustion is absorbed by the water in calorimeter is not true. & \(\Delta T\) measured will be smaller than expected and thus the magnitude of \(\Delta H_{k}\) calculated is smaller than actual. \\ Significant amount of heat is lost to the surrounding air from the spirit lamp flame. & \\ Some heat is also absorbed by the copper calorimeter. & \\ \hline Difference in the mass of methanol and spirit burner before and after combustion \(\neq\) mass of methanol burnt. & Mass of methanol burnt recorded is larger than the actual mass burnt. & \\ Evaporation of volatile methanol from the hot spirit burner cause additional loss in mass. & Heat change is divided by a larger than expected amount of methanol, resulting in a smaller magnitude of \(\Delta H_{k}\) calculated. & \\ \hline \end{tabular}

_Note:_

There is no need to determine the limiting agent in a combustion reaction. By definition, combustion has to be carried out under excess oxygen.

_Note:_

Do not use the mass of the methanol being burnt in _heat change = mc\(\Delta\)T._

Mass of the water heated up should be used. This is because heat released from the combustion is gained by the water. The temperature change recorded is that of the water, not the methanol.

Calculate the enthalpy change of combustion of methanol.

\[\text{CH}_{3}\text{OH}(\text{$\text{$\text{$\text{$\text{$\text{$\text{$ \text{$\text{$\text{$\text{$\text{$\text{$\text{$\text{$\text{$\text{$}}$}$}$}$}$}}}}}}$}$})+3/2\ \text{O}_{2}(\text{$\text{$\text{$\text{$\text{$\text{$\text{$\text{$\text{$ \text{$\text{$\text{$\text{$\text{$\text{$\text{$\text{$\text{$\text{$\text{$\${$\text{$ $}}}$}$}$}$}}}}}}}$}$})}\longrightarrow\text{CO}_{2}(\text{$ \text{$\text{$\text{$\text{$\text{$\text{$\text{$\text{$\text{$\text{$\text{$ $\text{$\text{$\text{$\text{$\text{$\text{$\text{$\text{$\text{$$\text{$$ $}}$}$}$}$}$}$}}}}}}}$}}$)+2\text{H}_{2}\text{O}(\text{$\text{$\text{$ \text{$\text{$\text{$\text{$\text{$\text{$\text{$\text{$\text{$\text{$ $\text{$\text{$\text{$\text{$\text{$\text{$\text{$$\text{$$$}}$}$}$}$}$}$}}}}}}}}$}$}$)}\]

amount of methanol burnt = \(\frac{mass\ of\ methanol}{M_{r}\ of\ methanol}=\frac{532.68-531.72}{12.0+4(1.0)+16.0}\)

\[=3.00\times 10^{-2}\ \text{mol}\]

\[\Delta H_{k}=-\frac{mc\Delta T}{n_{methanol}}=-\frac{(200)(4.18)(39.3-28.0)}{3.00\times 10^{-2}}=-\frac{9446.8}{3.00\times 10^{-2}}=-315\ \text{KJ mol}^{-1}\]

**Note:**

The enthalpy change of combustion is the heat released when **one mole of a substance is completely burnt** in excess oxygen.

_Worked Example 6_

An experiment was carried out as follow to determine the standard enthalpy change of combustion of butane (C\({}_{\text{a}}\)H\({}_{\text{to}}\)) contained in the gas cylinder of a camping gas stove.

A large beaker of water was placed on the stove and heated by combusting butane completely in excess oxygen. The temperature rise was recorded. The cylinder was weighed before and after the experiment to determine the mass of gas used. The following results were obtained.

\begin{tabular}{|l|c|} \hline mass of butane used/ g & 3.4 \\ \hline mass of water heated/ g & 500 \\ \hline temperature rise/ \({}^{\circ}\)C & 44 \\ \hline \end{tabular}
**(i)**: Write a thermochemical equation for the combustion of butane.

\[\text{C}_{\text{a}}\text{H}_{\text{to}}(\text{g})+\frac{\text{13}}{2}\text{O} _{\text{z}}(\text{g})\longrightarrow 4\text{CO}_{\text{z}}(\text{g})+5\text{H} \text{zO}(\text{h})\qquad\qquad\Delta H_{\text{c}}^{\text{a}}<0\]
**(ii)**: Use the data given to calculate the enthalpy change of combustion of butane.

\[\begin{array}{l}\text{amount of butane burnt}=\frac{mass\ of\ butane}{M_{r}\ of\ butane}=\frac{3.4}{4(12.0)+10(1.0)}\\ =5.862\times 10^{-2}\ mol\\ \Delta H_{\text{c}}=-\frac{mc\Delta T}{n_{butane}}=-\frac{(500)(4.18)(44)}{5. 862\times 10^{-2}}=-1570\ kJ\ mol^{-1}\end{array}\]
**(iii)**: The true value of \(\Delta H_{\text{c}}\) of butane is -2877 kJ mol\({}^{-1}\).

Suggest a reason for the difference in magnitude between this true value and your calculated value in **(ii)**.

Only a portion of heat released from combustion is absorbed by water. Some heat are lost to the surrounding air and the container.
