### Introduction: The Nature of Science

Science is a _durable_ body of knowledge derived from empirical and repeatable observations. Despite this, science knowledge is also _tentative_: it is neither set in concrete nor perfect. Rather, it is subject to change.

A _scientific law_ describes an observed phenomenon while a _scientific theory_ explains it. The tentative nature of science also means that laws and theories may be updated in the light of new evidence or new interpretation of existing evidence.

Since science demands and relies on empirical evidence, a system of measurements is important to allow meaningful and objective comparisons between observations.

### Physical Quantities and Units

A _physical quantity_ is a property of a material or system that can be quantified by measurement. Each quantity consists of a numerical _magnitude_ and a _unit_.

\begin{tabular}{p{142.3pt} p{142.3pt} p{142.3pt}}  & We adopt SI units. The SI was founded on 7 _base quantities_, by which all other physical quantities in the SI are defined. The 7 SI base units are related to the base quantities where each is defined without referring to other units. \\ \end{tabular}

\begin{tabular}{p{142.3pt} p{142.3pt} p{142.3pt}}  & **Systems of measurements are generally inter-convertible**. _However, conversion from SI to English' units (poudrons/teefincles used in the US) can result in mistakes. In 1999, NASA lost the 5125 million Mars Climate Orbiter spacecraft after a 286-day journey to Mars. Thrusters used to nucleo spacecraft onto a correct path were fired incorrectly. Lockheed Martin, sent thruster data in pounds to NASA, but NASA's navigation team was expecting metric units (neutons)._ \\ \end{tabular}

Other quantities such as force (in newtons) and energy (in joules) are referred to as _derived quantities_. These can be expressed in terms of the 7 base quantities.

When expressing a derived unit in terms of base units, consider the equations that relate to its associated quantity.

#### 1.1.1 Homogeneous Equations and Dimensional Analysis

All correct physical equations are _homogenous_: all the terms on both sides of the equation have the same base units. If a quantity does not have an associated physical unit (dimension) and is purely a number, it is a _dimensionless_ quantity.

Dimensional analysis may be used to determine the

* unit of a constant in an equation
* unit of an unknown quantity (which can be used to deduce possibilities for the unknown quantity)
* plausibility of a proposed physical equation

When performing dimensional analysis:

* addition or subtraction must involve only terms of the same units
* any exponent (the "power" by which a quantity is raised to) must be dimensionless

**Example 2**

The Bernoulli's equation used for fluid flow in a pipe may be expressed in the form

\[p+\frac{1}{2}\rho x^{2}+A\rho h=B\]

where \(p\) is the pressure of the fluid, \(\rho\) is the density of the fluid, \(h\) is the height of the pipe, A and B are constants, and \(x\) is a physical quantity.

**(a)**: Determine, in terms of SI base units, the units of A and \(x\).

\[\begin{array}{l}\text{unit of }P\ =\ \big{(}\text{unit of A}\big{)}\big{(}\text{unit of }\rho\big{)}\big{(}\text{unit of }h\big{)}\\ \frac{\big{(}\text{kg}\big{)}\big{(}\text{m s}^{-2}\big{)}}{\big{(}\text{m}^{2 }\big{)}}=\ \big{(}\text{unit of A}\big{)}\big{(}\text{kg m}^{-3}\big{)}\big{(}\text{m} \end{array}\big{)}\\ \text{unit of A}=\ \text{m s}^{-2}\end{array}\]

**(b)**: Suggest a possible physical quantity that is represented by \(x\).

### Errors

The experimental error in measuring a physical quantity can be understood as the difference between the measured value and the true value of a physical quantity.

Experimental error = measured value - true value

#### Random Errors and Systematic Errors

A **random error** occurs when the measured values are

scattered about the true value

with no fixed pattern.

A **systematic error** occurs when the

measured values are

consistently larger

or consistently smaller

than the true value.

**random errors**

**systematic errors**

cannot be eliminated

can reduce by averaging

can reduce by correct laboratory practice

fluctuations in the readings of a

sentive measuring instrument

(e.g. an electronic balance)

fluctuations in the conditions of the

environment

(e.g. temperature or vibrations)

Irregularities in the quantity

measured

(e.g. diameter of a long wire)

human judgement

**Experimental data around a line of known equation**:

Consider the scattering of data points about a best fit line.

The larger the scatter, the larger the extent of random errors in the experiment.

A best fit line compensates

for values that are higher

than the true values with

the ones that are lower.

#### Accuracy and Precision

[FIGURE:S

### Uncertainty

An uncertainty quantifies the extent of errors. It gives the total range of values on both sides of a measurement in which the actual value of the measurement is expected to lie.

#### 1.3.1 Absolute Uncertainty

A measurement \(x\) and its associated uncertainty \(\Delta x\) can be expressed in the form

\[x\pm\Delta x\]

where \(\Delta x\) is the _absolute uncertainty_ of \(x\).

**Notes**:

1. When a **calculation for uncertainty \(\Delta x\)** is required in an intermediate step or asked for in a standalone calculation, follow the general significant figures / decimal place (s.f. / d.p.) rule: * For **addition/subtraction** of values, the **d.p. of the answer** should follow the **lowest d.p.** used in the calculation. [See Example 8] * For **multiplication/division** of values, the **s.f. of the answer** should follow the **least s.f.** used in the calculation, subject to a minimum of 2 s.f. [See Example 9-11] * 2. When required to provide a **value with its associated uncertainty in the form of \((x\pm\Delta x)\)**,** \(\Delta x\) **must be rounded off to 1 s.f;** * \(x\) **takes the same d.p. as the absolute uncertainty e.g.** \[l=52.1\pm 0.1\text{ cm}\qquad\text{ or }\qquad m=21.03\pm 0.05\text{ kg }\qquad\text{or }\qquad V=830\pm 10\text{ cm}^{3}\]

**Example 6**

Salt is poured into a wide beaker. The height of the salt \(h\) is desired in order to determine the volume occupied. Since it is not a liquid, the height is not even. Several measurements at peaks and troughs of the salt surface is made using the depth rod of a vernier calliper. The readings are shown below.

1. Estimate the uncertainty of the height \(h\), and
2. express the measurement \(h\) with its uncertainty.

\[h_{\text{h}}\text{ / mm}\qquad h_{\text{2}}\text{ / mm}\qquad h_{\text{3}}\text{ / mm}\qquad h_{\text{4}}\text{ / mm}\]

**Solution**

1. (ii) \[\Delta h \approx\frac{1}{2}\big{(}h_{\text{max}}-h_{\text{min}}\big{)} \big{\langle}h\big{\rangle}\approx\frac{51.1+50.9+50.9+51.2}{4}=51.025 \text{ mm}\] \[=\frac{1}{2}\big{(}51.2-50.9\big{)} \big{\langle}h=51.0\pm 0.2\text{ mm}\] \[=0.15\text{ mm }\big{(}2\text{ s.f.}\big{)}\]

\[x=\left(0.33\pm 0.01\right)\text{ cm}\qquad y=\left(5.4\pm 0.2\right)\text{ cm}\qquad z=\left(10.0\pm 0.7\right)\text{ cm}\]

**(a)**\(Q=xy\)

**(b)**\(T=\frac{\gamma z}{x}\)

**Solution**

\[\begin{array}{ll}\left(\mathbf{a}\right)&Q=xy\\ &=\left(0.33\right)\left(5.4\right)\\ &=1.782\text{ cm}^{2}\end{array}\qquad\begin{array}{ll}\left(\mathbf{b} \right)&T=\frac{\gamma z}{x}\\ &=\frac{\left(5.4\right)\left(10.0\right)}{\left(0.33\right)}\\ &=163.64\text{ cm}\end{array}\]

\[\begin{array}{ll}\frac{\Delta Q}{Q}=\frac{\Delta x}{x}+\frac{\Delta y}{y} \\ \frac{\Delta Q}{1.782}=\left(\frac{0.01}{0.33}+\frac{0.2}{5.4}\right)\\ \Delta Q=0.12\text{ cm}^{2}\end{array}\qquad\begin{array}{ll}\frac{\Delta T }{T}=\frac{\Delta y}{y}+\frac{\Delta z}{z}+\frac{\Delta x}{x}\\ \frac{\Delta T}{163.64}=\left(\frac{0.2}{5.4}+\frac{0.7}{10.0}+\frac{0.01}{0.33 }\right)\\ \Delta T=22\text{ cm}\end{array}\]

**Example 10**

Given \(x\), \(y\) and \(z\), find the quantities with their associated uncertainties

\[x=\left(0.33\pm 0.01\right)\text{ cm}\qquad y=\left(5.4\pm 0.2\right)\text{ cm}\qquad z=\left(10.0\pm 0.7\right)\text{ cm}\]

**(a)**\(Q=x^{2}y\)

**(b)**\(W=\frac{x^{2}}{y^{3}}\)

**Solution**

\[\begin{array}{ll}\left(\mathbf{a}\right)&Q=x^{2}y\\ &=\left(0.33\right)^{2}\left(5.4\right)\\ &=0.588\text{ cm}^{3}\end{array}\qquad\begin{array}{ll}\left(\mathbf{b} \right)&W=\frac{x^{2}}{y^{3}}=\frac{0.33^{2}}{5.4^{3}}\\ &=0.0006916\text{ cm}^{-1}\end{array}\]

\[\begin{array}{ll}\frac{\Delta Q}{Q}=2\left(\frac{\Delta x}{x}\right)+\frac{ \Delta y}{y}\\ \frac{\Delta Q}{0.588}=\left(\frac{\left(2\right)\left(0.01\right)}{0.33}+ \frac{0.2}{5.4}\right)\\ \Delta Q=0.057\text{ cm}^{3}\end{array}\qquad\begin{array}{ll}\frac{\Delta W }{W}=2\left(\frac{\Delta x}{x}\right)+3\left(\frac{\Delta y}{y}\right)\\ \frac{\Delta W}{0.0006916}=\frac{\left(2\right)\left(0.01\right)}{0.33}+ \frac{\left(3\right)\left(0.2\right)}{5.4}\\ \Delta W=0.00012\text{ cm}^{-1}\end{array}\]

\[\begin{array}{ll}\frac{\Delta W}{W}=0.0007\pm 0.0001\text{ cm}^{-1}\\ \text{ or }=\left(7\pm 1\right)\times 10^{-4}\text{ cm}^{-1}\end{array}\]

**Example 11**: Given the following measurements, find the percentage uncertainty of the cylinder's density.

\begin{tabular}{l l} diameter of cylinder & \(D=5.08\pm 0.01\,\text{cm}\) \\ height of cylinder & \(h=20.3\pm 0.1\,\text{cm}\) \\ mass of cylinder & \(m=252.5\pm 0.1\,\text{g}\) \\ \end{tabular}

**Solution**

\[\rho =\frac{\text{mass}}{\text{volume}}\] \[=\frac{m}{\pi r^{2}h}\] \[=\frac{m}{\pi\left(\frac{D}{2}\right)^{2}h}\] \[=\frac{4m}{\pi D^{2}h}\]

\[\frac{\Delta\rho}{\rho}\times 100\%\] \[=\left(\frac{\Delta m}{m}+2\frac{\Delta D}{D}+\frac{\Delta h}{h} \right)\times 100\%\] \[=\left(\frac{0.1}{252.2}+2\frac{0.01}{5.08}+\frac{0.1}{20.3} \right)\times 100\%\] \[=0.93\%\,\left(2\text{ s.f.}\right)\]

**Note**: "4" and "\(\pi\)" are constants with no uncertainty. For terms with "power", multiply the power as a factor. Give standalone fractional/percentage uncertainty to 2 s.f.

### Scalars and Vectors

A **scalar** is a physical quantity

that has magnitude only.

Examples:

* mass
* energy
* pressure
* electric current.

#### 1.4.1 Addition of Vectors

Adding 2 vectors \(A\) and \(B\) that are acting in the same direction results in a vector \(R\)

* with a magnitude that is equal to the sum of the individual magnitudes of the two
* acting in the same direction

If 2 vectors are acting at an angle to each other, we apply trigonometry.

#### 1.4.2 Adding 2 vectors acting at an angle to each other

An example of an application involving the addition of vectors is to determine the resultant force acting on an object when multiple external forces are acting on it.

In general, we "line up" vectors to be summed in a "head-to-tail" order. We then link the starting point to the tail of the last summed vector to obtain (geometrically) the resultant vector.

#### 1.4.2 Subtraction of Vectors

If vector \(B\) is to be subtracted from vector \(A\), this operation is equivalent to adding the negative vector of \(B\) to \(A\). If 2 parallel vectors are acting in opposite directions, adding them will result in a vector

* with a magnitude that is equal to the difference between the individual magnitudes of the two

\[\left|R\right|=\left|A\right|-\left|B\right|\]

* acting in the same direction as the vector with a larger magnitude

because \(\left|A\right|>\left|B\right|\), direction of resultant \(R\) is in the direction of \(A\)

#### 1.4.3 Adding 2 vectors in opposite direction / subtracting colinear vectors

If the vectors are not parallel to each other, we add the negative vector of \(B\) to \(A\) and align them "head to tail" once again:

An example of an application involving the subtraction of vectors is the determination of the change of velocity of a body. Mathematically, the order in which we add vectors does not change the resultant. We say that vector addition is _commutative_.

**Example 13**

Find the resultant force due to the 2 coplanar forces.

**Solution**

by cosine rule :

\(R^{2}=\left(3.0\right)^{2}+\left(5.0\right)^{2}-2(3.0)(5.0)\cos 135^{\circ}\)

\(R=\sqrt{55.213}\)

\(=7.43\) N

by sine rule :

\(\dfrac{5.0}{\sin\theta}=\dfrac{\sqrt{55.213}}{\sin 135^{\circ}}\)

\(\theta=28.4^{\circ}\)

**Example 14**

A ball hits a surface and its velocity changes as shown.

Find the change in velocity.

**Solution**

by Pythagoras Theorem :

\(\left(\Delta\nu\right)^{2}=\left(3.0\right)^{2}+\left(4.0\right)^{2}\)

\(\Delta\nu=5.00\) m s\({}^{-1}\)

\(\tan\theta=\dfrac{3.0}{4.0}\)

\(\theta=36.9^{\circ}\)

**Example 15**

A car (moving north at 15 m s-1) and a bike (moving east at 5.0 m s-1) are equidistant from a crossroads. At this moment, which arrow represents the velocity of the car relative to the bike?

**Solution**

An aircraft flies with an airspeed of 700 km h-1 through a 250 km h-1 jet-stream wind from the west. The pilot wishes to fly directly north from South Sumatra towards Changi airport. Find the **(i)** speed of the aircraft in the direction of north relative to the ground, and **(ii)** the direction that the aircraft is actually pointing at.

**Solution**

\[V_{\text{residual}} =\sqrt{\nu_{\text{aircent}}^{2}-\nu_{\text{jet-stream}}^{2}}\] \[=\sqrt{700^{2}-250^{2}}\] \[=654\text{ km h}^{-1}\]

(ii) Let direction of aircraft be \(\theta\) west of north.

\[\left(\nu_{\text{aircent}}\right)\text{ sin}\theta =\nu_{\text{jet-stream}}\] \[\theta =\text{ sin}^{-1}\Bigg{(}\frac{V_{\text{jet-stream}}}{\nu_{\text{ aircent}}}\Bigg{)}\] \[=\text{ sin}^{-1}\Bigg{(}\frac{250}{700}\Bigg{)}\] \[=20.9^{\circ}\]

**Notes**: Do apply logic to check results. The pilot is "expending" some of the aircraft's capability in generating speed to "balance" out the wind (jet-stream) so the resultant speed should be less than what the aircraft is capable of in still air.

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:19]

**Example 18**

Find the magnitude of the component of the block's weight \(W\) causing it to slide down the slope.

**Solution**

We resolve the weight of the block (keep as hypotenuse of force triangle) into two component vectors; one parallel to the slope surface and another normal to the slope.

**Example 19**

Three coplanar forces act at the point O as shown in the diagram. Find the resultant force.

**Solution**

vector sum of forces along x-direction

\(F_{x}=\left(-5.0\cos 60^{\circ}\right)+4.0\cos 30^{\circ}\)

\(=0.96410\) N

vector sum of forces along y-direction

\(F_{y}=\left(5.0\sin 60^{\circ}\right)+4.0\sin 30^{\circ}+\left(-3.0\right)\)

\(=3.3301\) N

**[magnitude]**

\(\left|F\right|=\sqrt{F_{x}^{2}+F_{y}^{2}}\)

\(=\sqrt{0.96410^{2}+3.3301^{2}}\)

\(=3.4669=3.47\) N

**[direction]**

\(\tan\theta=\dfrac{F_{y}}{F_{x}}=\dfrac{3.3301}{0.96410}\)

\(\theta=73.9^{\circ}\)

### Ending Notes: The Necessity of Measurement in Our Everyday Life

"If someone separated the art of counting and measuring and weighing from all the other arts, what was left of each (of the others) would be, so to speak, insignificant."

- Plato

In a world in which no measurement tools exist, there can be no modern medicine, healthcare, surgery, pharmacology, radiology, dentistry, optometry, or audiology. Therefore, in a measureless world, there can be no Science.

You can use the space below to do up your own mind-map to summarise this topic.
