## 1 Introduction

Halogen derivatives are a homologous series of organic compounds containing **one or more** halogen atoms.

General formula: \(\textbf{C}_{\textbf{n}}\textbf{H}_{2n+1}\textbf{X}\) (where X = F, C/, Br or I).

They are important intermediates in organic synthesis.

## 3 PHYSICAL PROPERTIES OF HALOGENOALKANES AND HALOGENOARENES

### Boiling Point

1. Halogenoalkanes have higher boiling points (lower volatility) than alkanes of the same number of carbon atoms **e.g.** **Compound** CH3CH2CH3 CH3CH2CH2Br** **Boiling point/ K** **231** **344** There is **stronger permanent dipole - permanent dipole attractions** between polar CH3CH2CH2Br molecules. In addition, the greater number of electrons / greater size of the electron cloud results in greater ease of distortion of electron cloud in CH3CH2CH2Br. Hence there is **stronger instantaneous dipole-induced dipole attractions** (id-id) between CH3CH2CH2Br molecules. More energy is required to overcome the stronger intermolecular forces between CH3CH2CH2Br than the **weaker id-id attractions** between CH3CH2CH3.
2. Boiling point of halogenoalkanes in a homologous series **increases** with the length of the carbon chain **e.g.** **Compound** CH3_CI_ **CH3CH2_CI_ **CH3CH2CH2CI_ **Boiling point/ K** **249** **285** **320** As the length of the alkyl chain increases, the **number of electrons / electron cloud size increases**, which results in a **greater ease of distortion of the electron cloud**. More energy is required to overcome the **stronger instantaneous dipole-induced dipole attractions between the molecules**.
3. Boiling point **increases** down the halogen group in halogenoalkanes and halogenoarenes **e.g.** **Compound** CH3CH2\(F\) **CH3CH2_CI_ **CH3CH2Br** CH3CH2I** **Boiling point/ K** **235** **285** **312** **345** e.g.** **Compound** C6_H5F_ **C6_H5_CI_ **C6_H5Br_ **C6_H5I_ **Boiling point/ *C** **85** **132** **156** **189** The number of electrons / electron cloud size increases**, which results in a **greater ease of distortion of the electron cloud**. More energy is required to overcome the stronger instantaneous dipole-induced dipole attractions between the molecules**.

## 4 Preparation of Halogenoalkane

How are halogenalkane synthesised?

Halogenoalkane can be obtained from three main groups of organic compounds, namely, alkanes, alkenes and alcohols.

### Free-radical substitution from alkanes (Refer to Alkane Lecture Notes for more details)

**Type of reaction** Free-radical substitution

**Reagents** Cl\({}_{2}\) (g) or Br\({}_{2}\) (_l_)

**Condition** presence of ultraviolet (uv) light

_Note:_

This is not a good method to prepare halogenalkanes in the laboratory as it gives a mixture of products.

It is difficult to control the extent and position of substitution.

The use of a large excess of the alkane helps to give a better yield of the monosubstituted product.

### Nucleophilic Substitution

* The chemical reactivity of halogenalkanes is due to its polarised C\(-\)X bond: C\({}^{s+}-\)X\({}^{s}\).
* The **electron-deficient** C\({}^{s+}\) atom in R\(-\)X is susceptible to attack by **nucleophiles**.

Nu:- + R-X R-Nu + X-
* Recall: A **nucleophile** is an **electron-rich species** and it forms a **dative bond** by donating an electron pair to an electron-poor site.
* Possible nucleophiles:
* such as OH-, CN-, CH\({}_{3}\)COO-, CH\({}_{3}\)CH\({}_{2}\)O-
* **neutral molecules** with **lone pairs of electrons** such as H\({}_{2}\)O, NH\({}_{3}\)
* Halide ion, X-, is a **good leaving group1** due to its stability as an extremely **weak (Lewis) base2**.

Footnote 1: The **electron-deficient** C\({}^{s+}\) atom in R\(-\)X is susceptible to attack by **nucleophiles**.

* _In chemistry, a **leaving group** is a molecular fragment that departs with a pair of electrons in heterolytic bond cleavage. Leaving groups can be anions or neutral molecules, but in either case it is crucial that the leaving group is able to stabilise the additional electron density that results from bond heterolysis (heterolytic fission)._

### Nucleophilic Substitution Mechanism

How do halogenalkanes react with nucleophiles?

What are the factors that determine the mechanism of nucleophilic substitution?

Nucleophilic substitution reaction can occur via 2 different mechanisms:

\(\bullet\)**S\({}_{\textbf{n}2}\)**: Bimolecular nucleophilic substitution mechanism

\(\bullet\)**S\({}_{\textbf{n}1}\)**: Unimolecular nucleophilic substitution mechanism

#### 5.3.1 Sn2 (Bimolecular nucleophilic substitution mechanism)

A one-step mechanism (without intermediates!)

The following illustrates the mechanism of the nucleophilic substitution reaction (hydrolysis) of a primary alkyl halide, CH\({}_{3}\)CH\({}_{2}\)Br with OH-

\(\bullet\)**Sterochemistry\({}^{\textbf{3}}\) of Sn2 reaction

E.g. When a chiral compound, 2-bromobutane, reacts with aqueous hydroxide ions (OH\({}^{-}\)) via an Sn2 mechanism (when nucleophile _attacks from the back_), the stereochemistry at the \(\delta\)+ carbon is inverted (or inversion of configuration\({}^{\textbf{*}}\)) as C-Nu bond forms fully.

\(\bullet\)**R reactant Product**

\(\bullet\)**_where the product's configuration is opposite that of the reactant_The number of activation energy observed is dependent on the number of steps involved in the reaction. Since a Sn2 reaction involves **a** **mechanism**, there is only one activation energy observed.

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:16]

#### 5.3.2 Sn1 (Unimolecular nucleophilic substitution mechanism)

* A **two-step** mechanism **forming carbocation intermediate**
* The following illustrates the mechanism of the **hydrolysis** of a **tertiary** alkylI halide, C(CH\({}_{3}\))\({}_{3}\)Cl **Step 1: Heterolytic fission** of the C-Cl bond gives a carbocation intermediate and a chloride ion. This is the **rate-determining step**.

**Step 2: The carbocation is very reactive and is readily attacked by the nucleophile, OH-**.**

**Stereochemistry of Sn1 reaction**

**If the halogenoalkane has a chiral carbon, a racemic mixture is formed.**

_Reason:_

**Since the carbocation intermediate has a trigonal planar structure, the nucleophile attacks from either side of the plane with equal probabilities, yielding equal quantities of both enantiomers. Thus, a racemic mixture is formed.**

_(Recall: A racemic mixture is optically inactive, i.e. is unable to rotate plane-polarised light.)_

**Figure 1**: The carbocation is very reactive and is readily attacked by the nucleophile, OH-**.**

What is the mechanism of this reaction?

A electrophilic addition B electrophilic substitution C elimination D nucleophilic substitution D nucleophilic substitution

Hint Identity the reactive carbon.

Is the carbon atom electron-rich or electron deficient?

Answer:

### Reactivity among different alkyl halides in Nucleophilic Substitution Reactions

Nucleophilic substitution of halogenoalkanes involves breaking the C-X bond to form X-.

Hence, the **weaker** the C-X bond and the **greater the stability** of the X-formed, the **more reactive** is the halogenoalkane.

#### 5.4.1 Factors affecting reactivity among halogenoalkanes

(a) **Strength of C-X bond**

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|} \hline Bond & C-F & C-Cl & C-Br & C-I \\ \hline Bond energy/ kJ mol\({}^{-1}\) & 485 & 340 & 280 & 240 \\ \hline \end{tabular}

From the _Data Booklet_, bond energy of C-X bond decreases for F to I.

\(\Rightarrow\) ease of breaking C-X bond increases

\(\Rightarrow\) formation of X- will be faster

**Hence, the order of reactivity:** RI > RBr > RC_l_ > RF

This explains the inertness of fluoro compounds; hence the use of Teflon (polytetrafluoroethylene) in cookwares.

(b) **Stability of the leaving group, X-**

Good leaving groups are weak (Lewis) bases. _(see note 2 on page 10)_

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|} \hline  & H-F & H-Cl & H-Br & H-I \\ \hline p_K\({}_{\text{a}}\)_(HX) & +3 & -7 & -9 & -10 \\ \hline \({}^{*}\)_K\({}_{\text{a}}\)_(HX) & \(10^{-3}\) & \(10^{7}\) & \(10^{9}\) & \(10^{10}\) \\ \hline \({}^{*}\)_K\({}_{\text{b}}\)_(X') & \(10^{-11}\) & \(10^{-21}\) & \(10^{-23}\) & \(10^{-24}\) \\ \hline \end{tabular}

\({}^{*}\)_K\({}_{\text{a}}\)_ (acid dissociation constant) and \({}^{*}\)_K\({}_{\text{b}}\)_ (base dissociation constant) is a measure of the strength of an acid and a base, respectively. [This concept has been covered in greater details in Acid-base Equilibria.]

Weak (Lewis) bases have low _K\({}_{\text{b}}\)_ values. From the table, the I-formed has the lowest _K\({}_{\text{b}}\)_ value, so it is a weakest electron pair donor. Hence, it is most stable and most unreactive, and thus a best leaving group.

Hence, the stability of halide ion (leaving group): \(\Gamma\) > Br\({}^{*}\) > Cl\({}^{*}\) > F- resulting in

**the order of reactivity:** RI > RBr > RC_l_ > RFSummary
* Both the C-X bond energy and \(K_{b}\) value suggest that iodide is the best leaving group, while fluoride is the worst.
* Hence, alkyl iodide is the most reactive towards nucleophilic substitution, while alkyl fluoride is the least.

Checkpoint9

Why does the reaction C\({}_{2}\)H\({}_{5}\)X + OH- C\({}_{2}\)H\({}_{5}\)OH + X- take place more rapidly in aqueous solution when X is I than when X is Br?

A The I- ion is a stronger nucleophilic than the Br- ion.

B The I- ion is less hydrated in solution than the Br- ion.

C The C-Br bond is more polar than the C-I bond.

D The C-Br bond is stronger than the C-I bond.

Answer:

4.2 Can the polarity of C-X bond account for the reactivity of halogenolkanes in nucleophilic substitution reactions?

Polarity of C-X bond

C-X bond is polar: C\({}^{\beta+}-\)X\({}^{\beta}\).

The greater the difference in electronegativity between C and X, the greater the polarity of the C-X bond. This makes the C more electron deficient and hence it is more susceptible to an attack by nucleophiles.

Thus, polarity of the C-X bond alone would predict that fluoro-compounds would be the most reactive.

However, based on the strength of C-X bond alone (see 5.4.1(a)), the iodo-compounds would be the most reactivity.

The two factors are in opposition.

From experimental results, iodo-compounds have the fastest rate of reaction. Hence strength of the C-X bond is a more significant factor that governs the reaction rate as compared to polarity of C-X bond.

## 8 Preparation of Halogenoarene

How are halogenoarenes synthesised?

### Electrophilic substitution from benzene (Refer to Arene Lecture Notes for more details)

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|} \hline
**Type of reaction** & \multicolumn{1}{c|}{Electrophilic substitution} \\ \hline
**Reagent** & \(X_{2}\) (where \(X_{2}=CI_{2}\left(g\right)\) or \(\text{Br}_{2}\left(l\right)\)) \\ \hline
**Condition** & \(Fe(s)\) or \(FeX_{3}(s)\) or \(AIX_{3}(s)\) \\  & Room temperature, anhydrous \\  & _(When Fe catalyst is used, must write equation: 2Fe + 3X\({}_{2}\to 2FeX_{3}\))_ \\ \hline \end{tabular}

## 9 Chemical Reactivity and Reactions of Halogenoarene

### Reactivity towards nucleophilic substitution

Halogenoarenes are very much **less susceptible to nucleophilic substitution** than halogenoalkanes. Nucleophilic substitution is only possible under very vigorous conditions.

**Reasons for non-reactivity towards nucleophilic substitution**

**(i)** & **Delocalisation of lone pair of electrons on halogen** \\ \(\bullet\) & The \(p-\)orbital of the X atom in \(C_{6}H_{5}X\)**overlaps** with the \(\pi\) electron cloud of the benzene ring. \\ \end{tabular}

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|} \hline
**Type of reaction** & \(Fe(s)\) \\ \hline
**Reagent** & \(X_{2}\) (where \(X_{2}=CI_{2}\left(g\right)\) or \(\text{Br}_{2}\left(l\right)\)) \\ \hline
**Condition** & \(Fe(s)\) or \(FeX_{3}(s)\) or \(AIX_{3}(s)\) \\  & Room temperature, anhydrous \\  & _(When Fe catalyst is used, must write equation: 2Fe + 3X\({}_{2}\to 2FeX_{3}\))_ \\ \hline \end{tabular}

**(iii)**: **Hybridisation state of the C**

* The _sp\({}^{2}\)_ hybridised carbon in the C-X bond of halogenoarenes contains more _s_-character than the _sp\({}^{3}\)_ hybridised carbon in the C-X bond of halogenoalkanes.

* the bonding electrons in the C-X bond are held more closely to the nucleus

* the _sp\({}^{2}\)_-C-X bonds in halogenoarenes are stronger and more difficult to cleave.

Hence halogenoarenes undergo nucleophilic substitution reactions only under **very drastic** and **vigorous** conditions such as **high temperature and pressure**.

### Reactivity towards elimination

Halogenoarenes **DO NOT** undergo Elimination reactions as this would **disrupt the stable delocalised \(\pi\) electron system** of the benzene ring, which would require a large amount of energy.

### Electrophilic substitution

* Halogenoarenes undergo **electrophilic substitution** reactions involving benzene ring just like any other arenes.
* However, halogenoarenes are much less susceptible to electrophilic substitution as the **halogen substituent is deactivating**. The halogen substituent is also 2,4-directing.
* The deactivating and directing effects are seen in the nitration of chlorobenzene where a higher temperature is required and two isomers are formed.

## 10 Chemical Test for Halogenoalkanes

### Comparing colour of silver halide (AgX) ppt

* The general method for distinguishing between the type of halogen substituents present in halogenalkanes is to compare the colour of the silver halide precipitates that are formed after the compound undergoes nucleophilic substitution by hydroxide ion. The test involves 3 steps.

* **SGT:** Add **NaOH(aq)** and heat.

* **SGT:** Add **AgNO3(aq)** and observe the **colour** of precipitate formed.

* **SGT:** We can follow up by adding NH3(aq); AgCl dissolves in dilute aqueous NH3 while AgBr does not.

* **Colour of precipitate** white **pale cream** yellow
* **Identity of precipitate** AgCl_I_ AgBr **AgI**
* **Solubility of precipitate in NH3** dissolves in dilute aqueous NH3** dissolves in dilute dissolves in concentrated NH3** concentrated NH3** concentrated NH3**

* **Reaction: AgX(s) + 2NH3** \(\rightarrow\) [Ag(NH3)2]*(aq) + X- (aq) colourless complex ion Refer to Solubility Equilibria lecture notes for the explanation on the solubility off AgX in aqueous ammonia.

### Comparing rate of formation of AgX ppt

* In this method, the rates of the formation of the silver halide precipitates are used to distinguish between the different halogens in the halogenoalkanes.
* Alkyl halides undergo hydrolysis / nucleophilic substitution, releasing X- ion.
* The X- ion released forms a ppt with Ag* from AgNO3(aq): AgNO3 and place the test tube in a hot water bath. (_Nucleophile_: _CH3CH2OH_)

Note: Similar reaction can take place with aqueous AgNO3. The nucleophile involved will be H2O.

Explanation for the difference in the rate of formation of AgX precipitate
* The rate at which the silver halide precipitate is formed is determined by the strength of the C-X bond.
* Since C-X bond energy decreases from C-Cl to C-Br to C-I, the ease at which these bonds break increases in this order and the rate of formation of halide ions increases in this order.
* Hence, AgI precipitate forms most quickly, followed by AgBr, and AgCl is formed the slowest.

A precipitate is not formed when halogenoarenes and fluoroalkanes undergo the described chemical test:

1. RF: Contains a very strong C-F bond which is very difficult to break.
2. Halogenoarenes: p-orbital of the X atom overlaps with the \(\pi\)-electron cloud of the benzene ring. The lone pair of electrons of the X atom can delocalise into the benzene ring creating partial double bond character, resulting in the stronger C-X bond.

Hence nucleophilic substitution cannot take place and no ppt is formed.
