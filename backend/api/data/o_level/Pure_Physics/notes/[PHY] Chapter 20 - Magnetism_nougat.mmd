INDUCED MAGNETISM

When a piece of unmagnetised magnetic material touches or is brought near to the pole of a permanent magnet, it becomes a magnet itself.

This explains why a magnet can attract an unmagnetised magnetic material as the material becomes an induced magnet.

The end nearer the original magnet has an opposite polarity to the magnet and possesses induced magnetism to attract magnetic objects.

The strength of magnetism decreases as distance from the magnet increases.

MAGNETIC FIELD

Magnetic field is a region where a magnet will experience a magnetic force.

**Topics:**

- Magnetic field lines must never intersect or originate from the same point

- Closer magnetic field lines means the region's magnetic field strength is stronger
