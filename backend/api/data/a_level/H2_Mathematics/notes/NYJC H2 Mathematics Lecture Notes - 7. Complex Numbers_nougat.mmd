## Chapter 10 Complex Numbers

The set of real numbers can be extended to complex numbers. This set of numbers arose, historically, from the question of whether a negative number can have a square root.

For example, what are the roots of \(x^{2}+1=0\)?

From this problem, a new number was discovered: the square root of negative one. This number is denoted by i, a symbol assigned by Leonhard Euler (1707-1783, Swiss mathematician).

i.e. i = \(\sqrt{-1}\)

Complex numbers consist of all numbers of the form \(a+b\) i, where \(a\) and \(b\) are real numbers.

Complex numbers have applications in a variety of sciences and related areas such as signal processing, control theory, electromagnetism, quantum mechanics, cartography, and many others.

### 10.1 Introduction

Let us start by solving the equation \(x^{2}-8x+20=0\). Applying the formula, we have

\[x = \frac{8\,\pm\,\sqrt{64-80}}{2}\] \[= 4\,\pm\,2\sqrt{-1}\]

If we let i = \(\sqrt{-1}\), it follows that \(x=4+2\)i or \(x=4-2\)i.

The numbers \(4+2\)i and \(4-2\)i are called complex numbers.

A **complex number**, usually denoted by the letter \(z\), is defined as any number of the form \(z=a+b\)i where i = \(\sqrt{-1}\) and \(a\), \(b\in\mathbb{R}\), and this is known as the **Cartesian form** of complex numbers.

The real number \(a\) is called the **real part of z**, written as \(a=\)**Re(z)**.

The real number \(b\) is called the **imaginary part of z**, written as \(b=\)**Im(z)**.

The set of complex numbers is denoted by \(\mathbb{C}\).

**Chapter 10: Complex Numbers**

**Self-Review 2 (b):** If \(z=4-3\)i, express \(z-\dfrac{1}{z}\) in Cartesian form. Hence, find a complex number \(w\) in Cartesian form such that \(w+\dfrac{1}{w}=\dfrac{78}{25}+\dfrac{96}{25}\)i. \([w=3+4\mathrm{i}\;\;\mathrm{or}\;\dfrac{1}{25}(3-4\mathrm{i})\;]\)

**Solution:**

Using GC, \(z-\dfrac{1}{z}=\dfrac{96}{25}\dfrac{78}{25}\)

\(w+\dfrac{1}{w}=\dfrac{78}{25}+\dfrac{96}{25}=\mathrm{i}\left(\dfrac{96}{25}- \dfrac{78}{25}\mathrm{i}\right)=\mathrm{i}\left(z-\dfrac{1}{z}\right)=\mathrm{ i}\,z-\dfrac{\mathrm{i}}{z}=\mathrm{i}\,z+\dfrac{1}{\mathrm{i}\,z}\)

By comparison, \(w=\mathrm{i}\,z\;\;\mathrm{or}\;\;\;\dfrac{1}{\mathrm{i}\,z}\).

Thus, \(w=\mathrm{i}(4-3\mathrm{i})=3+4\mathrm{i}\;\;\;\mathrm{or}\;\;\;\;\;w=\dfrac{1 }{\mathrm{i}\,z}=\dfrac{1}{3+4\mathrm{i}}=\dfrac{1}{25}(3-4\mathrm{i})\).

### Solving equations involving Complex numbers

**Example 6:**

Find the two roots of the equation \(ww^{*}=4+2\mathrm{i}+2\mathrm{i}\,w^{*}\), giving your answers in the form \(a+\mathrm{i}b\), where \(a,\;b\in\mathbb{R}\).

**Solution:**

Let \(w=a+b\mathrm{i}\), where \(a,b\in\mathbb{R}\)

Note the complexity when we substitute \(w=a+\mathrm{i}b\) into the equation.

\(w^{*}=4+2\mathrm{i}+2\mathrm{i}\,w^{*}\)

\(w=a+b\mathrm{i}\left(a-b\mathrm{i}\right)=4+2\mathrm{i}+2\mathrm{i}\left(a-b \mathrm{i}\right)\)

\(w=a^{2}+b^{2}=4+2\mathrm{i}+2a\mathrm{i}+2b\)

The problem develops into a system of 2 unknowns and subsequently 2 equations.

Consequently, 2 equations.

If there are 2 or more unknown complex numbers involved, this method would be too tedious as an approach and inadvisable in general.

Hence the two roots are \(-1-\mathrm{i}\) and \(-1+3\mathrm{i}\).

**Chapter 10: Complex Numbers**

**Self-Review 3:** Solve the simultaneous equations \(\mathrm{i}z+2w=2\), \(z-\left(1+\mathrm{i}\right)w=4\), giving your answers in the form \(x+\mathrm{i}y\), where \(x\), \(y\in\mathbb{R}\). \([z=6-4\mathrm{i},w=-1-3\mathrm{i}]\)

\begin{tabular}{|l l|} \hline Given: & \(\mathrm{i}z+2w=2\) & \(\ldots\) (1) \\  & \(z-\left(1+\mathrm{i}\right)w=4\) & \(\ldots\) (2) \\ (1) - \(\mathrm{i}\times(2)\); & \(2w+\mathrm{i}(1+\mathrm{i})w=2-4\mathrm{i}\) \\ Thus & \(\left[2+\mathrm{i}(1+\mathrm{i})\right]w=2-4\mathrm{i}\) \\  & \(\Rightarrow w=\dfrac{2-4\mathrm{i}}{2+\mathrm{i}+\mathrm{i}^{2}}=\dfrac{2-4 \mathrm{i}}{1+\mathrm{i}}=-1-3\mathrm{i}\) \\ Hence, & \(z=4+(1+\mathrm{i})w=4+(1+\mathrm{i})(-1-3\mathrm{i})=6-4\mathrm{i}\). \\ \hline \end{tabular}

**Conjugate Root Theorem**

Let \(\mathfrak{f}(z)\) be a polynomial in \(z\) with **real coefficients**. If \(\alpha\) is a complex root of \(\mathfrak{f}(z)=0\), then \(\alpha^{*}\) is also a root.

E.g. Suppose the equation \(az^{4}+bz^{3}+cz^{2}+dz+e=0\), where \(a\), \(b\), \(c\), \(d\) and \(e\) are real numbers, has a complex root \(\alpha\). Then \(\mathrm{a}^{*}+\mathrm{b}\alpha^{3}+\mathrm{c}\alpha^{2}+\mathrm{d}\alpha+ \mathrm{e}=0\) \(\Rightarrow(\mathrm{a}\alpha^{4}+\mathrm{b}\alpha^{3}+\mathrm{c}\alpha^{2}+ \mathrm{d}\alpha+\mathrm{e})^{*}=0^{*}=0\) \(\Rightarrow(\mathrm{a}\alpha^{4})^{*}+(\mathrm{b}\alpha^{3})^{*}+(\mathrm{c} \alpha^{2})^{*}+(\mathrm{d}\alpha)^{*}+\mathrm{e}^{*}=0\) \(\Rightarrow\) \(\mathrm{a}^{*}(\alpha^{4})^{*}+\mathrm{b}^{*}(\alpha^{3})^{*}+\mathrm{c}^{*}( \alpha^{2})^{*}+\mathrm{d}^{*}(\alpha^{2})^{*}+\mathrm{e}=0\) \(\Rightarrow\) \(\mathrm{a}(\alpha^{*})^{4}+\mathrm{b}(\alpha^{*})^{*}+\mathrm{c}(\alpha^{2})^{ *}+\mathrm{d}(\alpha^{*})+\mathrm{e}=0\) \(\Rightarrow\) \(\mathrm{a}^{*}(\alpha^{*})^{4}+\mathrm{b}(\alpha^{*})^{*}+\mathrm{c}(\alpha^{ 2})^{*}+\mathrm{d}(\alpha^{*})^{*}+\mathrm{e}=0\) \(\Rightarrow\) \(\mathrm{a}^{*}(\alpha^{*})^{4}+\mathrm{b}(\alpha^{*})^{*}+\mathrm{c}(\alpha^{ 2})^{*}+\mathrm{d}(\alpha^{*})^{*}+\mathrm{e}=0\) Then \(\alpha^{*}\) is also a root.

In general, whenever a polynomial equation with **real coefficients** has complex roots, by Conjugate Root Theorem, the complex roots will occur in conjugate pairs.

**Example 9:**

Without the use of GC, solve the equation \(z^{4}+z^{3}-8z^{2}+14z-8=0\) given that \(1+\mathrm{i}\) is one of the roots.

**Solution:**

Since \(z^{4}+z^{3}-8z^{2}+14z-8=0\) has **real coefficients**, by Conjugate Root Theorem, \(1-\mathrm{i}\) is another root.

Then \([z-(1+\mathrm{i})]\) and \([z-(1-\mathrm{i})]\) are factors of the expression on the RHS of the given equation.

Hence, \([z-(1+\mathrm{i})][z-(1-\mathrm{i})]\) is also a factor of it.

That is,

\(x^{2}-(\mathrm{sum}\) of roots)\(x+(\mathrm{product}\) of roots) = 0

\(z^{2}-2\pm\pm 2\)

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:11]

**Chapter 10: Complex Numbers**

Given that \(z=-2+3i\) is a root of the equation \(2z^{2}+(-1+4i)z+c=0\), find the complex number \(c\) and the other root.

**Solution:**

Let \(\alpha=-2+3i\) and the other root be \(\beta\)

\(\alpha+\beta=-1+Mi\)

\(\beta=\frac{c}{2}-2i-(-2+3i)=\frac{5}{2}-5i\)

\(\alpha+\beta=-\frac{b}{a}\), \(\alpha\beta=\frac{c}{a}\)

\(\beta=\frac{c}{a}\)

\(\beta=\frac{c}{2}-2+3i)(\frac{f}{2}-5i)>20\nu 5i\)

Why can't we use Conjugate Root Theorem?

**Self-Review 4:** (NJC Prelim 2007/I/1) Without the use of GC, verify that \(-2+3i\) is a root of the equation \(z^{3}+5z^{2}+17z+13=0\) and hence determine the other roots of the equation.

\([-2-3i,-1]\)

**Solution:**

\(\left(-2+3i\right)^{2}=(-2)^{2}+2(-2)(3i)+(3i)^{2}=4-12i+9i^{2}=-5-12i\)

\(\left(-2+3i\right)^{3}=\left(-2+3i\right)^{2}\left(-2+3i\right)=\left(-5-12i \right)\left(-2+3i\right)=10-15i+24i+36=46+9i\)

Substitute \(z=-2+3i\) into the equation \(z^{3}+5z^{2}+17z+13=0\),

\(\left(-2+3i\right)^{2}+5\left(-2+3i\right)^{2}+17\left(-2+3i\right)+13=46+9i+ 5\left(-5-12i\right)-21+51i=0\)

Hence \(-2+3i\) is a root of the equation.

By conjugate root theorem, since the coefficients are real numbers, the conjugate is also a root. Thus \(\big{(}z-(-2+3i)\big{)}\big{(}z-(-2-3i)\big{)}\) is a factor, i.e., \(z^{2}+4z+13\) is a factor.

Since \(z^{3}+5z^{2}+17z+13=\big{(}z^{2}+4z+13\big{)}(z+1)\). Thus the roots are \(z=-2\pm 3i,-1\)

### The Argand Diagram

The \(x\)-axis of the Cartesian plane represents the real part of a complex number, while the \(y\)-axis represents the imaginary part. Hence, the \(x\)-axis is called real axis while the \(y\)-axis is the imaginary axis.

We use the point \(P\) with coordinates \((a,\,b)\) to represent the complex number \(z=a+b\)i.

\(b\)\(P=z\)

\(O\)\(a\)

A diagram in which complex numbers are represented this way is called an **Argand Diagram**. (This idea was introduced by the French Mathematician Argand, hence this diagram is known as

**Chapter 10: Complex Numbers**

the **Argand diagram.**) We say that the complex number \(z\) is represented by the point \(P\). Sometimes this is written as \(P\equiv z\).

**Example 12:**

Show on the Cartesian plane the following complex numbers \(3+2\mathrm{i}_{1}-4+\mathrm{i}_{1}-3-5\mathrm{i}_{1}\)\(3-2\mathrm{i}\).

**Solution:**

ThinkZone:

It is always good to draw to scale for all Argand diagram.

A distorted diagram will distort your view.

Notice, \(3+2\mathrm{i}\) and \(3-2\mathrm{i}\) are reflections of each other in the real axis.

**Conjugation**

Again for simplicity, let \(z=a+b\mathrm{i}\) where \(a\!>\!0\) and \(b\!>\!0\).

The conjugate of \(z\), \(z^{\star}=a\!-b\mathrm{i}\). Let \(P\equiv z\) and \(Q\equiv z^{\star}\).

**Note:**

(a) \(z^{\star}\) will be represented by \(Q\) is the reflection of \(P\) (\(a\), \(b\)) in the Real axis, i.e. \(Q\) (\(a\), \(-b\)).

(b) \(-z\) will be represented by \(P^{\prime}\) (\(-a\), \(-b\)). It is the reflection in the origin of the point \(P\) (\(a\), \(b\)) representing \(z\).

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:14]

**Chapter 10: Complex Numbers**

**Vector Representation**

In vector form, the complex number \(a+bi\) may be alternatively represented in the Argand diagram by the position vector \(\overrightarrow{OP}\) where \(P\) is \((a\,\ b)\).

Note: Do **not** write \(\overrightarrow{OP}=z\) (A vector **cannot** be equal to a complex number). Instead, we will write \(P\equiv z\)

**Addition of Two Complex Numbers in an Argand Diagram**

Geometrically, if \(P_{1}\), \(P_{2}\) represent the complex numbers \(z_{i}\), \(z_{2}\), then \(P\equiv z_{1}+z_{2}\) where \(P\) is the 4th vertex of the parallelogram determined by the points, \(O\), \(P_{1}\), \(P_{2}\).

**Subtraction of Two Complex Numbers in an Argand Diagram**

Writing \(z_{1}-z_{2}\) as \(z_{1}+(-z_{2})\), the point \(P\), the 4th vertex of the parallelogram determined by the points \(O\), \(P_{1}\), \(P_{2}\)' represents \(z_{1}-z_{2}\).

**Note: Addition and subtraction of two complex numbers are 'the same' as vector addition and subtraction.**

**Multiplication of a complex number by i**

For the sake of simplicity, let \(z=a+b\)i where \(a,b\in\mathbb{R}\) and \(a>0\), \(b>0\).

i\(z=\) i\((a+b\ )=a\ \mathrm{i}+b\ \mathrm{i}^{2}\ =-b+a\)i.

### Trigonometric form (or Polar form) of a Complex Number

#### 10.5.1 Modulus and argument:

Let point \(P\) represents the complex number \(z=x+\mathrm{i}y\).

Let the length of the line segment \(OP\) be \(r\) and the angle subtended by \(OP\) and the real axis be \(\theta\).

Then \(x=r\cos\theta,y=r\sin\theta\) and \(r=\sqrt{x^{2}+y^{2}}\).

\(r\) is called the **modulus of \(z\)** and is denoted by \(|z|\), i.e. \(r=|z|=\left|x+iy\right|=\sqrt{x^{2}+y^{2}}\).

\(\theta\) is called the **argument of \(z\)** and is denoted by \(\arg z\), i.e. \(\theta=\arg z=\arg(x+\mathrm{i}y)\).

**Chapter 10: Complex Numbers**

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|} \hline
**Note:** & \\ \hline If \(P\) is **above** the real axis, \(\theta\) is measured **anti-clockwise sense** and \(\theta\) is **positive**. & If \(P\) is **below** the real axis, \(\theta\) is measured **clockwise sense** and \(\theta\) is **negative**. \\ \hline \end{tabular}

Conventionally, we restrict \(\theta\) to the range \(-\pi<\theta\leq\pi\), called the **principal range**. The **unique** value of \(\theta\) lying in the principal range is called the **principal argument**. From now onwards, the argument of a complex number is taken to be the principal argument unless otherwise stated. Follow the **ABS** approach to get the principal argument correctly.

**Step 1.**: Argand diagram: To find the argument of a complex number, always **draw an Argand diagram** and indicate on the diagram which quadrant the complex number lies in.
**Step 2.**: Basic angle: Find basic angle\(=\alpha=\tan^{-1}\left(\left|\frac{y}{x}\right|\right)\)
**Step 3.**: Sign: Find the sign and magnitude of the argument of a complex number. This depends on which quadrant the complex number is in.

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|} \hline
**2\({}^{\text{nd}}\) Quadrant:** & \(\text{Im}(z)\) & \(\text{Im}(z)\) \\ \hline \(\text{arg}(z)=\pi-\alpha\) & \(\text{arg}(z)=\alpha\) & \(\text{Re}(z)\) \\ Argument is positive and obtuse. & Argument is positive and acute. \\ \hline \end{tabular}

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|} \hline
**3\({}^{\text{rd}}\) Quadrant** & \(\text{Im}(z)\) & \(\text{4}^{\text{th}}\) Quadrant & \(\text{Im}(z)\) \\ \hline \(\text{arg}(z)=-(\pi-\alpha)\) & \(\text{arg}(z)=-\alpha\) & Argument is negative and obtuse. \\ Argument is negative and obtuse. & Argument is negative and acute. \\ \hline \end{tabular}

**Chapter 10: Complex Numbers**

**10.5.2 Complex Number in Trigonometric form (or Polar form)**

Consider the complex number \(z=x+\mathrm{i}y\) in the Argand diagram shown below:

If the _principal argument_ of \(z=x+\mathrm{i}y\) is defined to be \(\theta\), where \(-\pi<\theta\leq\pi\),

\(z=x+\mathrm{y}\mathrm{i}\)

\(=r\cos\theta+r\sin\theta\,\mathrm{i}\)

\(=r(\cos\theta+\mathrm{i}\sin\theta)\)

\(=r\,\mathrm{e}^{\mathrm{i}\theta}\)

\(z=r\,\mathrm{(cos\ \theta+\mathrm{i}\ \sin\ \theta)}\) where \(-\pi<\theta\leq\pi\) is called the **trigonometric form, modulus argument form or polar form** of the complex number.

**Note:**

(i) If \(z=r(\cos\theta+\mathrm{i}\sin\theta)\), then

\(z^{\ast}=r(\cos\theta-\mathrm{i}\ \sin\ \theta\ )\)

\(=r[\cos(-\theta)+\mathrm{i}\sin\ (-\theta)]\)

Both \(z\) and \(z^{\ast}\) are represented on

an Argand diagram as shown.

It is easy to notice that : \(\left|z\right|=\left|z^{\ast}\right|=r\), \(\arg z^{\ast}=-\arg z=-\theta\) (\(-\pi<\theta\leq\pi\))

(ii) \(z\) is purely real \(\Leftrightarrow\) principal argument of \(z\) is 0 or \(\pi\).

(iii) \(z\) is purely imaginary \(\Leftrightarrow\) principal argument of \(z\) is \(\frac{\pi}{2}\) or \(-\frac{\pi}{2}\).

**Remark:**

It is important to remember the trigonometric ratios of special angles: i.e. \(0\), \(\frac{\pi}{6}\), \(\frac{\pi}{4}\), \(\frac{\pi}{3}\), \(\frac{\pi}{2}\). The following examples will illustrate the relationship between "special" complex numbers with these \(\varepsilon_{\nu}\)-cial angles.

**Chapter 10: Complex Numbers**

**GC basics to calculate \(|\,z\,|\) and \(\,\arg(z)\) :**

You may use the GC to calculate the modulus and the argument of a complex number.

Take for e.g. in Example 16(c), \(\,z=-\sqrt{3}+\mathrm{i}\,\).

To find the modulus, we can key to access the modulus function, and type in our complex number accordingly.

(note: if it is a irrational number, you can square the number, then square root it back to get the nice surd form)

To find the angle, we can key to get the argument of the complex number

(note: the number given is usually irrational, we can divide our answer by \(\,\pi\,\) to see if \(\arg(z)\) is a nice number in terms of \(\,\pi\,\).

#### Multiplication in Trigonometric Form

\[\,z_{1}z_{2} =r_{1}r_{2}\big{(}\cos\theta_{1}+\mathrm{i}\sin\theta_{1}\big{)} \big{(}\cos\theta_{2}+\mathrm{i}\sin\theta_{2}\big{)}\] \[=r_{1}r_{2}\big{[}\big{(}\cos\theta_{1}\cos\theta_{2}-\sin\theta_ {1}\sin\theta_{2}\big{)}+\mathrm{i}\big{(}\sin\theta_{1}\cos\theta_{2}+\cos \theta_{1}\sin\theta_{2}\big{)}\big{]}\] \[=r_{1}r_{2}\big{[}\cos\big{(}\theta_{1}+\theta_{2}\big{)}+\mathrm{ i}\sin\big{(}\theta_{1}+\theta_{2}\big{)}\big{]}\]

In general,

\[\,z_{1}z_{2}....z_{n}=r_{1}r_{2}^{\prime}....r_{n}\Big{[}\cos\big{(}\theta_{1} +\theta_{2}+.....+\theta_{n}\big{)}+\mathrm{i}\sin\big{(}\theta_{1}+\theta_{2} +.....+\theta_{n}\big{)}\Big{]}\]
