Introduction

The definition of equilibrium in the dictionary is 'balance or harmony of opposing forces'. The concept of chemical equilibrium is also about balance - between the forward and backward directions of reversible reactions.

### Irreversible vs Reversible Reactions

\begin{tabular}{p{142.3pt} p{142.3pt}}  & **Irreversible Reaction** \\ \hline Chemical reactions that take place in one direction (forward), indicated by the single arrow line ( ). & Chemical reactions that take place in both directions (forward and backward), indicated by the double arrow line ( ). \\ \end{tabular}

\begin{tabular}{p{142.3pt} p{142.

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:4]

Characteristics of Dynamic Equilibrium
* Although the rate of forward reaction is equal to the rate of reverse reaction, the [reactants] and [products] are not equal to each other most of the time.
* [reactants] and [products] are constant (remain unchanged). However, the equilibrium mixture is still reacting (both forward and reverse reactions are ongoing).
* The same equilibrium position is reached regardless of whether the reversible reaction was started by mixing chemicals on the left or right side of the equation.
* Equilibrium can only be achieved in a closed system in which there is no loss or gain of matter to and from surroundings. An open system may allow matter to escape or enter. Thus equilibrium cannot be reached.

### Closed and Open Systems

Consider the following example: \(\mathbf{H_{2}O(g)}\) + \(\mathbf{C(s)}\)\(\implies\) CO(g) + \(\mathbf{H_{2}(g)}\)

* In an **open system**,
* The black carbon is placed in an open jar and heated with steam.
* The black carbon will gradually disappear after some time as all of it reacted to form gaseous products which escape from the system.
* In a **closed system**,
* The black carbon is placed in a jar with lid and heated with steam.
* Some black carbon will remain after some time.
* Without any disturbance such as temperature or pressure, the system will remain like this indefinitely as reverse reaction is taking place too.
* A **state of dynamic equilibrium** will be achieved.

Exercise 1:Substance **A** decomposes into substances **B** and **C**, according to the following equation:

\(2\mathbf{A(g)}\) = \(2\mathbf{B(g)}\) + **C(g)**

In an experiment, a known quantity of **A** was allowed to decompose. The results of the experiment are shown in the _concentration_-_time_ graph below:

\(\mathbf{(a)}\)How long did the reaction take to reach equilibrium? Give a reason for your answer.

What was the _initial_ concentration of substance **A**?

At _equilibrium_, what were the concentrations of (i) **A** (ii) **B** (iii) **C**.

### Equilibrium constant (\(K_{c}\)) in Heterogeneous Systems

Heterogeneous equilibria describes a reversible reaction in which the substances involved are present in **more than one phase**.

Examples: (a) \(\text{H}_{2}\text{O}(\textbf{g})+\text{C}(\textbf{s})\)\(\implies\)H\({}_{2}\textbf{g}\) + CO(g) (b) \(\text{CaCO}_{3}(\textbf{s})\)\(\implies\)CaO(s) + CO2(g) (c) [Al(H\({}_{2}\)O)\({}_{4}\)(OH)\({}_{2}\)]\({}^{*}\) (aq) + OH(aq) \(\implies\)[Al(H\({}_{2}\)O)\({}_{3}\)(OH)\({}_{3}\)] (s) + H\({}_{2}\)O(l) To write the equilibrium constants (\(K_{c}\) or \(K_{p}\)) for _heterogeneous_ systems, the following terms which are **CONSTANT** are **EXCLUDED** in the K expressions:

**Reasons:**

* Concentrations of pure solids and liquids are equivalent to their densities which are constants.
* Vapour pressures of solids and pure liquids are small and are constants.
* Solvents (usually water) are present in large amount such that their concentrations will not vary much and remains relatively constant throughout the reaction.

Consider the _heterogeneous_ equilibrium:

\(\text{CaCO}_{3}(\textbf{s})\)\(\implies\)CaO(s) + CO2(g)

\(\text{K}=\frac{[\text{CaO}(\textbf{s})][\text{CO}_{2}(\textbf{g})]}{[\text{ CaCO}_{3}(\textbf{s})]}\)

Hence, since CaCO\({}_{3}\) and CaO are solids, equilibrium expression can be rewritten as:

**Exercise 3**: Write the expression for \(K_{c}\) and/or \(K_{p}\) for the following reactions.

1. Ni(s) + 4CO(g) \(\implies\)Ni(CO)\({}_{4}\)(g) \(\text{K}_{c}=\frac{[Ni(CO)_{4}]}{[CO]^{4}}\) and \(K_{p}=\frac{P_{Ni(CO)_{4}}}{\rho_{CO}}\)
2. BaCO\({}_{3}\) (s) \(\implies\)Ba\({}^{2+}\)(aq) + CO\({}_{3}\)\({}^{2-}\)(aq)
3. HF(aq) + H\({}_{2}\)O(l) \(\implies\)H\({}_{3}\)O\({}^{*}\)(aq) + F\({}^{-}\)(aq)

## 3 Calculations Involving \(K\)

Equilibrium constants enable us to calculate the composition of a reaction mixture that has reached equilibrium, and is therefore useful if we are preparing a 'target compound' via a reversible reaction.

**Procedure for solving equilibrium problems**

**Step 1:**: Identify the **balanced** chemical equation for the reaction which is given.
**Step 2:**: Construct the '**ICE'** table. (Only when equilibrium information is not sufficient)

**Initial amount/concentration/partial pressure
**Change** in amount/concentration/partial pressure
**Equilibrium** amount/concentration/partial pressure

(If equilibrium amount is calculated in moles, always remember to convert to **concentration** in mol dm\({}^{-3}\) or partial pressures.)
**Step 3:**: Check if the reaction is in **homogeneous or heterogeneous** equilibrium. Write down the **equilibrium constant (_K_) expression**.
**Step 4:**: Substitute the calculated **EQUILIBRIUM** concentrations/partial pressures into the equilibrium constant expression and solve.

There are 2 scenarios:

Given composition of substances at equilibrium, solve \(K\).

Given \(K\) value, solve equilibrium composition of substances

**Calculations involving _K_c

### Calculating _K_c Given Equilibrium Composition

**Exercise 4:**

A sealed flask contained 4 mol of hydrogen, 2 mol of iodine and 19 mol of hydrogen iodide gas at equilibrium. Calculate the equilibrium constant, _K_c for the reaction stating it units.

_HINT: Let volume of flask be V dm\({}^{3}\)._

**Eqm. moles / mol 4**: 2**: 19

**Eqm. conc./ mol dm\({}^{-3}\)**

**NOTE:**: _K_c has no units and although the volume, \(V\), cancels out, working still has to be shown that **concentration** (and NOT no. of moles) is used for calculation of _K_c.

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:11]

## 4 Calculations Involving \(K_{\text{p}}\)

### Calculating \(K_{\text{p}}\) given Initial Partial Pressures

For _gaseous equilibria_, the concentrations of the reactants and products are usually more convenient when expressed in terms of their _partial pressures_. In order to use pressures rather than concentrations, the effect of pressure of each gas must be considered separately.

In these cases, the _initial partial pressures of the reactants or products and the total pressure at equilibrium_ are usually given, and the \(K_{\text{p}}\) is required to be calculated.

**Exercise 8**:

SO\({}_{2}\)(g) and O\({}_{2}\)(g), at partial pressures of 1.00 atm and 0.50 atm respectively, are allowed to reach equilibrium at 675 K. When equilibrium is established, the total pressure in the container is found to be 1.01 atm. Calculate the \(K_{\text{p}}\) for the reaction at 675 K.

\(2\text{SO}_{2}\)(g) + O\({}_{2}\)(g) \(\qquad\qquad 2\text{SO}_{3}\)(g)

**Note:**

At _constant temperature_, the partial pressure of a gas is dependent on _moles_ and the _volume_ of the reaction vessel.

#### 4.1.1 Recall: pV = nRT

In this context, since there is a change in the total pressure (from 1.50 to 1.01 atm) when there is a change in number of moles of gas from reactants to products (from 3 moles to 2 moles), we assume that moles \(\propto\) partial pressure at _constant volume (container of known volume)_ and we can use partial pressures in the 'ICE' table.

_Let x be the partial pressure of O\({}_{2}\) reacted._

\(2\text{SO}_{2}\)(g) + O\({}_{2}\)(g) \(\qquad\qquad 2\text{SO}_{3}\)(g)

REVIEW Characteristics of \(K_{\rm c}\) and \(K_{\rm p}\)

* For a general reversible reaction, aA (g) + bB (g) <= cC (g) + dD (g) The expression of \(K_{\rm c}\) is The expression of \(K_{\rm p}\) is \(K_{\rm c}=\frac{[\rm C]^{\rm c}[\rm D]^{\rm d}}{[\rm A]^{\rm a}[\rm B]^{\rm b}}\)
* Units of \(K_{\rm c}=(\rm mol\ dm^{-3})^{\rm c+d-a-b}\)
* For heterogeneous systems, concentrations that are constant are not included in the expression. \(K_{\rm c}\) and \(K_{\rm p}\) have no fixed units (units dependent on the reaction equation).
* Factors affecting values of \(K_{\rm c}\) and \(K_{\rm p}\)
* \(K_{\rm c}\) and \(K_{\rm p}\) are constants at constant temperature. \(K_{\rm c}\) and \(K_{\rm p}\) are only affected by temperature and are **not*
* affected by
* changes in concentration
* changes in pressure
* presence of catalyst
* Values of \(K_{\rm c}\) and \(K_{\rm p}\) are determined experimentally. \(K_{\rm c}\) and \(K_{\rm p}\)**do not*
* give any information on the
* numerical values of rates of forward and reverse reactions (we only know that both rates of forward and reverse reactions are the same).
* time required for the equilibrium to be established.
* The magnitude of \(K_{\rm c}\) and \(K_{\rm p}\) is an indication of how far the reaction has gone to completion and the position of the equilibrium.

## 5 Position of Equilibrium

The _proportion of products to the reactants_ in the equilibrium mixture is described as the position of the equilibrium.

\begin{tabular}{|p{142.3pt}|p{142.3pt}|} \hline aA + bB = cc + dD & aA + bB = cc + dD \\ \hline If the conversion of reactants (**A** and **B**) into products (**C** and **D**) is very small, there is greater proportion of reactants compared to the products. & If the equilibrium mixture is composed largely of the products (**C** and **D**), \(\Rightarrow\) equilibrium position _lies to the right_. \\ \(\Rightarrow\) & \(K_{\text{c}}\) \(<<\) 1 (i.e. very small) \\ \hline \end{tabular}

## 6 Factors Affecting the Position of Equilibrium

Once an equilibrium is established, the _position of equilibrium (or composition of the equilibrium mixture) can be changed_ by varying the following conditions:

**(a)**: Concentrations of species involved **(b)**: Pressure (for reactions involving gases) **(c)**: Temperature

**Le Chatelier's Principle**

Le Chatelier's Principle summarises the effect on the position of equilibrium (or composition of an equilibrium mixture) when the conditions **(a)** to **(c)** stated above are changed.

Le Chatelier's Principle states that if a chance occurs in one of the conditions (concentration, temperature, or pressure) under which a reversible reaction is in dynamic equilibrium, the _position of equilibrium shifts_ so as to minimise that change (and to re-establish equilibrium).

### Changing the Concentration

Consider the following system in equilibrium at **constant temperature**:

\begin{tabular}{|p{142.3pt}|p{142.3pt}|p{142.3pt}|} \hline A + B = C + D & System in equilibrium \\ \hline A + B = C + D & Increase in **[A]** (by adding A) \\ \hline (reactant) [B] decreases (products) [C] and [D] increase as compared to the original equilibrium. & Equilibrium position has SHIFTED to the RIGHT. \\ \hline \end{tabular}

A concentration-time graph illustrating the effect of increasing the concentration of reactant **A** in the equilibrium:

**NOTE**

* The system cannot completely cancel the change in the external factor but it shifts in the direction that will minimise the change.
* At constant temperature, \(K\), remains UNCHANGED but the COMPOSITION of the reactants and products CHANGES when additional **A** is added to the equilibrium mixture.

Exercise 12: Application of Le Chatelier's Principle

Use Le Chatelier's Principle to predict and explain the effect of:

(i) increasing [C/(aq)];

- The equilibrium position shifts to the to remove some of the C/(aq) added.

- Thus the [Co(H\({}_{2}\)O)e\({}^{2+}\)(aq)] and the [CoCl\({}^{2-}\)(aq), resulting in solution formed. (ii) decreasing [Co(H\({}_{2}\)O)e\({}^{2+}\)(aq)];

- The equilibrium position shifts to the left to increase [Co(H\({}_{2}\)O)e\({}^{2+}\)(aq)].

- Thus the [CoCl\({}^{2-}\)(aq)] decreases, resulting in a pink solution formed.

Effect of Adding Water into Aqueous Equilibrium Systems

(iii) adding water into the aqueous solution (Refer to 'Hint')

- Adding water

- The equilibrium position shifts to the left to produce more ions since the left side produces more aqueous ions compared to the right (5 moles of aa ions versus 1 mole of aa ions).

- Thus the concentration of [CoCl\({}_{4}\)]\({}^{2-}\)(aq) decreases, resulting in a pink solution formed.

HINT: To study the effect of adding water into aqueous equilibrium systems, we can consider these questions:

How will the concentration of Co(H\({}_{2}\)O)\({}_{6}\)\({}^{2+}\), C/- CoCl\({}^{2-}\) and water change respectively? Concentrations of Co(H\({}_{2}\)O)\({}_{6}\)\({}^{2+}\), C/- and CoCl\({}^{2-}\) decrease and concentration of water remains unchanged.

What is the specific change after adding water that causes shift in the position of equilibrium?

Adding water results in a decrease in the concentrations of all aqueous ions.

This leads to a shift in position of equilibrium to the left to produce more aqueous ions as there are more aqueous reactants than aqueous products in the reaction equation.

Or Concentrations of reactants decreases more than products as there are more aqueous species on the left side of the equation. Position of equilibrium will shift left to increase the concentration of aqueous reactants in the system.

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:19]

**Exercise 14:**

Consider the dimerisation of NO\({}_{2}\) at equilibrium:

Use Le Chatelier's Principle to predict and explain the following effects. State the observations.

**(i) increasing pressure;**

Equilibrium position will **shift to the**

to

pressure by producing (2 gaseous NO\({}_{2}\) on the left while one gaseous N\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{4}\) on the right.). The colour of the gas turned from brown

**(ii) decreasing pressure;**

Equilibrium position will **shift to the left** to **increase** pressure by producing **more gaseous molecules**. The brown colour of the gas turned **darker**.

### Effect of adding Inert Gas on Gaseous Equilibrium Systems

**(iii) Adding neon (inert gas) at constant volume (Refer to Hint (1))**

An addition of Ne at constant volume

the partial pressures of NO\({}_{2}\) and N\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{4}\).

Hence, there will be

on the position of the equilibrium.

**Hint (1):**

Study the below diagrams, predict how these pressures changes after adding inert gas at constant volume.

Total pressure of the system, P\({}_{\text{T}}\) :

partial pressure of N\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{4}\), P\({}_{\text{N}_{2}\text{O}_{4}}\) :

### Changing the Temperature

When applying Le Chatelier's Principle to predict the effect of a temperature change on the equilibrium position, the factor to consider here is whether the forward reaction is exothermic (\(\Delta H<0\)) or endothermic (\(\Delta H>0\)).

Consider the following reversible reaction:

\(\textbf{N_{2}(g) + 3H_{2}(g) = 2NH_{3}(g) \Delta H=- 92 kJmol^{-1}}\) _Exothermic_

An increase in temperature favours the endothermic reaction;

A decrease in temperature favours the exothermic reaction.

\begin{tabular}{|p{113.8pt}|p{113.8pt}|p{113.8pt}|} \hline \hline \multirow{2}{*}{**Change**} & **Effect on** & **Effect on** & ***Effect on** \\  & **position of equilibrium** & **equilibrium mixture** & **\(K_{c}\)** \\ \hline \multirow{2}{*}{**If temperature increases,**} & **Reverse endothermic reaction** & \multirow{2}{*}{\(\left[\text{N}_{2}\right]\) and \(\left[\text{H}_{2}\right]\) increase, \(\left[\text{N}_{2}\right]\) decreases} & \multirow{2}{*}{\(K_{c}=\frac{\left[\text{NH}_{3}\right]^{2}}{\left[\text{N}_{2}\right]\left[ \text{H}_{2}\right]^{3}}\) decreases} \\  & **Reverse endothermic reaction** & & \\  & is favoured. & & \\  & Equilibrium position will shift to the left to reduce temperature by absorbing the extra heat. & & \\ \hline \multirow{2}{*}{**If temperature decreases,**} & **Forward exothermic reaction is** & \multirow{2}{*}{\(\left[\text{N}_{2}\right]\) and \(\left[\text{H}_{2}\right]\) decrease, \(\left[\text{NH}_{3}\right]\) increases.} & \multirow{2}{*}{\(K_{c}=\frac{\left[\text{NH}_{3}\right]^{2}}{\left[\text{N}_{2}\right]\left[ \text{H}_{2}\right]^{3}}\) increases} \\  & temperature by **producing more heat** & & \\ \hline \end{tabular}

_NOTE: Increase in temperature not only affect the position of equilibrium and value of \(K\), but also speed up both the forward and reverse reactions, allowing equilibrium to be reached more quickly. Refer to 'Reaction Kinetics'._

**Exercise 16**:

Predict the direction in which the position of equilibrium will shift, and the change to the \(K_{c}\) value for the systems below:

(a) 4NH3(g) + 5O2(g) 4NO(g) + 6H2O(g) 4NH < 0Temperature increases, position of equilibrium shifts to the \(K_{c}\) (b) H2(g) + I2(g) 2NH(g) 4NH > 0Temperature increases, position of equilibrium shifts to the \(K_{c}\) (c) 2AgC/O3(s) + C_l2(g) 2AgC_l(s) + 2C_lO2(g) + O2(g) 4NH = 0Temperature decreases, position of equilibrium \(K_{c}\) (c)

### Presence of catalyst

The addition of a catalyst only help the reaction to reach the same position of equilibrium at a faster rate. There is no change in the equilibrium constant, \(K\).

Look at the table below. Do you notice the difference in effects of adding a catalyst from changing temperature of a reaction?

\begin{tabular}{|p{113.8pt}|p{113.8pt}|p{113.8pt}|p{113.8pt}|} \hline \hline Change & Rate constants of (reward and reverse reactions) \(K\) & Equilibrium & Position of equilibrium \\ \hline \multirow{4}{*}{Addition of CATALYST} & increase to the same _extent (because activation energies are lowered by the same magnitude)_ & \multirow{2}{*}{Unchanged _but equilibrium is established faster_} & \multirow{2}{*}{Unchanged _but equilibrium is established faster_} \\ \cline{1-1} \cline{2-4}  & increase in TEMPERATURE & increase to different extent & & \\ \cline{1-1} \cline{2-4}  & increase to different extent TEMPERATURE & & & \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}

## 7 Application of Principles of Reaction Rates and Equilibria to Industrial Processes

The principles of reaction rates and chemical equilibria play an important part in the design and conditions of industrial processes. Other than economical reasons, the major factors determining these designs and conditions are to be able to convert reactants to products:

1. as quickly; and (i.e. kinetics - obtain maximum rate of reaction and product formation)
2. as completely as possible (equilibrium - maximise proportion of product)

Le Chatelier's Principle can be used to predict the choice of conditions such as:

1. temperature
2. pressure
3. catalyst

for **maximum yield** of product at equilibrium.

### The Haber Process

The Haber process is an industrial process for manufacturing ammonia, NH\({}_{3}\), from hydrogen and nitrogen gas. The reaction is reversible and exothermic.

#### Choice of Temperature

Since the forward reaction is exothermic, then applying Le Chatelier's Principle, the production of NH\({}_{3}\) is favoured by a **low temperature**. (At low temperature, POE shifts to the right to produce more heat and NH\({}_{3}\).)

However, if the temperature is too low, the **rate** of reaction will be **too slow** making the process uneconomical.

Hence a moderate temperature of **450 \({}^{\circ}\)C** is used to obtain a reasonable yield of NH\({}_{3}\) in a **short time**.

## Choice of Pressure

* Since there are lesser moles of gaseous products than reactants, then applying Le Chatelier's Principle, the production of NH\({}_{3}\) is favoured by a very **high pressure**. (At high pressure, POE shifts to the right to produce fewer gas particles.)
* However, very high pressure demands higher **costs of plant construction and maintenance** since more expensive and thicker vessels (hydrogen can diffuse through many metals at high temperature and pressure) have to be employed in order to withstand high pressures.
* Hence a pressure of moderately high pressure of **250 atm** is used.

### Choice of Catalyst

* To further speed up the rate of production, **finely divided iron catalyst** is employed.
* The role of the iron catalyst is mainly to **increase the rate at which equilibrium is achieved**. The **YIELD of NH\({}_{3}\) is NOT affected** by the presence of the catalyst.

### Invention of Ammonia: Good or bad?

* Used widely as refrigerant and in the manufacture of nitric acid which is used to make _explosives_, _dye stuffs_, _nylon_, _pharmaceuticals etc._
* Lastly it can be used as a precursor for production of nitrates for fertilizers.
* However, fertilisers may lead to eutrophication where fertilisers washed off from land into lakes and rivers. Increased nitrates promote algae growth over the water surface. This prevents sunlight from reaching the water plants. Plants die and decompose, depleting the oxygen in water to the extent that no aquatic life is possible again.
* Lastly, Haber's work also boosted the nitrate supply for the manufacture of explosives in Germany in the early 1900s, which indirectly prolonged World War I.

## 8 Relationship between \(K\) and spontaneity of reaction

A graph depicting the Gibbs free energy, G of a reaction mixture at various compositions is shown below.

In any spontaneous reactions at constant temperature and pressure, the Gibbs free energy, G decreases as the reaction proceeds and the composition of reactants and products changes. The G of the reaction mixture decreases until it reaches a minimum value at point X. When this minimum is reached, a state of equilibrium exists, \(\Delta\)G = 0.

At point A, value of \(\Delta\)G can be found by calculating the gradient of the tangent at point A. The ratio of products to reactants, called reaction quotient, **Q**, tells us the composition of the reaction mixture (**Q** = [products] ).

**Note: Q** has the same expression as \(K\), but represents the quantity of reactants and products at **any composition. \(K\) on the other hand only represents the quantity of reactants and products at equilibrium, where \(\Delta\)G = 0.

This explains why when a system at equilibrium is disturbed by the addition or removal of reactants or products and hence [products] changes from K to Q, the position of equilibrium will shift to restore equilibrium (Le Chatelier's Principle).

An equation to relate \(\Delta\)G and \(\Delta\)G\({}^{0}\) (standard Gibbs free energy) is as follows:

\(\Delta\)G = \(\Delta\)G\({}^{0}\) + RT In \(Q\)

At equilibrium, \(\Delta\)G = 0 and \(Q\) = \(K\), therefore

where R is molar gas constant: 8.31 J K\({}^{-1}\) mol\({}^{-1}\)

T is temperature: K

\(\Delta\)G\({}^{0}\) : J mol\({}^{-1}\)

**Note:**

* \(\Delta G^{\oplus}\) are mostly given in kJ mol\({}^{-1}\). In order to be consistent with the unit of R, you are reminded to convert the units to J mol\({}^{-1}\).
* \(K\) is known as the _standard_ equilibrium constant or _thermodynamic_ constant and is dimensionless (i.e. no units) since K is taken as ratio of [products] to [reactants].

**Relationship between \(\Delta G^{\oplus}\) and K**

From the equation, we can see

**Relationship between \(\Delta G^{\oplus}\) and position of equilibrium**

The sign of \(\Delta G^{\oplus}\) tells us whether reactants or products are dominant at equilibrium.

### Exercise 17:

\(K\) is greater than 1 because \(\Delta G^{\bullet}\) is negative.

## 9 Relationship between Equilibrium and Kinetics

To understand why \(K_{\text{c}}\) or \(K_{\text{p}}\) values only change with temperature, the two equations involving rate constants, k, have to be considered.

(a) Arrhenius equation where \(A\) is Arrhenius constant \(K=A\text{e}^{-E_{a}/RT}\)\(E_{a}\) is the activation energy of the reaction \(R\) is the gas constant and \(T\) is the temperature NOTE:

Rate constant, \(k\) is only affected by \(E_{a}\) and T.

Most reversible reactions have different \(E_{a}\) for the forward and reverse reactions.

(b) Relationship between equilibrium constant, \(K_{\text{c}}\) (or \(K_{\text{p}}\)) and rate constant, \(k\).

Consider a reversible reaction: \(A+B\iff C+D\)

Recall concept of _dynamic_ equilibrium:

rate of forward reaction = rate of reverse reaction

In 'Reaction Kinetics', you learnt that rate equation can be written as:

rate of forward reaction = \(k_{\text{f}}\)[A][B]

rate of reverse reaction = \(k_{\text{b}}\)[C][D]

Combining both concepts you will get \(\Rightarrow\)\(k_{\text{f}}\)[A][B] = \(k_{\text{b}}\)[C][D]

Rearranging, \(\frac{[C][D]}{[A][B]}=\frac{k_{\text{f}}}{K_{\text{b}}}\)\(K_{\text{c}}=\frac{k_{\text{f}}}{K_{\text{b}}}\)

Conclusion:

Since rate constants for both forward and backward reactions changes to the same extent on addition of catalyst, \(K_{\text{c}}\) is not affected.

Changes in temperature leads to a change in the \(k_{\text{f}}\) and \(k_{\text{b}}\) to different extent. Hence, \(K_{\text{c}}\) will change.

* Extra Reading Mathematical explanations for students who are interested.

So why \(K_{\text{c}}\) decreases when temperature increases? (For exothermic forward reaction)

Reason 1:

\[K_{\text{c}} =\frac{\text{k}_{\text{t}}}{\text{k}_{\text{b}}}=\frac{\text{[C][D]}}{ \text{[A][B]}}\] \[\frac{\text{k}_{\text{f}}}{\text{k}_{\text{b}}} =\frac{\text{A}\text{e}^{\frac{\text{E}_{\text{a(forward)}}}{\text {RT}}}}{\text{A}^{\text{c}}\text{e}^{\frac{\text{E}_{\text{a(backward)}}}{ \text{RT}}}}\] \[=\frac{\text{A}}{\text{A}^{\text{c}}}\text{e}^{\frac{\text{E}_{ \text{a(backward)}}-\text{E}_{\text{a(forward)}}}{\text{RT}}}\]

For an exothermic forward reaction, magnitude of \(E_{\text{a(forward)}}\) is smaller than \(E\)'a (backward). Thus, the term \((E^{\text{a(backward)}}-E_{\text{a(forward)}})\) is a positive value.

(Note: If forward reaction is endothermic, the term will be a negative value).

When temperature increases, it results in the term \(\text{e}^{\frac{\text{E}_{\text{a(backward)}}-\text{E}_{\text{a(forward)}}}{ \text{RT}}}\) to be smaller. Hence \(K_{\text{c}}\) decreases when temperature increases.

Reason 2:

\[\text{In }K\text{=}-\frac{\Delta\text{H}^{0}}{\text{RT}}+\frac{\Delta \text{S}^{0}}{\text{R}}\] \[\text{Since }\Delta H\text{ is exothermic, In }K\propto\frac{1}{\text{T}}\] \[\text{When }\textbf{temperature increases, }K_{\text{c}}\text{ decreases.}\]

Thinkl How does \(K_{\text{c}}\) change as the temperature increase for an endothermic reaction? Are you able to explain using the mathematical relationships above?
