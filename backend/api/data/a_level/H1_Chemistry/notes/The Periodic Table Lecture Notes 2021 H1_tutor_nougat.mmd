## 1 Introduction

(a) recognise variation in the electronic configurations across a Period and down a Group

Elements in the Periodic Table are arranged in increasing order of proton number. The modern Periodic Table is largely based on the works of Dmitri Mendeleev, Lothar Meyer and Henry Moseley. (See Appendix.)

The **vertical** columns are called **groups**.

Elements in the same group have the same number of valence electrons and outer electronic configuration. As such, they show similarities in their physical and chemical properties.

The **horizontal** rows are called **periods**.

Elements in the same period have the same number of filled quantum shells. They have different physical and chemical properties, but there are trends in these properties as we move across the period.

The elements are further grouped into four blocks in the periodic table.

## 2 Variation of Atomic and Physical Properties

(b) describe and explain qualitatively the trends and variations in atomic radius, ionic radius, first ionisation energy and electronegativity:

(i) across a Period in terms of shielding and nuclear charge

(ii) down a Group in terms of increasing number of electronic shells and nuclear charge

### Atomic Radius (refer to Atomic Structure lecture notes)

[1cm]

**Trend:** Atomic radius decreases across the period.

[1cm]

Reason: Across a period,

[1cm]

**Nuclear charge increases as number of protons increase.**

**Shielding effect is approximately constant as successive electrons are added to the same quantum shell**

**Effective nuclear charge increases**

**Valence electrons are more strongly attracted towards the nucleus**

[1cm]

**Trend:** Atomic radius increases down the group.

[1cm]

**Reason: Down a group,**

**Although nuclear charge increases as number of protons increase,**

**the more significant factor is the increased number of filled quantum shells**

**causing the valence electrons to be further away from the nucleus**

### Ionic Radius (refer to Atomic Structure lecture notes)

(a) **Cationic radius** is **smaller** than corresponding parent atom **Flaton** >** **Flaton**

**Reason:**

* Nuclear charge remains constant (as number of protons in both the atom and its cation are the same).
* The cation has **fewer electrons** than its atom, thus, the remaining electrons are more strongly attracted to the nucleus.
* Furthermore, the cation contains **one less filled quantum shell**.

(b) **Anionic radius** is **greater** than corresponding parent atom **Flaton** <** **Flaton**

**Reason:**

* Nuclear charge remains constant (as number of protons in both the atom and its anion are the same).
* The anion has **more electrons than protons**, thus, the valence electrons are less strongly attracted to the nucleus.

(c) **Ionic Radius of Isoelectronic Species**

**Trend:** Ionic radius of **isoelectronic ions decrease** across the period.

There are 2 sets of isoelectronic ions.

Cations: Na+ > Mg2+ > Al3+ > Si4+

Anions: P3 > S2 > Cl

[1s2 2s2 2p6 3s2 3p6]

**Reason:**

* **Nuclear charge increases** as number of protons increase.
* **Shielding effect is approximately constant** as the ions are isoelectronic
* **Effective nuclear charge increases**
* **Valence electrons are more strongly attracted to the nucleus.**

**There is a sharp increase in ionic radius from the cationic series (Na+, Mg**\({}^{2*}\)**,** \(\text{A}^{3*}\)**,** \(\text{Si}^{4*}\)**) to the anionic series (P**\({}^{3-}\)**,** \(\text{S}^{2}\)**,** \(\text{C}I\)**), as these 2 series are NOT isoelectronic. The anions have 1 more filled quantum shell than the cations, causing the valence electrons to be further away from the nucleus.**

### First ionisation energies (refer to Atomic Structure lecture notes)

**Trend: First ionisation energy generally increases across a period.**

**Reason: Across a period,**

* **Nuclear charge increases** as number of protons increase
* **Shielding effect is approximately constant** as successive electrons are added to the same valence shell
* **Effective nuclear charge increases**
* **Valence electrons are more strongly attracted to the nucleus**
* **More energy** is required to remove a valence electron from each atom.

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:7]

### **Electronegativity** (refer to Atomic Structure lecture notes)

The electronegativity of an atom refers to the ability of an atom in a molecule to **attract bonding electrons**.

[0.5cm]

**Trend:** Electronegativity increases across a period.

Reason: Across a period,

**Nuclear charge increases** as number of protons increase

**Shielding effect is approximately constant** as successive electrons are added to the same valence shell

**Effective nuclear charge increases**

Hence, the ability of the atom to attract bonding electrons increases:

[0.5cm]

**Trend:** Electronegativity decreases down a group.

Reason: Down a group,

**Nuclear charge increases** as number of protons increase

**However, the more significant factor is the increased number of filled quantum shells**

**causing the valence electrons to be further away from the nucleus.**

**Hence, the ability of the atom to attract bonding electrons decreases.**

### Melting Point (refer to Chemical Bonding lecture notes)

[leftmargin=*,label=]
**Trend:**: Melting point **increases** from sodium to silicon and then **decreases** from phosphorus to chlorine.

We explain the variation in melting points by considering the elements' **structure, bonding and particles**. Always link the melting point to the **energy** required to overcome the attractions between the particles.

**Na, Mg and A/I**

Na, Mg and A/I have a **giant metallic lattice** of **cations surrounded by a sea of delocalised electrons**, held together by **strong metallic bonds**. A large amount of energy is required to overcome the strong metallic bonds, hence, high melting point.

The melting point increases from Na to A/ as metallic bond strength increases with

increasing number of valence electrons

increasing charge

decreasing cationic size

**Si**

Si has a **giant molecular structure** consisting of **atoms** held together by **strong covalent bonds**. A large amount of energy is required to break the many strong covalent bonds, thus, melting point is very high.

**P\({}_{4}\), S\({}_{8}\) and Cl\({}_{2}\)**

P\({}_{4}\), S\({}_{8}\) and Cl\({}_{2}\) have **simple molecular structures** with **weak instantaneous dipole - induced dipole attractions** between **molecules**. Little energy is required to overcome these weak attractions, hence low melting point.

The melting point of S\({}_{8}\) > P\({}_{4}\) > Cl\({}_{2}\). S\({}_{8}\) has the largest number of electrons per molecule, followed by P\({}_{4}\) then Cl\({}_{2}\). The larger the number of electrons per molecule, the more polarisable the electron cloud and the stronger the instantaneous dipole - induced dipole attraction between molecules.

### Electrical Conductivity (refer to Chemical Bonding lecture notes)

Electrical conductivity depends on the presence of **mobile charge carriers** (mobile ions or electrons).

**Na. Mg and A/I**

The metals have delocalised electrons to act as mobile charge carriers. From Na to A/I, number of **delocalised electrons** increases from 1 to 3, therefore there is an increase in electrical conductivity of these metals.

**Si**

Si is a semi-conductor/metalloid (has properties of metals and non metals).

It has a low electrical conductivity.

More on semiconductors: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wuLuBroXAKo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wuLuBroXAKo) (not in syllabus)

**P\({}_{4}\), S\({}_{8}\) and C\({}_{I2}\)**

P\({}_{4}\), S\({}_{8}\), C\({}_{I2}\) are simple molecules with **no delocalised electrons** to act as mobile charge carriers.

The valence electrons are localised in chemical bonds.

**Exercise 1**

Which of the following statements is true across the third period elements from sodium to chlorine?

A. Ionic radius decreases B. Atomic radius decreases C. 2nd ionisation energy decreases D. Electrical conductivity decreases

Ans: B

**Self- Check: Q1-2**

## 3 Variation of Chemical Properties

### Oxidation Numbers of Period 3 oxides and chlorides

(e)(i) state and explain the variation in the highest oxidation number of the elements in oxides (for Na\({}_{2}\)O; MgO; Al\({}_{6}\)O\({}_{3}\); SiO\({}_{2}\); P\({}_{4}\)O\({}_{10}\); SO\({}_{3}\)) and and chlorides (for NaCl; MgCl\({}_{2}\); Al\({}_{3}\); SiC\(l_{4}\); PC\(l_{5}\))

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|} \hline
**Element** & **Na** & **Mg** & **A/I** & **Si** & **P** & **S** \\ \hline Formula of oxide & Na\({}_{2}\)O & MgO & Al\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{3}\) & SiO\({}_{2}\) & P\({}_{4}\)O\({}_{6}\), P\({}_{4}\)O\({}_{10}\) & SO\({}_{2}\), SO\({}_{3}\) \\ \hline Oxidation number & +1 & +2 & +3 & +4 & +3, +5 & +4, +6 \\ \hline
**Element** & **Na** & **Mg** & **A/I** & **Si** & **P** & \\ \hline Formula of chloride & NaCl\(I\) & MgCl\({}_{2}\) & Al/Cl\({}_{3}\) & SiC\(l_{4}\) & PC\(l_{3}\), PC\(l_{5}\) & \\ \hline Oxidation number & +1 & +2 & +3 & +4 & +3, +5 & \\ \hline \end{tabular}

The oxidation number of each element in its oxide and chloride is always **positive** because O and **C/I** are more electronegative than the element.

The highest oxidation number of each element corresponds to the number of valence electron(s) in each atom of the element that can be lost or shared to achieve an octet configuration of ns\({}^{2}\) np\({}^{6}\).

P and S can exhibit variable oxidation states. They are able to expand their octet structure due to the presence of **empty and energetically accessible 3d orbitals**.

### Period 3 oxides and their properties

#### Bonding

(e)(ii) state and explain the variation in bonding in oxides in terms of electronegativity

(e)(iv) suggest the types of structure and bonding present in the oxides from observations of their chemical and physical properties

**Trend**: Across Period 3, the oxides become less ionic and more covalent.

Reason:

* The elements change from metallic to non-metallic across the period.
* Electronegativity difference between the element and oxygen decreases, resulting in more covalent character.

#### 3.2.2 Reaction with water

(e)(iii) describe the reactions of the oxides with water(for Na\({}_{2}\)O; MgO; Al\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{3}\); SiO\({}_{2}\);P\({}_{4}\)O\({}_{16}\); SO\({}_{3}\))

(e)(vi) suggest the types of structure and bonding present in the oxides from observations of their chemical and physical properties

**Trend**: Across Period 3, the nature of the oxides changes from basic to amphoteric to acidic (become more acidic).

\begin{tabular}{|p{28.5pt}|p{113.8pt}|p{113.8pt}|p{113.8pt}|} \hline  & **Reaction with water** & **Equations** & **pH** \\ \hline

**SiO\({}_{2}\)** & **Does not react** with water due to the strong covalent bonds between Si and O atoms in the giant covalent lattice structure. & NA & 7 \\  & SiO\({}_{2}\) is insoluble in water. & & \\ \hline

#### 3.2.3 Acid-Base nature of oxides and hydroxides

### Period 3 chlorides and their properties

#### 3.3.1 Bonding

Candidates should be able to:

(e)(ii) state and explain the variation in bonding in chlorides in terms of electronegativity (with the exception of AC_l_)

(e)(vi) suggest the types of structure and bonding present in the chlorides from observations of their chemical and physical properties.

**Trend**: Across Period 3, the chlorides become less ionic and more covalent.

: Reason:

The elements change from metallic to non-metallic across the period.

Electronegativity difference between the element and chlorine decreases, resulting in more covalent character.

### Group 1 elements

(f) (i) describe and explain the relative reactivity of elements of Group 1 as reducing agents in terms of ease of loss of electron

**Reactivity of Group 1 Elements (Li to Cs)**

Group 1 elements are **reactive** metals.

Li, Na, K, Rb and Cs are very reactive and therefore they are stored in oil.

Group 1 elements generally act as **reducing agents and undergo oxidation** to the + 1 oxidation state in all their compounds by losing the outermost electron so as to achieve stable configuration of noble gases.

**M \(\rightarrow\) M\({}^{*}\) + e\({}^{-}\)**

Hence, most of the Group 1 compounds are **ionic** in nature.

**Element** **Atomic radius/nm** **1st ionisation energy**

**M(g) \(\rightarrow\) M\({}^{*}\)(g) + e\({}^{-}\)**

Li 0.152 519

Na 0.186 495

K 0.190 418

Rb 0.265 403

Cs 0.298 376

**Reducing powers** (and hence reactivity) **increases** down the group because **atomic radius increases** and **1st ionisation energies decreases**. Down the group, atoms are more willing to give up their valence electron to form cation, M\({}^{*}\).

**Self- Check: Q7**

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:21]

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|} \hline  & \(\mathbf{F_{2}}\) & \(\mathbf{Cl_{2}}\) & \(\mathbf{Br_{2}}\) & \(\mathbf{I_{2}}\) \\ \hline Boiling point / \({}^{\circ}\mathbf{C}\) & \(-188\) & \(-35\) & \(59\) & \(183\) \\ \hline \end{tabular}

**Trend:** Volatility decreases down Group 17.

**Reason:** Halogens exist as non-polar simple covalent molecules with weak instantaneous dipole-induced dipole (id-id) interactions between its molecules.

Down the group

* number of electrons per molecule **increases**
* the electron cloud size of \(\mathrm{X_{2}}\) **increases**
* electron cloud becomes **more easily distorted/ polarisable**
* **instantaneous dipole-induced dipole attraction** become **stronger**.
* **more energy is required** to break the intermolecular forces of attraction
* hence, **boiling point increases** in the order: \(\mathrm{F_{2}<Cl_{2}<Br_{2}<I_{2}}\)
* **volatility decreases** in the order: \(\mathrm{F_{2}>Cl_{2}>Br_{2}>I_{2}}\)

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|} \hline  & \multicolumn{1}{c}{} & \multicolumn{1}{c}{} & \multicolumn{1}{c}{} \\ \cline{2-3} \end{tabular}

Which of the following statements about the halogens chlorine, bromine and iodine are correct?

1. & The volatility of the halogens decreases down the group.

2. & The bond energy of the \(\mathrm{X-X}\) bond decreases down the group.

3. & The magnitude of 1st electron affinity of \(\mathrm{X}\) decreases down the group.

Ans: **1,2,3**

\begin{tabular

**Reason:**

* Thermal stability of Group 17 hydrides is related to the **H-X bond strength**
* **More endothermic bond energy suggests that the **H-X bond is stronger** and that **H-X is more thermally stable**.
* Down the group, the **size** of the halogen **increases**.
* The **valence orbital** used for bonding is **larger and more diffuse**.
* **Less effective orbital overlap** between s orbital of hydrogen and the valence p orbital of the halogen.
* **Electronegativity difference** between hydrogen and halogen decreases, resulting in a decrease in bond polarity**.
* X bond strength decreases, so **H
- X bond is more easily broken.
* Hence the thermal stability of the hydrogen halides decreases down the group**

**Self- Check: 8-10**

**Exercise 6**

**For the sequence hydrogen chloride, hydrogen bromide and hydrogen iodide, there is an increase in**

**1. Thermal stability**

**2. Bond length**

**3. Volatility**

**Ans: 2**

## 4 Application of concepts in periodicity

* predict the characteristic properties of an element in a given Group by using knowledge of chemical periodicity
* deduce the nature, possible position in the Periodic Table, and identity of unknown elements from given information of physical and chemical properties

### Predicting the characteristic properties of an element

* Elements in the same Group tend to have similar chemical and physical properties.
* You can use knowledge of the Period 3 elements to extrapolate the chemical and physical behaviour of other elements in Groups 1-2, 12-17.

* **Exercise 7** The element selenium can react with oxygen to form several compounds. From your knowledge of chemical periodicity, suggest the chemical formulae of two of the compounds selenium forms with oxygen.

* **Thinking process**: Which elements are in the same Group as selenium? What oxides do these elements form, and what is their formula?

### Diagonal Relationship in the Periodic Table

* It was observed that for certain properties, the trends actually move in opposite directions. For example, electronegativity increases across a Period but decreases down a Group. When taken into combination, this means that elements diagonal to each other (in a down-and-right direction) actually have similar electronegativity, and this is supported by observational evidence.

* Properties which may be supported by the diagonal relationship, which is most noticeable in Periods 2 and 3:
* Atomic radius
* Electrical conductivity (e.g. B and Si are semiconductors)
* Acidic Hydrolysis (e.g. aqueous solutions of Be\({}^{2+}\) and A\({}^{\beta+}\) are weakly acidic)
* Nature of compounds (e.g. Be and A/I both form covalent chlorides BeCl\({}_{2}\) and A/Cl\({}_{3}\))
* You may need to use this diagonal relationship to predict the properties of a given element.

### Deduce identity of unknown element from given information

* It is also possible that you will be given certain information and asked to deduce the identity of an unknown element and its position in the Periodic Table. Cross-reference the information with what you know to identify the element.

An unknown element is found in period 3. Identify this unknown element given the following information.

* It has a melting point of 650 \({}^{\circ}\)C.
* The chloride is a white solid at room temperature. The chloride dissolves readily in water to form a slightly acidic solution with a pH of 6.5.

## 5 Appendix

'If you want to learn about the future, you have to look into the past.' The history of the periodic table and IUPAC demonstrates the gradual perfection of scientific research and the continuous effort for better communication to facilitate it. In the future, new tools will continue to help scientists in evermore exciting exploration of the elements, as well as in broader collaborations for the betterment of mankind.

Qi-Feng Zhou, President, International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC)

**Did you know?**

On 20 December 2017, during its 74th Plenary Meeting, the United Nations (UN) General Assembly 72nd Session proclaimed 2019 as the International Year of the Periodic Table of Chemical Elements (IYPT 2019).

IYPT 2019 will coincide with the 150th anniversary of the discovery of the Periodic System by Dmitry Mendeleev in 1869. The events of IYPT aims to enhance the understanding and appreciation of the Periodic Table and chemistry in general among the public. Particular areas where the Periodic Table and its understanding have had a revolutionary impact are in nuclear medicine, the study of chemical elements and compounds in space and the prediction of novel materials.

**Development of the periodic table**

Dmitri Mendeleev proposed the periodic system in 1869. His Periodic Table, which arranged elements according to atomic mass, was widely accepted. It was able to predict the properties of five undiscovered elements and their compounds, which provided further proof of his periodic system.

However, there were some inconsistencies - Mendeleev placed argon (atomic mass 39.95) before potassium (atomic mass 39.10), which contradicted his principle of arranging elements according to atomic mass. Henry Moseley's subsequent work provided evidence that the arrangement of elements according to atomic number could explain these contradictions. This is the Periodic Table that is still in use today.

All elements from atomic numbers 1 (hydrogen) to 118 (ununnotcum) have been discovered or synthesised. The four most recent elements (113, 115, 117 and 118) were fully added into the periodic table, with the approval of their names and symbols, on 28 November 2016.

Science is an evidence-based, model-building enterprise concerned with the natural world.

Scientific knowledge is reliable and durable, yet subject to revision in the light of new evidence.
