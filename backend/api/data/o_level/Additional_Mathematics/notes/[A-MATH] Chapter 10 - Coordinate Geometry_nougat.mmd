**Alternative to the equation of a straight line**

Then a network position that can be used to find the position of a straight line. This equation is now powerful (and) useful than the standard equation in \(x\) only requires 1 parameter and 1 point stable to line negative 1 gradient and 2 point stationary.

\[y-y_{*}=n(x-y_{*})\]

(\(x_{*}\),\(y_{*}\)) in the coordinate model

\(x\) in the gradient of the line

The gridset of line is 1 and the \(y\)-vector is 4. This is because the whole equation has to be divided by 2 for the coefficient of \(y\) next to 1.

There are questions where students can asked to determine if there are any intersection points between 2 lines. A very easy way to check is to check the gradient and \(y\)-number values. There will be possible \(z\)-number values.

The line was attached, they have implicitly many intersections points

Consider some, \(y\)-intersection different

The 2 lines are parallel, how how has intersection points

Consider and \(y\)-intersection different

The 2 lines have no unique relationships between them, they have \(z\)-point of intersection

## Area of rectilinear figures

Method to use is the Shoelace method. Let \(A(x_{1},y_{1})\), \(B(x_{2},y_{2})\), \(C(x_{2},y_{3})\),... and \(M(x_{m},y_{m})\) be the vertices of a rectilinear figure and the points are arranged in an anti-clockwise direction

\[\begin{array}{ccccc}\textbf{Area}=\frac{1}{2}\left|\begin{matrix}x_{1}&x_{2} &x_{3}&...&x_{m}&x_{1}\\ y_{1}&y_{2}&y_{3}&...&y_{m}&y_{1}\end{matrix}\right|\end{array}\]

To be very honest, the direction of how the points are arranged does not really matter [due to the modulus signs], but the ordering does. Always ensure that you follow one specific direction when calculating

## Take Note

Always remember to repeat the very first point that you choose

\[\begin{array}{ccccc}\textbf{Area}=\frac{1}{2}\left|\begin{matrix}x_{1}&x_{2} &x_{3}&...&x_{m}\\ y_{1}&y_{2}&y_{3}&...&y_{m}\end{matrix}\right|\end{array}\]
