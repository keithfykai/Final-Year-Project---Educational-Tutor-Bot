### Types of experimental variables

* In an experiment, there are generally three types of variables.

* The independent variable is the variable that is changed in an experiment to investigate its effect. This is the variable that is being investigated in the experiment and its value is chosen to be varied.

* The dependent variable is the variable that is measured in an experiment. This is the variable with value that depends on the independent variable and is being measured in the experiment.

* These are other key factor(s) that can affect the dependent variable. These variables must be controlled (usually kept constant) in the experiment to help ensure valid conclusion can be made.

* These are also termed controlled variables.

* Example 1

* Hydrochloric acid and magnesium ribbon react to produce hydrogen gas.

* You are to plan the details of an experiment, based on the volume of gas produced in the reaction, to investigate how the rate of reaction depends on the concentration of the hydrochloric acid.

* [noitemsep]
* independent variable
* volume of H2 gas collected in a specified time
* time taken to produce a specified volume of H2 gas
* temperature
* amount/length/mass/surface area of magnesium ribbon
* Example 2

* When aqueous sodium chloride, NaCl, is added to aqueous lead nitrate, Pb(NO3)2, a white precipitate of lead chloride, PbCl2, is produced. A suggested stoichiometric equation is

* In separate experiments, different volumes of 0.20 mol dm-3 aqueous sodium chloride are added to a fixed volume of 0.10 mol dm-3 aqueous lead nitrate. In each case, the precipitate is filtered, washed with distilled water and thoroughly dried. The mass of the precipitate is recorded.

* You are to plan an experiment to investigate this reaction in order to confirm or reject the stoichiometry of the equation.

* independent variable
* volume/amount/mass of NaCl/
* mass/amount of PbCl2
* constant variable
* temperature

### Writing the procedure

* Each procedural step must be properly described and typically comprises three parts:

* "weigh", "transfer", etc)
* Quantity and identity of chemical to be measured and recorded e.g. (20.00 cm\({}^{3}\) of NaOH)
* Instrument / apparatus (specifying their capacity, if relevant) to be used (e.g. 100 cm\({}^{3}\) beaker, electronic balance, 25.0 cm\({}^{3}\) pipette, etc)
* Examples:
* Using a 25 cm\({}^{3}\) measuring cylinder, measure 20.0 cm\({}^{3}\) of NaOH(aq).
* Using an electronic balance, weigh accurately about 2.5 g of Na\({}_{2}\)CO\({}_{3}\) into a clean and dry weighing bottle.

### Colour change at the end-point for manganate(VII) titration

### Acidifying solutions - choice of acids

* Some redox tritons require acidification with an appropriate acid. This is usually apparent from the question or the balanced chemical equation. For example: \[\text{Mn}\text{Cr}(\text{aq})+\text{5Fe}^{2+}(\text{aq})+\text{BH}^{*}(\text{ aq})-\text{Mn}^{+}(\text{aq})+\text{5Fe}^{2+}(\text{aq})+\text{4H}\text{2O}(\text{I})\]
* The choice of acid used must be considered carefully. For example, hydrochloric acid cannot be used to provide the acidic medium for the titration between KMnO\({}_{4}\) and H\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{2}\). The Cr' ion from HCl(aq) would be oxidised by either H\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{2}\)(aq) or MnO\({}_{4}\)+ to Cl\({}_{2}\)(g).
* Dilute H\({}_{2}\)SO\({}_{4}\)(aq) is commonly used to provide the acidic medium for redox titrations and is usually added in excess using a measuring cylinder.

### Safety

* Students can be asked to suggest safety precautions that should be undertaken during the experiment and to state the reasons for them.
* Examples of some basic safely precautions related to titration. [leftmargin=*] **Safety precaution** Reason

1 Fill the burette with hydrochloric acid with the aid of the funnel and preferably do so at below eye-level. To prevent any accidental spillage of the corrosive acid solution into the eyes which will cause irritation and harm.
2 Pipette the aqueous sodium hydroxide solution with the aid of the pipette filter. The solution should not be drawn into the pipette by mouth. 3 Wear safety goggles and safety glowes when diluting the 1 mol dm\({}^{3}\) H\({}_{2}\)SO\({}_{4}\).
* Students can also be asked to identify one or more safety risks unique to the experiment and to suggest ways to overcome or minimise these safety risks.
* Examples [leftmargin=*] **Safety risk/hazard** Way to minimise or overcome the risk/hazard

1 To prepare FA3 solution for titration, magnesium ribbon has to be added to hydrochloric acid. This produces hydrogen gas which is highly inflammable.
2 FA1 contains Na\({}_{2}\)C\({}_{0}\)A which is highly toxic and also an irrtant. Wear safety goggles, safety gloves and laboratory coat when handling FA1 to avoid any direct contact with the skin and also any accidental contact with the eyes.

### Reliability of results

* Candidates can be asked to state measures to take to ensure reliability of results in a titration. Some measures are:
* Stopper and shake the volumetric flask well to ensure a homogeneous solution is obtained.
* Swirl the solution in the conical flask continuously during titration to ensure that the reactants are well mixed.
* Repeat the titration to get at least two consistent titration readings (i.e. at least two titre values that are within 0.10 cm\({}^{3}\) of each other).
* The experiment can be repeated to check for the reliability of the titration results.

### Checklist of skills

Students should be able to

* draw a simple diagram of a titration setup, with labelling of the solutions in the burette and conical flask
* write procedures for each of the following:
* the preparation of a standard solution using the 250 cm\({}^{3}\) graduated flask,
* the dilution of a given solution using the 250 cm\({}^{3}\) graduated flask,
* the steps to carry out an acid-base titration
* the steps to carry out a redox titration

## 3 Worked Examples

* Worked Example 1
* A solid sample contains about 80% by mass of Na\({}_{2}\)CO\({}_{3}\) You are to design an experiment in which the percentage purity by mass of Na\({}_{2}\)CO\({}_{3}\) in the impure sample can be determined accurately using a titrimetric method. You may assume that the following are available:
* 3 g of impure Na\({}_{2}\)CO\({}_{3}\) sample
* 0.100 mol dm\({}^{-3}\) dilute HC/
* acid-base indicators
* usual titration apparatus

* Write a plan involving volumetric analysis for the determination of the percentage purity by mass of Na\({}_{2}\)CO\({}_{3}\) in the given solid sample. Your plan should include the following:
* calculation of a suitable mass of sample to be used
* procedure for the preparation of Na\({}_{2}\)CO\({}_{3}\) solution
* details of the titration procedure
* Show how the experimental results may be used to find the percentage purity of Na\({}_{2}\)CO\({}_{3}\) in the sample.
* State any assumptions made regarding the impurity in the sample.

* **Guiding questions*
* What is the type of titration to be conducted? Is there a need for back titration? Is there is a need to prepare a solution using a graduated flask? If so, what is the capacity of the graduated flask to be used? Which solution, Na\({}_{2}\)CO\({}_{3}\) or HCI, is to be placed in the conical flask or burette? What is a suitable indicator? What is the expected colour change at the end-point of titration?

* Worked Example 2

An old bottle of methanoic acid solution was found in a laboratory.

It is known that methanoic acid is a weak acid that decomposes slowly according to the following equation.

HCO\({}_{2}\)H \(\longrightarrow\) CO + H\({}_{2}\)O

You are to design an experiment to determine the concentration of methanoic acid remaining in the bottle using a titration method.

You may assume that the following are available:

* 150 cm\({}^{3}\) of the partially decomposed solution from the bottle (FA1)
* 0.200 mol dm\({}^{-2}\) NaOH (FA2)
* 250 cm\({}^{3}\) graduated flask
* deionised water
* thymophthaien and methyl orange indicators
* the apparatus and materials normally found in a school or college laboratory

The solutions were tested and it was found that 20 drops of FA1 required 4 drops of FA2 for complete reaction.

(a) Write a plan for the volumetric analysis of FA1.

In your plan you should give:

* details, including quantities, for the preparation of a suitable NaOH solution (i.e. FA3) from FA2 to be used during titration
* the essential details of the titration procedure.

Present your plan as a sequence of numbered steps. [5]

(b) The label on the bottle reads "0.1 mol dm\({}^{-3}\) methanolic acid".

Show how the experimental results may be used to determine the percentage decomposition of methanoic acid in the sample. Assume that the average titre value is \(x\) cm\({}^{3}\). [2]

Guiding questions

* Based on the micro-titration results, is there a need to dilute any solution? If so, what volume of solution is to be used for dilution? What is the capacity of graduated flask to be used?
* What type of titration is to be conducted and which indicator, thymolphthalein or methyl orange, is suitable?
* Which solution is to be placed in the conical flask and burette?
* What is the expected colour change at the end-point of titration?* For this pre-experimental calculation, make use of the preliminary titration (micro-titration) results to determine which solution needs to be diluted.
* See section 4.1 on page 9.
* The HCOOH and NaOH solutions to be used for this acid-base titration should preferably have similar concentrations so that 25.0 cm\({}^{3}\) of the acid will react with about 25.0 cm\({}^{3}\) of the base.
* Key points to consider here:
* dilution of FA2 is necessary volume of FA2 to be used for dilution needs to be determined
* this is a weak acid-strong base titration, so the suitable indicator is thymophthallein.
* **Stopper** the graduated flask and shake the solution to ensure that it is homogeneous. Label the solution FA3.

**Titration of FA1 against FA3 placed in the burette**

Procedure:

* Fill another burette with FA3.
* Pipette 25.0 cm\({}^{3}\) of FA1 into a 250 cm\({}^{3}\) conical flask and add 2 drops of thymolphthallein indicator. Titrate this FA1 against FA3.
* Stop the titration when the end-point is reached i.e. when one drop of FA3 added changes the colour of the solution in the conical flask from colourless to pale blue.
* Record the titration results using an appropriate table.
* Repeat the titration until at least two consistent results are obtained (i.e. the titre volumes are within 0.10 cm\({}^{3}\) of each other).

* For this part, express the final answer in terms of \(x\).

Concentration of NaOH in FA3 = 0.200/5 = 0.0400 mol dm\({}^{3}\) Amount of NaOH used = \(\frac{x}{1000}\times\)0.0400 = 4 x 10\({}^{-}\)x mol

HCOOH(aq) + NaOH(aq) + HCOONa(aq) + H\({}_{2}\)O(l) Amount of HCOOH in 25.0 cm\({}^{3}\) FA1 = 4 x 10\({}^{-}\)x mol

Concentration of HCOOH in FA1 = 4 x 10\({}^{-}\)x \({}^{+}\)\({}^{25.0}_{1000}\) = 0.0016x mol dm\({}^{-3}\)

% of HCOOH that remains = (0.0016x / 0.1) (100%) = 1.6x %

% decomposition of HCOOH = (100 - 1.6x) %

Gravimetric analysis

Gravimetry involves the accurate measurement of mass as a means of quantifying a sample. The substance to be weighed may be formed from thermal decomposition or by precipitation.

## Thermal decomposition

This method involves heating a compound until it decomposes to give a solid residue and a gaseous product.

General procedure:

Common apparatus for

Record the mass of an empty boiling tube/crucible.

thermal decomposition

Heat the sample gently in the boiling tube using a Bunsen burner.

Then heat strongly for at least 10 min.

Cool and weigh the boiling tube and its contents.

The process of heating, cooling and weighing is repeated until constant mass is achieved.

Points to take note:

Apparatus used for heating: dry and clean boiling tube or crucible

Heating should be gentle at first to prevent spattering of the sample. Strong heating is then carried out for about 10 min.

The crucible and its contents should be cooled to room temperature. If the crucible

and its contents are weighed when they are hot, the measured mass will be less than their true mass. Why? As hot air rises above the crucible, cold air is drawn in

and as it heats up and rises, it lifts the crucible very slightly from the balance pan.

Ideally, the crucible and its contents should be cooled in a desiccator (see below).

The desiccator provides a dry atmosphere and allows the crucible and its contents

to cool without absorbing moisture.

The procedure of reheating, cooling and weighing of the solid until constant mass is important in gravimetric analysis because this ensures that the sample is completely decomposed.

Possible source of error: Due to uneven heating, part of the sample may not have decomposed.

Basic safety considerations:

* Allow the crucible to cool sufficiently before handling and handle a hot crucible with crucible tongs. This is to ensure that your hands do not get burnt.
* While heating a sample using a boiling tube, move the boiling tube up and down, and do not heat it at one spot. This is to prevent the contents of the boiling tube from spurring due to intensive heating at one spot.
* Handle the boiling tube with a test tube holder at all times. This ensures that your hands do not get burnt.
* Point the boiling tube away from yourself and others. This ensures that no one gets hurt in case of spurring.

The table below shows some substances that decompose on heating.

* Gas collection method is fast, but it is not so accurate because
* some gases, e.g. CO2, may dissolve in the water if the water displacement method is used.
* some gas may escape from the experimental set-up instead of being collected in the buretle/measuring cylinder/gas syringe.
* swifing of the conical flask is variable, which will vary the volume of gas collected in the measuring cylinder;
* air and the gas evolved are both compressible, and heat of reaction may cause fluctuation in gas volumes due to thermal expansion;
* volume of gas collected in the gas syringe or by water displacement method is dependent on temperature and pressure.
* the ideal gas equation must be used to determine the amount of substance present from the volume of gas collected. However, this is not a good estimate, especially for gases which deviate greatly from the ideal gas behaviour.

* General Guideline For planning gas collection experiments, we assume the volume of gas collected to be between 50% and 90% of the capacity of the collection apparatus and use it to determine the amounts of reagents required in the pre-calculations.

* Plan an investigation to determine the actual concentration of a sample of aqueous H\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{2}\).

You may assume that you are provided with:

Solutions

Pre-calculations

Mass of FA1 to be used

Assume that 50.0 cm\({}^{3}\) of CO\({}_{2}\) gas is collected.

As 1 mole of gas occupies a volume of 24 dm\({}^{3}\) under laboratory conditions,

Amount of CO\({}_{2}=\frac{50.0}{24000}=2.08\times 10^{-3}\) mol

Na\({}_{2}\)CO\({}_{3}\)(s) + 2HC(aq) \(\rightarrow\) 2NaCl(aq) + CO\({}_{2}\)(g) + H\({}_{2}\)O(i)

Amount of Na\({}_{2}\)CO\({}_{3}=2.08\times 10^{-3}\) mol

Molar mass of Na\({}_{2}\)CO\({}_{3}=106.0\) g mol\({}^{-1}\)

Mass of Na\({}_{2}\)CO\({}_{3}=(2.08\times 10^{-3})(106.0)=0.220\) g

Assume that FA 1 contains 80% Na\({}_{2}\)CO\({}_{3}\). Hence mass of FA 1 to be used = 0.220 / 0.8 = 0.275 g

Volume of HC(aq) to be used

Amount of HC(aq) = (2)(2.08 \(\times 10^{-3}\)) = 4.16 \(\times 10^{-3}\) mol

Volume of HCI to be used = (4.16 \(\times\) 10\({}^{-3}\))0.200 = 2.08 \(\times 10^{-2}\) dm\({}^{3}\) = 20.8 cm\({}^{3}\)

Since HCI(aq) has to be in excess such that the Na\({}_{2}\)CO\({}_{3}\) used is completely reacted and for the experiment to be repeated, a suitable volume of HCI(aq) to be used is 30 cm\({}^{3}\).

Procedure

1. Using a buretle, add 30.00 cm\({}^{3}\) of HCI(aq) into a clean and dry 250 cm\({}^{3}\) conical flask with a side arm.
2. Weigh accurately about 0.275 g of FA 1 and place it in a small tube tied to a string.
3. Set up the apparatus as shown above.
4. Lower the filled tube into the conical flask taking care that the reagents do not mix. Stopper the conical flask
5. Check that the initial reading of the 100.0 cm\({}^{3}\) graduated gas syringe is set at the zero mark.
6. At a suitable time, loosen the stopper slightly to release the string to allow mixing of FA 1 and HCI(aq). Stopper the conical flask immediately.
7. Swift the conical flask to ensure that the reagents are well mixed.
8. Allow the reaction to progress until it has ceased as indicated by a constant reading of the syringe.
9. Record the final reading, V cm\({}^{3}\), on the graduated gas syringe.
10. Repeat the experiment again to get consistent results of volume of CO\({}_{2}\)(g) collected.

Calculations

Let the average volume of CO\({}_{2}\)(g) collected be V cm\({}^{3}\) and the mass of FA1 used = m\({}_{1}-\)m\({}_{2}\) g

Amount of CO\({}_{2}\) formed = \(\frac{V}{24000}\) mol

Amount of Na\({}_{2}\)CO\({}_{3}\) = Amount of CO\({}_{2}=\frac{V}{24000}\) mol

Mass of Na\({}_{2}\)CO\({}_{3}=\frac{V}{24000}\) x106.0 g

Percentage composition by mass of Na\({}_{2}\)CO\({}_{3}\) in FA 1

## Chemical Energetics

Thermochemistry is the study of heat effects accompanying chemical reactions, the formation of solutions and changes in physical states of substances. The measurement of the heat of a reaction requires the careful determination of a measurable change in temperature, often with the use of a calorimeter.

Refer to your lecture notes on Chemical Energetics for the definitions of important terms. You must be able to construct energy cycles and calculate enthalpy changes of reactions using the experimental data obtained.

### General Guideline

For planning energetics experiments where the approximate value of the unknown enthalpy change of reaction is given, we will assume that the reaction causes a 5-10 "C change in temperature and perform pre-calculation to determine the appropriate qualities of reagents to use.

General Procedure:

1. Monitor the temperature of a solution at regular time intervals, e.g. 0.5 min intervals. There should be a minimum of 3 (including initial temperature) temperature readings before the addition of the other reagent.
2. At a suitable time (e.g. t = 3min), add the other reagent to the solution and take temperature readings at 0.5 min intervals.
3. Sufficient temperature readings (minimum of 5 readings) must be taken after highest or lowest temperature is reached for reliable plotting of data points to be done.
4. Plot a graph of temperature against time. Draw two straight lines of best fit, one for the temperature of solution before addition of reagent at t = 3 min and the other for the cooling/warming of the solution once the reaction is completed. Extrapolate the two lines to t = 3 min and determine the change in temperature.

[Note: A stopwatch is required for this experimental method.]
General procedure:

1. Transfer \(x\) cm\({}^{3}\) of FA 1 into a Styrofoam cup, supported in a 250 cm\({}^{3}\) beaker.
2. Measure the initial steady temperature of the FA 1 solution in the cup.
3. Add \(y\) cm\({}^{3}\) of FA 2 from a burette into the polystyrene cup. Measure and record the highest/lowest temperature, T, attained.
4. Repeat step 3 until a total of \(z\) cm\({}^{3}\) of FA 2 has been added.
5. Plot a graph of T/ "C against volume of FA 2 / cm\({}^{3}\). Draw best-fit lines for the points before and after the maximum/minimum temperature, T, has been reached and extend them until they intersect. The point at which the two best-fit lines meet corresponds to the volume of FA 2 required for reaction and \(\Delta\)T.

(_values of x, y and z need to be determined based on context of question.)_

(Note: The volume of FA 2 added in step 3 should allow for a minimum temperature readings before AND after the maximum/minimum T.)

4. Add \(y\) cm\({}^{3}\) of FA 2 to FA 1. Measure and record the highest/lowest temperature, T, attained.
5. Repeat steps 1 to 3 using different volumes of FA 1, each time using the appropriate volume of FA 2 so that the total volume of the mixture is kept constant.
6. Plot the graph of T/ "C against volume of FA 2/ cm\({}^{3}\).

**Precalculation**

Let the volume of water used = 50.0cm\({}^{3}\)

Since solubility of NH\({\rm{\it{C}}}\)/ in water is 383 g dm\({}^{-3}\).

Max mass of NH\({\rm{\it{C}}}\)/ that would dissolve in 50.0cm\({}^{3}\) of water = \(\frac{383}{1000}\times 50\) = 19.15 g

Let the temperature change be -7 \({}^{\circ}\)C.

Heat change = 50 x 4.18 x -7 = -1463 J

Since \(\Delta H_{\rm{\it{Non}}}\) (NH\({\rm{\it{C}}}\)/) = +15 kJ mol\({}^{-1}\),

n(NH\({\rm{\it{C}}}\)/) = -1463 = 0.09753 mol

15 x 10\({}^{3}\)

mass of NH\({\rm{\it{C}}}\)/ = 0.09753 x (14.0+4.0+35.5) = 5.218 g

**Procedure**

1. Using a 50.0 cm\({}^{3}\) burette (or measuring cylinder), transfer 50.0 cm\({}^{3}\) of deionised water into a clean and dry polystyrene cup supported in a 250 cm\({}^{3}\) beaker. Take the initial temperature of the water using the thermometer provided.
2. Using an analytical balance, weigh accurately about 5.22 g of NH\({\rm{\it{C}}}\)/ in a clean and dry weighing bottle. Record the total mass of the weighing bottle and solid NH\({\rm{\it{C}}}\)/.
3. Empty the solid NH\({\rm{\it{C}}}\)/ into the polystyrene cup, cover the cup with a lid and stir gently using the thermometer to dissolve all the NH\({\rm{\it{C}}}\)/. Record the lowest temperature reached.
4. Weigh the emptied weighing bottle and record its mass.
5. Repeat steps 1 to 4. Use the data obtained from each experiment to calculate a value for \(\Delta H\). Take the average of these two values.

**Table of results**

Mass of weighing bottle and solid NH\({\rm{\it{C}}}\)/ g

Mass of emptied weighing bottle / g

Mass of solid NH\({\rm{\it{C}}}\)/ used / g

The change in temperature (\(\Delta T\))

will be negative as temperature

Initial temperature / \({}^{\circ}\)C

decreases when NH\({\rm{\it{C}}}\)/ dissolves

in water. \(\Delta T\) = \(T_{\rm{\it{min}}}\) - \(T_{i}\)

**Calculations to determine \(\Delta H_{\rm{\it{Non}}}\)**

Assume specific heat capacity of solution to be 4.18 J cm\({}^{-1}\) K\({}^{-1}\).

Assume no heat absorbed from surroundings.

Energy change for the reaction, q = (50.0)(4.18)(-T) = -209T J

Let mass of NH\({\rm{\it{C}}}\)/ used be m\({}_{A}\) g.

Molar mass of NH\({\rm{\it{C}}}\)/ = 53.5 g mol\({}^{-1}\)

Amount of NH\({\rm{\it{C}}}\)/ used = \(\frac{m_{A}}{53.5}\) mol

Enthaly change of reaction

= - \(\frac{q}{amount\) of NH\({\rm{\it{C}}}\)/

Since the reaction is endothermic and

temperature decreases, enthalpy change

of reaction must be positive.

A **saturated** solution is one in which no more solid can dissolve at a particular temperature. In a saturated solution with undissolved solid, the following equilibrium is established.

Ce(SO\({}_{4}\))(s) **Ce\({}^{4+}\)(aq) + 2SO\({}_{4}\)**-(aq)** Cerium(IV) sulfate is unusual as its solubility decreases when the temperature of the solution increases.

(a) Plan a procedure to determine the solubility of cerium(IV) sulfate in water.

Aim - determine the solubility of cerium (IV) sulfate in water.

You may assume that you are provided with:

* 60 cm\({}^{3}\) deionised water in a 150 cm\({}^{3}\) conical flask
* solid cerium(IV) sulfate, Ce(SO\({}_{4}\))\({}_{2}\),

The extent to which sparingly soluble salts dissolve in water is indicated either by the solubility or solubility product of the salt. A saturated solution is one in which no more solid can dissolve at a particular temperature.

Potassium hydrogen tartrate, KHCH\({}_{4}\)O\({}_{6}\) (KHT), is a sparingly soluble salt. In a saturated solution with the undissolved solid KHT, the following equilibrium is established.

KHCH\({}_{4}\)O\({}_{6}\)(s) = K'(aq) + HC\({}_{4}\)H\({}_{6}\)O\({}_{7}\)(aq)

* **Write an expression for the solubility product, \(K_{\rm{sp}}\), of KHT.**

* \(K_{\rm{sp}}\) = [K'][HCH\({}_{4}\)O\({}_{6}\)**]**

The hydrogen tartrate ion, HCH\({}_{4}\)O\({}_{6}\) (HT'), is a weak monobasic acid and its concentration in the saturated solution of KHT can be determined by titration with a strong base.like sodium hydroxide of known concentration.
* **The solubility of KHT in deionised water at 25 *C is approximately 0.032 mol dm\({}^{-3}\).**

In a titration experiment, 20.00 cm\({}^{3}\) of 0.0400 mol dm\({}^{-3}\) aqueous sodium hydroxide was needed to neutralise a saturated solution of KHT at 25 *C.

Calculate the volume of saturated solution of KHT used in the titration.

* **In(HCH\({}_{4}\)O\({}_{6}\)) = n(NaOH) = 20.0 / 1000 x 0.0400 = 0.000800 mol Volume of saturated solution of KHT used = 0.000800 / 0.032 x 1000 = 25.0 cm\({}^{3}\)**

Immerse the flask in a water bath maintained at 25\({}^{\circ}\)C and place a thermometer into the flask to monitor the temperature of the solution.

Add solid potassium hydrogen tartrate (KHT) into conical flask, stirring using a glass rod, until no more solid can dissolve.

Allow the solution to stand for 30 minutes with occasional stirring or switing to ensure that the system has reached equilibrium i.e. solution is saturated.

Filter the solution through a dry filter paper and dry filter paper into a dry 250 cm\({}^{3}\) conical flask.

_(Note: Dry filter paper and conical flask is used to prevent any water diluting the saturated solution)_

[Cu\({}^{2}\)]The organic chemist works with covalent compounds, in which strong covalent bonds are often broken and made. Such reactions may be very slow and heating may be required. These reactions usually involve side reactions which produce unwanted side products from which the intended products must be separated and purified.

Hence, there are four main steps in organic synthesis experiments:

When planning for an organic synthesis reaction, it is important to consider the **type of setup** to be used, how the reagents should be mixed and consequently the **temperature control** required.

* **Mixing of reagents** It is important to consider how the reagents should be mixed. Some reactions require careful mixing of reagents or cooling the reaction flask to reduce side reactions. For example, 
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|} \hline

* cooled or room temperature reactions
- can be used in some organic
reactions. However due to the volatility of most organic solvents, reactants and products, a reflux setup is often used.

Heating under reflux

Heating under reflux

often used to increase the efficiency and safety of the reaction. In this technique, the reagents are heated together in a flask which has a Liebig condenser fitted vertically above it. Vapour from the boiling mixture enters the condenser, cools and condenses, and flows back into the flask. (Note: The cooling water enters the condenser at the bottom to ensure that the temperature is the coolest at the bottom and all vapour will be condensed without any loss.)

Advantages of boiling under reflux:

1. The reaction can take place at or near the boiling point of the reactants/products/solvents without any loss of the reagents/products/solvents by evaporation.
2. Immiscible reactants are constantly agitated and brought into more intimate contact - the contents of the flask not only splash about gently during boiling, but constantly have liquid dripping from above.

(Note: The boiling chips are to ensure smooth boiling by letting small vapour bubbles form within the porous chips.)

Safety Considerations:

As organic reactions often involve flammable organic compounds or solvents, the use of any naked flames should be avoided.

Refer to section on _Temperature control_ for some heat sources which can be used.

Distillation

Methods such as distillation can be considered a reaction setup even though it is usually used for isolation or purification.

For example, CH3CHCH2CH2OH

\begin{tabular}{l} \(\circ\) \\ heat with immediate \\ distillation \\ \end{tabular}

In the oxidation of butan-1-ol to butanal, the reaction occurs in the round bottom flask and the product, butanal, is immediately distilled out of the reaction mixture to prevent further oxidation. This is possible because the boiling point of butanal is lower than that of butan-1-ol.

Note: In the distillation setup, the Liebig condenser is fitted almost horizontally.

compounds and solvents are highly flammable.

The table below shows a _general guide_ to the temperatures attainable by the different heat sources. Images of these heat sources can be easily found on the Internet.

2. Isolation / SeparationIn this step, majority of the impurities will be removed.
* The technique of separation to be used depends on the type of mixture to be separated. This depends on the nature of the product and impurities. Separation of insoluble solid in a liquid : Fliltration Separation of two miscible liquids : Distillation Separation of two immiscible liquids : Extraction using separatory funnel
* separation of insoluble solid in a liquid**

1. Gravity filtration : This technique uses gravity to draw the filtrate through the filter paper, leaving the residue on the filter paper.
2. Vacuum filtration This technique uses vacuum (instead of gravity) to separate the filtrate from the residue
* separation of miscible liquids**

Simple distillation: If two liquids have boiling points that differ significantly (e.g. by at least 10 *C), it is usually possible to separate them by distillation. The mixture of the two liquids is heated such that the mixture boils. The lower boiling liquid will start to boil first and its vapour will rise from the liquid mixture. The vapour is led to the condenser where it condenses to the liquid state. The lower boiling liquid will be collected first since it boils at a lower boiling point. By repeating this process of distillation, two miscible liquids can be separated.

Fractional distillation: Introducing a fractionating column into the setup improves the separation between the liquids being distilled, especially when the liquids have similar boiling points. The fractionating column allows the process of distillation to be repeated a large number of times all at once. The vapour rises in the column and as it does so, the higher boiling liquid begins to condense and run down. With suitable adjustment of the heating rate, only the vapour of the lower boiling liquid reaches the side arm and enters the condenser. As the vapour travels up the column, the vapour becomes richer in the lower-boiling component since the higher boiling component condenses. On the other hand, as the liquid runs down the column, it becomes richer in the higher boiling component as the lower boiling component vaporises. This process of fractional distillation can repeat many times the process of boiling and condensing within the single piece of apparatus.

- separation of immiscible liquids**

Mixture of liquids which are immiscible (and with different densities) can be separated using a **separatory funnel** (refer to diagram below). The liquids will separate into layers in the separatory funnel, with the denser liquid at the bottom and the less dense liquid on top. With the stopper removed, the bottom layer is slowly released through the tap until the interface between the layers is just going through the tap. After discarding the interface, the top layer is then run out, from the top of the funnel, into another clean flask.

This technique is particularly useful in separating organic products from an aqueous reaction mixture. The cold reaction mixture is shaken with successive amounts of a water-immiscible organic solvent. Each time, the organic layer is run off and collected before fresh organic solvent is added. The organic product will distribute itself between water and organic solvent until equilibrium is reached, but more will dissolve in the organic layer. Two or three extractions with a suitable solvent will remove most of the organic product.

**IMPORTANT!** When the mixture is shaken in the separatory funnel, the pressure in the funnel should be periodically released. This is to avoid pressure build-up in the separatory funnel, especially if a gas is produced in the process. The pressure build-up will cause the stopper to be pushed out and the organic product might be lost.

In order to remove traces of residual water in the organic solvent, anhydrous reagents such as anhydrous MgSO\({}_{4}\) and anhydrous Na\({}_{2}\)SO\({}_{4}\) are used. These anhydrous salts absorb water found in the organic solvent and become hydrated, thereby removing the residual water.

The dehydrating agents can then be removed from the organic solvent via filtration.

## 3 Purification

The majority of impurities have been removed in the previous separation step. In this step, final traces of impurities will be removed.

* purification of liquids** If the intended organic product is a liquid, distillation can be used as a means of purification.
* purification of solids** The key feature of this technique is that
* the solubility of the desired product increases with increasing temperature in a particular solvent, **AND** the impurities are soluble in the solvent at all temperatures

\begin{tabular}{c|c|c|}  & **Solubility in** \\  & **hot solvent** & **cold solvent** \\ \hline \end{tabular}

\begin{tabular}{c|c|c|}  & **Solid product** & **Yes** & **No** \\ \hline \end{tabular}

\begin{tabular}{c|c|c|}  & **Solid product** & **Yes** & **No** \\ \hline \end{tabular}
General procedure (in this case, the solvent used is water)

1. Transfer the crude mixture into a 50 cm\({}^{3}\) conical flask _(not beaker)_ with a few boiling chips.
2. Add about 5 cm\({}^{3}\) (small amount) of water into the flask and place it on a heating plate.
3. When the mixture is boiling and the crude mixture does not dissolve, add water slowly to the mixture until the crude mixture just dissolves.
4. Remove the flask from the heating plate and allow it to cool to room temperature slowly before cooling in an ice-water bath. Crystals will grow as the mixture is cooled.
5. Filter the cooled mixture (e.g. using vacuum filtration) and wash the residue (product) with cold deionised water to remove the impurities.
6. Dry the residue under the Infrared lamp.

## 4 Identification

In this step, the identity and purity of the purified product with be determined.

\begin{tabular}{|c|l|} \hline
**Identity** & 
\begin{tabular}{l} Determined through Infra-red spectroscopy and NMR spectroscopy \\ (data is available in the A level _Data Booklet_) \\ \end{tabular} \\ \hline
**Purity** & 
\begin{tabular}{l} The melting point of a solid or the boiling point of a liquid can be used to ascertain its purity. For \\ a pure compound, it should melt or boil over a narrow temperature range (-1*C) \\ \end{tabular} \\ \hline
**Measurement of melting point**: \\ \end{tabular}

A pure solid will melt over a very small temperature range. If there are impurities present, then the solid will gradually melt over a temperature range (a few degrees Celsius).

Method:

A small sample of the dry solid is placed in a melting point tube and the temperature is raised very gradually. The temperature at which the solid melts, i.e. the temperature when the crystalline solid structure collapses and a meniscus is formed in the sample tube, is recorded as the melting point of the solid.

Methyl cinnamate can be prepared from cinnamic acid and methanol.

(a) 10.8 g of cinnamic acid was reacted with 30 cm\({}^{3}\) of methanol, which was in excess, together with about 8 to 10 drops of concentrated sulfuric acid. The volume of methanol used was about 10 times more than the actual volume needed as a reactant. The addition of concentrated sulfuric acid to the mixture was highly exothermic.

The reaction mixture was then heated underneath for about five hours before the unreacted methanol was recovered by distillation.

* **Worked Example 7

Aspirin was one of the first drugs to be produced synthetically and is one of the most widely used 'over-the-counter' drugs in the world. It is a white solid and is prepared by an acylation reaction between 2-hydroxybenzeencarboxylic acid and ethanoic anhydride.

HOCeHACO2H (CH3CO)2O CH3CO2C6HACO2H

2-hydroxybenzeencarboxylic acid ethanoic anhydride aspirin

2-Hydroxybenzeencarboxylic acid is a white crystalline solid.

Ethanoic anhydride is a corrosive liquid which has a density of 1.08 g cm\({}^{-3}\).

Pure aspirin has a melting point of 135 *C.

Like most organic reactions, the yield of this reaction is less than 100%. Using the procedure described below, a typical yield of pure aspin is/1.5%.

Equinolai amounts of 2-hydroxybenzeencarboxylic acid and ethanoic anhydride are used, together with about 8-10 drops of 85% phospholipid acid which catalyses the reaction. When mixing the reactants, the initial reaction may be/voleni.

* **"cool acid and anhydride in ice bath 4 mixing, dropwise addition of phosphoric acid while mixing**

The reaction mixture is then heated under full-conditions for a carotofit/elements. About 25.3cm of water is then added to the hot reaction mixture to hydrolyse any unreacted enthalonic anhydride. The addition of this water may cause the mixture to foil

Once the reaction has subsided, the reaction is poured into about 50 cm\({}^{-3}\) of cold water. This causes the aspirin to precipitate. The crude aspirin product is purified by recrystallisation from water;

**Calculate ant of carboxylic acid and anhydride 10.9 of aspirin.**

- **75% purity**

You may assume that you are provided with:

* round bottom flask,
* condenser,
* heating mantle,
* thermometer,
* the apparatus and chemicals normally found in a school or college laboratory

In your plan you should include brief details of:

* the apparatus you would use,
* the quantities you would use,

_Apparatus - reflux setup, electronic balance (mass measurement of carboxylic acid), measuring cylinder (volume measurement of anhydride), beakers, conical flasks for crystallization._

_Mass of carboxylic acid from pre-calculation_

_Volume of anhydride from pre-calculation_* a fully-labelled diagram of the set-up you would use, how you would ensure that the reaction is conducted under the appropriate condition;
* how you would purify the aspirin and check the purity of your sample.

Pre-calculations:

Amt of aspirin = 10 / 180 = 0.05556 mol

Amt of 2-hydroxybenzeneecarboxylic acid required

= Amt of ethanoic anhydride

= 0.05556 x 100/75

= 0.07408 mol

Mass of 2-hydroxybenzenecarboxylic acid required

= 0.07408 x 138 = 10.2 g (3 s.f.)

Mass of ethanoic anhydride required

= 0.07408 x 102

= 7.56 g (3 s.f.)

Procedure:

1. Using an electronic balance, weigh out accurately about 10.2 g of 2-hydroxybenzenecarboxylic acid in a round bottom flask.
2. In a fumehood, measure out 7 cm\({}^{3}\) of ethanoic anhydride using a 10 cm\({}^{3}\) measuring cylinder and add the anhydride to the round bottom flask while stirring with a glass rod. _(Note: As the anhydride is a corrosive liquid, it is not safe to take its mass on a weighing balance. Instead, its volume, which can be determined from its density and the mass calculated, is used.)_
3. Cool the reaction mixture in an ice bath placed inside a fumehood until the mixture is cold.
4. Using a dropper, add 8-10 drops of 85% phosphoric acid to the mixture carefully, swirling the flask after every drop.
5. Set up the apparatus for reflux as shown. Heat the mixture under reflux for 15 minutes.
6. Detach the flask from the set-up. Using a dropper, add 2-3 cm\({}^{3}\) of water dropwise to the mixture, swirling constantly. If the mixture becomes too hot, stop adding water. Cool in an ice bath before further addition of water.
7. When the reaction has subsided, pour the mixture into a beaker containing 50 cm\({}^{3}\) of cold water. Filter the crude product that is precipitated.
8. Transfer the residue into a small beaker. Carefully add hot water dropwise and stir until the aspirin just dissolves. A minimal volume of hot water should be used.
9. Let the mixture cool to room temperature. Crystals will start to grow as the solution cools. Cool the mixture further in an ice bath to ensure all the aspirin has crystallised. Filter and dry the residue to obtain pure aspirin.
10. Weigh the dried aspirin.
11. To test the purity, collect some crystals and determine the melting point. If the aspirin is pure, the melting point should be very close to 135 "C and the melting should be completed within a very small temperature range.
