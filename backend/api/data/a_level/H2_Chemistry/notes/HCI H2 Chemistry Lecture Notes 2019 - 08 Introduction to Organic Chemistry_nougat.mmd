* [2] John McMurry, _Organic Chemistry_, 8th Ed., Brooks/Cole, Chapter 2In this extension topic, we will see how the fundamental concepts learnt in previous topics can be applied onto the area of organic chemistry. The study of organic chemistry in the A-Level syllabus is based on the chemistry of different functional groups. Besides the first two general topics on Introduction and Isomerism, each topic in organic chemistry will cover one functional group: its nature, physical properties, chemical reactivity, reactions and mechanisms. There are a total of ten topics in organic chemistry, six of which is covered in year 1 and another four to be covered in year 2.

To make sense of the properties of the many organic compounds and reactions, it is useful to understand that the nature and reactivity of all functional groups can be explained in terms of **structure and bonding concepts**, in particular, atomic orbitals, hybridization, covalent bonding, intermolecular forces and electronegativity. The reactions and mechanisms can be understood on the basis of both **thermodynamic** and **kinetic considerations**, for example, bond energies, transition states, intermediates, rate equations and orders of reaction as well as fundamental concepts of stoichiometry, redox and acid-base reactions. Each functional group (and hence each topic) should also not be studied in isolation. It is important, during our study of organic chemistry, to understand how each functional group is related to each other via functional group inter-conversions.

In the mid-1700s, when chemistry was evolving into a modern science, unexplainable differences were noted between substances obtained from living sources and those obtained from minerals. The Swedish chemist Torbern Bergman in 1770 was the first to express this difference between organic and "inorganic" substances and the term organic chemistry soon came to mean the chemistry of compounds found in living organisms.

To many chemists at that time, they believed that organic compounds must contain a "vital force" as a result of their origin in living forces, and could not be prepared or manipulated in the laboratory, making them different from inorganic compounds. However, this theory of Vitalism suffered two major blows when in 1816, Michael Chevreul discovered that an organic compound (fat) could be converted to another (fatty acids and glycerin) without the intervention of an outside "vital force"; and in 1828, Friedrich Wohler discovered that the "organic" substance found in human urine, urea, could be synthesized by heating ammonium cyanate, an "inorganic" salt. This observation demonstrated for the very first time, that an organic compound could be synthesized from an inorganic source, which led eventually to the rejection of Vitalism as a scientific theory.

Today, chemistry is unified and the same principles that explain inorganic compounds explain the organic ones as well. The only distinguishing characteristic of organic compounds is that all contain the element carbon.

### Types of Formulae

Empirical formula
* simplest formula that shows the ratio of number of atoms of the elements present in one molecule.

Molecular formula
* shows the actual number of atoms of the elements present in one molecule

For example, the empirical formula and molecular formula for lactic acid are CH\({}_{2}\)O and C\({}_{3}\)H\({}_{6}\)O\({}_{3}\) respectively; ethanol has its empirical formula same as its molecular formula, C\({}_{2}\)H\({}_{6}\)O.

### Overview of Functional Groups

Functional groups are part of a larger molecule and are composed of an atom or a group of atoms that have special chemical properties and which define the chemistry of that organic compound.

All molecules containing the same functional group can be considered as members of the same family and have similar properties. More about the various functional groups will be covered in the relevant topics. (Note: R typically represents alkyl and aryl groups in organic chemistry. The terms are explained below.)

### Some terms to be familiar with:

* An alkyl group is a substituent group derived from an alkane by removal of a hydrogen atom:
* An aryl group is a functional group that is derived from an aromatic ring (such as a benzene ring) by removal of a hydrogen atom. (An example of an aryl group is the phenyl group, represented by

\end{table}
Table 1: Examples of alkyl groups* Many organic compounds are classified as primary (19), secondary (29), tertiary (39) or quarternary (49) depending on how many substituent groups (usually alkyl) are joined to the carbon atom which the functional group is attached to, or the nitrogen atom in the case of amines. Using the example of amines, we can see that primary, secondary, tertiary and quarternary amines have one, two, three and four alkyl groups attached to the nitrogen atom. Similarly, primary, secondary, tertiary alcohols have one, two and three alkyl groups attached to the hydroxyl carbon (respectively).

Homologous series of organic compounds is a family of compounds containing the same functional group, and in which each successive member increases by one =CH2 unit.

Compounds of the same homologous series:

1. can be represented by the same general molecular formula
2. can usually be prepared by similar methods
3. show a gradual change in physical properties as molar mass increases
4. have similar chemical properties

### Surfix

The suffix gives the principal functional group in the compound. If more than one functional group is present, the highest priority functional group is named as the suffix according to the following hierarchy:

Figure 1: The stem is normally the name of an aliphatic or alicyclic hydrocarbon. All other compounds are regarded as being derived from these parent hydrocarbons by the replacement of hydrogen atoms by alkyl or other groups. The stem takes its name according to:

The prefix is used to denote any substituent in an organic compound: The main prefixes are shown in the summary table on pages 13 and 14.

* all groups substitute one H atom except the 'oxo' groups which substitute two.
* the carbon number in the stem to which the substituent is attached is written in front of the prefix.
* if there is more than one prefix, the prefixes are placed in **alphabetical order**.
* Recall on page 8, the prefixes methyl, ethyl, propyl and butyl etc. are used to indicate alkyl groups as substituents.

Step 1: Determine the principal functional group in the compound (if present). If more than one functional group is present, the principal functional group is the one with highest priority. Other functional groups will be named as substituents.

Step 2: Find and name the longest continuous carbon chain in which the principal functional group occurs (if present) as the parent chain. Any side-chains will be named as substituents.

Step 3: Number the chain consecutively, starting at the end nearer the principal functional group. If there is no functional group, start at the end nearer the first substituent.

Step 4: Identify and name groups attached to this chain. If the same functional group or substituent occurs more than once, indicate using proper multipliers (eg. di-, tri-, tetra-, penta-, etc). Designate the location of each functional group / substituent using the appropriate locants if necessary.

Step 5: Assemble the name consisting of prefix(es), stem and suffix, using commas to separate the numbers and hyphens to join letters and numbers. Substituent groups are listed in alphabetical order. Multipliers are not used for alphabetization purposes (i.e. ethyl before dimethyl). Add any stereochemical identifier(s) at the front of the name if applicable.

In the later topics of Organic Chemistry, we will look at how to name compounds containing specific functional groups, using the above IUPAC rules.

Figure 1: The principal functional group in the compound (if present). If more than one functional group is present, the principal functional group is the one with highest priority. Other functional groups will be named as substituents.

### Types of organic reactions

Figure 11: **The \(\alpha\)-\(\beta\) reaction in which a molecule is split into two by bigger molecule, with the elimination of a small molecule such as water or HC_I_ etc. Note that condensation is **not** the same as elimination.

### Mechanisms of organic reactions

The mechanism of a reaction is a detailed description of which bonds break, which bonds form, and in what order these processes occur. Since bonds are shared electrons, the mechanism of a reaction essentially describes the electron rearrangements that happen as reactants are converted to products.

Recall in Topic 6 Reaction Kinetics, we learnt that a reaction mechanism should be consistent with the reaction stoichiometry, the rate law and with all other available experimental data, such as the stereochemical course of the reaction and the isolation or detection of any reactive intermediates. However, a proposed mechanism is only a postulate and can be extended, altered or completely reconstructed as a result of new evidence.

Most mechanisms in organic chemistry can be represented by a series of labelled diagrams in which plausible electron rearrangements in the particles are shown using the curly arrow notation through a sequence of steps.

#### 3.2.1 Polar mechanisms

Other than free radical substitution (to be taught in Topic 10 Alkanes), most organic reaction mechanisms in the A-level syllabus are polar mechanisms. In polar mechanisms, the bond breaking and forming processes are heterolytic, involving movement of electron pairs.

The curly arrow notation: rather than using dot-and-cross diagrams, it is more common to represent the movement of electrons using curly arrows. We also usually draw displayed formulae to show bonds that are broken and formed in the reaction and condensed formulae for the rest of the species:

Figure 7: Heterolytic bond breaking of C–Cl bond in chloromethane

### Electrophiles

An electrophile is an electron-deficient species that accepts an electron pair from an electron-rich species in a reaction to form a new covalent bond. Electrophiles possess either a positively-charged centre (e.g. CH\({}_{3}\), Br\({}^{+}\), NO\({}_{2}^{+}\), H\({}^{+}\)) of an atom which can carry an induced or permanent partial positive charge "6+" (e.g. polarised Br\({}_{2}\), HBr).

### Nucleophiles

A nucleophile is a species that donates an electron pair to an electron-deficient species in a reaction to form a new covalent bond. All nucleophiles possess electrons that can be shared e.g. lone pairs of electrons with or without a negative charge (H\({}_{2}\)O, NH\({}_{3}\), OH\({}^{+}\), CN\({}^{-}\)), a \(\pi\) bond (e.g. ethene, benzene) or a partial negative charge "6-" (CH\({}_{3}\)Li).

In the above example, OH\({}^{+}\) is the nucleophile and CH\({}_{3}\)Br is the electrophile as OH\({}^{+}\) donates a lone pair of electrons to the electron-deficient carbon atom in CH\({}_{3}\)Br. Recall that according to the Lewis Theory of acids and bases (Topic 4 Reactions and Stoichiometry), Lewis acids are species that accept an electron pair and Lewis bases are species that donate an electron pair. This theory can be applied to the reaction above, where OH\({}^{+}\) is the Lewis base and CH\({}_{3}\)Br is the Lewis acid.

#### 3.2.2 Non-polar mechanisms

We will encounter non-polar mechanisms when we study free radical substitution in Topic 10 Alkanes. In non-polar mechanisms, the bond breaking and forming processes are homolytic, involving movement of single electrons rather than electron pairs.

#### 3.2.2 Non-polar mechanisms

We will encounter non-polar mechanisms when we study free radical substitution in Topic 10 Alkanes. In non-polar mechanisms, the bond breaking and forming processes are homolytic, involving movement of single electrons rather than electron pairs.

#### 3.2.3 Reaction Intermediates

In Topic 6 Reaction Kinetics, we learnt that reaction intermediates are species that are formed in one of the steps of the reaction mechanism and are consumed in later steps. The energy minimum represents an intermediate in the reaction pathway. An **intermediate** is a definite species that exists for a finite length of time. It may be stable and thus isolated, or it may be reactive and short-lived (\(\sim\)10\({}^{-5}\) s), but nonetheless detectable. In contrast, a **transition state** is a hypothetical species that exists only during the time that the reactants are in contact with each other (\(\sim\)10\({}^{-15}\) s) and thus cannot be isolated. Transition states correspond to the highest energy (or energies) along the reaction pathway.

## 4 INDUCTIVE, RESONANANCE AND.STER EFFECTS

Inductive and resonance effects are two types of electronic effects (i.e. effects that influence the distribution of electrons in a particular chemical species, and hence the reactivity of the species itself) that some atoms or functional groups can have within a chemical species.

### Inductive Effect (Polarisation)

The inductive effect refers to the polarisation of the electron density in a bond due to the electronegativity of nearby atoms.

The inductive effect:

Is a permanent but weak effect

Can be electron-donating or electron-withdrawing

Occurs through \(\alpha\) bonds

Is distance dependent (becomes weaker the further you get from the influencing functional group)

The electronegative atoms involved in the functional groups below all inductively withdraw electron density from the carbon, as shown by its resulting partial positive charge.

Here, the arrow represents the _electron-withdrawing_ effect through the sigma bond. We say that -CI, -CHO, and -CN are inductively electron-withdrawing groups.

Alkyl groups are considered inductively electron-donating groups, as they can increase the electron density in nearby atoms.

Here, the positive charge on the carbon atom is stabilised by the action of the electron-donating alkyl groups. (Which do you think is more stable?)

_Note: the actual reason that deals with hyperconjugation will not be covered here_

Where have we seen the inductive effect before?

Any time you encounter a polar covalent bond, you are essentially seeing the inductive effect at work.

The charge separation that results from the difference in electronegativity of the atoms in the bond is a result of an inductive effect!
### Resonance (Delocalisation)

Resonance occurs when re electrons are allowed to flow through the overlap of neighbouring \(p\) orbitals. Such electrons are said to be delocalised.

Influence of resonance (sometimes called mesomeric effect):

Is a permanent effect

Can be electron-donating or electron-withdrawing

Occurs through n-system, which must be in a plane

Independent of distance

The amide functional group exhibits resonance. The nitrogen atom can donate its lone pair of electrons into the overlapping system of \(p\) orbitals, effectively increasing the electron density in the adjacent carbonyl group (C=O) by delocalisation of electrons (i.e. resonance).

Where have we seen resonance before?

In the chapter on Chemical Bonding, we saw that some species can have more than one equivalent Lewis structure: Each of these structures is called a'resonance structure', and the actual species' characteristics are a mix of each individual resonance structure.

### Distinguishing Tests

A distinguishing test is a simple chemical test that aims to confirm the presence of a particular compound, or differentiate between organic compounds, through the identification of certain key functional groups. Such tests require a **detectable chemical change** (e.g. colour change, appearance of precipitate, evolution of a gas, etc.) and are usually quick tests carried out in test tubes (unlike in synthesis) with minimal use of complicated set-up or equipment (unlike that for reflux).

Figure 10: **Planning an experiment involving distinguishing tests**

### Synthesis

An organic synthesis generally involves carrying out a reaction to form the desired product with reasonable yield and purity. Various strategies are therefore used in syntheses to obtain maximum yield and good purity. This usually involves careful sequencing of steps, controlled reaction conditions, complex set-up and/or equipment, and often, the investment of time. The product must also be isolated (i.e. separated from the reaction mixture) and purified.

The different stages in an organic synthesis are:

* Carrying out the reaction by heating the reaction mixture under reflux.
* Separation and purification by filtration, use of separating funnel, distillation and/or recrystallization.
* Checking of purity by determining the melting or boiling point.

### Carrying out the reaction

Compared to inorganic reactions between ionic compounds in solutions, organic reactions are generally slow (as such reactions involve breaking of covalent bonds) so the organic reaction mixture needs to be heated for some time. You will be learning many reactions that involve heating reagents under reflux in the A-level organic chemistry syllabus.

Heating under reflux means to heat a flask so that the solvent boils continually. A condenser is placed vertically in the neck of the flask to condense the solvent vapour. This method allows the temperature of the reaction mixture to be kept at the boiling point of the solvent, while minimizing the loss of reactants or products due to evaporation.
