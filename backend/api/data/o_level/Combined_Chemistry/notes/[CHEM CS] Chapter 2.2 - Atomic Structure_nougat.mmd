**Proton number:** The total **number of protons** in an atom (number of electrons as well)

**Nucleon number:** The total **number of protons and neutrons** in the nucleus of an atom

Identity of an element is dependent on its proton number, not its nucleon number.

_To review later: Isotopes_Formation of Positive Ions

When atoms that lose electrons, there are now more protons than eleztrons, hence they become positively charged. They would become a **cation**.

The sodium atom achieves a stable electronic configuration by losing one electron. It becomes a sodium cation with a charge of +1 and is written as Na\({}^{+}\).

FORMATION OF NEGATIVE IONS

When atoms gain electrons, there are more electrons than protons now, they become negative ions, called an **anion**. Negative

The chlorine atom fully completes its valence shell by gaining one electron. It is now a chlorine anion with a charge of -1 and is also written as Cl:.

Isotopes are atoms of the same element that have the same amount of protons and electrons but different amount of neutrons.

Isotopes of an element have same chemical properties, as they have **the same amount of electrons**. Hence, they will undergo the same chemical reactions to form compounds with the same chemical formula. (Recall electronic configuration)

However, isotopes will have **differences in physical properties** as having **different amount of neutrons** means that they have slightly different masses. This would also affect other physical properties like their density.

SAME CHEMICAL PROPERTIES

 DIFFERENT PHYSICAL PROPERTIESCase Study: Chlorine mass: 35.5

Chlorine mass on the periodic table is 35.5.

Does it mean it has 35.5 proton + neutron?

**The answer? No.**

Chlorine exists as chlorine-35 and chlorine-37 atoms. There are more chlorine-35 atoms however.

The final **atomic mass** seen on the periodic table is the sum of **atomic mass/percentage abundance of all the isotopes** of chlorine.

Represented by calculation:

35 x 75% + 37 x 25% = _35.5 (average mass)_

Hence, chlorine's Ar is 35.5.

**note**

**Understanding isotopes**

**Atomic mass is an average mass of the element's isotopes**

By taking into account the percentage composition of the different isotopes and their respective masses, the periodic table displays that calculated average atomic mass.**

Case study: Chlorine's Ar is 35.5
