#### 1.3.2 Dative Bonding/Co-ordinate Bonding

Usually, a covalent bond consists of each atom contributing one electron for sharing. It is also possible for just one of the atoms involved to provide **both** bonding electrons to form a covalent bond.

The **donor atom** provides two electrons (from a **lone pair of electrons**) to an **acceptor atom**. The acceptor must contain an **empty valence orbital**. This kind of bonding is called **dative bonding** or **co-ordinate bonding**. Dative bonds are represented by arrows "\(\rightarrow\)" showing which way the lone pair is donated.

The dative bond, once formed, is not different from any other covalent bond i.e. has the same bond strength as a normal covalent bond.

**Example 1**

When gaseous ammonia and gaseous boron trifluoride react with each other, a white solid is formed, with the formula NH\({}_{3}\)BF\({}_{3}\). The nitrogen atom in ammonia has a lone pair, and the boron atom in boron trifluoride has an empty 2p orbital.

**Example 2**

When gaseous ammonia and gaseous hydrogen chloride react, the white solid ammonium chloride is formed. The lone pair of electrons on the nitrogen atom of ammonia has formed a dative bond with the hydrogen atom of the hydrogen chloride molecule.

At the same time, the H-C_I_ bond breaks and the electrons in the H-C_I_ bond form a fourth lone pair on the chlorine atom, giving rise to a chloride ion.

All four N-H bonds are exactly the same. It is not possible to tell which one is a dative bond.

#### 1.5.2 Bond Strength

The strength of a covalent bond is measured by its **bond energy**. The **stronger** the covalent bond, the **higher** the bond energy.

 Bond energy is the **amount of energy** required to break **one mole of covalent bonds** in the **gaseous state**.

_e.g._ C_k_(g) \(\to\) 2C_l_(g)

Energy is **released** during bond **formation** (i.e. this is an **exothermic** reaction)

Energy is **absorbed** during bond **breaking** (i.e. this is an **endothermic** reaction)

The strength of covalent bonds is generally dependent on the following factors:

* **bond order** i.e. number of covalent bonds formed between two atoms
* **effectiveness of orbital overlap**
* **bond polarity**

(i) Bond order

As bond order **increases**, the **number of bonding electrons within the inter-nuclei region increases**. Hence, the **electrostatic forces of attraction for these electrons increases**.

 bond order & types of bond

1 & single

2 & double

3 & triple

**Example:** Strength of covalent bond: C-C & C=C & C=C

C-C & C=C

bond energy / kJ mol-1 & 350 & 610 & 840

bond length / nm & 0.154 & 0.134 & 0.120

(ii) Effectiveness of orbital overlap

Generally, **larger orbitals are more diffuse**, which results in **less effective orbital overlap**. Hence, bonds formed by **larger atoms** will tend to have **lower bond strength (bond energy)**.

**Example:** Trend of bond energies of some Group 17 elements

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|} \hline  & bond energy / kJ mol-1 \\ \hline C_l_-C_l_ & 244 \\ \hline Br-Br & 193 \\ \hline I-I & 151 \\ \hline \end{tabular}

Eunoa Junior College3. **Bond polarity** (i.e. unequal sharing of electrons in a covalent bond) In a polar bond, there are **additional attractive forces between the 8+ and 8-** that **strengthens the covalent bond**, leading to **higher bond strength**. The **more polar** the bond, the **stronger** the bond. This factor of bond polarity only comes into play when bonds have **comparable** bond order and effectiveness of orbital overlap.

**Example:**

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|} \hline  & bond energy / kJ mol\({}^{-1}\) & bond length / nm \\ \hline C\(\equiv\)O & 1070 & 0.113 \\ \hline N\(\equiv\)N & 994 & 0.110 \\ \hline \end{tabular} CO and N\({}_{2}\) have similar bond lengths. However, the C\(\equiv\)O bond is polar while the N\(\equiv\)N is not, leading to the C\(\equiv\)O bond having higher bond strength.

#### Bond Length

Bond length is the **average distance** between the **nuclei of two atoms**.

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|} \hline  & bond energy / kJ mol\({}^{-1}\) \\ \hline H-C\(l\) & 431 \\ \hline H-Br & 366 \\ \hline H-I & 299 \\ \hline \end{tabular} Because of the **decrease** in the effectiveness of orbital overlap between the hydrogen atom and halogen atom, the bond length **increases**, and the bond strength (bond energy) **decreases**.

In summary, when

1. **bond order increases** or
2. **effectiveness of orbital overlap increases** or
3. **polarity of bond increases**

**bond length decreases and bond strength (bond energy) increases**.

**Example 15**: As F is smaller than _CI_, we would expect that F-F should have more effective overlap of orbitals and hence a stronger bond. However, based on the bond energy values, _CI-CI_ is in fact a stronger bond. Suggest why this is so.

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|} \hline  & bond energy / kJ mol\({}^{-1}\) & atomic radius / nm \\ \hline F-F & 158 & 0.072 \\ C_I-CI_ & 244 & 0.099 \\ \hline \end{tabular}

As the F atom is very small, the F-F bond length is very short. This results in the non-bonding electrons on F being in close proximity with those of the other F atom. Thus, repulsion occurs which weakens the covalent bond. This phenomenon happens in small molecules such as F\({}_{2}\) and O\({}_{2}\).

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|} \hline Checkpoint \\ \hline I know that all chemical bonds are basically electrostatic forces of attraction. \\ \hline I know the definition of a covalent bond. \\ \hline I know how sigma and pi bonds are formed, and how they lead to the formation of single, double and triple bonds. \\ \hline I know what dative bonding is, identify when it is formed, and how to represent it. \\ \hline I am able to identify if a bond is polar or non-polar. \\ \hline I am able to use the 3 factors (bond order, effectiveness of orbital overlap or bond polarity) to explain differences in bond strength/bond energy.

### 1.6 Representing Covalent Bonding

* [label=LO(0)]
* Describe, including the use of 'dot-and-cross' diagrams:
* [label=(0)] (ii) covalent bonding, as in hydrogen; oxygen; nitrogen; chlorine; hydrogen chloride; carbon dioxide; methane; ethene (iii) co-ordinate (dative covalent) bonding, as in formation of the ammonium ion and in the A\({}_{\delta}\)C\({}_{\delta}\) molecule.

When an atom forms bonds with other atoms, normally only electrons in the **valence shell** are involved. When looking at bonding in _simple terms_, we can ignore the distinction between the various types of orbitals (s, p, d, _etc._) in a shell and consider all electrons in the valence shell as a group.

If an atom has more than one electron in its valence shell, it can form more than one covalent bond with other atoms. For example, the beryllium atom (1s\({}^{2}\) 2s\({}^{2}\)) has a pair of 2s electrons. When forming a compound such as beryllium hydride, BeH\({}_{2}\), these electrons can unpair themselves and form two bonds with two hydrogen atoms:

The boron atom (1s\({}^{2}\) 2s\({}^{2}\) 2p\({}^{1}\)) can form three bonds as exemplified by boron hydride, BH\({}_{3}\), while the carbon atom (1s\({}^{2}\) 2s\({}^{2}\) 2p\({}^{2}\)) with four electrons in its valence shell can form four bonds as in methane, CH\({}_{4}\), shown above.

Bonding diagrams often only show the electrons in the valence shell, omitting the inner shells.

**How to draw dot-and-cross diagrams for species containing covalent bonds**

* [label=Step 0]
* Identify the **central atom** in the **chemical formula**. The central atom is _usually_ the atom with the **lowest electronegativity (except H)**.
* Determine the **number of valence electrons (by group number)** for each atom.
* For an **anion**, **add electron(s)** to the **more electronegative** atom (F, O, C\(l\), N). For a **cation**, **remove electron(s)** from the **less electronegative** atom.
* Determine the **type of bond formed** (single, double, triple or dative) between the central atom and its neighbouring atoms through sharing of valence electrons to achieve **noble gas electronic configurations**. Use **dots** and **crosses** on **alternate atoms**.
* Arrange the **remaining valence electrons (not involved in bonding) in pairs**. These electrons are known as **lone pairs of electrons** (non-bonding electrons).
* Check that each atom achieves a **stable noble gas configuration** (_ideal case_, but sometimes, the central atom does not achieve this). **Elements from period 3 onwards can expand octet** i.e. have more than 8 electrons around the atom (see Note on next page for the reason why). If the central atom cannot expand octet, consider changing a double bond to a dative bond.

## 2 Shape and Polarity

In a polyatomic species, the valence electron pairs of each atom, both bond pairs and lone pairs, repel one another to be as far as possible from each other. Hence, covalent molecules and polyatomic ions possess a definite, unique, three-dimensional shape which is determined by the angles between the bonds within them.

### The Valence Shell Electron Pair Repulsion (VSEPR) Theory

The Valence Shell Electron Pair Repulsion (VSEPR) theory is used to predict the shape of a molecule or ion. The two general principles of VSEPR theory are:

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|} \hline
**Principle 1** & **Electron pairs** (bond pairs and lone pairs) around a central atom are arranged **as** **far apart as possible** so as to **minimise repulsion**. \\ \hline

Multiple bonds contain both \(\sigma\) and \(\pi\) bonds. But for the purpose of VSEPR, they are assumed to **occupy only one region of electron density**.

Consider the carbon in CO\({}_{2}\) (O=C=O):

The central C atom is doubly bonded to each of the O atoms and is surrounded by just **two electron regions**. It is therefore predicted to be linear.

**Comparing the Polarities of NH\({}_{3}\) and NF\({}_{3}\) (for enrichment)**

Despite the differences in electronegativities between N and H, and between N and F, being similar, NH\({}_{3}\) has a much higher dipole moment compared to NF\({}_{3}\).

This is because dipoles are induced not just in polar bonds, but also in lone pairs of electrons. The lone pair of electrons is an area of negative charge, so it forms the \(\delta-\) end of a dipole which points away from the positively charged nucleus of the atom.

In NH\({}_{3}\), the dipole due to the lone pair helps reinforce the dipoles from the N-H bonds, resulting in a highly polar molecule. However, in the case of NF\({}_{3}\), this dipole partially offsets the dipole due to the N-F bonds, resulting in a smaller resultant dipole.

Intermolecular Forces of Attraction

The covalently bonded molecules we have looked at so far have **simple molecular structures**.

Substances made up of such molecules are often gases or liquids at room temperature. This is because, although the **intramolecular** covalent bonds _within_ each molecule are very strong, the **intramolecular forces of attraction**_between_ one molecule and another are comparatively weaker and require less energy to overcome.

There are three main categories of intermolecular forces of attraction:

* **instantaneous dipole-induced dipole interactions**
* **permanent dipole-permanent dipole interactions**
* **hydrogen bonding**

* intermolecular forces, based on permanent and induced dipoles, as in CHC Is(I); Brz(I) and the liquid noble gases
* hydrogen bonding, using ammonia and water as examples of molecules containing -NH and -OH groups

### Instantaneous Dipole-Induced Dipole Interactions

Temporary fluctuations in the electron distributions within atoms and non-polar molecules could result in the formation of short-lived **instantaneous dipoles**, which produce attractive forces between otherwise non-polar substances. These attractive interactions are weak and fall off rapidly with increasing distance.

Consider a pair of adjacent He atoms:

* On average, the two electrons in each He atom are uniformly distributed within the atom. However, because the electrons are in constant motion, their distribution in one atom is likely to be _asymmetrical_ at any given instant, resulting in an **instantaneous dipole** that lasts in the order of 10-16 seconds:
* As shown above, the instantaneous dipole on one atom can interact with the electrons in an adjacent atom, pulling them towards the positive end of the instantaneous dipole or repelling them from the negative end. The net effect is that the first atom causes the **temporary** formation of a dipole, called an **induced dipole**, in the second. Interactions between these temporary dipoles cause atoms to be attracted to one another.
* An instant later, the first atom might change its dipole through another movement of electrons within it, so the original dipole attraction might be destroyed. This changed dipole will induce new dipoles in another neighbouring atom, however, and so new intermolecular forces of attraction will be formed.

Similar interactions are formed between molecules such as hydrogen gas.

The **strength of instantaneous dipole-induced dipole interactions** is related to the ease of polarisation of the electron cloud in an atom or molecule (i.e. their **polarisability**)

The polarisability of the electron cloud of a substance depends on:

* **Number of electrons*
* When a molecule has **more electrons**, it will have a **bigger and more polarisable electron cloud**.
* This leads to **stronger** instantaneous dipole-induced dipole interactions, which requires **more energy** to overcome.

### Hydrogen Bonding

When a **hydrogen atom is bonded to a very electronegative atom such as nitrogen, oxygen, or fluorine**, it will have a significant partial positive charge (\(\delta+\)). Hence, this hydrogen atom with a large \(\delta+\) can experience a particularly strong attraction to a **lone pair of electrons on a nitrogen, oxygen, or fluorine atom** in an adjacent molecule. An intermolecular attractive force called a **hydrogen bond** is thus created.

Hydrogen bond is defined as the **electrostatic forces of attraction** between the **partial positive** (\(\delta+\)) **hydrogen atom that is directly bonded to a very electronegative F, O or N atom and a **lone pair of electrons** of another F, O or N atom.

While the name "hydrogen bond" makes such an electrostatic force of interaction sound like it is a type of covalent bond, it is not. In fact, hydrogen bonds are about 10 times weaker than a typical covalent bond.

Hydrogen bonds are represented by dotted lines between the \(\delta+\) hydrogen and the lone pair of electrons on a very electronegative element (F, O, N).

Intermolecular Forces of Attraction

Generally, for molecules with similar number of electrons, the relative strengths of intermolecular forces of attraction are in the order of:

\begin{tabular}{|p{113.8pt}|p{113.8pt}|p{113.8pt}|p{113.8pt}|p{113.8pt}|} \hline
**hydrogen bonds** & **permanent dipole- permanent dipole interactions** & **instantaneous dipole- induced dipole interactions** \\ \hline \end{tabular}

This has implications on physical properties, such as boiling points of covalent compounds.

In the examples below, the compounds are grouped together by similar number of electrons. This implies that the instantaneous dipole-induced dipole interactions will be similar in strength within each grouping.

\begin{tabular}{|p{113.8pt}|p{113.8pt}|p{113.8pt}|p{113.8pt}|} \hline
**compound** & **formula** & **polarity** & **type of IMF** & **no. of electrons** & **boiling point / \({}^{\circ}\)C** \\ \hline ethane & CH3-CH3 & non-polar & id-id & 18 & -89 \\ \hline methanal & H-C-H & polar & pd-pd & 16 & -19 \\ \hline methanol & CH3-OH & polar & hydrogen bonding & 18 & +65 \\ \hline propane & CH3-CH2-CH3 & non-polar & id-id & 26 & -42 \\ \hline ethanal & CH3-C-H & polar & pd-pd & 24 & +20 \\ \hline ethanol & CH3-CH2-OH & polar & hydrogen bonding & 26 & +79 \\ \hline butane & CH3-CH2-CH2-CH3 & non-polar & id-id & 34 & 0 \\ \hline propanal & CH3-CH2-C & polar & pd-pd & 32 & +49 \\ \hline propan-1-ol & CH3-CH2-CH2-OH & polar & hydrogen bonding & 34 & +97 \\ \hline \end{tabular}

The first compound in each grouping is a hydrocarbon which is essentially non-polar. Molecules of these compounds are held together by instantaneous dipole-induced dipole interactions _only_. The second compound in each grouping is an aldehyde with a polar -CHO group (refer to propanal). Molecules of these compounds are held together by stronger permanent dipole-permanent dipole interactions, on top of instantaneous dipole-induced dipole interactions, leading to higher boiling points. The last compound in each grouping is an alcohol with a polar -OH group, which is capable of forming hydrogen bonds. These molecules are held together by even stronger hydrogen bonding, on top of the permanent dipole-permanent dipole interactions and instantaneous dipole-induced dipole interactions. Hence, they have the highest boiling points compared to the rest in the group.

1. Consider the following three compounds:

1 (CH\({}_{3}\))\({}_{3}\)CH **2** CH\({}_{3}\)CH\({}_{2}\)CH\({}_{2}\)CH\({}_{3}\)

Explain why compound **3** has a higher boiling point than compound **1**.

Both compounds have simple molecular structure.

Compound **1** is a branched molecule while compound **3** is a straight-chain molecule.

Compound **3** has greater surface area of contact compared to compound **1**.

Hence, Compound **3** has stronger instantaneous dipole-induced dipole interactions than compound **1** which requires more energy to overcome.

Explain why compound **2** has a higher boiling point than compound **3**.

Compound **2** is a simple molecular compound with stronger hydrogen bonds, while compound **3** is a simple molecular compound with weaker instantaneous dipole-induced dipole interactions.

More energy is required to overcome the stronger hydrogen bonds of compound **2**.

2. Which of the following statements best explains why the boiling point of butanone, C\({}_{4}\)H\({}_{8}\)O (79.6 \({}^{o}\)C) is higher than that of pentane, C\({}_{5}\)H\({}_{12}\) (36.1 \({}^{o}\)C)?

A The relative molecular mass of butanone is higher than that of pentane.

B The butanone molecule has a larger surface area than the pentane molecule.

C There are hydrogen bonds between butanone molecules, but not between pentane molecules.

D There are permanent dipole-permanent dipole interactions between butanone molecules, but only instantaneous dipole-induced dipole interactions between pentane molecules.

Answer: D

Pentane is non-polar while butanone is polar. Thus, butanone will have permanent dipole-permanent dipole interactions which are stronger and requires more energy to overcome than the instantaneous dipole-induced dipole interactions that pentane has. Thus, butanone would have a higher boiling point than pentane.

### Influence of Hydrogen Bonding on Physical Properties of Molecules

#### 4.2.1 Unusually high boiling points of ammonia, water and hydrogen fluoride

when compared to other hydrides in the same group:

All hydrides in each group have **simple molecular** structures.

As **number of electrons increases** down each group, **strength of instantaneous dipole-induced dipole interactions increases**. A **larger amount of energy** is required to overcome the stronger instantaneous dipole-induced dipole interactions. Hence, boiling point of hydrides increases down the group.

However, boiling points of ammonia, water and hydrogen fluoride are **higher than expected**. This is because **more** energy is needed to overcome the **stronger hydrogen bonds** in **ammonia**, **water** and **hydrogen fluoride** compared to the **weaker instantaneous dipole-induced dipole interactions** in other hydrides.

(See Section 3.3 for the comparison between the boiling points of ammonia, water, and hydrogen fluoride.)

#### 4.2.2 Anomalous relative molecular masses of organic acids (R-CO\({}_{2}\)H)

Ethanoic acid, CH\({}_{3}\)CO\({}_{2}\)H, has an **apparent _M_+ of 120.0 which is **double** the expected \(M\) of 60.0 in the gas phase or when dissolved in benzene.

This is due to each acid molecule pairing up to form a **cyclic** (closed ring) _dimer via hydrogen bonds_.

.2.3 High solubility of ammonia, alcohols (R-OH), organic acids and amines (R-NH\({}_{2}\)) in water

These substances can form **hydrogen bonds** with water molecules as shown below:

#### 4.2.4 Different physical properties of isomers

4-nitrophenol has a boiling point of 279 \({}^{\circ}\)C, while that of 2-nitrophenol is **lower** at 216 \({}^{\circ}\)C. Also, 4-nitrophenol is **more soluble in water** compared to 2-nitrophenol.

#### 4.2.5 Higher density of water compared to ice

Hydrogen bonding holds ice molecules in place in an **orderly open structure** with **large amount of empty spaces** in between.

In this extended network, each water molecule forms **two** hydrogen bonds with its neighbouring water molecules such that each oxygen atom is surrounded by **four** hydrogen atoms.

Water molecules in the liquid state are able to occupy the spaces in between when ice melts. More molecules present in a fixed volume accounts for the higher density of water.

### 4.3 Giant Molecular Structures

Giant molecules can have **giant covalent** or **giant molecular structures**. Such structures consist of **extensive three-dimensional arrays of atoms**, which can either be all of the same type, as in the elements carbon (diamond and graphite) and silicon, or of two different elements such as in silicon(IV) oxide, SiO\({}_{2}\).

**Think about this: If each Si atom is bonded to 4 O atoms and each O atom is bonded to 2 Si atoms, why is the chemical formula of silicon(IV) oxide SiO\({}_{2}\), instead of SiO\({}_{2}\)?**

The **atoms are all joined to one another by strong covalent bonds**. So a single crystal of diamond or quartz is in fact a single molecule. For atoms to become free from the lattice, these strong bonds must be broken. Therefore, substances containing this type of lattice have very high melting and boiling points:

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|} \hline
**substance** & **formula** & \begin{tabular}{c} **type of interatomic** \\ **attraction** \\ \end{tabular} & \begin{tabular}{c} **melting** \\ **point/°C** \\ \end{tabular} &

### _Formation of Ionic Bond_

\begin{tabular}{|c|} \hline
** Ionic bonds** are **strong electrostatic forces of attraction** between **oppositely charged ions** in a giant ionic lattice structure \\ \hline
** Ionic bonds** are typically formed between a metallic element and a non-metallic element, when one atom (the metal) totally gives away one or more electrons to the non-metallic atom. This results in **ions** being formed. \\ \hline Atoms with _low ionisation energies_ can lose valence electrons to become positive ions, known as **actions**. The electrons are donated to atoms to form negative ions, known as **anions**. This can be represented using a **'dot-and-cross' diagram**: \\ \end{tabular}

Dots and crosses distinguish where the electron comes from, although in reality there is no difference between them. The charge on the ion should be shown as a superscript outside the square bracket. \\ \end{tabular}

The ions that make up ionic compounds are not always monatomic, _i.e._, they do not always contain _only one atom_. Several common ions contain _groups_ of atoms which are **covalently bonded** together, and which have an overall positive or negative charge e.g. SO\({}_{4}\)\({}^{2-}\) and NH\({}_{4}\)\({}^{*}\).

### Factors affecting Ionic Bond Strength

The strength of an **ionic bond** is measured by the **magnitude** of **lattice energy** (\(\Delta H_{\text{int}}\)) of the ionic compound.

**Lattice energy, \(\Delta H_{\text{int}}\) of an ionic crystal is the **energy released** when **one mole** of the **solid ionic compound** is **formed from** its **constituent gaseous ions**.

_e.g._ Na\({}^{*}\)(g) + \(C\)\(f\)(g) \(\rightarrow\) NaCl(s) \(\Delta H\) < 0

where \(q\), and \(q\). : charges on the cation and anion respectively \(t_{+}\) and \(t_{-}\): ionic radii of cation and anion respectively

Generally, the **greater** the **magnitude of lattice energy**, the **stronger** the ionic bonds. Also, generally the **difference in charge is more important than the difference in radius**.

**Example A**

In terms of structure and bonding, explain why MgO (m.p. 2850 \({}^{\circ}\)C) has a higher melting point than Na\({}_{2}\)O (m.p. 1130 \({}^{\circ}\)C).

Both MgO and Na\({}_{2}\)O have **giant ionic lattice structures** held together by **strong electrostatic forces of attraction between oppositely charged ions**.

Both compounds have the same anionic charge and radius. However, Mg\({}^{2+}\) has a **higher** ionic charge and **smaller** ionic radius than Na\({}^{+}\).

**More energy** is required to overcome the **stronger ionic bonds** in MgO. Hence, MgO has a higher melting point.

for Your Infe

Ionic bonding involves a separation of charge, which is usually an unfavourable endothermic process. The reason why it becomes more favourable with metals is their comparatively low ionisation energies. In sodium chloride, NaCl, for example, the outer electron is fairly easily lost from the sodium atom and becomes more attracted to the chlorine nucleus than to its original sodium nucleus.

\[\begin{array}{ll}\mbox{Na}(g)\rightarrow\mbox{Na}^{+}(g)+\epsilon^{-}&\Delta H ^{\odot}=+494\mbox{ kJ mol}^{-1}\mbox{ (ionisation energy)}\\ \mbox{Cl}(g)+\epsilon^{-}\mbox{Cl}(g)&\Delta H^{\odot}=-349\mbox{ kJ mol}^{-1}\mbox{ (electron affinity)}\end{array}\]

Therefore, in the gas phase:

\[\mbox{Na}(g)+\mbox{Cl}(g)\rightarrow\mbox{Na}^{+}(g)+\mbox{Cl}(g)\hskip 28.452756pt \Delta H^{\odot}=494-349=+145\mbox{ kJ mol}^{-1}\]

The fact that \(\Delta H^{\odot}\) is positive means that this is an energetically unfavourable process.

But when the ions form a solid lattice, the ions attract one another, and much energy is released:

\[\mbox{Na}^{+}(g)+\mbox{Cl}(g)\rightarrow\mbox{Na}^{+}\mbox{Cl}(s)\hskip 42.679134pt \Delta H^{\odot}=-787\mbox{ kJ mol}^{-1}\mbox{ (lattice energy)}\]

Hence, the overall energy change, from gas-phase atoms to solid compound, is:

\[\mbox{Na}(g)+\mbox{Cl}(g)\rightarrow\mbox{Na}^{+}\mbox{Cl}(s)\hskip 42.679134pt \Delta H^{\odot}=145-787=-642\mbox{ kJ mol}^{-1}\]

The complete process is seen to be highly exothermic, and therefore favourable. The benefits of total electron transfer are completed by the resulting electrostatic forces of attraction between the cation and anion that are formed.

### Giant Ionic Lattice

In an ionic lattice of a solid, ions are arranged in a **fixed**, **orderly** manner in a **giant ionic lattice** structure.

* Each cation is surrounded by a number of anions as its closest neighbours.
* Each anion is surrounded by a number of cations as its closest neighbours.
* No two cations or anions will be adjacent to each other.
* The electrostatic forces of attraction exists between ions of opposite charge. Hence, an ionic bond is said to be **non-directional**.

In the case of sodium chloride, NaCl, each Na+ ion is surrounded by six of the larger \(C\!I\) ions while each \(C\!I\) ion is surrounded by six Na+ ions. (Refer to Appendix 5 for information on Coordination Number for ionic compounds)

1. Describe the bonding in magnesium oxide and explain why it acts as an insulator.
2. Suggest a reason why copper is suitable for encasing the magnesium oxide.

## 6 Intermediate Bond Types

Many covalent and ionic bonds have **intermediate bond character** - some covalent bonds have **ionic character** and some ionic bonds have **covalent character**

### Ionic Character in Covalent Bond

Ionic character in a covalent bond arises due to sharing of electrons between atoms with a **considerable electronegativity difference**.

The **more electronegative** atom acquires a **partial negative charge** (denoted by \(\delta\)-), the **less electronegative** atom acquires a **partial positive charge** (denoted by \(\delta\)+), forming a **dipole moment** in a **polar** covalent bond

The extent of **ionic character** in a covalent bond **increases** with an **increase in electronegativity difference** between the covalently bonded atoms.

If we compare HBr and HI, both have simple molecular structures with weak permanent dipole-permanent dipole interactions between molecules.

As electronegativity of iodine is lower than that of bromine (as electronegativity decreases down a group), the electronegativity difference between the atoms in HI is smaller than that between HBr. Hence, HI has a smaller degree of ionic character.

### 6.2 Covalent Character in Ionic Bond

In a pure ionic bond, there is complete transfer of electrons and the electron clouds of both the cation and anion remain intact.

Covalent character in an ionic bond arises due to **polarisation**, which refers to the **distortion of anion electron cloud by a neighbouring cation** in an ionic compound. Due to this, there is some form of "electron sharing" between oppositely charged ions, leading to some covalent character being induced in the ionic bond

Fajans' rules can be used to predict the extent of polarisation, which depends on the **charge on the cation** and the **relative sizes of the cation and anion**:

\begin{tabular}{|l|c|} \hline Low & Polarisation & High \\ \hline Low positive charge & High positive charge \\ \hline Large cation & Small cation \\ \hline Small anion & Large anion \\ \hline \end{tabular}

The concept of **charge density** is useful for explaining the influence that an ion (usually a cation) has on the electrons in adjacent ions or molecules. The charge density of an ion can be calculated by dividing its charge by its ionic radius, i.e. \(\frac{q_{\_}}{r_{\_}+}\) or \(\frac{q_{\_}}{r_{\_}-}\)

where \(q_{\_}\) is the charge of the cation, \(q_{\_}\) is the charge of the anion, \(r_{\_}\) is the cationic radius, \(r_{\_}\) is the anionic radius.

The extent of polarisation (and hence attraction) of the electron cloud in adjacent anions depends on the charge density and, in turn, the **polarising power of the cation**.

* Small, highly charged ions (_e.g._ A\(\ell^{+}\)) have **greater charge densities** and hence **higher polarising powers** than large, singly charged ions (_e.g._ Cs\({}^{+}\)).
* If two ions have similar charge densities, their compounds often have similar properties (e.g. A/\(Cl_{3}\) and BeCl\({}_{2}\)).

The extent of polarisation also depends on the **polarisability of the anion**. The **larger the anionic radius**, the **more polarisable** the anion is.

Hence, the extent of covalent character in an ionic bond is larger when:

* The cation has a high charge and a small radius i.e. high charge density (highly polarising).
* The anion has a large radius (highly polarisable).

The idea of ion polarisation is important in explaining the thermal decomposition of Group 2 carbonates under the topic of 'Periodic Table'.

Intermediate Bond Types

**Example A1**.

In terms of structure and bonding, account for the following observation:

**compound** **melting point / \({}^{\circ}\)C**

AF\({}_{3}\) **1090**

**AC\({}_{b}\) **193**

**Understanding the context:**

**Due to the larger size of** \(Ct\) **(**\(r_{{}_{Ct}}=0.181\) nm**) compared to** \(F^{-}\left(r_{{}_{F^{-}}}=0.136\) nm**), the** \(Ct\) **ion is more polarisable than** \(F^{-}\)**, leading to substantial polarisation of the** \(A\)**_L-C_l_ **bond in** \(ACb\)**.**

**Since** \(A\)**\({}^{b+}\) **has** **high charge density and is highly polarising, this results in** **significant covalent character to the** \(A\)**_L-C_l_ **bond. Hence** \(ACb\) **has a** **simple molecular structure** **while** \(A\)**IF**\({}_{3}\) **is essentially ionic.**

**AF**\({}_{3}\) **has a** **giant ionic lattice structure** **while** \(ACb\) **has a** **simple molecular structure**.**

**More energy is required to break the** **stronger electrostatic forces of attraction between the** **oppositely charged ions** **in** \(AF_{3}\) **than the weaker instantaneous dipole-induced dipole interactions between** \(ACl_{3}\) **molecules. Thus,** \(AF_{3}\) **has a higher melting point that** \(ACl_{3}\)**.**

## 7 Metallic Bonding

* [label=LO]
* Show understanding that all chemical bonds are electrostatic in nature and describe:
* (ii) metallic bond as the electrostatic attraction between a lattice of positive ions and delocalised electrons.
* Describe, in simple terms, the lattice structure of a crystalline solid which is:
* (v) metallic, as in copper

### Definition of Metallic Bond

**Metallic bonds are strong electrostatic forces of attraction between metal cations and sea of delocalised electrons in a giant metallic lattice structure**

The metal atoms contribute their valence electrons to form cations in a sea of delocalised electrons. The valence electrons are delocalised due to the weak electrostatic forces of attraction between them and the nucleus.

In any given piece of metal, the **metallic lattice** is electrically neutral as the number of positive and negative charges balance out.

### Factors affecting Metallic Bond Strength

The strength of metallic bonds is:

* **proportional to number of delocalised valence electrons** contributed per atom
* **proportional to the charge density of metal cation, \(\frac{q_{*}}{r_{+}}\)**

where \(q_{*}\) is the charge of the cation, \(r_{*}\) is the cationic radius.

In comparing two metals, the **difference in cationic charge tends to have a greater effect on metallic bond strength than the difference in cationic radius**.

The metallic bond strength is reflected in the boiling point of the metal.

_E.g._ Comparing the metallic bond strength of sodium, magnesium and aluminium

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|} \hline
**metal** & **sodium (Na)** & **magnesium (Mg)** & **aluminium (AJ)** \\ \hline

## Appendix 1: A Little Bit of History....

In the early 20th century, the American chemist Gilbert N. Lewis began to use dots in lecture, while teaching undergraduates at Harvard, to represent the electrons around atoms. His students favoured these drawings, which stimulated him in this direction. From these lectures, Lewis noted that elements with a certain number of electrons seemed to have a special stability: it appeared that once a core of _eight electrons_ has formed around a nucleus, the layer is filled, and a new layer is started. Lewis also noted that various ions with eight electrons also seemed to have a special stability. On these views, he proposed the rule of eight or octet rule: ions or atoms with a filled layer of eight electrons have a special stability.

Moreover, noting that a cube has eight corners Lewis envisioned an atom as having eight sides available for electrons, like the corner of a cube. Subsequently, in 1902 he devised a conception in which cubic atoms can bond on their sides to form cubic-structured molecules.

In 1913, while working as the chair of the department of chemistry at the University of California, Berkeley, Lewis read a preliminary outline of paper by an English graduate student, Alfred Lauck Parson, who was visiting Berkeley for a year. In this paper, Parson suggested that the electron is not merely an electric charge but is also a small magnet (or "magneton" as he called it) and furthermore that a chemical bond results from two electrons being shared between two atoms.

Moreover, he proposed that an atom tended to form an ion by gaining or losing the number of electrons needed to complete a cube. Thus, Lewis structures show each atom in the structure of the molecule using its chemical symbol. Lines are drawn between atoms that are bonded to one another; occasionally, pairs of dots are used instead of lines. Excess electrons that form lone pairs are represented as pair of dots, and are placed next to the atoms on which they reside.

To summarise his views on his new bonding model, Lewis states:

Two atoms may conform to the rule of eight, or the octet rule, not only by the transfer of electrons from one atom to another, but also by sharing one or more pairs of electrons...Two electrons thus coupled together, when lying between two atomic centres, and held jointly in the shells of the two atoms, I have considered to be the chemical bond. We thus have a concrete picture of that physical entity, that "hook and eye" which is part of the creep of the organic chemist.

The following year, in 1917, an unknown American undergraduate chemical engineer named Linus Pauling was learning the Dalton hook-and-eye bonding method at the Oregon Agricultural College, which was the vogue description of bonds between atoms at the time. Each atom had a certain number of hooks that allowed it to attach to other atoms, and a certain number of eyes that allowed other atoms to attach to it. A chemical bond resulted when a hook and eye connected. Pauling, however, wasn't satisfied with this archaic method and looked to the newly emerging field of quantum physics for a new method.

In 1927, the physicists Fritz London and Walter Heitler applied the new quantum mechanics to the deal with the saturable, non-dynamic forces of attraction and repulsion, _i.e._, exchange forces, of the hydrogen molecule. Their valence bond treatment of this problem, in their joint paper, was a landmark in that it _brought chemistry under quantum mechanics_. Their work was an influence on Pauling, who had just received his doctorate and visited Heitler and London in Zurich on a Guggenheim Fellowship.

Subsequently, in 1931, building on the work of Heitler and London and on theories found in Lewis' famous article, Pauling published his ground-breaking article "The Nature of the Chemical Bond" in which he used quantum mechanics to calculate properties and structures of molecules, such as angles between bonds and rotation about bonds. On these concepts, Pauling developed hybridisation theory to account for bonds in molecules such as CH\({}_{4}\), in which four sp\({}^{3}\) hybridised orbitals are overlapped by hydrogen's 1s orbital, yielding four sigma (\(\sigma\)) bonds.

_Why_ are We Studying This?

Molecular structure is the foundation on which chemistry, the study of matter and the changes it undergoes, rests. Much of chemistry is concerned with changes at the molecular level as structures are elucidated and chemical reactions occur.

## Appendix 2: Structure of the Atom

Understanding the nature of the chemical bond relies on knowledge of the composition and structure of the atom. The model of the atom that emerged from the early work of Thomson, Rutherford, Moseley, and Bohr was of a central, very small, positively charged nucleus composed of positively charged protons and neutral neutrons, surrounded by one or more negatively charged electrons moving at high speed and effectively occupying a volume much larger than that of the nucleus.

The lack of reactivity of the noble gases - no known compounds at that time - led both Walther Kossel and Lewis to conclude in 1916 that these substances have a particularly stable arrangement of electrons. This in turn led to the development of the shell model of the atom. In the shell model, the electrons in an atom are arranged in successive spherical layers or shells surrounding the nucleus. The outer shell is never found to contain more than the number of electrons in the valence shell of a noble gas. The outer shell is called the valence shell because it is these electrons that are involved in bond formation and give the atom its valence.

Experimental support for the shell model has been provided by the determination of the ionisation energies of free atoms in the gas phase and by the analysis of the spectra of such atoms. These measurements have given a picture of the arrangement of the electrons in an atom in terms of their energies, which can also be deduced from the quantum mechanical description of an atom. Quantum mechanics also shows us that electrons do not have fixed positions in space but are in constant motion, following paths that cannot be determined. Hence, it is strictly not correct to talk about the _arrangement_ of the electrons. It is their energy, not their positions, which can be determined.

On the basis of the shell mode, two apparently different models of the chemical bond were proposed, the ionic model and the covalent model.

## Appendix 4: Covalent Bonding - Prelude

Clearly the explanation of the chemical bond given by Kossel cannot apply to homonuclear molecules (_i.e._ molecules comprising of the same type of atoms) such as C_l_2. Almost simultaneously with the publication of Kossel's theory, G. N. Lewis published a theory that could account for such molecules. Like Kossel, Lewis was impressed with the lack of reactivity of the noble gases. But he was also impressed by the observation that the vast majority of molecules have an even number of electrons, which led him to suggest that in molecules, electrons are usually present in pairs. In particular, he proposed that in a molecule such as C_l_2 the two atoms are held together by sharing a pair of electrons because in this way each atom can obtain a noble gas electron arrangement, as in the following examples:

Diagrams of this type are called Lewis diagrams or Lewis structures. The bond between the two atoms could be called a shared-electron-pair bond but it is now universally called a covalent bond - a term introduced by Irving Langmuir (1919). In a Lewis diagram, the pairs of electrons that are not forming bonds are called nonbonding pairs or, more usually, lone pairs.

Although Lewis had no clear idea of why electrons are found in molecules as pairs, or how a shared pair of electrons holds two atoms together, the ideas of the shared electron pair, the covalent bond and the octet rule enable us to understand the formulas of a vast number of molecules and their relationship to the positions of the elements in the periodic table.

Because the formation of electron pairs seemed to contradict Coulomb's law, according to which electrons repel each other so that they should keep as far apart as possible, Lewis even suggested that Coulomb's law is not obeyed over the very short distances between electrons in atoms and molecules. Although we now know that Coulomb's law is obeyed for all distances between charges, in making the assumption about the importance of electron pairs, Lewis displayed remarkable _intuition_: electrons do indeed form pairs in most molecules, despite their mutual electrostatic repulsion. Nonetheless Lewis diagrams showing bonding pairs and lone pairs are still widely us ed today, and the electron pair remains a central concept in chemistry.

Lewis called the apparent tendency of atoms to acquire a noble gas electron arrangement, either by forming ions or by sharing electron pairs, the rule of eight. Later Langmuir called it the octet rule, and this is the term that is now generally used. Lewis did not regard the rule of eight as being as important as the rule of two, according to which electrons are present in molecules in pairs, because he found more exceptions to the octet rule than to the rule of two. There are only a few exceptions to the rule of two, such as molecules with an odd number of electrons (free radicals), whereas there are a large number of exceptions to the octet rule.

## Appendix 5: Coordination Number

* Coordination number, with regards to an ionic lattice, refers to the number of oppositely charged ions that surrounds the ion of concern. The factors that affect coordination number are:
* Relative size of the ions For any given ionic compound,
* Typical coordination numbers to be considered are 4, 6 and 8.
* There are 3 possible scenarios as shown below:

\end{tabular} * Relative charge To achieve electrical neutrality, * Cation with +2 charge will need twice as many anions with -1 charge, when compared to a cation with +1 charge
