## 1 Manipulation of Apparatus and Materials

### Using the Pipette

* The pipette commonly used for 'A' level practical work is the "volumetric" or "transfer" pipette. It is used to measure out a specified volume of liquid (e.g. 25.0 cm\({}^{3}\)) accurately.

**Rinsing the pipette**

1. **Do not** use your mouth to draw any solution into a pipette. There could be serious health consequences!
2. **Do not** insert the pipette too far into the pipette filler. This could damage the pipette filler (See Figure 1 on page 1).
3. **Do not** allow any solution to enter the pipette filler. This contaminates the pipette filler for subsequent use and could also damage it.
4. **Do not** adjust the liquid level in the pipette to the calibration mark when the pipette tip is still immersed in the solution.
5. **Do not** tap the base of the conical flask with the pipette tip to force the last drop of solution out.

**Note:**

Volumetric pipettes are designed and calibrated such that after the required volume of a liquid is dispensed, a very small volume of liquid will remain in the tip. This last drop should not be blown out1. Use your thumb and forefinger to press on valve "A" and squeeze the bulb with other fingers to produce a vacuum for aspiration. Release valve "A" once the bulb is completely deflated.
2. Hold the pipette close to its upper end and insert into the bottom of the pipette filler (see Figure 1 above).
3. Insert the pipette into the liquid to be transferred. Press on valve "S". Such will draw liquid up into the pipette. Continue pressing valve "S" until the liquid reaches the desired level. Carefully adjust the liquid level so that the bottom of the meniscus coincides with the calibration line on the pipette.
4. Press on valve "E" to expel liquid.
5. Carefully remove the pipette filler from the pipette and allow the liquid to drain freely into the receiving flask.

Figure 3: Tilt the conical flask slightly and allow the pipette tip to touch the bottom of the conical flask without touching the solution. Rotate the pipette tip a few times to draw out some more of the remaining solution in the pipette. Do not blow out the last drop!

Figure 4: Fill a burette with the aid of a funnel. You may need to lift up the funnel slightly, to allow the solution to flow in freely.

Figure 5: Always check that there is no air bubble trapped in the burette. Flush out any air bubble by opening the tap to allow some solution to drain out.

Figure 6: For clear solutions, the bottom of the meniscus should be read at eye-level. In this case, the burette reading is 30.00 cm\({}^{3}\).

### Titration

#### Do's

1. Follow the instructions given in Section 1.2 to get your burette ready for titration. Record the initial burette reading.
2. Place a piece of white tile on the base of the retort stand holding the burette.
3. Adjust the burette (on the bench top) to a comfortable height for titration (e.g. with the burette tip slightly inside the conical flask but not in contact with any parts of the flask).
4. Carry out the titration with the addition of the solution from the burette (see Figure 8), with continuous swirling of the solution in the conical flask.
5. Add the solution from the burette drop-wise when approaching the end-point of the titration. Also **r**ise the inner walls of the conical flask with deionised water when approaching the end-point to wash down any adhering solution.

#### Note:

It is common to carry out a rough titration to determine the approximate volume of the solution required to reach the end-point.
6. **Stop** the titration when the end-point is reached i.e. when **one drop of the solution** added from the burette causes a distinct colour change of the solution in the conical flask.
7. Read the final burette reading at eye-level and record it.
8. Repeat the titration to get at least two consistent readings (i.e. the two titre values are within 0.10 cm\({}^{3}\) of each other).

#### Don'ts

1. Do not rinse the conical flask with the titrand solution. Rinse the conical flask only with deionised water.
2. Do not release solution continuously from the burette without swirling the conical flask even if the approximate end-point is known.
3. Do not carry out titration with the funnel still resting on the top of the burette.

### Preparing a Standard Solution

* A volumetric flask (or graduated flask) is used to prepare a solution of known volume. It is commonly used to prepare a standard solution (i.e. a solution of known concentration).
* Volumetric flasks are available in various capacities. For 'A' level experiments, 250 cm\({}^{3}\) volumetric flasks are commonly used.
* The main steps involved in the preparation of a standard solution from a solid reagent are shown diagrammatically below.

More deionised water is added into the volumetric flask until the 250 cm\({}^{3}\) mark is reached. The volumetric flask is then stoppered and the solution shaken to ensure that it is homogeneous.

### The deionised water

The deionised water is added into the volumetric flask until the 250 cm\({}^{3}\) surface is reached. The volumetric flask is then stoppered and the solution shaken to ensure that it is homogeneous.

Common apparatus used for the preparation of a standard solution:

Do's

1. Wash the following apparatus with water and then rinse them with deionised water: volumetric flask, 100 cm\({}^{3}\) glass beaker, glass rod, funnel and dropper.
2. Place the funnel onto the volumetric flask.
3. Transfer as much solid as possible from the weighing bottle into the beaker carefully.
4. **Rinse the weighing bottle** with some deionised water (from the wash bottle) to help 'wash' and transfer the remaining small amount of solid from the weighing bottle into the beaker.
5. Rinse the weighing bottle a few times with deionised water and transfer all the washings into the beaker with the aid of the glass rod. Lean the weighing bottle against the glass rod and allow the washings to flow down the glass rod into the beaker.
6. Dissolve as much of the solid in the beaker by **stirring with the glass rod**. Add more deionised water if necessary. Ensure that the beaker is at most \(\%\) full to avoid spillage while stirring.
7. Transfer the solution from the beaker into the volumetric flask carefully with the **aid of the funnel and the glass rod**. Rest the spout of the beaker on the glass rod and pour the solution out carefully, using the glass rod to direct the solution towards the funnel. Ensure that any undissolved solid remains in the beaker.
8. Add more deionised water to dissolve the remaining solid in the beaker. Then transfer the solution into the volumetric flask as in step 7.
9. **Rinse the beaker, glass rod and funnel repeatedly with deionised water** and pour all the washings into the volumetric flask to ensure a complete transfer of the solid weighed out initially.
10. Remove the funnel from the volumetric flask.
11. **Fill the volumetric flask with deionised water** (from the wash bottle) **until the solution level is about 1 - 3 cm away from the mark at the neck of the volumetric flask.
12. Add deionised water drop-wise using a dropper into the volumetric flask (placed on the bench) until the mark is reached. Check at eye-level that the bottom of the meniscus is just touching the mark.
13. Stopper the volumetric flask. Hold the stopper firmly, **invert the volumetric flask and shake the solution**. Repeat the inversion and shaking about 10 times to ensure that the solution is homogeneous. Label the solution (if necessary).

Don'ts

1. **Do not** add deionised water to the solid in the weighing bottle before transferring as much of the solid as possible into the small beaker.
2. **Do not** place the glass rod or the funnel onto the bench top unless they have been rinsed with deionised water and the washings transferred into the volumetric flask.
3. **Do not** use more deionised water than necessary for rinsing to avoid overshooting the required mark in the volumetric flask.
4. **Do not** lift the volumetric flask away from the bench top while filling it up to the mark with deionised water from the dropper. The volumetric flask should be placed on a flat surface, e.g. the bench top, when filling up to the mark.

Figure 14: The bottom of the meniscus should just touch the mark at the neck of the volumetric flask.

Figure 12: The solid in the weighing bottle is to be transferred quantitatively into a 100 cm\({}^{3}\) glass beaker and then dissolved in deionised water.

Figure 13: The transfer of the solution from the beaker to the volumetric flask is done with the aid of the glass rod and the funnel.

Figure 15: The bottom of the meniscus should just touch the mark at the neck of the volumetric flask. This should be checked at eye-level.

2. Discussion Questions

A student carried out a titration experiment in which solution FA1 is titrated against solution FA2 placed in the burette.

1. Before filling up the burette with solution FA2, the student rinsed the burette first with deionised water and then with solution FA2. Explain the need for each rinsing.

2. Before the start of the first titration, the student rinsed the pipette with deionised water but did not rinse it with solution FA1. Explain the impact of this on the first titre volume.

3. Before the start of the first titration, the student rinsed the conical flask with deionised water but did not rinse it with solution FA1. Explain why the conical flask should not be rinsed with solution FA1.

4. After rinsing the conical flask with deionised water, the student proceeded to pipette 25.0 cm\({}^{3}\) of FA1 into it. Explain why the presence of water droplets in the conical flask would not affect the titration result.

5. Explain why a conical flask and not a beaker was used for titration.

6. The student swirled the conical flask continuously during the titration. Explain the need for him to do so.

7. During titration, the student occasionally used the wash bottle to add deionised water to rinse the inner walls of the conical flask. Explain the need for him to do so.

### Acid-base indicators

* The indicators used in acid-base titrations are generally organic dyestuffs which are weak acids or weak bases.
* In an acid-base titration, the indicator used is usually added in a small quantity to help to determine the end-point of the titration. Each indicator has a pH range over which it changes colour.
* The choice of an indicator for an acid-base titration depends on: (i) the type of titration carried out and (ii) the pH range of the indicator.
* Essential characteristics of a good indicator: [noitemsep]
1. The colour change of the indicator must occur when the correct volume of titrant is added from the buret, i.e. the colour change takes place only when the reaction is complete.
2. The indicator must give a sharp end-point in the titration, i.e. it must change colour distinctly upon the addition of one drop of the titrant from the buret. It would be useless if 2 or 3 cm3 of the titrant were necessary to bring about the colour change.
* Colour changes and pH ranges of selected indicators: [noitemsep]

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|} \hline
**Indicator** & **Approximate** & **Colour in** & **Colour in** & **Colour** \\  & **pH range** & **'acid'** & 'alkaline' & **at the end-point** \\  & & **solution** & **solution** & \\ \hline methyl orange & \(3.1-4.4\) & red & yellow & orange \\ \hline screened methyl orange & \(3.1-4.4\) & violet & green & grey \\ \hline thymol blue & \(1.2-2.8\) & red & yellow & green \\  & \(8.0-9.6\) & yellow & blue & \\ \hline thymolphthalein & \(9.3-10.5\) & colourless & blue & light blue (if titrant is alkali) colourless (if titrant is acid) \\ \hline \end{tabular}

## 2 Uncertainty (or error) in Measurement

### Uncertainty in Measurement

* A measurement gives quantitative information. The result of nearly every measurement is a number and a unit.
* a result with no uncertainty.
* Recording a measurement provides information about both its magnitude and uncertainty. When a scientist reports the result of a single measurement, he also reports the uncertainty in the result, a number indicating the reliability of the measuring device used.
* For example, the mass of a sample obtained using an electronic balance that weighs to the nearest 0.01 g may be reported as \(\mathbf{32.46\pm 0.01}\) g. This means that the actual mass will be in the range \(\mathbf{32.45\pm 0.37}\) g.
* Scientists sometimes report the above mass as \(\mathbf{32.46\pm 0.37}\) g. Reporting the mass to 2 decimal places implies an uncertainty of 0.01 g.
* In science, measured values are reported in terms of significant figures.
* A mass that is reported as \(\mathbf{32.4\pm 0.37}\) g (to 3 sf) has an uncertainty of \(\pm\) 0.01 g.
* **Significant figures** in a measurement consist of all the digits known with certainty plus one final digit, which is somewhat uncertain or is estimated.
* **Note:**
* Analytical chemists make a distinction between error and uncertainty.
* Error is the difference between a single measurement or result and its true value (or accepted value or literature value).
* **Uncertainty** is an estimate that expresses the range of possible values that a measurement or result might reasonably be expected to have.
* For simplicity at 'A' level, we will treat **uncertainty as being the same as error** when dealing with calculations involving **equipmentmeasurement error**. In this case, equipment/measurement error refers to the uncertainty that is associated with measurements made with that piece of equipment (i.e. the error that is intrinsic in the use of a particular piece of equipment).

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:16]

### Accuracy and Precision

* Two concepts that have to do with measurements are accuracy and precision.
* The accuracy of a measurement refers to how close the measured value is to the true, accepted or literature value. Measurement error is the amount of inaccuracy.

* refers to how close together several measurements of the same quantity are to each other. It is the degree of consistency and agreement among several measurements made in the same manner.
* Precision is commonly divided into two categories: repeatability and reproducibility.
* is the precision obtained when one experimenter carries out several measurements of the same quantity and they are in close agreement with each other.
* Reproducibility is the precision obtained when different experimenters carry out the measurement of the same quantity and obtain readings that are in close agreement with each other.
* A dartboard analogy can be used to illustrate the difference between accuracy and precision.
* Measurements can be
* accurate and precise as in (d)
* precise but inaccurate as in (b)
* neither accurate nor precise as in (a)
* You must strive for both accuracy and precision in all of your laboratory experiments. Make sure that you understand the operation of each instrument, take each measurement carefully, and check to make sure that you have precision.

### Precision of Instrument

* The smallest division of a measuring instrument determines the precision of the instrument.

[MISSING_PAGE_POST]

### Absolute Uncertainty and Percentage Uncertainty

Consider the following quantity that is measured: 28.50 \(\pm\) 0.01 g

\begin{tabular}{|p{28.5pt}|p{28.5pt}|} \hline Absolute uncertainty & * The absolute uncertainty is the actual uncertainty in the value. * In this case, absolute uncertainty = \(\pm\) 0.01 g \\ \hline Percentage uncertainty & * The percentage uncertainty is the absolute uncertainty expressed as a percentage of the measured value i.e. \\ \hline Percentage uncertainty = 
\begin{tabular}{} \end{tabular} & * In this case, percentage uncertainty = \(\frac{(\pm 0.01)}{28.50}\) x 100 \% \\ \hline \(\pm\)0.0351 \% (3 s.f.) \\ \hline \end{tabular}
* An uncertainty of \(\pm\)0.01 g is more significant for a mass measurement of 1.00 g than it is for 100.00 g. This is shown by the different percentage uncertainties for the two measurements using the same analytical balance.

\begin{tabular}{|p{28.5pt}|} \hline For 1.00 \(\pm\) 0.01 g, the percentage uncertainty = \(\frac{(\pm 0.01)}{100.00}\) x 100 \% = \(\pm\)0.0100 \% \\ \hline \end{tabular}

### Combining Uncertainties

* In an experiment, it is common that a number of measurements using different apparatus are made and a final result is calculated from these measurements.
* **Question**: How do we combine the uncertainties in the individual measurements to work out the overall uncertainty in the final result?
* The simplified approach in combining uncertainties shown on the next page depends on the mathematical operations involved in calculating the results.

* **Addition and Subtraction of Readings**

Consider the volume of a solution FA1 measured using a buret.

Final burette reading /cm\({}^{3}\) & 37.20

Initial burette reading /cm\({}^{3}\) & 15.05

Volume of FA1 /cm\({}^{3}\) & 22.15

What is the uncertainty associated with the volume of FA1 measured?

Uncertainty in volume of FA1 measured

= uncertainty in final burette reading + uncertainty in initial burette reading

= (\(\pm\)0.05) + (\(\pm\)0.05)

= \(\pm\)0.10 cm\({}^{3}\)

**Note:** For measurements involving 2 readings:

Uncertainty in measurement = uncertainty of final reading + uncertainty of initial reading

Proof
* The smallest division in a burette is 0.10 cm\({}^{3}\).

Each burette reading has an uncertainty of \(\pm\)0.05 cm\({}^{3}\).

The final burette reading is in the range of \(37.15-37.25\) cm\({}^{3}\).

The initial burette reading is in the range \(15.00-15.10\) cm\({}^{3}\).

Maximum volume calculated = Maximum final reading - Minimum initial reading

= \(37.25-15.00\)

= \(22.25\) cm\({}^{3}\)

Minimum volume calculated = Minimum final reading - Maximum initial reading

= \(37.15-15.10\)

= \(22.05\) cm\({}^{3}\)

Therefore **volume of FA1 = \(22.15\pm 0.10\) cm\({}^{3}\)**

Hence the uncertainty associated with the volume of FA1 is 2(\(\pm\) 0.05) = \(\pm\) 0.10 cm\({}^{3}\)

**Note:**

The volume of FA1 calculated depends on the difference between the two burette readings and the uncertainty is the sum of the two absolute uncertainties of the two measurements.

* **Note:**

When adding or subtracting measurements, the uncertainty in the calculated result is the sum of the absolute uncertainties of the individual measurements.

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:23]

### Recording Buret Readings

* Record buret readings to 2 decimal places and to the nearest 0.05 cm\({}^{3}\) (i.e. the last digit is either a '0' or '5').
* Ensure that a sufficient number of titrations have been carried out i.e. obtain at least two consistent titration results (i.e. two titres that are within 0.10 cm\({}^{3}\) of each other).
* Record buret readings using a table as shown below.

* Do take note of the following when presenting primary and secondary data:

1. Record mass readings to 3 decimal places.
2. Record buret readings to 2 decimal places.
3. Record pipette readings to 1 decimal place.
4. Present intermediate answers (i.e. part of calculation working) to 3 or 4 significant figures.
5. Present final answer to each part to 3 significant figures.
6. Present stoichiometric coefficients such as \(x\) in CuSO\({}_{u}\).xH\({}_{2}\)O to the nearest whole number.
7. Relative molecular mass (\(M_{l}\)) and relative formula mass (\(M_{l}\)) calculated using \(A_{r}\) values from the given Periodic Table should always be quoted to 1 decimal place. Examples: \(M_{l}\) of CaCO\({}_{3}\) = 40.1 + 12.0 + (3)(16.0) = 100.1 (1 decimal place) \(M_{r}\) of BaCl\({}_{2}\) = 137.3 + (2)(35.5) = 208.3 (1 decimal place) However a \(M_{r}\) (or \(A_{l}\)) value **determined** experimentally should be presented to 3 significant figures.

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:25]

_Comment on the consistency of the titre values obtained. Identify, and suggest an explanation for, the presence or absence of anomalous results in these titre values._

* **As titration 1 and 2 readings are within 0.10 cm\({}^{3}\) of each other, the readings are consistent.**
* **Since there is no anomalous result, a third titration was not attempted.**
* **Consistent readings were obtained due to proper pipetting and titration techniques being adopted. For example, the titrant (i.e. FA1 in the buret) was added drop-wise when nearing the end-point of the titration to ensure that the latter was not exceeded. Also, swiring of the reaction mixture in the conical flask was done continuously during titration to ensure even mixing of the reactants.**
* **Worked Example 2:** An acid-base titration in which FA2 is titrated against FA1.

\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|c|} \hline
**Titration results** & & & \\ \hline
**Titration number** & **1** & **2** & **3** \\ \hline

**Volume of FA1 used /cm\({}^{3}\)** & **25.30** & **25.05** & **25.05** \\
**Values used** & & & \\ \hline \end{tabular}

**Average volume of FA1 required = 25.05 cm\({}^{3}\)**

**Volume of FA2 pipetted = 25.0 cm\({}^{3}\)**

**Summary: 25.0 cm\({}^{3}\) of FA2 required 25.05 cm\({}^{3}\) of FA1 for complete reaction.**

_Comment on the consistency of the titre values obtained. Identify, and suggest an explanation for, the presence or absence of anomalous results in these titre values._

* **As titration readings 1 and 2 are more than 0.10 cm\({}^{3}\) apart, the readings are not consistent. Since one of the readings is anomalous, a third titration was done.**
* **Titration readings 2 and 3 are the same and hence they are consistent. Proper pipetting and titration techniques were adopted to obtain consistent readings. For example, the titrant (i.e. FA1 in the buret) was added drop-wise when nearing the end-point of the titration to ensure that the end-point was not exceeded.**
* **Titration reading 1 is anomalous and higher than the other readings probably because the titrant (i.e. FA1 from the buret) was not added drop-wise when approaching the end-point of the titration. Hence the end-point was exceeded with slightly more titrant added. This titration was meant to be a rough one to get an approximate titre value quickly.**

## 5 Examples on Uncertainty (or error) Calculations

* **Worked Example 3** Two students used different balances to weigh the masses of two samples of lithium nitrate and recorded their readings as shown in the table below. Student A used a balance capable of reading to 0.1 g. Student B used a balance capable of reading to 0.01 g. **Student A** Student B

Mass of crucible and lid /g 5.1 4.16 **Mass of crucible and lid and \(\mathrm{LNO_{3}/g}\) 20.9 4.86** Show by calculation, using values from the table, that any uncertainty (or error) in the mass of lithium nitrate recorded is less significant for student A than for student B.

Solution

Mass of \(\mathrm{LNO_{3}/g}\) 20.9 - 5.1 = 15.8 4.86 - 4.16 = 0.70 **Uncertainty /g** (2)(\(\pm\)0.05) = \(\pm\)0.100 (2)(\(\pm\)0.005) = \(\pm\)0.0100 **Percentage** (\(\pm\)0.1) uncertainty 15.8 \(\times\) 100 % **0.70 \(\times\) 100 % **\(=\pm\)0.633% (3 s.f.) = \(\pm\)1.43% (3 s.f.)** Since the percentage uncertainty associated with the mass of \(\mathrm{LNO_{3}}\) weighed by student A is smaller than that of student B, the uncertainty in the mass of \(\mathrm{LNO_{3}}\) recorded is less significant for student A.
* **Worked Example 4** A student carried out an experiment to determine the concentration of aqueous sodium hydroxide. He weighed out a mass of 0.753 g of ethanedoic acid dihydrate, \(\mathrm{(COOH)_{2}.2H\alpha}\). The solid was dissolved in deionised water and made up to 250 cm\({}^{3}\)in a graduated flask. 25.0 cm\({}^{3}\)of this solution was pipetted and titrated against an aqueous solution of sodium hydroxide using thymolphthalein as an indicator. A titre volume of 23.20 cm\({}^{3}\)of sodium hydroxide was obtained. The errors (uncertainties) associated with each reading using a graduated flask, pipette and burette are \(\pm\)0.15 cm\({}^{3}\), \(\pm\)0.1 cm\({}^{3}\)and \(\pm\)0.05 cm\({}^{3}\) respectively. Calculate the maximum total percentage error (uncertainty) of the concentration of sodium hydroxide.

* **Worked Example 5** A student performed an experiment by mixing 35 cm\({}^{3}\) of dilute sulfuric acid and 20 cm\({}^{3}\) of potassium hydroxide in a Syrfoam cup, and measuring the maximum temperature of the resulting mixture. Calculate the maximum total percentage uncertainties (errors) in the volume of the reaction mixture for the experiment when using the following to measure the volumes of sulfuric acid and potassium hydroxide: (1) burettes (2) measuring cylinders, given that the uncertainty (error) associated with each reading using a 50 cm\({}^{3}\) measuring cylinder is \(\pm\)0.5 cm\({}^{3}\). Solution (1) When using burettes, maximum total percentage uncertainty = \(\frac{(40.05)(2)+(2.05)(2)}{35.00+20.0}\) (100%) = \(\pm\)**0.364%** (3 s.f.) (2) When using measuring cylinders, maximum total percentage uncertainty = \(\frac{(40.5+0.5)}{(35.0+20.0)}\) (100%) = \(\pm\)**1.82%** (3 s.f.)
