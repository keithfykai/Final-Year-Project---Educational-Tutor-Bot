## 1 Introduction CHOON

Arenes are aromatic hydrocarbons. **Aromatic compounds are those possessing the ring structure of benzene or its analogues.** The name "aromatic" originates from the past when many of the known members of the family had pleasant smells, such as benzaldehyde (from cherries, peaches and almonds) and methylbenzene (from Tolu balsam). As chemists discovered more aromatic hydrocarbons, they found that other members of the group possess unpleasant smells and are extremely carcinogenic yet the name remained. Today, aromaticity is used to describe the extra stability of benzene and its structural relatives.

Petroleum, unlike coal, contains only a few aromatic compounds and consists largely of alkanes. However, alkanes, when passed over a catalyst at about 500 \({}^{\circ}\)C under high pressure, can be converted to their aromatic analogues via dehydrogenation and cyclisation (for example, heptane C\({}_{H_{5}}\) can be converted into methylbenzene C\({}_{H_{5}}\)).

Many compounds from natural sources as well as many synthetic drugs are aromatic in part. Similarly, each of the three aromatic amino acids phenylalanine, tryptophan, and tyrosine, also serve as the basic building blocks of proteins.

Figure 1: Examples of aromatic compounds.

#### 1.1.1.1 Benzene

Benzene has a molecular formula of C\({}_{6}\)H\({}_{6}\). The benzene ring is often represented using the skeletal formula as shown below.

#### 1.1.2 Mono-substituted benzenes

When one H atom of benzene is replaced by another atom or group of atoms of less or equals to 6 carbon atoms, the benzene ring is considered the **parent** and a suffix - **benzene** is employed in naming.

Some mono-substituted benzenes are more common such that their conventional names are used instead.

When the substituent is an alkyl group of more than 6 carbon atoms, or when it is too complex to be named conveniently as a prefix, benzene is considered as a **substituent** and named as a prefix - **phenyl**.

### Structure of benzene

Benzene is a planar, aromatic molecule where all carbon atoms that make up the benzene ring are _sp\({}^{2}\)_**hybridised**. Recall from Topic 2 Chemical Bonding where you also learnt about _sp\({}^{2}\)_ hybridisation in the ethene molecule.

In benzene, each carbon is bonded to two other carbons and one hydrogen. The geometry around each carbon atom in benzene is trigonal planar with C-C-C bond angle of 120\({}^{\circ}\). The hybridisation theory proposes that one electron in the 2s orbital (of carbon)is promoted to the empty, 2\(p\) orbital to give 4 unpaired electrons in an excited state. Mixing one s and two p orbitals gives three _sp\({}^{2}\)_ hybrid orbitals directed at 120\({}^{\circ}\) to each other. All three _sp\({}^{2}\)_ hybrid orbitals are identical in shape and energy.

Figure 3: (a) 2s and three 2p orbitals in a carbon atom in excited state before hybridisation (b) _sp\({}^{2}\)_ hybridisation of carbon in benzene.

Carbon atoms in the ring are bonded to one another and to their hydrogen atoms by \(\alpha\) bonds. The \(\alpha\) bond formed between two carbon atoms occurs via the head-on overlap between one \(sp^{2}\) hybrid orbital of one carbon atom with one \(sp^{2}\) hybrid orbital of the adjacent carbon atom. The \(\alpha\) bond formed between one carbon atom and one hydrogen atom occurs via the head-on overlap between one \(sp^{2}\) hybrid orbital of one carbon atom with the 1s orbital of the adjacent hydrogen atom.

The unhybridised \(p\) orbital that is perpendicular to the plane of the ring overlaps side-on with the unhybridised \(p\) orbitals on adjacent carbon atoms. The overlapping \(p\) orbitals produce two continuous rings of \(n\) electrons above and below the plane of the benzene ring, known as the **delocalised \(n\) electron cloud**. The six electrons found in these delocalised \(n\) electron cloud are free to move throughout the entire \(n\) electron cloud, so the electrons are said to be delocalised.

Figure 4: \(\alpha\) bonds between two carbon atoms and between carbon and hydrogen atoms in benzene.

Figure 5: _Delocalised \(n\) electron clouds in benzene._

### Implications of \(\pi\) electron cloud delocalisation (Independent Learning subtopic)

Due to the delocalised \(\pi\) electron cloud in benzene, **all carbon-carbon bond lengths** in benzene are **equal**. This creates a planar, regular hexagonal shape. X-ray measurements of benzene showed that all the carbon-carbon bonds are identical in length and is intermediate between a carbon-carbon single bond length and a carbon-carbon double bond length. The bond energy of carbon-carbon bond in benzene is also between a carbon-carbon single bond energy and a carbon-carbon double bond energy.

The delocalisation of the \(\pi\) electron cloud results in **resonance stabilisation**, giving rise to the **extra stability of benzene**. This extra stability of benzene is also known as the aromaticity of benzene. We can get a quantitative idea of benzene's stability from the comparison of various enthalpy change of hydrogenation. The experimentally determined enthalpy change of hydrogenation of cyclohexene is -118 kJ mol\({}^{-1}\). The experimentally determined enthalpy change of hydrogenation of cyclohexa-1,4-diene is -232 kJ mol\({}^{-1}\), which is approximately twice of the experimentally determined enthalpy change of hydrogenation of cyclohexene. Hence the theoretical prediction for benzene's enthalpy change of hydrogenation, based on the model of 3 alternating C-C and C=C bonds (i.e. hypothetical cyclohexatriene), is -354 kJ mol\({}^{-1}\) (-118 kJ mol\({}^{-1}\) x 3). However, the experimentally determined enthalpy change of hydrogenation of benzene was found to be -205 kJ mol\({}^{-1}\). Hence, benzene is estimated to be more stable than the hypothetical cyclohexatriene by about 354 - 205 - 149 kJ mol\({}^{-1}\). The stabilisation of 149 kJ mol\({}^{-1}\) is known as the stabilisation energy, the delocalisation energy or the resonance energy.

Figure 8: Energy level diagrams for hydrogenation of cyclohexene, cyclohexa-1,4-diene,

Figure 9: Energy level diagrams for hydrogenation of cyclohexene, cyclohexa-1,4-diene,Similar to electron-rich alkenes, n electrons in benzene attracts electrophiles (electron-deficient species). Although benzene is unsaturated, it does not undergo electrophilic addition like alkenes, As a result of the resonance stabilisation due to the delocalisation of the \(\pi\) electron cloud, **benzene undergoes electrophilic substitution** where one or more hydrogen atoms can be substituted by electrophiles. Electrophilic addition destroys the delocalised \(\pi\) electron cloud and this requires a significant amount of energy, which is highly unfavourable. Benzene preferentially undergoes electrophilic substitution reactions, which preserve its aromaticity. The following shows an example of the electrophilic addition in alkenes and the electrophilic substitution in arenes, respectively.

Due to resonance stabilisation from \(\pi\) electron cloud delocalisation, \(\pi\) electron cloud in benzene is less susceptible to attack by electrophiles than C=C in alkenes. As a result, benzene requires a stronger electrophile to react as compared to alkenes. For example, electrophilic addition of cyclohexene using liquid bromine as electrophile can be carried out at room temperature and without a catalyst, whereas electrophilic substitution of benzene with liquid bromine requires warming, and FeBr\({}_{3}\) as a Lewis acid catalyst to generate strong electrophile Br\({}^{+}\) (Refer to Section 4.2). In the slow step of electrophilic substitution, the addition of electrophile Br\({}^{+}\) to benzene give a carbocation intermediate which requires high activation energy due to the loss of aromatic stability. Hence benzene reacts with electrophile slower than alkenes.

The energy profile diagram of bromination of benzene via electrophilic substitution is as follows:

Figure 2: Energy profile diagram of bromination of benzene via electrophilic substitution.

1. Fe in FeX\({}_{3}\) (s) or A/I in A/X\({}_{3}\) (s) can accept a lone pair of electrons from the halogen X\({}_{2}\). Hence FeX\({}_{3}\) (s) or A/N\({}_{3}\) (s) are called the **Lewis acid** (electron pair acceptors) catalyst.
2. FeX\({}_{3}\) (s) or A/X\({}_{3}\) (s) catalyses the electrophilic substitution because they react with halogen X\({}_{2}\) (where X\({}_{2}\) = Cl or Br) to generate a **strong electrophilic** (\(C^{\prime}\) or Br\({}^{\prime}\)).
3. In the **absence** of the Lewis acid catalyst, reaction between benzene and halogen **cannot** take place. This is because halogen molecule \(Cl_{2}\) (g) or Br\({}_{2}\) (_I_) is a **weak electrophile**, unable to activate the resonance-stabilised benzene ring.
4. The reaction conditions must be **anhydrous**. This is because in the presence of water, FeX\({}_{3}\) (s) or A/X\({}_{3}\) (s) will accept lone pair of electrons from water instead, and hence can no longer accept lone pair of electrons from halogen X\({}_{2}\) to generate the strong electrophilic X\({}^{*}\).
5. Fe (s) can also be used instead of FeX\({}_{3}\) (s). This is because when Fe(s) comes into contact with X\({}_{2}\), Lewis acid catalyst FeX\({}_{3}\) (s) is generated _in situ_ according to the redox reaction shown below.
2. The reaction does not occur in the absence of concentrated sulfuric acid.
3. Under more rigorous conditions (e.g. prolonged heat or heating at a higher temperature), nitrobenzene can be further nitrated to give 1,3-dinitrobenzene or 1,3,5-trinitrobenzene. After monontitration, as the nitro substituent is strongly deactivating (Refer to Section 5.4.3), more rigorous conditions are required to result in further nitration. After monontitration, as the nitro substituent is 3-directing (Refer to Section 5.5), it directs incoming electrophile NO\({}_{2}\)* to 3-position to give 1,3-dinitrobenzene.
4. Nitration of benzene is an important first step on the way to a variety of compounds in organic synthesis. For example:
### 4.4 Electrophilic substitution with halogenalkanes (Friedel-Crafts alkylation)

Figure 4.1: The bromination of benzene in the presence of A/Br\({}_{3}\) can be represented by the following mechanism. The enthalpy change of reaction for the bromination of benzene is -43 kl mol\({}^{-1}\).

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:19]

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:20]

These reactivity and directing trends can be explained by considering resonance and inductive effects of substituent on the benzene ring (view the following sections 5.4 and 5.5).

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:23]

#### 5.4.2 Resonance effect

Resonance effect is present when there is overlapping of p orbitals: in this case between the carbon atom of benzene and the substituent that it is bonded to.

### Side-chain reactions of methylbenzene

#### 5.6.1 Free Radical Substitution

During the side-chain halogenation, methylbenzene and other alkylbenzenees undergo free-radical substitution with chlorine or bromine in the presence of UV light or heat. The alkyl side chain reacts like an alkane (Recall from Topic10 Alkanes).

**Observation:**

greenish-yellow Cl\({}_{2}\)(g) decolourises slowly, Reddish brown Br\({}_{2}\)(_l_) decolourises slowly

**Note:** To preferably obtain product of monohalogenation on the alkyl side chain, limited Cl\({}_{2}\)(g) or excess alkylbenzene is usually employed.

More than one chlorine or bromine atom can be incorporated onto the alkyl side chain if excess Cl\({}_{2}\)(g) or Br\({}_{2}\)(_l_) is used. For example:

**a)** Why must the synthesis of 2-bromomethylbenzene from methylbenzene be carried out in the absence of light and without heat?

**b)** Chlorine was passed into methylbenzene under reflux in the presence of aluminium chloride.

#### 5.6.2 Side-Chain Oxidation

When particular alkylbenzenes are heated with aqueous potassium manganate(VII) in the presence of dilute H\({}_{2}\)SO\({}_{4}\) or dilute NaOH, oxidation of the side chain occurs.

For example, ethylbenzene will also undergo side chain oxidation in acidic medium producing benzoic acid but the second carbon in the side chain is oxidised to CO\({}_{2}\)(g).

If the side chain consists of a propyl group (or a longer straight chain alkyl group), the products after oxidation in acidic medium will consist of benzoic acid and the rest of the side chain gets oxidised to a carboxylic acid.

## 6 Distinguishing tests

Bromine in tetrachloromethane can be used as a distinguishing test to differentiate between alkenes and arenes. For example: 1-methylcyclohexene and benzene.

**Procedure for distinguishing test between 1-methylcyclohexene and benzene as example**

**1**: Add bromine in tetrachloromethane dropwise with shaking to 1 cm\({}^{3}\) of each compound in separate test tubes.

**Observations**

Benzene: Reddish-brown Br\({}_{2}\) in CCI\({}_{4}\) not decolourised

1-methylcyclohexene: Reddish-brown Br\({}_{2}\) in CCI\({}_{4}\) decolourises

**Note**

* Bromine in tetrachloromethane is usually employed instead of liquid bromine because it is easier to handle than liquid bromine which is a volatile liquid at rtp that constantly gives rise to toxic bromine gas.
* In the presence of light, both electrophilic addition and free radical substitution occur to 1-methylcyclohexene. However, free radical substitution is not usually used as a distinguishing test.

Aqueous bromine can be used as a distinguishing test to differentiate between alkenes and arenes. For example: 1-methylcyclohexene and benzene.

**Procedure for distinguishing test between 1-methylcyclohexene and benzene as example**

**1**. Add aqueous bromine dropwise with shaking to 1 cm\({}^{3}\) of each compound in separate test tubes.

**Observations**

Benzene: Yellow-orange Br\({}_{2}\)(aq) not decolourised

1-methylcyclohexene: Yellow-orange Br\({}_{2}\)(aq) decolourises

**Note**:

The difference between aqueous bromine and bromine in tetrachloromethane is that in the presence of light, free radical substitution does not occur with the use of aqueous bromine.

## Appendix A Effect on the position of the incoming electrophile

### 2,4-directing groups

**Activating groups and halogens are 2,4-directing.** The reason can be explained by the stability of the carbocation intermediates. The fundamental principle is that "A more stable carbocation is formed faster than a less stable one".

Consider the nitration of methylbenzene in the following example. NO\({}_{2}\) can be added to methylbenzene at 2-, 3- or 4-position to give three carbocation intermediates as shown in the following figure. The carbocation intermediates formed from 2- and 4-substitution are stabilised more than the intermediate formed from 3-substitution. This is because carbocation intermediates formed from 2- and 4-substitution each have a resonance structure where the positive charge is on the methyl-substituted carbon. These carbocation intermediates are stable tertiary carbocations that are stabilised by the electron-donating methyl substituent by inductive effect (see the box). The carbocation intermediates formed from 2- and 4-substitution are therefore more stable and form faster, giving rise to higher product yields of 2-nitrophenylbenzene and 4-nitrophenylbenzene than 3-nitrophenylbenzene.

Figure 11: _Carbocation intermediates in the nitration of methylbenzene. Note: It is more convenient to use one of the resonance structures of toluene for illustration._Consider the nitration of phenol in the following example. The carbocation intermediates formed from 2- and 4-substitution are more stable than the intermediate formed from 3-substitution. This is because carbocation intermediates formed from 2- and 4-substitution each have a resonance structure where the positive charge is stabilised by the electron-donating OH substituent by resonance effect i.e. donation of lone pair from O.

Consider the nitration of chlorobenzene in the following example. The carbocation intermediates formed from 2- and 4-substitution are more stabilised than the intermediate formed from 3-substitution. This is because carbocation intermediates formed from 2- and 4-substitution each have a resonance structure where the positive charge is stabilised by the electron-donating C/ substituent by resonance effect i.e. donation of lone pair from C/.

Figure 12: _Carbocation intermediates in the nitration of phenol. Note: it is more convenient to use one of the resonance structures of phenol for illustration._

Figure 13: _Carbocation intermediates in the nitration of chlorobenzene. Note: It is more convenient to use one of the resonance structures of chlorobenzene for illustration._

### 3-directing groups

**Deactivating groups (with the exception of halogens) are 3-directing.** Consider the nitration of benzaldehyde in the following example. The carbocation intermediates formed from 3-substitution is more stable than the intermediate formed from 2- and 4-substitution. This is because carbocation intermediates formed from 2- and 4-substitution each have a resonance structure where the positive charge is on the carbon bearing the deactivating group. These carbocation intermediates will be destabilised by the electron-withdrawing deactivators by both inductive and resonance effects. (See the box)
