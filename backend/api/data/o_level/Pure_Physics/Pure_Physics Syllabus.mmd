[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:2]

## Introduction

The O-Level physics syllabus provides students with a coherent understanding of energy, matter, and their interrelationships. It focuses on investigating natural phenomena and then applying patterns, models (including mathematical ones), principles, theories and laws to explain the physical behaviour of the universe. The theories and concepts presented in this syllabus belong to a branch of physics commonly referred to as classical physics. Modern physics, developed to explain the quantum properties at the atomic and sub-atomic level, is built on knowledge of these classical theories and concepts.

Students should think of physics in terms of scales. Whereas the classical theories such as Newton's laws of motion apply to common physical systems that are larger than the size of atoms, a more comprehensive theory, quantum theory, is needed to describe systems at the atomic and sub-atomic scales. It is at these scales that physicists are currently making new discoveries and inventing new applications.

It is envisaged that teaching and learning programmes based on this syllabus would feature a wide variety of learning experiences designed to promote acquisition of scientific expertise and understanding, and to develop values and attitudes relevant to science. Teachers are encouraged to use a combination of appropriate strategies to effectively engage and challenge their students. It is expected that students will apply investigative and problem-solving skills, effectively communicate the theoretical concepts covered in this course and appreciate the contribution physics makes to our understanding of the physical world.

## Aims

The syllabus aims to:

1. provide a worthwhile educational experience for all students, whether or not they go on to study science beyond this level
2. develop in students the understanding, and skills relevant to the practices of science, and enable them to 2.1 appreciate practical applications of Physics in the real world 2.2 deepen their interest in Physics for future learning and work 2.3 become scientifically literate citizens who can innovate and seize opportunities in the 21st century 2.4 use the disciplinary ideas in Physics to approach, analyse and solve problems in the physical world
3. develop in students the values, ethics and attitudes relevant to science such as 3.1 curiosity - desiring to explore the environment and question what is found 3.2 creativity - seeking innovative and relevant ways to solve problems 3.3 integrity - handling and communicating data and information with complete honesty 3.4 objectivity - seeking data and information to validate observations and explanations without bias 3.5 open-mindedness - accepting all knowledge as tentative and suspending judgement, tolerance for ambiguity, willingness to change views if the evidence is convincing3.6 resilience - not giving up on the pursuit of answers/solutions, willingness to take risks and embrace failure as part of the learning process
3.7 responsibility - showing care and concern for living things and awareness of our responsibility for the quality of the environment
3.8 healthy scepticism - questioning the observations, methods, processes and data, as well as trying to review one's own ideas

## 2 Practices of Science

The _Practices of Science_ represent the set of established procedures and practices associated with scientific inquiry, what scientific knowledge is and how it is generated and established, and how Science is applied in society respectively. It consists of three components:

1. **Demonstrating Ways of Thinking and Doing in Science (WoTD)** 1.1 Posing questions and defining problems 1.2 Designing investigations 1.3 Conducting experiments and testing solutions 1.4 Analysing and interpreting data 1.5 Communicating, evaluating and defending ideas with evidence 1.6 Making informed decisions and taking responsible actions 1.7 Using and developing models 1.8 Constructing explanations and designing solutions
2. **Understanding the Nature of Scientific Knowledge (NOS)** 2.1 Science is an evidence-based, model-building enterprise concerned with understanding the natural world 2.2 Science assumes there are natural causes for physical phenomena and an order and consistency in natural systems 2.3 Scientific knowledge is generated using a set of established procedures and practices, and through a process of critical debate within the scientific community 2.4 Scientific knowledge is reliable and durable, yet open to change in the light of new evidence
3. **Relating Science, Technology, Society and Environment (STSE)** 3.1 There are risks and benefits associated with the application of science in society. Science and its applications have the potential to bring about both benefits and harm to society 3.2 Applications of science often have ethical, social, economic and environmental implications 3.3 Applications of new scientific discoveries often inspire technological advancements while advances in technology motivate scientists to ask new questions and/or empower scientists in their inquiry (e.g. collecting more precise data or carrying out more complex data analysis)The _Practices of Science_ serve to highlight that the discipline of Science is more than the acquisition of a _body of knowledge_ (e.g. scientific facts, concepts, laws, and theories); it is also a way of _thinking and doing_. In particular, it is important to appreciate that the cognitive, epistemic and social aspects of the _Practices of Science_ are intricately related. For example, observation of events can lead to the generation of scientific knowledge which is, simultaneously, shaped by the beliefs of scientific knowledge. In addition, scientists develop models to construct theories, based on the assumption that there is order and consistency in natural systems. The practice of theory-making, in turn, reinforces the explanatory power of scientific knowledge. The scientific endeavour is embedded in the wider ethical, social, economic and environmental contexts.

## 3 Disciplinary Ideas of Physics

The disciplinary ideas of Physics represent the overarching ideas essential for the understanding of Physics. An understanding of these ideas helps students see the interconnectedness of ideas within and across the sub-disciplines of Physics. Equipping students with a coherent view and conceptual framework facilitates the application and transfer of learning. These disciplinary ideas can be revisited and deepened at higher levels of learning and beyond the schooling years.

Disciplinary ideas are introduced at the upper secondary levels when students begin to specialise in the sub-disciplines of science.

1. Matter and energy make up the Universe
2. Matter interacts through forces and fields
3. Forces help us understand motion
4. Waves can transfer energy without transferring matter
5. Conservation laws constrain the changes in systems
6. Microscopic models can explain macroscopic phenomena

## Section II: Newtonian mechanics

### Overview

Mechanics is the branch of physics that deals with the study of motion and its causes. Through a careful process of observation and experimentation, Galileo Galilei used experiments to overturn Aristotle's ideas of the motion of objects, for example the flawed idea that heavy objects fall faster than lighter ones, which dominated physics for about 2000 years.

The greatest contribution to the development of mechanics is by one of the greatest physicists of all time, Isaac Newton. By extending Galileo's methods and understanding of motion and gravitation, Newton developed the three laws of motion and his law of universal gravitation, and successfully applied them to both terrestrial and celestial systems to predict and explain phenomena. He showed that nature is governed by a few special rules or laws that can be expressed in mathematical formulae. Newton's combination of logical experimentation and mathematical analysis shaped the way science has been done ever since.

## Section III: Thermal Physics

### Overview

When asked what was the most valuable scientific information in a single sentence, Richard Feynman response was, 'All things are made of atoms - little particles that move around in perpetual motion, attracting each other when they are a little distance apart, but repelling upon being squeezed into one another. In that one sentence... there is an enormous amount of information about the world.' (Six Easy Pieces, p.4)

Understanding thermal physics requires us to approach the concepts from both the macroscopic and microscopic lenses. The _Kinetic Particle Model of Matter_ is a cornerstone theory that is used extensively to explain how different types of matter exhibit certain physical properties by relating them to behaviour of atoms and molecules.

By nature, energy exchange takes place between bodies of different temperatures until thermal equilibrium is reached. Energy may be transferred between bodies by heating through processes like conduction, convection and radiation. These processes could cause changes in the molecular structure of matter and result in macroscopic observations, e.g. monsoon winds and ocean currents observed are convectional currents produced in the process of regulating differences in temperature.

## Section IV: Waves

### Overview

All waves have properties in common and a wave model can be used to explain many phenomena, both natural (like water waves and sound) and artificial (like many forms of electromagnetic waves). The ability of waves to transfer energy at great speed provides valuable propositions.

Much of our current understanding of wave motion has come from the study of acoustics, which is the science of sound. Many of the ancient Greek philosophers were interested in music. They had hypothesized that there was a connection between waves and sound, and that vibrations must be responsible for sounds. Pythagoras observed in 550 BC that vibrating strings produced sound and worked to determine the mathematical relationships between the lengths of strings that made harmonious tones.

Scientific theories of wave propagation became more prominent in the 17th Century, when Galileo Galilei published a clear statement that connected vibrating bodies to the sounds they produce. In 1640 Robert Boyle's classic experiment on the sound produced by a ticking watch in a partially evacuated glass vessel provided evidence that air is necessary, either for the production or transmission of sound.

The mathematical theory of sound propagation began with Isaac Newton, whose _Principia_ (1686) included a mechanical interpretation of sound as being 'pressure' pulses transmitted through neighbouring fluid particles. In the 18th Century, French mathematician and scientist Jean Le Rond d'Alembert derived the wave equation, a thorough and general mathematical description of waves, which laid the foundation for generations of scientists to study and describe wave phenomena.

## Section V: Electricity and magnetism

### Overview

Electricity and magnetism were seen as separate and independent phenomena in the past. It only was when Danish physicist Hans Christian _O_rsted discovered, accidentally, in 1820 that a magnetic needle is deflected when the current in a nearby wire varies - a phenomenon establishing a relationship between electricity and magnetism.

Inspired by _O_rsted's discovery, Andre-Marie Ampere conducted a series of experiments in the same year to designed to elucidate the exact nature of the relationship between electric current-flow and magnetism. Further works by Michael Faraday reinforced the magnetic effect of a current and introduced the idea of a 'field' of action to explain why electricity and magnetism had and 'area of activity'.

However, it was the work of James Clerk Maxwell, a mathematical physicist, who provided mathematical tools and equations to describe Faraday's ideas of the field. His works went on to prove that electromagnetic fields have wave-like properties which was a very important discovery in physics.

## Section VI: Radioactivity

### Overview

Radioactivity was first discovered through the handling of radioactive uranium by physicists Pierre and Marie Curie during which they suffered radioactive burns due to inadequate handling of the substance. _Radioactivity_ is the study of the nature of the radiation emitted by radioactive materials. It was later understood that there are three types of emissions: the alpha particles (helium atoms with no electrons), beta particles (fast moving electrons) and the gamma rays (electromagnetic radiation similar to X-rays). These emissions are the result of the decay or disintegration of an unstable atomic nucleus.

Radioactivity have important medical uses, which include the killing of cancer cells. However excessive exposure to radioactivity can cause cancer if the dose is too high. Many early scientists working with radioactive materials died early from the harmful effects of high radiation before proper safety guidelines were drawn. 'Radiometric dating' makes use of a radioactive element's half-life to help determine the age of rocks or carbon.

Large amounts of energy are also involved in radioactive emissions and physicists quickly recognized the power of this. Many scientists working on this from 1930 to 1940 in Europe were forced to leave their home countries, fleeing to the United States due to the development of the war. This led to a 'brain drain' which benefited the United States and allowed them to develop the two atomic bombs which ended the war. This highlights the impact on science on society and human interactions. Since the development of the atomic bomb, much has been learnt about how to control the release of energy and nuclear power can generate electricity with only a fraction of the greenhouse gases released by burning coal and other fossil fuels.

Because radiation cannot be easily seen, it is commonly feared and shunned. Coupled with news about the dangers of nuclear radiation and the potential detriments to health, the general public is apprehensive about the use and application of any form of radiation. This topic aims to provide an objective evaluation of the risks and benefits of the use of radiation through the development of a good understanding of the many practical uses of radioactive materials.

## Practical Assessment

Scientific subjects are, by their nature, experimental. It is therefore important that an assessment of a candidate's knowledge and understanding of science should include a component relating to practical work and experimental skills.

This assessment is provided in Paper 3 as a formal practical test and is outlined in the _Scheme of Assessment_.

### Paper 3 Practical

This paper is designed to assess a candidate's competence in those practical skills which can realistically be assessed within the context of a formal practical assessment.

Candidates will be assessed in the following skill areas:

1. Planning (P) Candidates should be able to: * identify key variables for a given question/problem * outline an experimental procedure to investigate the question/problem * describe how the data should be used in order to reach a conclusion * identify the risks of the experiment and state precautions that should be taken to keep risks to a minimum 2. Manipulation, measurement and observation (MMO) Candidates should be able to: * set up apparatus correctly by following written instructions or diagrams * use common laboratory apparatus and techniques to collect data and make observations * describe and explain how apparatus and techniques are used correctly * make and record accurate observations with good details and measurements to an appropriate degree of precision * make appropriate decisions about measurements or observations 3. Presentation of data and observations (PDO) Candidates should be able to: * present all information in an appropriate form * manipulate measurements effectively for analysis * present all quantitative data to an appropriate number of decimal places / significant figures* Analysis, conclusions and evaluation (ACE)
* Candidates should be able to:
* analyse and interpret data or observations appropriately in relation to the task
* draw conclusion(s) from the interpretation of experimental data or observations and underlying principles
* make predictions based on their data and conclusions
* identify significant sources of errors and explain how they affect the results
* state and explain how significant errors may be overcome or reduced, as appropriate, including how experimental procedures may be improved

One, or more, of the questions may incorporate some assessment of skill area P, set in the context of the syllabus content, requiring candidates to apply and integrate knowledge and understanding from different sections of the syllabus. It may also require the treatment of given experimental data in drawing relevant conclusion and analysis of proposed plan.

The assessment of skills MMO, PDO and ACE will be set mainly in the context of the syllabus content. The assessment of PDO and ACE may also include questions on data-analysis which do not require practical equipment and apparatus.

Candidates are not allowed to refer to notebooks, textbooks or any other information during the assessment.

Candidates should be able to make measurements or determinations of physical quantities such as mass, length, area, volume, time, current and potential difference. Candidates should be aware of the need to take simple precautions for safety and/or accuracy. Candidates will be required to follow the instructions given in the question paper and answer on the question paper itself.

Candidates may be asked to carry out exercises based on:

1. measurements of (i) length by using tapes, rules, digital calipers and digital micrometers (ii) time interval (including period of a simple pendulum) by using digital stopwatches (iii) volume of solids/liquids by using measuring cylinders (iv) mass and weight by using electronic balances and spring balances (v) temperature by using laboratory thermometers (vi) current and voltage by using ammeters and voltmeters
2. determination of the density of a liquid, or of a regularly or irregularly shaped solid that sinks in water
3. determination of the value of the acceleration of free fall
4. investigation of the effects of balanced and unbalanced forces
5. the principle of moments
6. determination of the position of the centre of gravity of a plane lamina
7. investigation of the factors affecting transfer of energy by thermal processes
8. determination of heat capacities of materials
9. latent heat of substances
10. the law of reflection
11. determination of the position and characteristics of an optical image formed by a plane mirror or a thin converging lens
12. the refraction of light through glass blocks13. the principle of total internal reflection
14. the focal length of lenses
15. determination of the speed, wavelength and frequency of waves
16. determination of the resistance of a circuit
17. investigation of the magnetic effect of current in a conductor
18. investigation of the effects of electromagnetic induction

This is not intended to be an exhaustive list. Candidates are expected to be familiar with the use of data-loggers. Assessment of skill area P may include the appropriate use of data-loggers.

Responsibility for safety matters rests with Centres.

Reference may be made to the techniques used in these experiments in the theory papers but no detailed description of the experimental procedures will be required.

Within the Scheme of Assessment, the practical paper constitutes 20% of the O-Level Physics examination. It is therefore recommended that the schemes of work include learning opportunities that apportion a commensurate amount of time for the development and acquisition of practical skills.

### Apparatus List

This list below gives guidance to Centres concerning the apparatus and items that are expected to be generally available for examination purposes. The list is not intended to be exhaustive.

The apparatus and materials requirement for Paper 3 will vary from year to year. Centres will be notified in advance of the details of the apparatus and materials required for each practical examination.

It is intended that candidates should have 55 minutes with the apparatus for each section of the paper. Please note the requirement to provide a seating plan of the examination, as indicated on the instructions. It is essential that candidates are warned of these arrangements in advance. Spare sets of apparatus must be available to allow for breakages and malfunctions.

### General marking points

#### Taking readings

During the course of their preparation for this paper, candidates should be taught to observe the following points of good practice, which are often featured in the mark scheme. A measuring instrument should be used to its full precision. Thermometers are often marked with intervals of 1\({}^{\circ}\) C. It is appropriate to record a reading which coincides exactly with a mark as, for example, 22.0\({}^{\circ}\) C, rather than as a bald 22\({}^{\circ}\) C. Interpolation between scale divisions should be to better than one half of a division. For example, consider a thermometer with scale divisions of 1\({}^{\circ}\) C. A reading of 22.3\({}^{\circ}\) C might best be recorded as 22.5\({}^{\circ}\) C, since '0.3' is nearer '0.5' than '0'. That is, where a reading lies between two scale marks, an attempt should be made to interpolate between those two marks, rather than simply rounding to the nearest mark. The length of an object measured on a rule with a centimetre and millimetre scale should be recorded as 12.0 cm rather than a bald 12 cm, if the ends of the object coincide exactly with the 0 and 12 cm marks.

A measurement or calculated quantity must be accompanied by a correct unit, where appropriate.

#### Recording readings

A table of results should include, in the heading of each column, the name or symbol of the measured or calculated quantity, together with the appropriate unit. Solidus notation is expected. Each reading should be repeated, if possible, and recorded. The number of significant figures given for calculated quantities should be the same as the least number of significant figures in the raw data used. A ratio should be calculated as a decimal number, to two or three significant figures.

#### Drawing graphs

A graph should be drawn with a sharp pencil. The axes should be labelled with quantity and unit. The scales for the axes should allow the majority of the graph paper to be used in both directions and be based on sensible ratios, e.g. 2 cm on the graph paper representing 1 or 2 or 5 units of the variable (or 10, 20 or 50, etc.). Each data point should be plotted to an accuracy better than one half of one of the smallest squares on the grid. Points should be indicated by a small cross or a fine dot with a circle drawn around it. Large 'dots' are penalised. Where a straight line is required to be drawn through the data points, Examiners expect to see an equal number of points either side of the line over its entire length. That is, points should not be seen to lie all above the line at one end, and all below the line at the other end. The gradient of a straight line should be taken by using a triangle with a hypotenuse that extends over at least half the length of the candidate's line. Data values should be read from the line to an accuracy better than one half of one of the smallest squares on the grid. The same accuracy should be used in reading off an intercept. Calculation of the gradient should be to two or three significant figures.

## Mathematical Requirements

### Arithmetic

Candidates should be able to:

1. recognise and use expressions in decimal and standard form (scientific) notation
2. use appropriate calculating aids (electronic calculator or tables) for addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. Find arithmetic means, powers (including reciprocals and square roots), sines, cosines and tangents (and the inverse functions)
3. take account of accuracy in numerical work and handle calculations so that significant figures are neither lost unnecessarily nor carried beyond what is justified, rounding answers correctly when necessary
4. make approximations and estimates to obtain reasonable answers

### Algebra

Candidates should be able to:

1. change the subject of an equation
2. solve simple algebraic equations, including linear simultaneous equations
3. use direct and inverse proportion
4. substitute physical quantities into physical equations using consistent units
5. formulate simple algebraic equations as mathematical models of physical situations and to represent information given in words

### Geometry and trigonometry

Candidates should be able to:

1. understand the meaning of angle, curve, circle, radius, diameter, square, parallelogram, rectangle and diagonal
2. calculate areas of right-angled triangles, circumference and area of circles, areas and volumes of rectangular blocks, volumes of cylinders
3. use Pythagoras' theorem, the angle sum of a right angle and adjacent angles on a straight line
4. use sines, cosines and tangents
5. use usual mathematical instruments (rules, compasses, protractor, set square)
6. recognise and use points of the compass (N, S, E, W)

#### Graphs

Candidates should be able to:

1. translate information between graphical, numerical, algebraic and verbal forms
2. select appropriate variables and scales for graph plotting
3. for linear graphs, determine the slope and state the intercept and intersection
4. choose, by inspection, a straight line which will serve as the line of best fit through a set of data points presented graphically
5. recall standard linear form y = mx + c and rearrange relationships into linear form where appropriate
6. understand, draw and use the slope of a tangent to a curve as a means to obtain the gradient

## Glossary of Terms

It is hoped that the glossary will prove helpful to candidates as a guide, although it is not exhaustive. The glossary has been deliberately kept brief not only with respect to the number of terms included but also to the descriptions of their meanings. Candidates should appreciate that the meaning of a term must depend in part on its context. They should also note that the number of marks allocated for any part of a question is a guide to the depth of treatment required for the answer.

1. _Define (the term(s)...)_ is intended literally. Only a formal statement or equivalent paraphrase, such as the defining equation with symbols identified, is required.
2. _Explain/What is meant by..._ normally implies that a definition should be given, together with some relevant comment on the significance or context of the term(s) concerned, especially where two or more terms are included in the question. The amount of supplementary comment intended should be interpreted in the light of the indicated mark value.
3. _State_ implies a concise answer with little or no supporting argument, e.g. a numerical answer that can be obtained 'by inspection'.
4. _List_ requires a number of points with no elaboration. Where a given number of points is specified, this should not be exceeded.
5. _Describe_ requires candidates to state in words (using diagrams where appropriate) the main points of the topic. It is often used with reference either to particular phenomena or to particular experiments. In the former instance, the term usually implies that the answer should include reference to (visual) observations associated with the phenomena. The amount of description intended should be interpreted in the light of the indicated mark value.
6. _Discuss_ requires candidates to give a critical account of the points involved in the topic.
7. _Predict_ or _deduce_ implies that candidates are not expected to produce the required answer by recall but by making a logical connection between other pieces of information. Such information may be wholly given in the question or may depend on answers extracted in an earlier part of the question.
8. _Suggest_ is used in two main contexts. It may either imply that there is no unique answer or that candidates are expected to apply their general knowledge to a 'novel' situation, one that formally may not be 'in the syllabus'.
9. _Calculate_ is used when a numerical answer is required. In general, working should be shown.
10. _Measure_ implies that the quantity concerned can be directly obtained from a suitable measuring instrument, e.g. length, using a rule, or angle, using a protractor.
11. _Determine_ often implies that the quantity concerned cannot be measured directly but is obtained by calculation, substituting measured or known values of other quantities into a standard formula.
12. _Show_ is used when an algebraic deduction has to be made to prove a given equation. It is important that the terms being used by candidates are stated explicitly.
13. _Estimate_ implies a reasoned order of magnitude statement or calculation of the quantity concerned. Candidates should make such simplifying assumptions as may be necessary about points of principle and about the values of quantities not otherwise included in the question.
14. _Sketch_, when applied to graph work, implies that the shape and/or position of the curve need only be qualitatively correct. However, candidates should be aware that, depending on the context, some quantitative aspects may be looked for, e.g. passing through the origin, having an intercept, asymptote or discontinuity at a particular value. On a sketch graph it is essential that candidates clearly indicate what is being plotted on each axis.

_Sketch_, when applied to diagrams, implies that a simple, freehand drawing is acceptable: nevertheless, care should be taken over proportions and the clear exposition of important details.

## SPECIAL NOTE

### Nomenclature

The proposals in 'Signs, Symbols and Systematics (_The Association for Science Education Companion to 16-19 Science, 2000_)' will generally be adopted.

### Units, significant figures

Candidates should be aware that misuse of units and/or significant figures, i.e. failure to quote units where necessary, the inclusion of units in quantities defined as ratios or quoting answers to an inappropriate number of significant figures, is liable to be penalised.

### Calculators

An approved calculator may be used in all papers.

### Geometrical Instruments

Candidates should have geometrical instruments with them for Paper 1 and Paper 2.
