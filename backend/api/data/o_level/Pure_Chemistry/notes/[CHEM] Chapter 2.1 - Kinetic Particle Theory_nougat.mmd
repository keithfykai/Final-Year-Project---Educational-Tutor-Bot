KINETIC PARTICLE THEORY OF MATTER

The theory states that:

all matter consist of **particles** that are too small to be directly visible,

the particles are always in a constant state of **random motion** at varying speeds.

## 6 Freezing (LIQUID TO SOLID)

At A, the particles have lost enough kinetic energy and freezing starts.

The particles after losing most of their kinetic energy, **no longer have enough energy to overcome the forces of attraction** between themselves and would **return to their fixed position.**

Between A and B, the freezing process is ongoing. The **temperature remains constant** because **heat energy is being released to the surroundings.** The release of heat energy negates the cooling effect resulting in the temperature remaining is constant.

A mixture of solid and liquid is present during this stage.

## Conclusion (Gas to Liquid)

At A, the particles lost much of its kinetic energy and condensation starts.

During condensation, the particles **loses most of its energy to that was used to overcome the forces of attraction** between themselves resulting in them coming closer together.

**Heat energy is released** to the surroundings as particles slow down and become more closely packed. The **release of heat energy negates the cooling effect** resulting in the **temperature remaining constant.**

A mixture of gas and liquid is present during this stage.

**SUBLIIMATION & DEPOSITION**

**Common Substances**

**Iodine** is a dark purple solid at room temperature. When low heat is applied, it undergoes sublimation and becomes a violet gas.

**Dry ice** is frequently used as a cooling agent to keep temperatures low. It is used instead of normal ice as it sublimes to form gaseous carbon dioxide, rather than water.

**GAS/LIQUID PARTICLES**

**DIFUSION**

**MOVEMENT OF MOLECULES**

## 6 Discussion

Diffusion is the movement of molecules from a region of higher concentration to a region of lower concentration.

During diffusion, gas or liquid particles would move to available spaces in a container through random motion, mixing thoroughly in the process.

Diffusion in liquid* 5. Under the same conditions, which gas diffuses at the same rate as nitrogen gas? (N2018/P1/Q1)
* A carbon dioxide B carbon monoxide C neon D sulfur dioxide ( )
* 5. B
* 6. A the same room temperature and pressure, N, and CO will diffuse at the same rate as they have the same molecular mass.

* 6. The rate of diffusion of two gases is measured at different temperatures but at constant pressure. Which would diffuse most quickly? (N2020/P1/Q5)
* A argon at 15\({}^{\circ}\)C
* B carbon dioxide at 15\({}^{\circ}\)C
* D carbon dioxide at 40\({}^{\circ}\)C
* ( )
