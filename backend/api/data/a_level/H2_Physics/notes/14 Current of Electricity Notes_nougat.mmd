#### 14.1 Introduction

The figure above shows a closed electrical circuit. There is a continuous conducting path, provided by the connecting wires, for electrical charges to flow from one terminal of the source of e.m.f. to one or more devices, like a resistor, and then back to the other terminal. To analyse such a closed circuit, we shall now look at the different parts of the electrical circuit.

#### 14.2 Electric Current/Ex Chapter 2

Whenever charged particles move, an electric current is said to exist.

Electric current is defined as the rate of flow of charges

Suppose charges are moving perpendicular to a surface of area \(A\) as shown in the figure below. (This area \(A\) could be the cross sectional area of a wire, for example.)

If \(\Delta Q\) is the amount of charge passing through this surface in a time interval \(\Delta t\), the average electric current \(I_{\text{ave}}\) is equal to the net charges that pass through the area per unit time.

If the rate at which charges flow varies with time, the Instantaneous current \(I\) is defined as the differential limit of average current.

\[I=\lim_{\Delta t\to 0}\frac{\Delta Q}{\Delta t}=\frac{dQ}{dt} \tag{2}\]

### 14.4 Electronics Force (Gunn) /2

\begin{tabular}{c|c} \hline E.m.f. \(E\) and Its Unit & When an electric current is flowing through conductors in a closed circuit, electrical energy is continuously dissipated as heat or other forms of energy. In order to sustain this constant flow of electric current, a source of electromotive force (e.m.f.) is needed. Sources of e.m.f. are any devices which can be likened to a "charge pump" in which electrical energy is converted from chemical, mechanical or other forms of energy (such as batteries, generators, solar cells and fuel cells). \\ \end{tabular}

\begin{tabular}{c|c} \hline The electromotive force of a source is defined as the amount of electrical energy per unit charge that is converted _from_ other forms of energy to drive charges around a complete circuit. \\ \end{tabular}

In equation form,

\[E=\frac{W}{Q} \tag{7}\]

The S.I. unit for e.m.f. is also the **volt, V**.

It is important to note that e.m.f. is not a force as the name may suggest.

As an example, for a battery with an e.m.f. of 1.5 V, 1.5 J of chemical energy is converted into electrical energy with every coulomb of charge the battery drives through the circuit.

### Resistance \(R\) and \(R\)

The electric current in a conductor depends on the potential difference applied across the conductor and its resistance.

By looking at how the current through a material varies with the potential difference across it, it is possible to differentiate between ohmic and non-ohmic materials/devices. Components

_Metallic Conductor at Constant Temperature (Ohmic)_

It has been found experimentally that if the temperature of a conductor is kept constant, its resistance will remain constant.

The _I-V_ characteristic is a straight-line graph through the origin.

This means that

* \(I\) is proportional to \(V\left(I\propto V\right)\)
* ratio \(\frac{V}{I}\) is constant
* thus, resistance \(R\) is constant

The temperature can be kept constant by immersing the conductor in a water bath.

A diode is a semiconductor device which allows current to flow in one direction only.

_Diode_

Under forward-bias, the current through a diode increases very rapidly when the voltage rises above about 0.7 V (turn-on voltage), and a diode in forward-biased has a very low resistance.

Under reverse-bias, the current through a diode is very small. A diode in reverse-bias has a very high resistance. The current is a few \(\upmu\)A and appears to be zero on a graph, if the same scale is used for both forward and reverse-bias.

The circuits below show diodes arranged in forward-bias and reverse-bias. The diode conducts only when it is forward-biased. There is no current (or only a very small current - less than 1 mA) when it is reverse-biased.

There are two effects that affect the resistivities of material when temperature increases.

associated with an increase in temperature

Effect 1: increase in number of free electrons

As its temperature rises, more electrons are able to break free from the atoms. The material then becomes a better electrical conductor with more free electrons.

Effect 2: ions vibrate faster and with greater amplitudes

The temperature of the material increases as electrons lose their kinetic energies to the ions. As the material becomes hotter, its ions vibrate faster and with greater amplitudes, making it even more difficult for electrons to pass through the lattice.

Let us look at these effects in the metallic conductors (e.g. filament lamp) and in negative temperature coefficient (NTC) thermistors (made out of semiconductors).

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|} \hline _Materials_ & _Metallic conductors_ & _Semiconductor_ \\ _Metallic_ & _(e.g. filament lamp)_ & _NTC thermistors_ \\ _conductors_ & _Effect 1_ & As the electrons are free at room temperature, any increase in temperature will not cause an appreciable increase in number of charged particles. & In semiconductors, the number of free electrons is small compared to that in metals. Hence it is a poor conductor at low temperatures. As its temperature rises, more and more electrons break free from the atoms. The semiconductor then becomes a better electrical conductor with more free electrons and holes._ \\ \hline _Effect 2_ & The temperature of the filament increases as the metal acquires energy due to its collision with electrons. Its ions vibrate faster and with greater amplitudes, increasing the frequency of collision with the electrons. As a result, resistance increases. & The temperature of the semiconductor increases as electrons lose their kinetic energies to the ions. As a semiconductor becomes hotter, its ions vibrate faster and with greater amplitudes, making it even more difficult for electrons to pass through the lattice.

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|} \hline _Change in resistance_ & As effect 1 is not significant and effect 2 is present, resistance increase as temperature increases. & As effect 1 is greater than effect 2, resistance decreases as temperature increases. A thermistor is thus termed a NTC thermistor. \\ \hline \end{tabular}

### 14.6 Electrical Power 2

As shown earlier in equation (6), if a charge \(Q\) moves through a p.d. \(V\), the amount of electrical energy converted to other forms is

\[W=QV\]

The rate at which energy conversion takes place is

\[P=\frac{\alpha W}{dt}=\frac{d(QV)}{dt}=\frac{dQ}{dt}V=IV \tag{11}\]

This equation applies for any electrical device.

The S.I. unit for power is the **watt**, W. (1 W = 1 J s-1)

\begin{tabular}{c c} Power & From equation (7), for an ideal source of e.m.f. \(E\), work done by the source is \\ Supplied by & an Ideal & \(W=QE\) \\ Source & & (12) \\ \end{tabular}

\begin{tabular}{c c} Power & From equation (8), the p.d. across a resistor is \\ Dissipated by & a Resistor & \\ \end{tabular}

\[V=IR \tag{14}\]

The rate at which energy is dissipated across a resistor is

\[P=IV\]

\[P=I\times\left(IR\right)=I^{2}R \tag{15}\]

\[\text{OR}\qquad P=\left(\frac{V}{R}\right)\times V=\frac{V^{2}}{R} \tag{16}\]

Another unit & To measure the consumption of electrical energy, the unit **kilowatt-hour** (kWh), is sometimes used instead of the (J). One kilowatt-hour is the electrical energy consumed in one hour by a device with a power rating of one kW.

(Note: 1 kWh = 1000 W x 3600 s = 3.6 x 10\({}^{6}\) J)

(b) the cost of running the heating element for 5 hours, if electricity costs $0.17 per kWh. [Re resistivity of nichrome is \(1.10\times 10^{-4}\)\(\Omega\) m]

(a) Current through resistor: \(I=\frac{P}{V}=\frac{20}{12}\) A

Resistance of resistor: \(R=\frac{V}{I}=\frac{12}{20/12}=7.2\)\(\Omega\)

From \(R=\rho\frac{I}{A}\),

\(I=\frac{RA}{\rho}=\frac{7.2\times\left[\left(1.0\times 10^{-3}\right)\left(0.050 \times 10^{-3}\right)\right]}{1.10\times 10^{-6}}=0.327\) m

In an ideal circuit,

* the e.m.f. source would have no resistance,
* the connecting wires would have no resistance, and
* the terminal p.d. \(V\) of the cell = e.m.f. \(E\) of the cell.

However, real cells have internal resistance \(r\). Hence, not all electrical energy generated is available to the external load \(R\). Some of these energy is lost as heat within the cell due to its internal resistance. As a result, the terminal p.d. is not equal to the e.m.f. of the source.

\begin{tabular}{c|c} _Model of a real_ & A real battery can be modelled as follows

In the external load \(R\),

\begin{tabular}{c c} power dissipated as heat, & \(P_{R}=I^{3}R=IV_{R}\) \\ \end{tabular}

By the principle of conservation of energy,

Power supplied by source = Power dissipated through \(r\) and \(R\)

\(P_{S}=P_{r}+P_{R}\)

\(IE=I^{2}r+I^{2}R\)

\(E=I\left(r+R\right)\) (17)

Also

\(P_{S}=P_{r}+P_{R}\)

\(IE=IV_{r}+IV_{R}\)

\(E=Ir+V_{R}\)

\(V_{R}=E-Ir\) (18)

The terminal p.d. is \(V=V_{R}=E-Ir\).

A plot of the terminal p.d. against current is shown below.

When no current flows (i.e. \(R\rightarrow\infty\)),

PHYSICS DEPATHENT

A resistor is a circuit element designed to have a known resistance. Resistors are found in almost all electronic devices. The resistance of a resistor is indicated by a colour-code system on the resistor. There are resistors with 4, 5 and 6-band colour codes. For a 4-band colour code, there are usually four coloured stripes on the resistor. The first three coloured stripes indicate the value of its resistance. The first gives the first digit, the second gives the second digit and the third provides the multiplier. The multiplier is the power of ten used to multiply the two-digit number determined from the first two stripes. The table below gives the digits associated with each colour. The fourth stripe on the resistor indicates its tolerance or accuracy. The most commonly used resistors are reliable to within \(\pm\) 5% of their indicated value.
