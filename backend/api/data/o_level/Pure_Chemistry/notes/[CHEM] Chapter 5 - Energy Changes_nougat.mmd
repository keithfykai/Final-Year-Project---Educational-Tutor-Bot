## 5 Experiment

An exothermic reaction occurs where energy is expelled out to the surroundings.

Examples of exothermic processes would include **condensation** and **freezing** as heat is expelled out to the surroundings to lower the units' temperature.

**- Combustion reactions** are also exothermic. Burning a hydrocarbon in the presence of oxygen will produce heat and raise the temperature of the surroundings.

\(\text{C}_{\text{J}}\text{H}_{\text{e}}\left(\text{g}\right)+3\text{O}_{\text{ g}}\left(\text{g}\right)\text{\textgreater 2 CO}_{\text{2}}\left(\text{g}\right)+2\text{H}_{\text{2}}\left( \text{0}\right)+\text{heat}\)

**- Neutralisation reactions** are also exothermic. Heat is produced when H' ions undergo bond forming with OH' ions to form water.

H' (aq) + OH' (aq) + H\({}_{\text{2}}\left(\text{0}\right)+\text{heat}\)

## Chapter 5 Endothermic Reaction

An endothermic reaction occurs when energy is absorbed from the surroundings.

Examples of endothermic process are **melting and boiling** where heat energy is absorbed to change states.

**- Dissoking ionic salts in water** is endothermic. For example, dissolving sodium chloride in water causes the temperature of the solution to decrease.

NaCl (s) + heat -> NaCl (aq)

**- Thermal decomposition** is an endothermic process as heat is required for most compounds to be decomposed.

PbCO\({}_{3}\) (s) + heat -> PbO (s) + CO\({}_{2}\) (g)

**- Electrolysis** is an endothermic reaction which occurs without absorbing heat energy. Instead, electrolysis occurs by **absorbing in electrical energy** for a reaction.

## Energy Profile

### Energy Profile

In asymmetric reactions, reaction loss energy to the surroundings of the form resulting particles, rates are energy lost to the negative is lower than the energy lost to the total reactants.

In asymmetric reactions, reaction gain energy from the surroundings to form continuous products, into the energy lost of the reaction is higher than the energy lost of the initial reactions.
