## 3 types of bonds

Understanding all 3 types of bonds is needed to

master this chapter while paying special attention to

**keywords** you must include in your answers.

For each type of bond, you must be able to explain:

- How the bond is formed

- The dot-k-cross diagram

- The structure

- Physical properties (with explanations)

## Covalent Bonds

Covalent bonds are formed between **non-metal & non-metal atoms**.

A covalent bond is defined as the **electrostatic force of attraction between the nuclei of the atoms and the shared electrons.**

To attain a stable electronic configuration, the two atoms **share their valence electrons** so that they can both attain stable and full valence shells.

Covalent bond is formed from the sharing of electrons.

**Examples:**

## 1 Simple Molecular Structure

Covalent compounds that are made up of small, discrete molecules have simple molecular structures.

Between the small molecules, they are held together by **weak intermolecular forces of attraction**, _AKA van der Waals'forces_.

These weak intermolecular forces can be overcome easily, hence they have **low melting and boiling points**.

However, atoms within the molecules itself are held together by strong covalent bonds.

## Simple Mollexular Structure

For example, ammonia has a simple molecular structure.

These ammonia molecules experience **weak intermolecular forces of attraction between other ammonia molecules.** Hence, they have low melting point & boiling point.

**HOWEVER**, within the ammonia molecules are **strong covalent bonds** that holds together a single nitrogen atom and three hydrogen atoms.

**TAKE NOTEI**

Are covalent bonds strong? **Yes, very strong.**

Then why the low MP & BP? Because it is the weak intermolecular forces that are being overcame.

For example, it is easy to change the state of water (melting/boiling) but extremely difficult to break a water molecule back into the individual hydrogen and oxygen atoms, as that would involve breaking the strong covalent bonds.

**Covalent bonds & intermolecular forces of attraction are different things!!**

## Appendix ADiamond

Diamond is comprised of carbon atoms being held together by strong single covalent bonds.

Each carbon atom is bonded with four other carbon atoms to attain a full valence shell, forming a **tetrahedral structure**.

Due to its rigid lattice, diamond is well-known for its hardness. It also has extremely high melting **k**, boiling point.

## Silicon Dioxide

Unlike diamond, silicon dioxide is made up of atoms of two different elements - silicon and oxygen.

Each silicon atom forms covalent bonds with four oxygen atoms while each oxygen atom forms covalent bonds with two silicon atoms.

Hence the **ratio of silicon to oxygen atoms is t:2**, resulting in the molecular formula SiO\({}_{2}\).

Silicon dioxide is the major constituent of **sand**.

QUICK CHECK

Why do molecules that have simple molecular structure have low melting & boiling point while molecules with giant molecular structure have such high melting & boiling point? Explain.

QUICK CHECK

_Why do molecules that have simple molecular structure have low melting & boiling point while molecules with giant molecular structure have such high melting & boiling point? Explain._

For molecules with simple molecular structure, **little energy is required** to overcome the **weak intermolecular forces of attraction** between molecules, hence they have low melting point & boiling point.

However, for molecules with giant molecular structure, large amount of energy is required to overcome the **strong covalent bonds** between atoms within a **giant molecular structure**. Hence, they have high melting point & boiling point.

For instance, _water_ is a covalent compound with a simple molecular structure.

These water molecules are held together by weak intermolecular forces of attraction with other water molecules. It only requires a small amount of energy to overcome these forces for a change in state.

However, in giant covalent molecules like _diamond and graphite_, they have strong covalent bonds that are requires a huge amount of energy to overcome.

Hence, they have exceptionally high melting and boiling points.

Metallic BONDS

Metallic bond is defined as the **electrostatic force of attraction between the cations and the'sea of delocalised electrons'**.

These metallic bonds are strong and require huge amounts of energy to break, hence metals, in general, have **high melting points**.

Metals have the ability to **conduct electricity** as the delocalised electrons can act as **mobile charge carriers** within the metals.

Also, metals are **malleable** and **ductile** because the cations have the ability to slide over one another easily.
