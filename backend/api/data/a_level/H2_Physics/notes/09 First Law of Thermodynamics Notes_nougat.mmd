## 9 Introduction

Energy transfer between two substances in thermal contact usually causes temperature changes in both of them, though this is not guaranteed. Heat capacity and specific heat capacity allow for the calculation of temperature changes in such interactions. Similarly, latent heat is used to calculate the energy required to change the phase of a substance (e.g. from solid to liquid, or from liquid to gas).

The first law of thermodynamics is central to understanding thermodynamic processes which involve heat and mechanical work. This law is an extension of the conservation of energy used in mechanics as it considers energy exchange to a system by means of both heat transfer and mechanical work. The concept of internal energy is introduced to make the link between the macroscopic concepts of heat and mechanical work to the microscopic concept of temperature, which relates to the mechanics of atoms and molecules in a substance.

### Specific heat capacity and specific heat heat

Heat

The numerical value of the heat capacity of a body is the quantity of heat required to raise the temperature of the body by one degree.

Mathematically, this definition can be expressed as

\[C=\frac{Q}{\Delta T}\]

Where \(C=\) heat capacity

\(Q=\) quantity of heat

\(\Delta T=\) change in temperature

S.I. unit: joule per kelvin (J K\({}^{-1}\))

The unit of heat capacity is _not_ the joule and this is why, in the definition of heat capacity, it is important to make reference to the _numerical value_.

The numerical value of the specific heat capacity of a substance is the quantity of heat required to raise the temperature of unit mass of the substance by one degree.

Mathematically, this definition can be expressed as

\[c=\frac{Q}{m\Delta T}\]

Where \(c=\) specific heat capacity

\(Q=\) quantity of heat

\(m=\) mass of body

\(\Delta T=\) change in temperature

S.I. unit: joule per kilogram per kelvin (J kg\({}^{-1}\) K\({}^{-1}\))

The main principles of determining specific heat capacity by electrical methods involve heating a material through a change in temperature \(\Delta T\) and comparing it to the electrical energy supplied.

Calculations

By the principle of conservation of energy,

electrical energy supplied = heat transferred + HEAT LOSS (to surroundings)

\(I\)\(V\times t=mc\left(T_{\text{out}}-T_{\text{in}}\right)+H\)

Heat loss \(H\) depends on the excess temperature of the apparatus and the duration of the experiment.

Excess temperature of a body = temperature of body - temperature of surroundings

Since heat loss to surroundings is proportional to the average excess temperature of the setup, the heat loss can be eliminated by repeating the experiment using the same inlet and outlet temperature and the same duration.

This means that in order to eliminate \(H\), the experiment has to be repeated with a different flow rate and adjusting the power of the heating coil to such that the inlet and outlet temperatures remain at the same values as that of the first experiment.

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|} \hline  & Previous & New \\  & Measurements & Measurements \\ \hline current & \(I\) & \(I\) \\ \hline potential difference & \(V\) & \(V^{\prime}\) \\ \hline time & & \(t\) \\ \hline mass of X passing & & \\ through in time \(t\) & \(m\) & \(m^{\prime}\) \\ \hline inlet temperature & & \(T_{\text{in}}\) \\ \hline outlet temperature & & \(T_{\text{out}}\) \\ \hline \end{tabular}

Further Calculations

new electrical energy supplied = new heat transferred + HEAT LOSS

\(I^{\prime}V^{\prime}\times t=m^{\prime}c\left(T_{\text{out}}-T_{\text{in}} \right)+H\)

Solving the simultaneous equations

\(I\)\(Vt-I^{\prime}V^{\prime}t=\left(m-m^{\prime}\right)c\left(T_{\text{out}}-T_{\text{in}}\right)\)

\(c=\frac{\left(I-I^{\prime}V^{\prime}\right)t}{\left(m-m^{\prime}\right)\left(T _{\text{out}}-T_{\text{in}}\right)}\)

**Application 1. Why does melting and boiling both take place without a change in temperature?**

Model

* At _melting_ point the molecules vibrate so violently that the attractive forces cannot hold them together, the lattice structure collapses and the solid undergoes a phase change.
* During this process, the energy supplied to the solid, called the _latent heat of fusion_, will not cause an increase in the temperature.
* This is because the energy is used to overcome the attractive forces between atoms and causes the lattice structure to break.
* The temperature remains constant during _boiling_ as the heat supplied to the liquid is used to overcome the attractive forces between molecules and break the bonds completely.
* The energy required to change from the liquid state to the gaseous state is known as the _latent heat of vaporisation_.

Why is the specific latent heat of vaporisation higher than the specific latent heat of fusion for the same substance?

For example, the specific latent heat of fusion of water is 3.40 \(\times\) 10\({}^{5}\) J kg\({}^{-1}\) while the specific latent heat of vaporisation of water is 2.52 \(\times\) 10\({}^{6}\) J kg\({}^{-1}\).

The following accounts for the difference in the two values for the same substance:

* **To melt a solid**, work must be done to separate **some** of the molecules against their mutual attractions (i.e. some molecular bonds are broken), so that the structure no longer has any rigidity. **When a liquid vaporises**, all the remaining bonds must be broken. Since melting means the breaking of relatively fewer bonds we expect the specific latent heat of melting to be less than that of vaporisation.
* The volume occupied in the gaseous state is much larger than that in the liquid state. The gas needs to do work against the external or atmospheric pressure (boiling must be done in an open container) to accomplish this. Energy is required by the gas to do work during the expansion process.

### Why does a cooling effect accompany evaporation?

Evaporation is the result of the exchange of energy between molecules.

* The kinetic theory supposes that molecules of liquids are at continual motion and make frequent collisions with each other. During collisions, some molecules gain energy and others lose energy.
* If a molecule near the surface of the liquid gains enough energy, it will be able to escape from the attractive forces of the molecules behind it.
* This results in a decrease in the average kinetic energy of the remaining molecules.
* Since temperature is a measure of the average kinetic energy of a material, the liquid will become cooler. That is, evaporation results in cooling.

### 9.3 FIRST Law of Thermodynamics

The First Law of Thermodynamics states that increase in the internal energy of a system is equal to the sum of the heat supplied to the system and the work done on the system, and the internal energy of a system depends only on its state.

\begin{tabular}{c c c c c c} word equation & INCREASE in & heat SUPPLIED TO & work done ON & \\  & internal energy of the system & the system & the system & the system & the system \\ \end{tabular}

\begin{tabular}{c c c c} mathematical & M0 = Q = 0 & \\ \end{tabular}

\begin{tabular}{c c c} spin Conventions & & & & \\ \end{tabular}

The First Law follows the convention as stated by its definition.

Hence if any of the quantities are calculated or defined as negative, it just means the opposite of how it was defined in the First Law.

\begin{tabular}{c c c}  & \(\sharp\) & Positive (+) & Negative (-) \\ \hline \(dU\) & **increase** in internal energy & & **Decrease** in internal energy \\ \(Q\) & & Heat & **absorbed** by the & & Heat & **loss** by the system \\  & & & & \\ \end{tabular}

\begin{tabular}{c c c} \(W\) & Work done on the system & & Work done by the system \\  & & (Compression) & (Expansion) \\ \end{tabular}

\begin{tabular}{c c c} Heat & Heat is defined as the transfer of energy across the boundary of a system due to a temperature difference between the system and its surroundings. \\ \end{tabular}

\begin{tabular}{c c} Work Done & Consider a system of gas in a cylinder with a frictionless, movable piston of area \(A\) \\ \(W\) & in contact with the gas. When the gas expands, a force \(F\) is applied on the piston \\ by the gas to move the piston against the external pressure \(p\). \\ \end{tabular}

The work done by this force \(F\) in displacing the piston through a small distance \(dx\) against the external pressure \(p\) is known as positive work done by the gas. This results in a change in volume \(dV=Adx\).

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:17]

* For all three processes, the gas changes from state 1 to state 2. : \(\Delta U=U_{2}-U_{1}=\) the same for all three processes!
* Work done \(W=\) area under the \(p\)-\(V\) graph It is obvious from the areas shaded that \(\left|W_{6}\right|<\left|W_{4}\right|<\left|W_{6}\right|\)!

In summary,

* **Internal energy \(U\)** is dependent on state and independent of the path/process taken.
* **Work done \(W\)**, on the other hand, is path dependent.

### (5) Cyclic Process

A cyclic process is one by which the system goes through a series of processes and ends back at its beginning state.

A cyclic process is shown on the right, where the system goes through a cycle of processes and ends up at the same initial state

(i.e. from A \(\rightarrow\) B \(\rightarrow\) C \(\rightarrow\) D \(\rightarrow\) E \(\rightarrow\) A ).

* The system starts and ends at A

* Total work done \(W\neq 0\)

A \(\rightarrow\) B : isovolumetric process, \(\Delta V=0\) : \(W_{AB}=0\)

B \(\rightarrow\) C \(\rightarrow\) D, expansion occurs : \(W_{BCO}\) (on the system) is negative

D \(\rightarrow\) E \(\rightarrow\) A, compression occurs : \(W_{DEA}\) (on the system) is positive

Since \(|W_{BCO}|<|W_{DEA}|\), the net work done on the system (which is the area enclosed by the cycle) is positive. i.e. : \(W\) is positive

* Applying the first law of thermodynamics

\(\Delta U=Q+W\)

0 = Q + \(W\)\(\Rightarrow\) Q = -\(W\)

For this cycle of processes to occur, heat has to be transferred out of the system. There is net heat lost from the system.

* A system of gas with pressure \(p_{t}\), volume \(V_{t}\), and temperature \(T_{t}\) undergoes process A by being heated at constant volume to pressure \(p_{2}\), volume \(V_{t}\), and temperature \(T_{2}\). It then undergoes an expansion by process B at constant pressure to pressure \(p_{2}\), volume \(V_{3}\), and temperature \(T_{3}\). An identical system undergoes an isothermal expansion by process C to pressure \(p_{3}\), volume \(V_{3}\), and temperature \(T_{t}\). It is then heated at constant volume by process D to pressure \(p_{2}\), volume \(V_{3}\), and temperature \(T_{3}\). So the two systems end up at the same state, characterised by the same pressure, volume and temperature.
* Sketch the processes described on a \(p\)-\(V\) graph.
* State and explain which system has more internal energy at the end.
* _Joll system have the inner internal energy at the end._
* _Joll system have the inner internal energy at the end._
* _Joll system has the inner internal energy at the end._
* _Joll system has the inner internal energy at the end.

## Appendix

Internal Energies Of Nonatomic Datomic and E Polyatomic Gases

The internal energy of a gas is related to the number of atoms in its molecules.

A gas whose molecules consist of single atoms is said to be monatomic: for e.g. chemically inert gases and metallic vapours, Hg, Na, He, Ne, A.

A gas with two atoms in the molecule is said to be diatomic: O\({}_{2}\), H\({}_{2}\), Cl\({}_{2}\), CO. And a gas with more than two atoms in the molecule is said to be polyatomic: H\({}_{2}\)O, O\({}_{3}\), H\({}_{2}\)S, CO\({}_{2}\), CH\({}_{4}\). We may regard the molecules of a monatomic gas as points, but we regard those of a diatomic gas as 'dumb-bells', and those of a polyatomic gas as more complicated structures. A molecule which extends appreciably in space - a diatomic or polyatomic molecule - has an appreciable moment of inertia. It will therefore have rotational and vibrational kinetic energy, besides translational.

A monatomic molecule, however, must have a much smaller moment of inertia than a diatomic or polyatomic. Its rotational kinetic energy can therefore be neglected and thus a helium atom, for e.g. has only **translational kinetic energy**.
