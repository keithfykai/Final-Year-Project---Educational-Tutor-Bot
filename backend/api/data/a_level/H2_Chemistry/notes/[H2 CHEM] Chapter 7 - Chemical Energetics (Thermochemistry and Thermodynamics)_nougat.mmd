_Discrepancies between theoretical and experimental values of LE:_

_Assumed that compounds are entirely ionic. However the degree of covalent character (charge and ionic radii, polarisability and polarising power) in ionic compound will results in discrepancies._

_Note: Comparing the difference in theoretical and experimental values of the LE gives an indication of the degree of covalent character in an ionic compound._

**Exothermic reactions (AH-U) are energetically more stable and energy level of products are lower than reactants but may not be kinetically feasible -- reaction does not occur spontaneously (naturally)**

**ENTROPY**

Entropy 'S' is the measure of randomness and disorderiness in a system, reflected in the number of ways that energy in a system can be distributed through the **motion** of its **particles.**

**ENTROPY CHANGE, AS**

Measure the change in randomness and disorderiness in a system.

Units = J mol' K'

AS > 0, increase in disorderiness

AS < 0, decrease in disorderiness

\(\Delta\)S = \(S_{\rm final}-S_{\rm initial}\)* [1] Temperature
* [2] Increase in temperature result in an increase in average Kinetic Energy and range of energy increases, hence there are more ways to disperse the energy / distribute the particles
* [3] Note: can link to Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution curve in Reaction Kinetics Chapter

* [5] During melting and boiling, particles move more freely from solid to liquid and from liquid to gaseous state, hence become more disordered. There are now **move ways to distribute the particles and their energy**, thus an increase in entropy
* [6] Note: entropy of solid < liquid < gas
* [7] Change in **number** of particles (only for **gaseous systems** in chemical reactions)
* [8] A chemical reaction resulting in an **increase** in gaseous particles increases the overall entropy as particles in gas are most disordered; there are now more ways to distribute particles
* [9] Note: There must be a net increase in number of mols of gaseous products as compared to gaseous reactants* 4. **Mixing of gaseous particles (only under CONSTANT PRESSURE)**
* **Entropy only increase when volume increases due to mixing under constant pressure. As volume increase there are now more ways to distribute the gas particle.**
* **Entropy does not change when gaseous particles are mixed under constant volume as the number of ways to distribute the gas particles remain constant.**
* 5. **Dissolution of ionic solid (effect on \(\Delta\)S varies)**
* **Entropy increase: ions are now free to move in solution, increasing the number of ways to distribute the particles.**
* **Entropy decrease: water molecules now become restricted in motion as they arrange themselves around the ions via ion-dipole interaction**
* **_magnitude of each determines whether entropy increases or decreases_

## Chapter 4 Practice Questions

1 Question: Magnesium oxide is produced by the decomposition to magnesium carbonate. MgCO\({}_{3}\) (s) \(\rightarrow\) MgO (s) + CO\({}_{2}\) (g)

\(\Delta\)H + + +107 kJ mol\({}^{+}\) KS + + +159 J mol\({}^{+}\) K\({}^{+}\)

(a) Calculate Ag for the reaction at 298K

(b) Calculate the temperature at which the decomposition will take place.

(c) Explain why magnesium carbonate decompose at around 500K instead of the temperature calculated in (b)?

### 4.2 \(A\) + 453.6 kJ mol\({}^{+}\)

(b) \(T\) = 635K

(c) In the calculation of (b), the 4H and 4S used were measured at standard conditions and not at the decomposition temperature. Thus the calculated temperature differs from the actual.

Test yourself!

(a) explain that most chemical reactions are accompanied by energy changes, principally in the form of heat usually associated with the breaking and forming of chemical bonds; the reaction can be exothermic (\(\Delta H\) negative) or endothermic (\(\Delta H\) positive)

(b) construct and interpret an energy profile diagram, in terms of the enthalpy change of the reaction and of the activation energy

(c) explain and use the terms:

(i) _enthalpy change of reaction_ and _standard conditions_, with particular reference to: formation; combustion; hydration; solution; neutralisation;

atomisation

(ii) _bond energy_ (\(\Delta H\) positive, i.e. bond breaking)

(iii) _lattice energy_ (\(\Delta H\) negative, i.e. gaseous ions to solid lattice)

(d) calculate enthalpy changes from appropriate experimental results, including the use of the relationship:

heat change = \(m\)\(\Delta T\)Test yourself!

(e) explain, in qualitative terms, the effect of ionic charge and of ionic radius on the numerical magnitude of a lattice energy

(f) apply Hess' Law to construct simple energy cycles, e.g. Born-Aleber cycle, and carry out calculations involving such cycles and relevant energy terms (including ionisation energy and electron affinity), with particular reference to:

(i) determining enthalpy changes that cannot be found by direct experiment, e.g. an enthalpy change of formation from enthalpy changes of combustion

(ii) the formation of a simple ionic solid and of its aqueous solution

(iii) average bond energies

(g) explain and use the term _entropy_Test yourself!

(h) discuss the effects on the entropy of a chemical system by the following:

(i) change in temperature

(ii) change in phase

(iii) change in the number of particles (especially for gaseous systems)

(iv) mixing of particles

[quantitative treatment is **not** required]

(i) predict whether the entropy change for a given process or reaction is positive or negative

(i) state and use the equation involving _standard Gibbs free energy change of reaction_, \(\Delta G=\Delta H-\)_TAS_

(k) state whether a reaction or process will be spontaneous by using the sign of \(\Delta G\)

(l) understand the limitations in the use of \(\Delta G\) to predict the spontaneity of a reaction

(m) predict the effect of temperature change on the spontaneity of a reaction, given standard enthalpy and entropy changesFor more notes & learning materials, visit: www.overmugged.com
