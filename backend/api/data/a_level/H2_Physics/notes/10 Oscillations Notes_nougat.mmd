Figure 10.1.1 illustrates the motion of a particle N in simple harmonic motion. Particle N experiences a restoring force that is always directed towards the equilibrium position O and oscillates between points A and B. The displacement \(x\) from point O, the velocity \(v\) and acceleration \(a\) of particle N are also indicated in Fig. 10.1.1. The direction towards the right is taken to be positive.

\begin{tabular}{l l} \hline \hline Damped Oscillations & The. oscillatory motions that have been discussed so far have been for _ideal_ systems. \\ \hline \end{tabular}

A real oscillating system is opposed by dissipative forces, such as friction and viscous forces, which cause the amplitude of the motion to decrease with time. The system then does positive work: the energy to do this work is taken from the energy of the oscillation, and usually appears as internal energy of the surroundings and the system.

Definition of damping

**Damping** is the process whereby_energy is removed from an oscillating system_. For a damping force which is proportional to the velocity of the mass, the decay in amplitude is _exponential_. This means that the amplitude decreases by the same fraction during each vibration.

A full mathematical analysis of damped harmonic motion shows that the frequency of the damped motion is _less than_ the undamped frequency.

_Degrees of Damping_

The degree of damping depends on the magnitude of the retarding force (or the amount of resistance to the oscillation). In practice, the motion of an oscillator will depend on the magnitude of the damping. In certain cases the damping may prevent the system from oscillating and it will just return to its equilibrium position.

The following graphs show how different degrees of damping affect the displacement of an oscillating body.

**Light Damping** results in oscillations whereby the amplitude decays exponentially with time. The frequency of oscillations is slightly smaller than the undamped frequency. (Fig. 10.3.2)

**Critical Damping** results in no oscillation and the system returns to the equilibrium position in the shortest time. (Fig. 10.3.3)

**Heavy Damping** results in no oscillation and the system takes a long time to return to its equilibrium position. (Fig. 10.3.4)

Without the shock absorber, a car spring, after a compression, will extend and release

the energy it absorbs from the rise of a bump at an uncontrolled rate. The spring will continue to bounce at its natural frequency until all of the energy originally put into it is used up. A suspension built on springs alone would make for an extremely bouncy and uncomfortable ride and, depending on the terrain, an uncontrollable car.

A heavily damped shock absorbing system would still have a compressed spring by the time P is reached and so would not be able to respond to the sudden drop in road surface. So long as there are bumps on a road then these must have an effect on a passenger in a car. The shock-absorbing system can only reduce the forces applied. It cannot eliminate them because, clearly, in the above diagram, the passenger must rise and drop eventually by the height of the bump.

Instruments such as analogue balances and electrical meters are also designed to be critically damped so that the pointer comes quickly to the correct position in the shortest possible time without oscillating.

Since all macroscopic mechanical oscillations are damped, energy is continually being lost from the system. If we wish to maintain the vibrations at constant amplitude, then energy must be supplied at the rate at which energy is being dissipated to the surroundings and within the system. A force must therefore be applied to oppose the damping forces.

Forced oscillations are produced when a body is subjected to a periodic external driving force. The force is also know as a driver.

### Demonstration Using Barton's Pendulums

Fig. 10.3.10 shows a setup of Barton's pendulums. It consists of a number of very light pendulums (made from paper cones) of varying length (A, B, C, D and E) and one pendulum with a heavy bob (X). This massive pendulum is called the driver pendulum. All the pendulums are suspended from the same string.

The setup is used to demonstrate what happens when a system is made to vibrate at some frequency other than its own natural frequency of vibration.

Figure 10.3.11:The sharpness of resonance is determined by the degree of damping:

1. When there is no damping, the amplitude of resonance becomes infinite. (Fig. 10.3.11(i))
2. When damping is light, the amplitude is large but falls off rapidly when the driving frequency of the body differs slightly from the natural frequency of the body. The resonance is sharp. (Fig. 10.3.11(ii))
3. When the degree of damping increases, the amplitude at resonance decreases. The curve falls off gradually and maximum amplitude occurs at a frequency that is lower than the natural frequency of the body. (Fig. 10.3.11(iii))
4. When damping is critical or heavy, the resonance is flat. (Fig. 10.3.11(iv),(v))

Resonance occurs when a system _responds at maximum amplitude to an external driving force. This occurs when the frequency of the driving force is equal to the natural frequency of the driven system_

Increasing the intensity of a note produced by a string in a musical instrument (Acoustic resonance)

This is done by coupling the vibrating string to a resonator. The air inside a cavity (e.g. a guitar body) and the material of the instrument (the thin wooden body of the guitar) all vibrate producing much greater vibrations in the surrounding air than would be produced by the string alone.

Magnetic resonance

Energy from strong oscillating magnetic fields is used to cause the nuclei of atoms to oscillate and emit radio frequency signals. In any given molecule there will be many resonant frequencies, and whenever resonance occurs energy is absorbed. The pattern of energy absorption can be used to detect the presence of particular molecules within any specimen and biochemists are using the technique to study complex molecules and the part they play in biological processes.

Magnetic resonance is also being used instead of X-rays as an imaging system (MRI) in the medical field. The radio frequency signals emitted are made to encode position information by varying the magnetic field. The contrast between different tissues is determined by the rate at which excited atoms return to the equilibrium state. One major advantage of magnetic resonance used in this way is that no ionising radiation is involved.

\(\phi\) is the _phase constant_ or the initial phase angle.

The phase of the motion is the quantity \(\left(\omega t+\phi\right).\)

\(x_{o}\) and \(\phi\) are determined uniquely by the position and velocity of the particle at \(t=0.\) E.g. if the particle is at \(x=x_{o}\) at \(t=0,\) then \(\phi=0.\)

\(x\) graph of \(x=x_{o}\cos\left(\omega t+\phi\right)\) is the graph of \(x_{o}\cos\omega t\) displaced to the left by a time interval \(\phi\over\omega}.\)

The motion described by \(x=x_{o}\cos\left(\omega t+\phi\right)\) is _not in phase_ with that described by \(x_{o}\cos\omega t.\) It is out of phase by angle \(\phi\left(\text{radian}\right)\) or time \(\phi\over\omega}.\) The plus sign indicates that this motion _leads_ by time \(\phi\over\omega}\) and so the graph is displaced to the left.

If the motion was described by \(x=x_{o}\cos\left(\omega t-\phi\right),\) the graph would be displaced to the right. This motion would be said to _lag_ by time \(\phi\over\omega}.\)

_Phase difference_ between two oscillators is the fraction of a complete oscillation by which one is ahead of the other. It can be expressed as a fraction of an oscillation, or, more usually, as an angle, measured in radians.
