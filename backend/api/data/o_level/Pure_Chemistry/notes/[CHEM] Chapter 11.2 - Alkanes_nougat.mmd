ISOMERISM (ALKANE) ISOMERISM

Isomers are compounds with **the same molecular formula** but different structural formula.

In order to display isomerism, alkanes would have to contain at least four carbon atoms.

Isomers have **similar chemical properties** but slightly different physical properties such as different melting and boiling points & density.

* 20. How many moles of oxygen would be used when 1 mole of propane, C,H, is completely burnt in the air to form carbon dioxide and water? (N2015/P1/Q37)
* 20. C The equation for the complete combustion of propane is, C,H, + S O, + 3 C0, + 4 H,O 1 mole of propane completely reacts with 5 moles of oxygen to form carbon dioxide and water.

* 1 Their general formula is \(\mathrm{C_{{}_{\mathrm{E}}}H_{{}_{\mathrm{E}}}}\).
* 2 They are flammable.
* 3 They react with chlorine.
* A 1 and 2 only  B 2 and 3 only  C 1 and 3 only  D 1, 2 and 3 ( )
