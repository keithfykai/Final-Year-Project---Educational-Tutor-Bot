## Chapter 2: Biomolecules

H2 Biology

## Introduction

Cells and their contents are built up from **biomolecules**. Cellular functions and life itself depends on these molecules.

Some important biomolecules and their functions are:

**Carbohydrates**: Energy source

**Lipids**: Main component of cell membrane

**Proteins**: Structural and enzymatic function

**Nucleic acids**: Store and transmit hereditary information

**Carbohydrates**

**Monosaccharidesarides are simple sugars, which are the monomers that make up disaccharides and polysaccharides.**

**They mainly function as energy sources since they contain many carbon-hydrogen bonds (C--H), which release energy upon oxidation.**

**They also act as building blocks for the synthesis of larger molecules.**

**Physical properties: Sweet, soluble and possess crystalline structures.**

**Chemical Properties: All monosaccharides are reducing sugars meaning they can carry out a chemical reaction called reduction.**

**Carbohydrates**

**Key Example of Monosaccharides:**

**Glucose:**

The most abundant hexose sugar and the main respiratory substrate for all living things. Energy is produced in the form of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) during cellular respiration.

**Structure:**

Chemical formula of C\({}_{6}\)H\({}_{12}\)O\({}_{6}\)

There are two possible ring structures of glucose namely the \(\alpha\)-glucose and \(\beta\)-glucose, depending on the hydroxyl group on carbon-1.

Below the ring (\(\alpha\)-glucose) or above the ring (\(\beta\)-glucose).

**Carbohydrates**

**Disaccharides:**

A glycosidic bond is formed between two

monosaccharides in a **condensation reaction** with the

**removal of one molecule of water**.

Conversely, the glycosidic bond is broken between two

monosaccharides (in a disaccharide) in a **hydrolysis**

**reaction** with the **addition of one molecule of water**,

to form the hydroxyl group on two different

monosaccharides.

Examples of disaccharides formed from condensation

reactions are shown in the figure on the right.

Lipids

Lipids contain the same elements as carbohydrates: carbon, hydrogen and oxygen.

They do not have a general formula but have proportionally less oxygen compared to hydrogen.

Lipids are **non-polar** due to even distribution of charge. In general, lipids are formed by **condensation reactions between fatty acids and an alcohol.**

Lipids can be classified into three types:

Triglycerides (e.g. fats and oils)

Phospholipids (e.g. phosphatidylcholine)

Steroids and sterols (e.g. cholesterol)

## 6 Proteins

Proteins can be classified into **globular proteins** and **fibrous proteins**.

Globular Protein Example: **Haemoglobin**

A red pigment in red blood cells responsible for transporting oxygen in blood.

A **quaternary globular protein of 4 subunits**, each consisting of a polypeptide chain and a prosthetic group called haem group.

**2 identical \(\alpha\)-chains of 141 amino acids** and **2 identical \(\beta\)-chains of 146 amino acids**.

Each polypeptide is coiled into \(\alpha\)-helices and then folded into a spherical globular shape. (No \(\beta\)-pleated sheets)

**Hydrophobic amino acid residues** are in the **interior of the folded structure**

and **hydrophilic amino acid residues are found at the exterior surface** to maintain solubility of the protein.

The four polypeptides are held by hydrophobic interactions, ionic bonds and hydrogen bonds. (No disulfide bonds are involved)

## 6 Proteins

* The **hydrophobic amino acids** are found in the **interior of the protein** and **hydrophilic amino acids** found at the **exterior surface**. This allows the haemoglobin to be **soluble to take part in chemical reactions.
* The haem group is held in the **hydrophobic pocket of the polypeptide chain**. This allows haemoglobin to **bind** reversibly to **oxygen** and transport oxygen to the rest of the body.
* The quaternary structure, of four subunits, are held by **weak bonds** such as **hydrophobic interactions**, **ionic bonds** and **hydrogen bonds**
* This allows for **cooperative binding of oxygen to haemoglobin**. Binding of one O\({}_{3}\) molecule to one subunit results in a **conformation change** of the adjacent subunits in the haemoglobin molecule, making it easier for another O\({}_{2}\) molecule to bind with the other haem groups in the molecule. This increases the rate of uptake of oxygen by haemoglobin.
* Haemoglobin is a **globular** protein and is folded into a **spherical** shape.
* The protein is **compact** and many haemoglobin molecules to be dissolved in the cytoplasm of a red blood cell.

## 6 Proteins

* A protein's **specific 3-dimensional conformation determines its biological function** which may involve recognising and binding to other molecules.
* **Denaturation is the loss of the specific 3-dimensional conformation of a protein molecule**, involving a **breadage of bonds** maintaining protein structure**, resulting in the **protein losing its biological function**. Depending on the degree of denaturation, the molecule may partially or completely lose it biological activity.
* The change may be **temporary or permanent**. In the case of temporary denaturation (reversible denaturation), removal of the mildly denaturing conditions will result in spontaneous and correct refolding of the polypeptide chain to regain its normal tertiary structure and the protein is still functional.
* Factors affecting denaturation include: Temperature pH Heavy Metals Oxidizing and Reducing Agents Organic Solvents
