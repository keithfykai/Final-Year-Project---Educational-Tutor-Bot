## Appendix Hlook's Law

* States that, within its elastic limit, the magnitude of the tension in an elastic body is directly proportional to its extension.

The _minus_ in the formula indicates that the tension \(T\) always acts in the direction _opposite_ to the direction of \(x\).
* For a given elastic material, the force constant \(k\) is directly proportional to its cross-section area \(A\) and inversely proportional to its natural length \(l_{0}\) i.e. \(\bar{k}\propto\bar{\alpha}\) and \(\bar{k}\propto l_{0}^{\infty\bar{\alpha}}\)
* A common error was to state that tension \(T\) is proportional to length* The body could be identified as obeying Hooke's law if the extension \((l-l_{0})\) is zero when T is zero, and it varies linearly with T.
* Unless indicated otherwise hereafter, all elastic may be assumed to obey Hooke's law, and all their extensions may be assumed to be within their elastic limits (or limits proportionality).

A common error was to state that tension T is proportional to length \(l\).

* At _equilibrium_ (or _rest_) position \(x_{0}\), the _net force_ on the mass is zero \[F_{net}=0\] \[mg-kx_{0}=0\] If the mass is given any additional displacement \(x\), the net force on the mass is \[F_{net}=mg-k(x_{0}+x)\] \[F_{net}=-kx\] This implies that the spring-mass system is behaving as if the equilibrium position is its equivalent natural (or unstretched) position for its net force-extension relation.

* Similarly, a light spring with mass resting on it, will behave as if the equilibrium position is its equivalent natural position for its _net force-extension_ relationship.

Appendix A A mass is at rest on a light spring with a force constant \(k\) of 600 N/m. If the mass is given an additional displacement \(x=3.0\) cm (downwards), what is the magnitude and direction of net force on the mass?

The force needed to stretched a 15-cm long spring to a length of 20 cm is 3.0 N. What is the force constant of the spring?

## Force Fields

* In Physics, it refers to a region of space within which a force is experienced Field Lines

* A force field could be represented by directed _lines of force_, which are an aid to visualizing the field.
* The field lines are not real but they represent a real field.

* The strength of a force field are represented by the relative spacing of the lines
* A uniform field could be represented by parallel directed lines that are equally spaced.
* Field lines do not cross each other

## Chapter 2 Gravitational Field

* is a region of space within which _a mass_ experiences a gravitational force.

### 2.1 Gravitational Field Strength

* The gravitational field strength \(g\) (N/kg) at point is the _gravitational force per unit mass_ acting on a small stationary test mass placed at that point.

### 2.2 Gravitational Force

The magnitude of a gravitational force \(F_{g}\) on a mass \(m\) at that point is

\[\left[\begin{array}{c}F_{g}=mg\\ \end{array}\right]\]

where \(m=\) mass in kilogram

\(g=\) gravitational field strength

* the direction of gravitational forces is in the direction of the gravitational field* [10] Electific Field
* is a region of space within which _a charge_ experiences an electric force.
* [11] Electric Field Strength
* The electric field strength \(E\) (N/C) at point is the _electric force per unit charge_ acting on a small stationary test charge placed at that point.

* [12] Electric Force

The magnitude of electric force \(F_{E}\) on a charge \(Q\) at that point is

* [13] where \(Q=\) charge in Coulombs
* [14] \(E=\) electric field strength
* the direction of electric forces on a positive charge is in the direction of the gravitational field. The direction of \(F_{E}\) if the charge is negative.

## Chapter 1 Magnetic Field

* is a region of space within which _a current-carrying conductor, a moving charge, or permanent magnet_ may experience an electric force.

### 1 Magnetic Flux Density

* also known as magnetic field strength \(B\) (T) at a point is the _magnetic force per unit length of conductor per unit current_ carried placed at that point at right angles to the field.
* For moving charged particles, it is the magnetic _force per unit positive charge per unit speed_ at the right angles to the field.

## Magnetic Force

The magnitude of magnetic force \(F_{B}\) on a current-carrying conductor or a moving charge

\[\left[\begin{array}{c}F_{B}=BIL\sin\theta\\ \end{array}\right]\qquad\quad\text{or}\qquad\quad\left[\begin{array}{c}F_{B}= QvB\sin\theta\\ \end{array}\right]\]

where \(B=\) magnetic flux density

\(I=\) current, \(Q=\) charge

\(L=\) length of conductor

\(v=\) magnitude of the velocity of the charge

\(\theta=\) angle the velocity or current makes to the field

* the direction of magnetic forces is perpendicular to both the field and the conductor or the velocity of the moving charge. The direction could be determined using _Fleming's left-hand rule_.

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:15]

Pressure in a Fluid

A fluid is a substance that can flow, i.e. both _liquids_ and _gases_ are fluids.

The pressure \(p\) at depth \(h\) in a fluid of density \(\rho\) is given by:

\[p=\rho gh\]

where \(g=\)acceleration of free fall (m/s\({}^{2}\))

Pressure \(p\) on an area \(A=\frac{force}{area}=\)

\[p=\frac{mg}{A}=\frac{\rho Vg}{A}=\frac{\rho hAg}{A}=\rho gh\]

The pressure \(p\) is _independent_ of the shape of the area \(A\) and the shape of any container holding the fluid.

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:17]

## Chapter 1 Outrust

* is the upward (or buoyant) force exerted by a fluid on a body when the body is (completely or partially) immersed in the fluid.
* Uphrust acts through what was the center of gravity of the fluid before it was displaced.
* the direction of upthrust is always upwards, i.e. opposite to the direction of free fall.

### 1.1 Magnitude

According to Archimedes' principle,

_When a body is immersed in a fluid, it experiences an upthrust equal in magnitude to the weight of fluid displaced._

_magnitude of upthrust \(U=weight\) of fluid displaced_Uehrust

* Uphrrust arises because _pressure in a fluid increases with depth_, and so pressure on the lower surface(s) is greater than that on the upper surface(s), resulting in a net upward force.

It could be explained by considering a body immersed in a fluid.

Example:

A cylinder of cross-section are \(A\) and length \(l\) is submerged in a fluid of density \(\rho\), as shown.

The downward force \(F_{1}\) on the upper surface is given by:

\(F_{1}=p_{1}A=\rho gh_{1}A\)

and the upward force \(F_{2}\) on the lower surface is given by:

\(F_{2}=p_{2}A=\rho gh_{2}A\)

where \(g=\) acceleration of free fall.

The net upward force \(U\) is given by:

\(U=F_{2}-F_{1}=\rho gh_{2}A=\rho gh_{1}A=\rho g(h_{2}-h_{1})A=\rho g\)lA

\(\equiv\rho gV\equiv mg\equiv weight\ of\ fluid\ displaced\)

## Chapter 1 UGHrust

* The upthrust \(U\) is independent of the shape of the immersed body and the shape of any container holding the fluid.

This could be deduced by considering the equilibrium of a bag of the fluid with a similar shape and volume as a body to be immersed.

With the bag of fluid in equilibrium, the upthrust \(U\) on it must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to its weight \(W_{f}\).

When the bag of the fluid is replaced by the immersed body, the body will experience the same upthrust \(U\) (=weight of fluid displaced)

## Chapter 1 Principle of Projection

If the body partially immersed in fluid, then

\[\framebox{\begin{array}{l}weight\ of\ the\ floating\ body=weight\ of\ fluid\ displaced\end{array}}\]

which is a special case of Archimedes' principle

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:23]

## Appendix A Frictional Force

* is a contact force when two surfaces interact.
* Frictional forces resist the relative motion between the two solid surfaces in contact.
* It always acts opposite to the direction of motion (or direction where the object tends to move towards to)

## Appendix B Static Friction

A force is applied to an object resting on a surface until it started to move. Up to the point where the object begins to move, the frictional force acting on the object is called **static friction.**

* The magnitude of the _static friction_\(f_{s}\) is found to be directly proportional to the magnitude of _normal force N_.

## Appendix C Static Friction

The frictional force acting on the moving object is called **kinetic friction.**

* The magnitude of _kinetic friction_\(f_{k}\) is usually smaller than the maximum magnitude \(f_{s}\) of t corresponding static friction.

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:25]

## Appendix A

## Chapter 1 Training Effects of Forces

### 1.1 Center of Gravity

* Is the point at which the whole weight of the body may be considered (or appears or seems) to act.

### 1.2 Center of Gravity

* is the point at which the mass of the body appears (or may be considered or may be taken) to be concentrated.
* For a body of uniform density, the center of mass is at the geometrical center of the body.

* In a uniform gravitation field, the center of gravity coincides with the center of mass, and they are sometimes used interchangeably.
* A common error was to define the center of gravity as the point that the weight was concentrated.

## Appendix 1 Moment of a Force

Syl multi-Newton meter [N-m] Vector

The ability of a force to rotate a body about a given pivot point.

is the product of the _force and the perpendicular distance_ between its line of action and the pivot point.

\(M=F\times d\)

where \(F=\) Force

\(d=\) distance perpendicular to \(F\)Appendix A **couple** is a pair of force, equal in magnitude but opposite in directions, and so tends to produce rotation only.
* The **torque** of a couple is the product of one of the forces and the perpendicular distance between their lines of action.

When defining the torque of a couple, a common error was to describe the moment of a force, and vice versa.
* The toque of a couple is independent of the position of the axis of rotation.
* On their own, the term _moment_ usually refers to the turning effect of a force while the term _torque_ usually refers to the turning effect without translational effect.

## Direction of Moment and Torque

* By right-hand grip rule, we can determine the direction of moment and torque.
* When the fingers of the right hand are wrapped around the direction of rotation, the thumb points in the direction of the torque vector.

In some situations, the directions are simply referred as clockwise or counterclockwise.

## Appendix A Proof of Equilibrium

* When the state of an object remains unchanged even though two or more forces are acting upon it, the object is said to be in **equilibrium**. Conditions

An object is said to be in equilibrium if

1. the resultant force on the object is zero.

2. the resultant torque (\(\tau\)) on the object about any

axis is zero.

## Appendix A Proof of Moments

* For a body in equilibrium under the action of coplanar forces, the condition of "no net torque" is often stated as: _the sum of clockwise moments about a point equals the sum of the counterclockwise moments (about the same point)_ \[\Sigma(clockwise\ moments)=\Sigma(counterclockwise)^{*}\] *about the same point
**Let us set up the equations for the condition of equilibrium**

**If the rod is in equilibrium,**

**Vertical components:**

\[\sum F_{y}=F_{1}\sin\theta_{1}+F_{2}\sin\theta_{2}-W=0\]

**Horizontal components:**

\[\sum F_{x}=F_{1}\cos\theta_{1}-F_{2}\cos\theta_{2}-W=0\]

**Torque:**

\[\sum(clockwise\;moments)=\sum(counterclockwise)\]

**about center of gravity**

\[\Rightarrow F_{1}\sin\theta_{1}\times d_{1}=F_{2}\sin\theta_{2}\times d_{2}\]

**The horizontal components of** \(F_{1}\) **and** \(F_{2}\) **(**\(F_{1}\cos\theta_{1}\) **and** \(F_{2}\cos\theta_{2}\)**) are in line with the pivot point, and so do not contribute to the net moment.**

**For calculations of net moment, the choice of** _pivot point_ **(or axis of rotation) is completely arbitrary.**

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:37]

**Solution:**

\[F=-kx\Rightarrow k=\frac{-F}{x}\]

\(x=20-15--5cm\). The force by the spring is opposite to \(x\) so \(F=-3N\).

\[k=\frac{-(-3)}{5\times 10^{-2}}=\texttt{60N/}\texttt{/}m\]

**Praffee Example 4**

The Earth may be assumed to be spherical with radius \(R\) of 6,400 km, and the atmospheric pressure \(p\) near the Earth's surface may be taken as 100 kPa. Estimate the total mass of the Earth's atmosphere.

**Solution:**

Let \(M=\) total mass of the Earth's atmosphere

\[p=\frac{force}{area}\approx\frac{weight\ of\ Earth's atmosphere}{area\ of\ Earth's surface}=\frac{Mg}{4\pi R^{2}}\]

i.e.,

\[(100\times 10^{3})\approx\frac{M(9.81)}{4\pi(6300\times 10^{3})^{2}}\]

\[:M\approx 5.25\times 10^{18}=5.2\times 10^{18}\ kg\]For more notes & learning materials, visit:
