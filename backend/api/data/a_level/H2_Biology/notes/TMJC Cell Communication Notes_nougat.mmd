The following question should help students frame their learning:

* How do organisms respond to internal and external changes?

### Communication is needed for organisms to respond to the environment and maintain equilibrium

Organisms should be able to detect changes both from the surrounding environment and within themselves so that they are able to respond to these changes to maintain a **constant internal environment**. This ability to respond to changes is made possible due to coordination across the various biological systems as well as communication between cells.

Communication between cells can take the form of **electrical** or **chemical transmission** via the **nervous** or **endocrine system** respectively. The endocrine system facilitates communication between different cells through the release of hormones into the bloodstream. **Binding** of **hormones** to **receptors** on or within target cells initiates **signal transduction** and eventually results in a **change** in **gene expression** to bring about certain **physiological changes. Defects** in any part of the **signalling pathway** often lead to detrimental conditions such as **metabolic diseases** and **cancer**.

### Core Idea 3: Energy and Equilibrium

#### Topic B: Communication and Equilibrium in Organisms

The emphasis of this section is on how **cell signalling processes** can cause a **physiological response** in an organism. The **circulatory system** transports **hormones** from where they are secreted to the **target cells**. Hormones bind to **specific binding sites - receptors** found on the **cell surface membrane** or **within the cell - to initiate** the **process of cell signalling**.

#### Cell signalling

 comprises the following stages: **ligand-receptor interaction, signal transduction** and **amplification**, and **cellular response**. Various molecules such as **second messengers, kinases and **transcription factors** mediate the processes of converting information from the **signal molecule (hormone)** into a **cellular response**. **Insulin** and **glucagon** are examples of hormones that trigger **cell signalling pathways** to bring about **responses** to **regulate blood glucose level**.

It is important to appreciate the complexity and inter-connectedness of how the communication systems within and between cells interact to achieve the required response. The **maintenance of blood glucose levels** will be used to illustrate how **physiological responses** are **regulated by controlling gene expression**. Sufficient glucose in the blood is necessary to provide cells with respiratory substrates. The **pancreas** detects the **level of blood glucose** and **secretes either **insulin or glucagon** to maintain a stable level of glucose in blood. These hormones trigger **cellular responses in liver, muscle and adipose cells** when the **hormones bind to receptors**. **Signal transduction** occurs through **various proteins and molecules** to **amplify** and **transduce** the **signal** and eventually, **elicit a cellular response**. Thus, **cell signalling and communication** result in a **relatively stable internal environment** for **cells** in an organism to **function optimally**.

## LEARNING OUTCOMES

## Cell Signaling - Overview

This table serves as an overview. You must refer to the notes for details.

You need to know the cell signalling pathways triggered in response to insulin and glucagon.

For other signalling pathways, you will need to draw upon your understanding of the molecules involved.

### Possible types of cell surface membrane receptors:

G protein-linked receptors

Tyrosine kinase receptors

Ligand-gated ion channels

Signal molecules that are **hydrophilic** cannot traverse the hydrophobic

prosoluble **dynamically**, hence, need to bind to cell surface membrane

receptor. e.g. of cell surface membrane receptors - peptide hormones

undergoes **conformation** change

and is activated

Possible types of signal transduction:

1. **Phosphorylation Cascade**

Involves **activated protein kinases phosphorylating** (adding

phosphate group) the next protein in cascade to **activate** the

inactive proteins.

Involves protein phosphatases that **remove** phosphate groups

to **inactivate** proteins.

2. **Transduction by 2nd messengers (e.g. cAMP)**

Second messengers are small, non-protein molecules that **relay**

signals received by the receptors **to activate** intracellular pathways.

### Possible types of cellular responses:

NOTE: The type/s of cellular responses triggered **depends on the**

**signal** that binds to the specific receptor (signal reception) and the

subsequent enzyme/molecules activated (signal transduction)

1. **Expression of specific gene(s) to produce specific proteins**
2. **Enzymatic pathways**

Examples:

1. **Glycogenesis -**

Glucose >>glucose-6-phosphate >> >> glycogen
2. **Glycogenysis -**

Glycogen >>glucose
3. **Other Interactions among molecules** _(not in syllabus)_ e.g.

interact with myosin leading to muscle contractions

### Possible ways of signal termination:

1. **At receptors**

1. **Chemical modification to** **inactivate receptors**

Inactivation of signalling proteins

Down regulation via endocytosis / degradation by lysosomes
2. **At relay proteins**

Hydrolysis of bound GTP to GDP by GTPase

Converting cAMP to AMP by cAMP phosphodiesteraseterase

Increase phosphatase activity to inactivate relay proteins

### 1.3 Types of Cell Signalling

* Cell signaling can be classified into 4 main categories.
* Paracrine signaling
* Autocrine signaling
* Hormonal/endocrine signaling
* Synaptic signaling between neurons of the nervous system _(FYI only; not in syllabus)_

#### a) Paracrine Signaling

* A type of **local** signaling where a **secreting cell** discharges substances (**chemical signals**) into the **interstitial/tissue fluid** to act on **nearby target cells** (Fig. 1.3).
* These signal molecules are rapidly removed from the interstitial/tissue fluid to prevent them from diffusing and exerting their effects over long distances.
* This removal occurs via 1. uptake by target cells 2. destruction by extracellular enzymes
* E.g. growth factors secreted by neutrophils during inflammation to stimulate cell growth and division.

#### b) Autocrine Signaling

* **Local signaling** where a cell secretes signal molecules that bind to its **own cell surface receptors** (Fig. 1.4).
* E.g. In response to bacterial antigens, monocytes (a type of leukocyte) secretes interleukin-1 (IL-1) which binds to its own cell surface receptor called IL-1 receptor.

Figure 1.4: Autocrine signaling

Figure 1.3: Paracrine signaling – a secreting cell discharges chemical messengers into its vicinity, which affects target cells but not non-target cells.

**c)**: **Hormonal / Endocrine Signaling**
* **Long-distance signaling** where specialized **endocrine cells** secrete hormones into the bloodstream and is transported in the blood to **other cells in the body** (Fig. 1.5).
* E.g. insulin secreted by the \(\beta\) cells of the islets of Langerhans of the pancreas is transported by the bloodstream to target liver cells and muscle cells.

### **Cell Signaling - How do cells receive and communicate the signals?**

**Key Concept 2:**

Cell signaling ensures that crucial **activities** occur in the **right cells**, at the **right time** and in **proper coordination with** the **other cells** of the organism.

It comprises 3 main stages: (1) **signal reception**, (2) **transduction**, (3) **response**.

* There are hundreds of different specific types of cell signaling pathways, but all of them share the same features [(1) **signal reception**, (2) **transduction**, (3) **response**].
* Examples:
* Ras signaling in the regulation of cell division
* Glucagon and insulin signaling in the regulation of blood glucose concentration
* Cytokine signaling in the activation of gene transcription during immune response

#### 1.4.1 Process

* **Signal molecules/ligands** are molecules that carries information from the environment. These signal molecules bind **specifically and reversibly** to a **complementary receptor** to form the receptor-ligand complex **(reception)**. The information carried will then be **converted into another chemical form** (**transduced**) inside the cell before the cell can **respond** (Fig. 1.6).
* Cell signaling involves 3 main stages: (1) **signal reception**, (2) **transduction**, (3) **response**.

Figure 1.5: Hormonal/endocrine signaling – hormones are secreted directly into the bloodstream by endocrine cells

### _Signal Reception_

* Membrane receptors transfer information from the environment to the cell's interior.
* A cell targeted by a particular chemical signal has **receptor molecules at the cell surface membrane** which are **complementary in shape** to the signal molecule. Most of these signal receptors are **transmembrane proteins.**
* The **signal molecule** is detected when it **binds** to the binding site of **specific complementary receptor protein**.
* This interaction causes a **conformational change** in the **receptor protein** and **activates** it.
* The activated receptor then **interacts** with **another molecule** or **aggregate with another receptor molecule**.

### _Transduction_

* Transduction is induced by the activated receptor which converts the signal to specific cellular responses **via a cascade of reactions** (_i.e._ a series of) **that amplifies the signal.** \(\circ\) E.g. the phosphorylation cascade
* In some cases, transduction may occur in a **single step**.

### _Cellular Response_

* The transduced signal triggers a **specific cellular response**.
* Examples: \(\circ\) Enzyme catalysis (glycogen phosphorylase catalyses the breakdown of glycogen) \(\circ\) Rearrangement of cytoskeleton (movement of synaptic vesicles containing neurotransmitter) \(\circ\) Activation of specific genes in the nucleus (testosterone or progesterone needed for the development of secondary sexual characteristics).

Fig.1.6: The three main stages of cell signaling

## 2 Signal Reception

Receptors associated with membranes are known as membrane receptors, some examples include:

* G protein-linked receptor (a.k.a. G protein-coupled receptor)
* Tyrosine kinase receptor

**Note:**_You are expected to use the knowledge gained in this section to apply to novel situations involving other types of cell signaling._

### G Protein-linked Receptor Signalling

#### 2.1.1 Features of the G protein-linked receptor

* The G protein-linked receptor is a group of similar proteins that activate G protein.
* It is a cell surface membrane protein with **7****a-helices spanning the membrane**. **Specific loops** between the helices form **binding sites** for (Fig. 1):

* extracellular **signal molecule**, and
* intracellular **G protein** (a trimeric protein)

In turn, the **G protein** acts as an **on-off switch**

* If **GDP** (guanosine diphosphate) is **bound**, the G protein is **inactive**
* If **GTP** (guanosine triphosphate) is **bound**, the G protein is **active**
* Examples of G protein-linked receptors in different cell types include:
* responsible for sense of smell
* Rod photoreceptors of the eyes- responsible for sight
* responsible for glucagon-induced responses

Figure 1: The G Protein-linked receptor

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:11]

### Tyrosine Kinase Receptor Signaling

* Features of the Tyrosine Kinase Receptor
* The tyrosine kinase receptor is a group of similar proteins **with kinase activity** and is capable of **phosphorating tyrosine residues** in the protein.
* A transmembrane protein with a **single alpha helix spanning the membrane** (Fig. 4) with: 1. an **extracellular ligand binding site**, and 2. an **intracellular catalytic tail** containing **intrinsic tyrosine kinase (enzyme)** and **several tyrosine residues**. (Recall: tyrosine is an amino acid)
* The **intracellular tyrosine kinase tail** functions as a **kinase enzyme** that **catalyzes** the **transfer of phosphate groups from ATP molecules to tyrosine residues of intracellular tail of another tyrosine kinase receptor (Fig. 4).
* The tyrosine kinase receptor system is effective in regulating and coordinating a variety of activities, and triggering several signaling pathways simultaneously (e.g. during cell growth and reproduction).
* Examples of tyrosine kinase receptors include: \(\circ\) Insulin receptor \(\circ\) Epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor \(\circ\) Fibroblast growth factor (FGF) receptor

Figure 4: Tyrosine kinase tail phosphorylates the tyrosine residues of intracellular tail of another tyrosine kinase receptor.

### 2.2 Tyrosine Kinase Receptor Signal Reception & Transduction Process

Figure 2.5: Tyrosine Kinase Receptor signal reception and transduction

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:14]

### Intracellular Receptor Signaling (details are not required in the syllabus)

#### a) Features of Intracellular Receptors

* These are **signal receptors** that are found in the **cytosol** (e.g. testosterone receptor) or in the **nucleus** (e.g. thyroid hormone receptor) of target cells (Fig. 8).
* These **receptors bind to ligands/signal molecules that are small** (e.g. nitric oxide) and **hydrophobic** in nature (e.g. steroid hormones such as testosterone and oestrogen).
* Serve as **both intracellular receptors and effectors** for the signal molecule

#### b) Intracellular Receptor Signal Transduction Process (Fig. 8)

1. Signals which are usually **steroidal** in nature (e.g. steroid hormones) are able to directly **diffuse** through the plasma membrane, **bind** to and **activate intracellular receptor proteins** (either cytosolic or in nucleus, depending on the ligand).
2. These activated proteins (in the form of hormone-receptor complexes) enter the nucleus and act as **transcription factors** that **switches on specific genes**, which are then **transcribed** into **messenger RNA** (mRNA).
3. The mRNA molecules leave the nucleus and carry information that **directs the synthesis** of **specific proteins** (via **translation**) at the ribosome.

Figure 8: Intracellular receptor signaling. The hormone-receptor complex acts as an effector (transcription factor) which activates the transcription of genes.

## 3 Signal Transduction

**Key Concept 3:**

Signal Transduction is a **multistep**, **cascaded** pathway that **amplifies the signal** by

(i) **phosphorylation-dephosphorylation reactions** and/or (ii) **second messengers**.

### _Important Features_

* In a signal transduction pathway, the signal molecule is not passed along the pathway. Instead, **information** is passed on by molecules that **relay** the signal in multistep processes such as \(\circ\) Phosphorylation-dephosphorylation reactions of subsequent proteins in the signal transduction pathway and/or \(\circ\) Second messengers (e.g. cyclic AMP)

This relaying of signals is a **multistep** process that allows for **greater fine-tuning of cellular responses** and for **amplification** of the signal. Such a series of signal amplification is known as **cascade amplification** (Fig. 3.1)

* Each catalytic step in a cascade produces a **larger number of activated products** than in the **preceding step**.
* Thus, a **very small amount** of **signal** will give a **large response** as each activated enzyme molecule can convert many substrate molecules into products per unit time before being inactivated.

Fig. 3.1: Signal amplification

### Transduction by Protein Phosphorylation and Dephosphorylation

* Protein phosphorylation is the **transfer of phosphate groups from ATP to a target protein** by **protein kinase.** The phosphorylation causes the target protein to undergo a **conformational change** and **convert** from the **inactive to active** form.
* It is a widespread cellular mechanism for **regulating protein activity**. It can also be seen as a **post-translational control** of gene expression.
* The protein kinases act on amino acid **serine** or **threonine** of its substrate (usually another protein kinase) in a signal transduction pathway leading to a **phosphorylation cascade** (Fig. 3.2).

A **phosphorylation cascade** is **sequence of phosphorylation reactions** where the activated relay protein phosphorylates and activates a protein kinase which in turn **phosphorylates** and **activates the subsequent protein kinase** leading to an amplified and divergent cellular response.

Conversely, **protein phosphatases remove phosphate groups from proteins** thus **inactivating protein kinases,** in the absence of the extracellular signal. This consequently turns off the signal transduction pathway.

Figure 3.2: A phosphorylation cascade

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:18]

* **Examples of second messengers**

## 1 Cyclic AMP (cAMP)

* When a signal molecule such as the hormone adrenaline or glucagon binds to the **G** protein-**linked receptors**, G-protein is activated, which in turn, binds to and **activates adenylyl cyclase** in the plasma membrane (Fig. 3.4).
* Activated adenylyl cyclase catalyses the **conversion of ATP to cAMP**.
* The cAMP acts as a **second messenger** and diffuses throughout the cell and **activates protein kinase A** (a cAMP-dependent protein kinase).
* This in turn **phosphorylates other proteins** which **activates transcription of target genes**.
* The cAMP is then rapidly hydrolys by cAMP phosphodiesterase to form AMP.

Figure 3.4: cAMP as the second messenger.

Figure 3.3: Calcium ion sequestration from the cytosol.

## 2 Calcium ions (details not required in syllabus)

Normally, Ca\({}^{2+}\) is **maintained** at a **much lower concentration in the cytosol** than in the extracellular/tissue/interstitial fluid, endoplasmic reticulum, and under certain conditions, the mitochondria and chloroplast.

This is due to the **active transport of Ca\({}^{2+}\)** from the cytosol into the extracellular/tissue/interstitial fluid and these organelles by various protein pumps.

Cytosolic Ca\({}^{2+}\) can be increased in 2 ways:

* **cAMP** activates the **opening of plasma membrane Ca\({}^{2+}\) channels** allowing facilitated diffusion of extracellular Ca\({}^{2+}\) into the cytosol (e.g. in olfactory sensory neurons).
* **IP\({}_{3}\)** (inositol trisphosphate) activates the **release of intracellular store of Ca\({}^{2+}\)** in the **endoplasmic reticulum** (Fig. 3.5): 1. A signal molecule binds to G-protein linked membrane receptors or tyrosine kinase receptors and **activates phospholipase C**.
2. Phospholipase C in turn **cleaves a membrane phospholipid (PIP\({}_{2}\))** to give two _other_ second messengers, **diacylglycerolcerol (DAG)** and **inositol trisphosphate (IP\({}_{3}\))**.
3. IP\({}_{3}\) diffuses through the cytosol, binds to, activates and opens **IP\({}_{3}\)-gated Ca\({}^{2+}\) channels** on the **endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane**, releasing Ca\({}^{2+}\) from the ER thereby increasing cytosolic Ca\({}^{2+}\) concentration.
4. Ca\({}^{2+}\) ions also acts in a **positive feedback loop** where increased cytosolic Ca\({}^{2+}\) activate more IP\({}_{3}\)-gated Ca\({}^{2+}\) channels triggering the release of more Ca\({}^{2+}\) stores, thus amplifying the response.
5. DAG and Ca\({}^{2+}\) ions also participate in the activation of protein kinase C which phosphorylates specific target proteins.

* An **increase in cytosolic Ca\({}^{2+}\)** concentration usually **activates a wide variety of enzymatic processes** e.g. smooth muscle contraction, exocytosis and glycogen metabolism.
* Ca\({}^{2+}\) ions are eventually pumped out of the cell into the extracellular fluid or back into the ER to **terminate the initial Ca\({}^{2+}\)** response and restore the low cytosolic Ca\({}^{2+}\) concentration.

Figure 3.5: How the calcium ion store in the ER can be released into the cytosol.

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:21]

Examples:

* **Adrenaline** triggers **liver** or **skeletal muscle cells** to **break down glycogen**, but stimulate **cardiac muscle cells** to **contract**, leading to a rapid heartbeat.
* **Acetylcholine** decreases rate and force of contraction in cardiac muscles but stimulates contraction of skeletal muscle & secretion of enzymes by salivary gland.
* **Same cell** with **different receptors** can receive **different signals** to trigger a **coordinated cellular response**. Branching of pathways and interactions ("cross-talk") between pathways (Fig. 4.2, Cell C) **allow fine-tuned regulation and coordination of a cell's response to incoming information from different sources**.
* **The efficiency** of signal transduction may be **increased** by the presence of **scaffold proteins** (Fig. 4.3).
* Scaffold proteins are large relay proteins to which several other relay proteins (usually protein kinases) are simultaneously attached.
* Scaffolding proteins facilitate the activation of specific phosphorylation cascade(s) thereby **enhancing** the **speed** and **accuracy** of signal transfer between intracellular proteins.
* Some scaffolding proteins also participate in more than one pathway in different cell types or at different times in the same cell thus forming a complex signaling network.

Fig. 4.3: The presence of a scaffold protein facilitates the signaling cascade.

## 5 Advantages and Significance of Cell Signaling Systems

in Multicellular Organisms

1. **Signal amplification** (Fig. 3.1) - A very small amount of signal is sufficient to give a large response because each catalytic step in a cascade produces a larger number of activated products than in the preceding step.
2. **Regulated and controlled cellular response** - The multi-step signaling cascade enables a greater fine-tuning and control as each enzyme-catalyzed step can be controlled independently of the preceding steps, ensuring an appropriate cellular response. In addition, signal termination (Section 4.2) ensures that ligand reception will not lead to unintended prolonged cellular responses.
3. **Specificity** - Each ligand is specific only to certain receptor(s) found on certain cell type(s). This ensures that only the appropriate cells are being targeted. For example, the hormone erythropoietin (Epo) is only specific to erythropoietin receptor (EpoR) found on bone marrow stem cells, which then differentiate to give erythrocytes.
4. **Reception on the cell surface membrane can lead to activation of genes in the nucleus** - Many ligands are hydrophilic in nature. Cell signaling system ensures that these ligands are able to activate gene transcription even though they are unable to traverse through the hydrophobic core of the cell membrane into the cell.
5. **A single signal molecule can trigger numerous cellular reactions at once** - At certain point, the signaling pathway may branch off (Fig. 4.2, Cell B) such that different kinds of intracellular signaling proteins are activated. These activated proteins then activate the respective sets of genes, leading to different cellular response.
6. **Coordinated cellular response** - Coordinated responses can be initiated within the same cell responding to different ligands at the same time due to interactions ("cross-talk") between the different pathways activated by the different receptors (Fig. 4.2, Cell C).
7. **A single type of signal molecule can activate many** _different cell types_ **simultaneously to trigger numerous different cellular reactions** at once

* e.g. Adrenaline triggers liver or striated muscle cells to break down glycogen, but stimulate cardiac muscle cells to contract, leading to a rapid heartbeat

## 6 Achieving Equilibrium In the Internal Environment

### Overview

* For **optimal** function, the internal environment of an organism needs to be maintained constant (within narrow limits) despite changes in the external environment.
* The internal environment refers to the **intracellular (inside the cell) and extracellular (in the tissue fluid surrounding the cell) environment** of the body.
* Some important parameters in the internal environment include
* Low temperatures inactivate enzymes, hence, slowing metabolic reactions.
* High temperatures denature proteins and enzymes.
* The pH of blood and tissue fluid, as well as the pH of cytosol, has to be kept within narrow limits to prevent denaturation of enzymes and proteins.
* **Concentration of glucose*
* Glucose is the primary respiratory substrate. A lack of it causes respiration to slow down or stop.
* Excess blood glucose (a solute) may cause water to leave cells into the blood by osmosis. Excessive retention of water in the blood can cause high blood pressure.
* **Volume of water in the blood*
* Lack of water in the tissue fluid causes water to leave the cells by osmosis, causing metabolic reactions to slow down or to stop.
* Too much water entering the cell may cause dilution of metabolites.
* Thus, maintaining an equilibrium in the internal environment is important to :
* ensure that enzymes and metabolic processes can function **optimally*
* for organisms to live and reproduce.
* ensure that **limits are not exceeded**, hence, preventing dangerous fluctuations.
* provide the organism with a degree of **independence of the external environment**.
* The roles of signal molecules in maintaining this equilibrium is illustrated in Sections 6.2 and 6.3. The signal molecules are a pair of protein hormones, insulin and glucagon, which act antagonistically to maintain blood glucose concentration within the tight limit of 70-110 mg glucose /100ml blood. The normal level or set point of blood glucose is 90 mg /100ml blood.

### Case Study: Regulation of Blood Glucose Concentration by Insulin Signaling

#### (A) Regulation of blood glucose level by Insulin Signaling in Liver and Muscle Cells

(Fig. 6.1)

* When blood glucose level rises above the set point of 90mg glucose /100m of blood (e.g. after a meal), insulin is released by \(\beta\) cells of the islets of Langerhans of pancreas to bring about responses in liver cells, muscle cells and other respiring cells that would **lower blood glucose level back to the set point**:

4. Signal Termination & Cellular responses can be terminated by acting on the:

(1) Receptors & Chemical modification to inactivate receptors

* Inactivation of signalling proteins
* Down regulation via endocytosis / degradation by lysosomes

(2) Relay proteins & Hybridysis of bound GTP to GDP by GTPase

* Converting cAMP to AMP by cAMP phosphodiesteraseterase

* Increase phosphatase activity to inactive relay proteins
