# The Structure of the Atom

The Discovery of the Subatomic Particles (Background Info)

The 5\({}^{\rm th}\) century B.C. Greek philosopher Democritus proposed that one couldn't divide a piece of gold wire forever until there isn't any gold left as all matter consists of very small, indivisible particles. He called these particles _atomos_, meaning "uncuttable" or "indivisible". This concept remained undeveloped until nineteenth century.

In 1808, an English scientist and school teacher, _John Dalton_ formulated the atomic theory that all matter is made up of atoms.

In 1897, _J.J. Thomson_ proposed a model that described atoms as negatively charged electrons embedded in a sphere of positive charge, which was then known as the "plum pudding model.

In 1910, _Rutherford_ observed that the majority of the \(\alpha\)-particles passing through a thin sheet of gold foil went through with little deflection. But every now and then, he would observe great deflection. In some instances the particle actually bounced back. This surprising discovery led to the theory that the positive charge in the atom is concentrated into an incredibly small nucleus right in the middle of it. The diameter of the nucleus is less than \(10^{-5}\) of the atom.

Not until 1932 did the English physicist _James Chadwick_ finally discover the neutron. He found it to be electrically neutral, having about the same mass as a proton. Together, the proton and neutron received the name "nucleon."

### Isotopes

_LO 1(e)(ii): distinguish between isotopes on the basis of different numbers of neutrons present_

Atoms of the same element do not all have the same mass.

_Isotopes_ are **atoms of an element that have the same proton number but different nucleon numbers** (or same number of protons but different number of neutrons).

Isotopes of an element have the same electronic configuration and chemical properties. They have different relative isotopic masses and physical properties.

Some common isotopes include: hydrogen (\({}^{1}\)H, \({}^{2}\)H, \({}^{3}\)H), carbon (\({}^{12}\)C, \({}^{13}\)C), oxygen (\({}^{16}\)O, \({}^{18}\)O), sulfur (\({}^{32}\)S, \({}^{34}\)S) and nitrogen (\({}^{14}\)N, \({}^{15}\)N).

Isotopes may be stable or **unstable (radioactive)**, E.g. the isotope \({}^{14}\)C decays by \(\beta\)-emission with a half-life of 5730 years.

When writing the chemical symbol for an element, it is not always necessary to write either or both the nucleon and proton numbers. E.g. \({}^{1}\)H may be written as \({}^{1}\)H or H. We assume the most abundant isotope is referred to when simply writing \({}^{1}\)H' for example. However, when it is necessary to refer to a particular isotope of an element, the nucleon number as well as the proton number must be indicated e.g. if we want to refer to deuterium, then we should write \({}^{2}_{1}\)H for clarity's sake.

**Exercise 1.1 (Worked Example)**

Complete the following table with the no. of protons, neutrons and electrons for each particle.

**Comments:**

For each case, the subscript refers to the proton number (i.e. the number of protons present).

For (a), since it is a neutral atom, no. of protons = no. of electrons.

For (b), since it is positively charged, there should be 3 less electrons than protons. Hence, no. of electrons = 31 - 3 = 28.

For (c), since it is negatively charge; there should be 3 more electrons than protons. Hence, no. of electrons = 15 + 3 = 18.

The superscript refers to the nucleon number (i.e. the total number of protons and nucleons present). Thus, no. of neutrons = nucleon number - no. of protons.

For (a), no. of neutrons = 28 - 14 = 14.

For (b), no. of neutrons = 70 - 31 = 39.

For (c), no. of neutrons = 31 - 15 = 16

## 2 Quantifying the masses of atoms

In Section 1.2, we have looked at the composition of the atom. While the protons, neutrons and electrons have masses, they are so small such that it is impossible to weigh atoms individually except for highly specialised equipment. For day-to-day use in a laboratory, an easier way to quantify the masses of atoms is needed. And so we usually measure the _relative_ masses of atoms, or how heavy one atom is compared to another atom.

### Relative Masses of Atoms

_LO 6(a)port: define the terms relative atomic, isotopic masses_

We call this relative mass the relative atomic mass of an atom. We measure all relative masses against the mass of carbon-12, the most abundant isotope of carbon. Hence, the definition of relative atomic mass would look like the following:

Note that the word 'average' is used in the definition above as the atomic mass of an atom takes into account the relative abundance of all possible isotopes of that element. We will deal with the idea of relative abundance of isotopes in the next section.

In cases where we want to deal very specifically with the atomic mass of one of the possible isotopes of an element, then we would call this the relative isotopic mass. The definition would look like the following:

### Relative Abundance of isotopes

_LO 6(c): calculate the relative atomic mass of an element given the relative abundances of its isotopes_

Most elements consist of mixtures of isotopes. The abundance of each isotope in a mixture is called the _isotopic abundance_ or the _relative abundance_.

For instance, chlorine has two isotopes; \({}^{35}\)_CI_ and \({}^{37}\)_CI_ (note that isotopes of the same element have the same atomic number). Naturally occurring samples of chlorine are found to contain \({}^{35}\)_CI_ and \({}^{37}\)_CI_ in a ratio of 3:1. Hence, the relative abundance of \({}^{35}\)_CI_ is 75% and the relative abundance of \({}^{37}\)_CI_ is 25%.

The relative atomic mass of an element is also the sum of the relative isotopic masses of each isotope multiplied by their relative abundances.

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:11]

## 3 The arrangement of the electrons

LO 1(f): describe the number and relative energies of the s,p and d orbitals for the principal quantum numbers 1, 2 and 3 and also the 4s and 4p orbitals

### Principal Quantum Shell

In order to understand chemical reactions, one must understand how electrons are arranged in atoms. Much about what we know of electrons comes from quantum theory, which states that electrons can be described by four _quantum numbers_, (The only one required in the A-level syllabus is the principal quantum number, \(n\), of only integer value of 1, 2, 3,...)

The principal quantum number, n, describes the main energy level of an electron. It also indicates the relative size of the orbital and therefore relative distance of the electron from the nucleus. The larger the value of n, the higher the energy level and the further the electron is from the nucleus.

All atomic orbitals of the same value of \(n\) are said to be in the same quantum shell.

The maximum number of electrons that can occupy each principal quantum shell can be obtained by the formula \(2n^{2}\).

### Subshells

Each principal quantum shell can be subdivided into one or more **subshells** (or sub levels). The number of subshells in a principal quantum shell is the same as its principal quantum number.

Subshells within a given quantum shell differ slightly in energy, with the energy of the subshell increasing according to the following order: s, p, d, f, i.e., energy of \(45<4\)p < \(46<4\)f.

Figure 6: Principal quantum shells of an atom

### Atomic Orbitals

Electrons are not randomly distributed in the region of space around the nucleus. They occupy specific volume regions, called **orbitals**, which have specific energies associated with them. According to the current quantum mechanical model of the atom, electrons in an atom **do not** remain in specific positions. They move in spaces defined by the Schrodinger's equation and Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle (_NOT in A-level syllabus_). Instead of predicting the precise location for each electron in an atom, each electron is assigned to an energy level and orbital as it can only possess specific quantities of energy.

An atomic orbital is defined as the region of space with a 90% probability (or more) of finding an electron. This distribution of the probability of finding an electron at a certain position is the electron density.

Each subshell (s, p, d, f) has one or more orbitals at the same energy level (degenerate) but different orientations in space.

Each orbital can contain up to a maximum of 2 electrons. These electrons are of opposite spins.

The table below summarises the relationships among principal quantum shells, subshells, orbitals and number of electrons.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|} \hline
**principal quantum** & **subshell** & **number of orbitals** & **maximum number of electrons in each principal quantum shell, \(2n^{2}\)** \\ \hline
**1** & **1** & **1** & **2** \\ \hline
**2** & **2** & **1** & **2** \\
**3** & **2** & **3** & **8** \\

**4** & **4** & **1** & **3** \\
**4** & **4** & **5** & **32** \\
**4** & **4** & **7** & **7** \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 5: Summary of the relationship between principal quantum shells, subshells and orbitals

#### 3.3.1 The s Orbital

Each **s subshell** has **only one s orbital**. All s orbitals are **spherical** in shape with no nodal plane (region of zero electron density). The probability of finding an electron at a given distance from the nucleus is the same regardless of the direction from the nucleus. The size of s orbitals increases with the principal quantum number, i.e., 1s < 2s 3s,...

#### 3.3.2 The p Orbital

Each **p subshell** has **three p orbitals**. Since each orbital can hold up to **2** electrons, each p **subshell** can hold up to **6** electrons. There are no p orbitals in the first quantum shell.

The **p orbital** is **dumb-bell** in shape. Each p orbital consists of two lobes with a region of zero electron density (node) between them centered on the nucleus.

The three p orbitals in a certain quantum shell are **identical** in **size** and **shape** but differ in their **spatial orientation**. The three p orbitals are represented as **p\({}_{\rm v}\)**, **p\({}_{\rm v}\)**, **p\({}_{\rm u}\)**, where the subscripts denote the axes along which the orbitals are orientated. The three p orbitals are **degenerate**, i.e. at the same energy level. The size of p orbitals increases with the principal quantum number, i.e. 2p < 3p < 4p.

Figure 8: The p orbital

Figure 7: The s orbital

#### 3.3.3 The d Orbital

Each d subshell has five d orbitals. Since each orbital can hold a maximum of 2 electrons, each d subshell can hold up to 10 electrons. There are five d orbitals: d\({}_{xy}\), d\({}_{ax}\), d\({}_{yz}\), d\({}_{z}^{2}\), d\({}_{x}^{2}\). The five d orbitals are also degenerate. The size of d orbitals increases with the principal quantum number, i.e. 3d < 4d < 5d...

## 4 Periodic trends in atomic and ionic radii

_LO 5(b)part: describe and explain qualitatively the general trends and variations in atomic radius, ionic radius, first ionisation energy_

_(i) across a Period in terms of shielding and nuclear charge,_

_(ii) down a Group in terms of increasing number of electronic shells, shielding and nuclear charge_

In explaining periodic trends in atomic and ionic radii, two fundamental considerations are important:

**(i) number of quantum shells**

The **number of quantum shells** determine how far the outermost electron is from the nucleus. The further the outermost electron is from the nucleus, the weaker the attraction between the outermost electron and the nucleus.

**(ii) effective nuclear charge**

The **effective nuclear charge**, \(\mathbf{Z_{eff}}\), is the **net nuclear charge** experienced by an **outer electron**. It is dependent on:

**(a) Nuclear charge (2)**: The nuclear charge is dependent on the number of protons. The larger the number of protons, the greater the nuclear charge and the attraction for the outermost electrons by the nucleus.

**(b) Shielding or screening effect (S)**: Presence of inner-shell electrons reduces the electrostatic attraction between the outermost electrons and the nucleus.

Hence,

**(a) For example, shielding of \(p\) electrons by \(s\) or \(p\) electrons in the same quantum shell does occur.

#### Why are the atomic radii of the noble gases so large?

The term atomic radius does not mean the same thing for every element. The atomic radii given for He, Ne and Ar in the _Data Booklet_ are labelled van der Waals' radii, rather than covalent radii (see Chapter 02 Section 4.2 for explanation). Ar, for instance, does not form compounds, so it will not have a covalent radius. The van der Waals' radius of an atom is always larger than the covalent radius, which explains the anomalously high atomic radii of the noble gases in the graph above.

###### Abstract

The 3p subshell of _Al_ is further away from the nucleus than the 3s subshell. There is weaker attraction between the nucleus and the outermost electron. Hence less energy is required to remove the 3p electron from _Al_, resulting in a lower ionisation energy for _Al_.

First ionisation energy remains relatively invariant.

First ionisation energy remains relatively invariant.

11 ionisation energy involves removal of a 4s electron

The nuclear charge increases due to increasing number of protons while additional electrons are added to the inner 3d subshell, which contributes to the shielding effect. The shielding effect increases thereby nullifying, to a considerable extent, the influence of each additional proton in the nucleus

###### Abstract

In this topic, we have looked at the structure of the atoms, the shapes and energies of the atomic orbitals, as well as the energies associated with removal of electrons from isolated gaseous atoms. In the following topic, we will be applying these concepts to help us understand how atoms interact to form chemical bonds.

In this topic, we have looked at the structure of the atoms, the shapes and energies of the atomic orbitals, as well as the energies associated with removal of electrons from isolated gaseous atoms. In the following topic, we will be applying these concepts to help us understand how atoms interact to form chemical bonds.

A particularly important and useful concept is that of effective nuclear charge. We have used this concept of effective nuclear charge quite extensively in this last section of Topic 1. So far, we have only considered isolated gaseous atoms and discussed the impact of the effective nuclear charge on removing electrons from these atoms. In reality, the electrostatic forces due to the effective nuclear charge of the atom extend beyond its outermost electron.

When two atoms are in proximity, the nucleus of each atom exerts an attractive force on its own electrons as well as the electrons of the other atom. The same nucleus also exerts a repulsive force on the nucleus of the other atom. This attraction and repulsion on the electrons and nucleus of the other atom by the first atom result in a net attractive force on the electrons of the other atom. It is quite clear then that the effective nuclear charge of the first atom would play a significant role in attracting the electrons of the other atom.

This attraction was first referred to as 'oxygenicity' in 1809 by Avogadro and Bezelius adopted the term 'electronegativity' in 1811. The concept of 'electronegativity' was finally defined and quantified by Linus Pauling in 1932. (Interesting fact: Linus Pauling is the only person to be awarded two unshared Nobel Prizes.)

Electronegativity quantifies the attractive force one atom exerts on the electrons of another atom in a chemical bond. A larger number implies a larger force of attraction towards the electrons. We will have a more thorough discussion of the concept of electronegativity when we deal with chemical bonding in Topic 2.

### Metallic Bonding & Physical Properties of Metals

### Metallic Lattice

_LO 2(l) part: describe, in simple terms, the lattice structure of a crystalline solid which is: (d) metallic, as in copper_

Metals in the solid state have a **giant metallic lattice structure** which is a lattice of **metal cations** and the **sea of delocalised electrons** held together by metallic bonding.

Figure 3 shows the structure and bonding in calcium metal.

Figure 3: Structure and bonding in calcium metal

In solid calcium, Ca\({}^{2+}\) cations are arranged in a **regular** manner. Each Ca atom contributes **two valence electrons** into the **sea of delocalised electrons**. These delocalised electrons are no longer attracted to only one specific atom but can **move freely** throughout the lattice. These delocalised electrons are responsible for the characteristic physical properties of metals such as good electrical and thermal conductivity.

**Note:** The metal is electrically neutral as the number of positive and negative charges **balance** out.

### Strength of Metallic Bonding

The strength of the attraction between the metal cations and the delocalised electrons depends on:

* **number of valence electrons contributed per metal atom** The larger the number of valence electrons contributed per atom, the greater the number of delocalised electrons, the stronger the metallic bonding.
* **charge and radius of the metal cation** The higher the charge and the smaller the radius of the metal cation, the higher its **charge density*, and the stronger the metallic bonding.

* Charge density of an ion, sometimes called surface charge density, is the amount of charge per unit surface area of that ion. For simplicity, we can compare the charge densities of two ions by comparing their \(\frac{\text{ionic charge}}{\text{ionic radius}}\) ratio.

### Physical properties of metals

_TO 2(m): describe, interpret and/or predict the effect of different types of structure and bonding on the physical properties of substances_

_LO 2(n): suggest the type of structure and bonding present in a substance from given information_

#### 2.3.1 High melting and boiling points

Metals have **high** melting and boiling points as a large amount of energy is needed to overcome the strong attraction between the metal cations and the delocalised electrons.

The **stronger** the metallic bonding, **more** energy is needed to overcome the metallic bonding, the **higher** the melting and boiling points.

Exercise 2.1 (Worked Example)

Explain why the melting point of Mg (650 \({}^{\circ}\)C) is higher than that of Na (98 \({}^{\circ}\)C), quoting relevant data from the _Data Booklet_.

Answer:

Each Mg atom has two valence electrons while each Na atom has one valence electron. Hence, magnesium has a larger number of delocalised electrons.

Mg\({}^{\pm}\)(0.065 nm) has a larger charge and smaller ionic radius than Na\({}^{\star}\) (0.095 nm). Mg\({}^{\pm}\) has a higher charge density than Na\({}^{\star}\).

More energy is needed to overcome the **stronger metallic bonding** in magnesium than that in sodium.

Useful informationWhen a solid metal _melts_, the closely packed cations become further apart but the metallic bonding is _not completely broken_; unlike during boiling: Hence, the boiling point is a better indicator of the strength of metallic bonding than the melting point.

#### 2.3.2 Good electrical and thermal conductivity

In order for a material to conduct electricity, it must have **mobile charge carriers** which are typically electron or ions. Metals are good electrical conductors because the delocalised electrons act as mobile charge carriers.

The delocalised electrons also explain why metals are good conductors of heat. Thermal energy causes the electrons to move more quickly. The energy is then transferred to the other parts of the metal by the mobile electrons.

Exercise 2.2Why does copper wire conduct electricity when a potential difference is applied?

A Bonding electrons in the crystal lattice move.

B Copper(II) ions move to the cathode.

C The atoms of copper become ionised.

D The crystal lattice breaks down.

[J2002/1/5]

#### 2.3.3 Malleable and ductile

Metals are usually malleable (easily beaten or rolled into sheets) and ductile (easily drawn into rods, wires and tubes). When a large stress (e.g. hammering) is applied to a piece of solid metal, the layers of ions will slide over one another into new positions. The overall shape of the metal changes (the metal deforms) but it does not break apart because the'sea' of delocalised electrons prevents repulsion between the cations as they move past one another, and metallic bonding remains intact.

#### 2.3.4 Hardness

The hardness of a solid material depends on how easily we can move the particles from their fixed positions in the solid lattice. In metals, this depends on the strength of metallic bonding.

Metals are usually hard, although the Group 1 and 2 metals are soft, iron is hard and does nor deform easily while sodium can be easily cut with a pen knife.

**Alloys & their uses [Application example]**

Most metals used in practical applications such as aluminium aircraft, frames are in the form of an alloy instead of the pure metal.

Alloys are mixtures of metals involving incorporation of small quantities of other element(s) into the pure metal. Alloying makes metals harder. This is because atoms of the added element(s) have a different size. This will disrupt the orderly arrangement of the main metal atoms such that they can no longer slide over each other easily when a force is applied. This increases the hardness and strength of the alloy compared to the pure metal.

Figure 4: The metallic lattice when subjected to shear stress

Figure 5: Arrangement of atoms in an alloyIonic bonding exists between _any_ two adjacent ions of opposite charge. Ionic bonding is _non-directional_ and extends indefinitely in all directions while a covalent bond is _directional_ as one covalent bond can only be formed between _two specific_ atoms.

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:41]

#### Good electrical conductivity

In the solid state, ionic compounds do not conduct electricity as the ions are in fixed positions and are not free to move.

In the **molten** or aqueous state, ionic compounds are good electrical conductors because the ions can act as **mobile charge carriers**.

The electrical conductivity of an aqueous solution of an ionic compound increases as its concentration increases, because there are more ions to carry the charge.

Figure 7: Ionic compounds do not conduct electricity in the solid state but do so when molten or dissolved in aq. solution

#### 3.3.3 Hard and rigid but brittle

In an ionic lattice, oppositely charged ions are held in fixed positions throughout the crystal lattice by **strong** ionic bonding. Moving the ions out of position requires **large amounts of energy** to overcome these bonds. Ionic lattices are therefore quite **hard** (do not dent or deform easily) and **rigid** (do not bend easily).

If a strong enough force (e.g. by cutting or knocking) is applied, it will force ions of like charges to move next to each other. **Repulsion** between ions of **like** charges will cause the lattice to shatter. Ionic lattices are therefore brittle (crack without deforming).

#### 3.3.4 Solubility in Macro

Ionic compounds are usually soluble in water, e.g. NaCl, KBr and BaCl\({}_{2}\). However, there are examples of insoluble ionic compounds as well, e.g. AgCl. See Section 12 for the explanation on the solubility of ionic compounds.

## Hwa Chong

In a previous discussion, we have studied the effect of the _ab initio_ model on the electronic structure of the ionic compounds.

## 4 Formation and strength of covalent bonding

### Covalent Bonding and Orbital Overlap

_LO 2(c): describe covalent bonding in terms of orbital overlap (limited to \(s\) and \(p\) orbitals only), giving \(\sigma\) and \(\pi\) bonds_

A covalent bond is formed when two atoms share a pair of electrons which are found in the valence orbitals of the atoms.

In order for the bond to be formed, the orbitals of the two atoms must overlap. The shared electrons or bond pairs occupy the region between the two nuclei formed by the overlap.

There are two types of orbital overlap:

* **sigma (\(\sigma\)) bond** is formed by 'head-on' overlap of two orbitals.

While p orbitals can overlap both head-on and side-on, s orbitals can only overlap head-on to form sigma bonds; they are unable to overlap side-on to form pi bonds.

Figure 10: Side-on overlap between two p orbitals to form a \(\pi\) bond.

### _Dot-and-Cross Diagrams for Covalent Compounds_

_10 2(b)(ii): describe, including the use of 'dot-and-cross' diagrams: covalent bonding as in hydrogen; oxygen; nitrogen; chlorine; hydrogen chloride; carbon dioxide; methionine; eitene._

Figure 14 shows the dot-and-cross diagrams for the hydrogen, oxygen and nitrogen molecules. Between any two bonded atoms, use different electron symbols (\(\bullet\) and \(\times\) only; do not use other symbols e.g. circles, triangles unless otherwise stated).

The hydrogen atom has one valence electron, so it forms one bond. The oxygen atom has six valence electrons. It needs two more electrons to attain an octet configuration so it forms two bonds. Similarly, nitrogen has five valence electrons and forms three bonds. Both oxygen and nitrogen obey the octet rule; each has eight electrons after sharing electrons. Hydrogen does not follow the octet rule since it is in Period 1 and its valence shell (1s) can only accommodate two electrons.

#### 5.2.1 Exceptions to the octet rule

The octet rule is based on empirical observations. We can use the rule to identify structures which are likely to be stable but it **cannot** be used to explain the stability of substances.

While the octet rule is obeyed by nearly all the Period 2 elements (such as C, N, O, F), there are several exceptions.

* **Molecule whose central atom has fewer than 8 electrons** In beryllium chloride and boron fluoride, the central atoms (Be and B) have fewer than 8 electrons in their valence shell. Beryllium chloride and boron fluoride are **electron deficient** species.

Figure 15: Dot-and-cross diagrams for beryllium chloride and boron fluoride

Figure 14: Dot-and-cross diagrams for hydrogen, oxygen and nitrogen

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:50]

### Further Dot-and-Cross Diagrams

Some dot-and-cross diagrams are less straight forward to draw, for example, C\({}_{2}\)H\({}_{4}\) (ethene), and polyatomic ions such as NH\({}_{4}\), SO\({}_{4}\)\({}^{2}\)- and NO\({}_{3}\)-.

**General guidelines**

1. Decide on the central atom, and the terminal atoms. The central atom is usually the one with the lowest electronegativity (e.g, sulfur in SO\({}_{4}\)\({}^{2}\)-) or the one that can form more covalent bonds (e.g. carbon in C\({}_{2}\)H\({}_{4}\) and nitrogen in NH\({}_{4}\)\({}^{4}\)); H forms one bond so it cannot be a central atom.
2. For polyatomic ions: For each (-) charge, add one electron to the more electronegative atom. E.g. oxygen is assigned the extra electrons in SO\({}_{4}\)\({}^{2}\)-

For each (+) charge, remove one electron from the less electronegative atom. E.g. the electron is removed from hydrogen; in NH\({}_{4}\)\({}^{*}\)

Draw square brackets around the ion and write its charge as a superscript outside the bracket.

### Co-ordinate Bonding (also called dative bonding)

_10 2(b)(iii): describe, including the use of (dot-and-cross' diagrams: co-ordinate (dative covalent) bonding, as in formation of the ammonium ion and in the Alicic molecule_

So far, we have looked at covalent bonds in which each atom provides one electron to form the bond. If both bonding electrons come from one atom, the bond is called co-ordinate bond or dative bond. A co-ordinate bond, once formed, is no different from any other covalent bond.

To form a co-ordinate bond, the donor atom must have a lone pair (valence electron pair not involved in bonding) while the acceptor atom must contain an empty orbital in its valence shell. We represent a co-ordinate bond with an arrow from the donor atom to the acceptor atom. In dot-and-cross diagrams, a co-ordinate bond is represented using two dots or two crosses.

**Example 1: NH\({}_{3}\)BF\({}_{3}\)**

When gaseous NH\({}_{3}\) and gaseous BF\({}_{3}\) react together, white solid NH\({}_{3}\)BF\({}_{3}\) forms.

The **nitrogen** atom in NH\({}_{3}\) has a **lone pair**. The **boron** atom in BF\({}_{3}\) has only 6 electrons in its valence shell and is **electron deficient**. It has an **empty 2p orbital** which can accept the lone pair from nitrogen.

**Example 2: AI\({}_{2}\)Cl\({}_{6}\)**

Just below its melting point, aluminium chloride exists as the AI\({}_{2}\)Cl\({}_{6}\) dimer.

In the monomer AI\({}_{3}\), the aluminium atom has 6 electrons in its valence shell and is **electron deficient**. It has an **empty 3p orbital** which can accept the **lone pair** from the **chlorine** atom of another AI\({}_{3}\) monomer.

**Example 3: The ammonium cation, NH\({}_{4}\)**

When gaseous NH\({}_{3}\) and gaseous HCl react together, the H-Cl bond breaks to give H\({}^{+}\) and Cl\({}^{+}\). **The lone pair** on the **nitrogen** atom forms a co-ordinate bond with H\({}^{+}\), which has an **empty 1s orbital**, to form NH\({}_{4}\).

**Figure 19. Dot-and-cross diagram and structure of AI\({}_{2}\)Cl\({}_{6}\) dimer. The co-ordinate bonds are broken above 800 \({}^{\circ}\)C.**

**Example 3: The ammonium cation, NH\({}_{4}\)**

When gaseous NH\({}_{3}\) and gaseous HCl react together, the H-Cl bond breaks to give H\({}^{+}\) and Cl\({}^{+}\). **The lone pair** on the **nitrogen** atom forms a co-ordinate bond with H\({}^{+}\), which has an **empty 1s orbital**, to form NH\({}_{4}\).

### Hybridisation of Atomic Orbitals

_LO 11.1(d): describe sp\({}^{1}\) hybridisation, as in ethane molecule, sp\({}^{2}\) hybridisation, as in ethene and benzene molecules, and sp hybridisation, as in ethyne molecule (Refer to Topic 12 Arenes with regards to benzene). LO 11.1(e): explain the shapes of, and bond angles in, the ethane, ethene, benzene, and ethyne molecules in relation to \(\alpha\) and \(\pi\) carbon-carbon bonds (Refer to Topic 12 Arenes with regards to benzene)_

### The hybridisation theory (Background info)

To account for the bonding in diatomic molecules like HF, we picture the direct overlap of s and p orbitals of isolated H and F atoms.

But how can we account for the shapes of so many molecules and polyatomic ions through the overlap of spherical s orbitals, dumbbell-shaped p orbitals and cloverleaf-shaped d orbitals?

For example, consider the methane molecule, CH\({}_{4}\), which has a tetrahedral shape and a bond angle of 109.5\({}^{\circ}\). Its tetrahedral shape suggests that its C atom should 'provide' four orbitals oriented in a tetrahedral geometry, each containing one electron, and each orbital forms a \(\alpha\) bond with the 1s orbital of a H atom via head-on overlap (Figure 24).

Figure 24: CH\({}_{4}\) molecule and expected orientation of orbitals around the C atom (each orbital forms a \(\sigma\) bond with the 1s orbital of a H atom)

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:62]

#### 6.2.1 The bonding in ethane, CH\({}_{3}\)CH\({}_{3}\) and sp\({}^{3}\) hybridisation of carbon

Similar to methane, both carbon atoms in ethane are **sp\({}^{3}\) hybridised**. Each carbon atom in ethane shares four electrons (one with each of three hydrogen atoms, and one with the other carbon atom), forming four **q** bonds. Mutual repulsion of the electrons in the four \(\alpha\) bonds around each carbon atom tends to place them as far apart as possible. Hence, the shape about each carbon atom is **tetrahedral** and the bond angles are **109.5\({}^{\circ}\)**.

For each carbon, the **four** sp\({}^{3}\) hybrid orbitals, obtained by mixing **one** s **orbital and three** p **orbitals**, are arranged in a **tetrahedral** geometry as shown in Figure 28b(i). The C-C bond is an sp\({}^{3}\)-sp\({}^{3}\)\(\sigma\) bond, formed from head-on overlap of two sp\({}^{3}\) hybrid orbitals from adjacent C atoms. There are six C-H bonds, each bond is s-sp\({}^{3}\)\(\sigma\) bond, formed from a head-on overlap of the 1s atomic orbital of H and the sp\({}^{3}\) hybrid orbital of C.

Figure 28b. Bonding in ethane, CH\({}_{3}\)CH\({}_{3}\)

Figure 27: Overlapping of orbitals in methane, CH\({}_{4}\)

#### 6.2.2 The bonding in ethene, CH\({}_{2}\)=CH\({}_{2}\) and sp\({}^{2}\) hybridisation of carbon

Each carbon atom shares three electrons (one with each of two hydrogen atoms, and one with the other carbon atom), forming three **o bonds**. The fourth electron on each carbon atom occupies a 2p orbital which overlaps side-on to form the **g bond**.

Mutual repulsion of the three groups of electrons around each carbon atom tends to place them as far apart as possible. Hence, the shape about each carbon atom is **trigonal planar** and the bond angles are **120\({}^{\circ}\)**.

For each carbon, the **three** sp\({}^{2}\) hybrid orbitals are arranged in a **trigonal planar** geometry as shown in Figure 29c(i). **One** **p orbital remains unhybridised**, and this p orbital is arranged perpendicular to the three sp\({}^{2}\) hybrid orbitals as shown in Figure 29c(ii).

The C=C double bond consists of one sp\({}^{2}\)-sp\({}^{2}\) \(\alpha\) bond formed by head-on overlap of two sp\({}^{2}\) hybrid orbitals, and one p-p \(\pi\) bond formed by side-on overlap of the unhybridised p orbitals.

There are four C=H bonds, each of which is an s-sp\({}^{2}\)\(\alpha\) bond formed from head-on overlap of the **1s** atomic orbital of H and the sp\({}^{2}\) hybrid orbital of C.

Figure 29c: Bonding in ethene, CH\({}_{2}\)=CH\({}_{2}\)

#### The bonding in ethyne, C\({}_{\text{H}}\) and sp hybridisation of carbon

Each carbon atom shares two electrons (one with each hydrogen atom, and one with the other carbon atom), forming two \(\sigma\) bonds. The remaining two electrons on each carbon atom occupies a 2p orbital each which overlaps side-on to form the two \(\pi\) bonds.

Mutual repulsion of the two groups of electrons around each carbon atom tends to place them as far apart as possible. Hence, the shape about each carbon atom is linear and the bond angles are \(\mathbf{180^{\circ}}\).

Both carbon atoms in ethyne, H-C=C-H, are sp hybridised. Mixing one s orbital and one p orbital gives two sp hybrid orbitals.

For each carbon, the two sp hybrid orbitals are arranged in a linear geometry as shown in Figure 30c(i).

Two p orbitals remain unhybridised, and these p orbitals are arranged perpendicular to the two sp hybrid orbitals as shown in Figure 30c(ii).

The C\({}_{\text{H}}\)C triple bond consists of one sp-sp \(\sigma\) bond formed by head-on overlap of two sp hybrid orbitals, and two p-p \(\pi\) bonds formed by side-on overlap of the unhybridised p orbitals.

Each C-H bond is an s-sp \(\sigma\) bond formed from head-on overlap of the 1s atomic orbital of H and the sp hybrid orbital of C.

### Polar covalent bonds

_10 2(0): explain and deduce bond polarity, using the concept of electronegativity [quantitative treatment of electronegativity is not required]_

In the hydrogen molecule, the bonding electrons are **equally shared** between the two hydrogen atoms as they have the **same electronegativity**. The H-H bond is a **non-polar** covalent bond. Other non-polar bonds include the _CI-CI_ bond and O=O bond.

When the covalent bond is formed by two different atoms, e.g. hydrogen atom and chlorine atom, the bonding electrons are **not shared equally** as the atoms have **different electronegativities**. The H-Cl bond is a **polar** covalent bond.

The _CI_ atom is more electronegative than the H atom. The bonding electrons will be found, on average, nearer to _CI_ than to H, resulting in a **partial charge separation** or **dipole**. _CI_ acquires a partial negative charge (**8**-) while H acquires a partial positive charge (**8**+). The 'cross-and-arrow' symbol can also be used to show the **dipole moment** or the direction in which the electrons are more strongly attracted.

### Ionic bonding with covalent character

In _ideal_ ionic bonding, there is _complete_ electron transfer. The nucleus of the cation and that of the anion only attracts its own electrons. The electron cloud of each ion is spherical (see Figure 35a).

However, in many cases, the cation tends to attract the electrons of the anion causing the electron cloud to be polarised or distorted, resulting in covalent character in the ionic bonding (see Figure 35b). The **degree of covalent character** depends on:

\(\bullet\)**polarising power of the cation**

**Cations** that are small and highly charge have high charge densities (see section 2.2) and **high polarising power**. These cations have a high tendency to distort the anion's electron cloud, resulting in **greater covalent character** in the ionic bonding.

**Anions** that are relatively **large** have **high polarisability**. Their valence electrons are further from and less strongly attracted by the nucleus so the electron cloud is easily distorted by a cation, resulting in **greater covalent character** in the ionic bonding.

The bonding in caesium fluoride is said to be predominantly ionic (with little covalent character). Cs\({}^{+}\) ion has a low charge density and low polarising power while F ion has a low polarisability. The electron cloud of F ion is only slightly polarised by Cs\({}^{+}\) ion.

The bonding in aluminium oxide is ionic with significant covalent character. A\({}^{B+}\) ion is highly polarising due to the high charge density so it is able to distort the electron cloud of the oxide anion. In Topic 21 Chemical Periodicity, we will look at how the covalent character in the ionic bond affects the properties of aluminium oxide. We will also look at how covalent character in ionic bond affects the magnitude of lattice energy in Topic 5 Chemical Energetics.

## 8 Polarity of molecules

10 2(q): deduce the polarity of a molecule using bond polarity and its molecular shape (analogous to those specified in (d))

In section 7.1, we said that when two bonded atoms have different electronegativities, the covalent bond is polar and has a dipole associated with it.

Depending on the **shape** of the molecule, the individual dipoles may or may not cancel each other completely. If the **overall dipole** or **net dipole** is **zero**, the molecule is **non-polar**. Figure 36 shows some examples of non-polar molecules.

Fl fluorine is more electronegativity than chlorine so the C-F bond is more polar than the C-Cl bond. The individual dipoles in CFCl\({}_{3}\) do not cancel each other so the net dipole is **not** zero.

# 9 Intermolecular forces of attractions

LO 2(h): describe the following forces of attraction (electrostatic in nature): (I) intermolecular forces, based on permanent and induced dipoles, as in CH4(I); Br(I) and the noble gases; (II) hydrogen bonding, using ammonia and water as examples of molecules containing -NH and -OH groups

There are three types of intermolecular forces (attractions between molecules):

instantaneous dipole-induced dipole attractions (also called dispersion forces)

permanent dipole-permanent dipole attractions

hydrogen bonding

These intermolecular forces are attractions between partial charges and are electrostatic in nature. They are generally weaker and require less thermal energy to overcome resulting in low melting points and low boiling points;

and dispersion forces

The molecule does NOT have a lone pair on N/O/F

and/or

does NOT have a H attached to N/O/F

\(\Rightarrow\) permanent dipole-permanent dipole interactions

and dispersion forces

### Instantaneous Dipole-Induced Dipole Attractions (Dispersion Forces)

Dispersion forces exist between all molecules or between noble gas atoms. Between non-polar molecules such as H\({}_{2}\) and CH\({}_{4}\) and between atoms of noble gases such as Ne and Ar, it is the only intermolecular forces of attraction.

The electrons in a molecule are constantly moving. **Fluctuations** (or distortions) **in electron distribution** can cause an **instantaneous dipole** in one molecule, which **induces** a dipole in a nearby molecule. An attraction arises between the two molecules. This'short-lived' and generally weak attraction is called **instantaneous dipole-induced dipole (id-id) attraction** or **dispersion forces** (see Figure 38).

#### 9.1.1 Strength of dispersion forces

The strength of dispersion forces depends on:

* **the number of electrons in the molecule** The larger the number of electrons, the **more polarisable** the electron cloud, the **stronger** the dispersion forces. For example, the dispersion forces between H2 molecules (two electrons) is much weaker than those between Br2 molecules (70 electrons).
* **the surface area of contact between adjacent molecules** The larger the surface area of contact, the more easily induced dipoles are formed, the **stronger** the dispersion forces. The surface area of contact between molecules depends on the overall **shape** of the molecules. Consider pentane and 2,2-dimethylpropane. These isomers (same molecular formula but different structural formula) have the same number of electrons. Pentane has an elongated shape and a larger surface area than 2,2-dimethylpropane which has a spherical shape. Hence, the dispersion forces between pentane molecules are stronger.

#### 9.3.1 Strength and extent of hydrogen bonding

\(\bullet\)**The electronegativity of the atom that H atom is bonded to affects the strength of the hydrogen bonding. For example, F is more electronegative than N. The \(\delta\)+ charge on H in HF is larger than that in NH**\({}_{3}\) **hence the hydrogen bonding between HF molecules is stronger.**

\(\bullet\)**The extent of hydrogen bonding depends on the number of H atom bonded to F, O or N and the number of lone pairs available.**

The hydrogen bonding in H**\({}_{2}\)**O is more extensive than that in HF or NH**\({}_{3}\)**: H**\({}_{2}\)**O has two lone pairs of electrons and two electron deficient hydrogen atoms. H**\({}_{2}\)**O can form on average two hydrogen bonds per molecule. On the other hand, NH**\({}_{3}\) **has only one lone pair (despite having three hydrogen atoms); HF has only one electron deficient hydrogen atom (despite having three lone pairs). NH**\({}_{3}\) **and HF can only form one hydrogen bond per molecule.**

The effect of strength and extent of hydrogen bonding on boiling points are discussed in section 9.3.2.

* **Considerably high boiling points of NH\({}_{3}\), H\({}_{2}\)O and HF** Figure 42 shows the boiling points of the hydrides (compound formed between hydrogen and another element).

CH\({}_{4}\), NH\({}_{3}\), H\({}_{2}\)O and HF have the same number of electrons (hence similar dispersion forces). However, the boiling points of NH\({}_{3}\), H\({}_{2}\)O and HF are considerably higher than that of CH\({}_{4}\). The **hydrogen bonding** in NH\({}_{3}\), H\({}_{2}\)O and HF are **stronger than** the **dispersion forces** in CH\({}_{4}\).

Similarly, the boiling points of NH\({}_{3}\), H\({}_{2}\)O and HF are also considerably higher than those of other hydrides in their respective groups (Groups 15, 16 and 17).

* **Boiling point: HF > NH\({}_{3}\)** (see Figure 42 and section 9.3.1)

F is **more electronegative** than N, the **electronegativity difference** between F and H is **larger** than that between N and H, hence the \(\delta\)+ charge on H in HF is **larger** than that in NH\({}_{3}\). **More** energy is needed to overcome the **stronger hydrogen bonding between HF molecules** than that between NH\({}_{3}\) molecules hence HF has a higher boiling point.

* **Boiling point: H\({}_{2}\)O > NH\({}_{3}\) and H\({}_{2}\)O > HF** (see Figure 42 and section 9.3.1)

H\({}_{2}\)O has two lone pairs of electrons and two electron deficient hydrogen atoms hence H\({}_{2}\)O can form on **average two hydrogen bonds per molecule**. On the other hand, NH\({}_{3}\) has only one lone pair while HF has only one electron deficient hydrogen atom, hence NH\({}_{3}\) and HF can only form **one hydrogen bond per molecule**. **More** energy is needed to overcome the **more extensive hydrogen bonding** in H\({}_{2}\)O than that in NH\({}_{3}\) and HF hence H\({}_{2}\)O has a higher boiling point.

## 10 Covalent lattices and physical properties

_10 2(m): describe, interpret and/or predict the effect of different types of structure and bonding on the physical properties of substances_

A lattice consists of particles that are arranged in a regular three-dimensional pattern. In sections 2 and 3, we described the metallic and ionic lattices respectively.

Covalent lattices can be giant molecular (as in graphite and diamond) or simple molecular (as in iodine and ice). We will describe and explain the physical properties of these substances in terms of their structure and bonding in the following sections.

### Simple Molecular (or Simple Covalent) lattices

_10 2(l) port: describe, in simple terms, the lattice structure of a crystalline solid which is: (l) simple molecular, as in iodine_

In simple molecular lattices, the particles are held by comparatively weak intermolecular forces (see section 9).

Figure 46 shows examples of simple atomic and simple molecular lattices.

Figure 46: Lattice structures of solid Ar, solid HCl and solid \(L\)

#### Physical properties of substances with simple molecular lattices

Physical properties of simple molecular substances depends on the strength of the **intermolecular forces**. In general, substances with simple molecular lattice structures have **low melting points and low boiling points** as the **weak intermolecular forces between molecules** require **little thermal energy** to overcome. For example, boiling water breaks the weak hydrogen bonding holding the molecules together. The strong covalent bonds holding the hydrogen and oxygen atoms together are not broken; the H\({}_{2}\)O molecules remain intact!

Many simple molecular compounds are soluble in **organic solvents** like propanone (CH\({}_{3}\)COCH\({}_{3}\)), tetrachloromethane (CC\({}_{4}\)) and benzene (C\({}_{6}\)H\({}_{6}\)). Some (e.g. ethanol, ethanolic acid, glucose) are soluble in water due to their ability to form hydrogen bonds with water. See section 12 for more discussions on solubility.

Simple molecular substances are **unable to conduct electricity** as there are no mobile charge carriers. However, some simple covalent substances are able to react with water to give aqueous ions. This allows the resulting solution to conduct electricity, for example: HC(g) + H\({}_{2}\)O(\(l\)) \(\to\)\(C\)(aq) + H\({}_{3}\)O'(aq).

**Exercise 10.1 (Worked Example)**

Explain in terms of structure and bonding the following:

**(a) Argon has a lower boiling point than hydrogen chloride.**

**Answer:**

Argon has a **simple atomic structure** while hydrogen chloride has a **simple molecular structure**.

**Stronger permanent dipole-permanent dipole attractions**

(and dispersion forces) exist between polar HCI molecules**.

Less energy is needed to overcome the **weaker dispersion forces** between argon atoms**\({}^{*}\) **so it has a lower boiling point.**

**Answer:**

Both hydrogen iodide and hydrogen bromide are **polar simple covalent molecules**.

Permanent dipole-permanent dipole attractions and dispersion forces exist between the molecules.

HI molecules have **more electrons** so **more** energy is needed to overcome the **stronger** dispersion forces between the molecules. Hence, HI has a higher boiling point than HBr.

**Strategy:**

_State the structures_

_Identify the type of attractions broken during boiling; keywords "between HCI molecules", "between Ar atoms"_

_Compare the strength of relevant attractions (pd-pd vs dispersion forces; HCI &Ar have comparable dispersion forces due to the same no. of electrons) & energy needed_

**Answer:**

Both hydrogen iodide and hydrogen bromide are **polar simple covalent molecules**.

Permanent dipole-permanent dipole attractions and dispersion forces exist between the molecules.

HI molecules have **more** electrons so **more** energy is needed to overcome the **stronger** dispersion forces between the molecules. Hence, HI has a higher boiling point than HBr.

**Strategy:**

_State the structures_

_Identify the type of attractions broken during boiling; keywords "between molecules" or "intermolecular"_

_Compare the strength of relevant attractions (in this case dispersion forces; pd-pd attraction is "irrelevant" as H-Br bond is more polar than H-I bond so pd-pd between HBr molecules is stronger which would result in a higher, rather than a lower, boiling point for HBr) & energy needed._

### Giant Molecular (or Giant Covalent) Lattices

_10 2(1) part: describe, in simple terms, the lattice structure of a crystalline solid which is: (ii) giant molecular, as in graphite; diamond_

Giant molecular lattices consist of three-dimensional arrays of atoms, held together by strong covalent bonds. Figure 47 shows examples of giant molecular lattices.

In **diamond** (figure 47a), each (sp\({}^{3}\)) hybridised C atom is covalently bonded to four other C atoms, in a tetrahedral arrangement.

In **silicon(IV) oxide (also known as quartz)**, each Si atom is covalently bonded to four O atoms, and each O atom is bonded to two Si atoms. The formula SiO\({}_{2}\) is an empirical formula. (Refer to figure 47b)

Diamond and graphite are allotropes of carbon - different forms of carbon, in which the atoms are arranged in different ways.

In **graphite**, each (sp\({}^{2}\) hybridised) C atom is covalently bonded to three other C atoms, forming a two-dimensional layer of hexagonal carbon rings. Each C atom in graphite has a 2p orbital containing one electron (not used in forming the C-C \(\sigma\) bonds). Within each layer, the 2p orbitals side-on overlap with each other to form a **delocalised \(\pi\) bonding system** (similar to the delocalisation of \(\pi\) electrons in benzene, refer to Topic 12 Arenesi). Between the layers of carbon atoms, there is (significant) **dispersion forces** due to the large surface area. (Refer to figure 48)

## 11 Physical periodicity

_10 5(c) part: interpret the variation in melting point across a Period in terms of structure and bonding in the elements (metallic, giant molecular, or simple molecular)_

Figure 49 shows the variation in melting point for the period 3 elements, sodium to argon.

Figure 49: Variation in m.p. for period 3 elements

Naj, Mg and Al have giant metallic structures and relatively high melting points due to the **strong metallic bonding between cations and the sea of delocalised valence electrons**.

From Na to Al, melting point increases as **more** energy is needed to overcome the **stronger** metallic bonding due to

the increase in **number of valence electrons contributed per atom

and the increase in charge density of the cation (due to increasing charge and decreasing ionic radius/cátionic size).

**No. of valence e contributed per atom**

**Charge of cation**

**Incl radius of cation / nm**

0.095

0.065

0.050

Si has a **giant** molecular structure and a very high melting point as a lot of energy is needed to overcome the many strong covalent bonds between the Si atoms during melting.

Non-polar P4, S4, and Cl2 have simple molecular structures. Ar has simple atomic structure. Little energy is needed to overcome the **weak** dispersion forces between the molecules or between argon **atoms** hence the low melting points.

The **number of electrons* and hence **strength of dispersion forces** decreases from S4 to P4 to Cl2 to Ar. Hence, **energy** needed to overcome the dispersion forces during melting and the resulting melting point decreases in the same order.

*from _Data Booklet_, no. of electrons in S4 (128) >P4 (60) > Cl2 (34) > Ar (18)

### Solubility of substances in water

Water molecules are held together by hydrogen bonding. Depending on the solute, the interactions formed by water and a solute include:

* **hydrogen bonding** with polar molecules such as ethanol (CH3CH2OH), propanone (CH3COCH3)
* **permanent dipole-induced dipole interactions** with non-polar molecules such as iodine, hexane (CH3(CH2)4CH3)
* **ion-dipole attractions** with cations or anions (from ionic solids)

**Example 1: Ethanol dissolves in water**

The energy released when forming hydrogen bonds between ethanol and water molecules is comparable to the energy needed to overcome the existing hydrogen bonding between ethanol molecules and the existing hydrogen bonding between water molecules.

The energy released when forming weak permanent dipole-induced dipole interactions between polar water and non-polar hexane molecules is insufficient to overcome the dispersion forces between hexane molecules and the stronger hydrogen bonding between water molecules.

**Example 3: Sodium chloride, NaCl, dissolves in water**

Sodium chloride is an ionic compound. Both Na+ and _CI_- ions are able to form ion-dipole attractions with water molecules. The ion-dipole attractions are relatively strong and very extensive. The energy released when forming **ion-dipole interactions** between Na+ and H2O and between _CI_- and H2O is comparable to the energy required to overcome the **hydrogen bonding** between water molecules and **ionic bonding** between Na+ and _CI_- ions in Na_CI_.

Figure 53: Diagrams to illustrate ion-dipole interactionsThe energy released from ion-dipole interactions depends on the charge densities of the ions (see Topic 5 _Chemical Energetics_). Ions with lower charge densities (e.g., Ag\({}^{*}\), Cf) form weaker ion-dipole interactions so less energy is released. This explains why some ionic compounds e.g. silver chloride are insoluble in water.

**Exercise 12.2 (Worked Example)**

Propanone (CH\({}_{3}\)COCH\({}_{3}\)) and water are miscible. Explain this with a suitable diagram to show the interactions formed between propanone and water.

Some of the earliest scientific investigations concerning matter were performed by scientists trying to understand the physical and chemical properties of gases. It was these studies (~1650-1800 AD) that helped establish chemistry as a scientific discipline. The experiments of scientists such as Robert Boyle (1627 - 1691), Jacques Charles (1746-1823), and Gay-Lussac (1778-1850) led to our understanding of laws that govern the macroscopic properties of gases and we will learn these gas laws in _Section 3_.

Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac was a French chemist who studied how different volumes of gases combined during chemical reactions to make products. He determined that when different gases reacted, they would always do so in small whole number ratios (e.g., two volumes of hydrogen would react with one volume of oxygen in forming water) - the "Law of Combining Volumes of Gases". This was one of the greatest advancements of its time and helped form the basis for later atomic theory and how chemical reactions occur.

Amodeo Avogadro, an Italian physics professor, hypothesised the **Avogadro's Law** to explain Gay-Lussac's data.

**Avogadro's Law**: Equal volumes of all gases, under the same temperature and pressure, contain the same number of particles (atoms or molecules).

_LO 6(b): define the term mole in terms of Avogadro's constant_

One _mole_ contains exactly \(6.02\times 10^{23}\)(or Avogadro constant, L) elementary entities. (notation: \(\eta\), unit: **mol**)

_LO 6(a): define the terms relative atomic, isotopic, molecular and formula mass_

_Average_ mass of one molecule of a substance

**Relative molecular mass, \(M_{r}\):**\(\frac{1}{12}\) x the mass of one atom of \({}^{12}\)C

**Note**:

* Due to the presence of isotopes, the word "_average_" is necessary in definition of \(M_{r}\)
* \(M_{r}\)= sum of \(A_{r}\) of all the atoms in the molecular formula
* \(M_{r}\) has no units as it is a ratio of two masses

However, you will need to define the important terms used in mole concept (those given in boxes above). The use of these terms in calculation will be covered in _Topic 4: "Reactions and Stoichiometry"_.

# The Simple Gas Laws and Ideal Gas Law

Because most gases are difficult to observe directly, they are described through the use of four macroscopic properties.

Pressure (P)

Volume (V)

Temperature (T)

Number of moles of gas (n)

Simple gas laws are formulated to describe the relationship between pairs of the properties and hold to good approximations for all gases.

#### Simple Gas Laws

The simple gas laws describe the relationships between pairs of the above variables, when the other two variables are held constant.

In the early1660s, the English scientist Robert Boyle found that at constant temperature, the volume of a fixed mass of gas (i.e. for n is constant) is _inversely proportional_ to its pressure. The mathematical and graphical relationships of Boyle's Law are given below:

\begin{tabular}{c} Mathematical relationship \\ For n is constant and T is constant, \\ \end{tabular}

Later, in 1787, the French physicist Jacques Charles found that at constant pressure, the volume of a fixed mass of gas is _directly proportional_ to its absolute temperature (measured in K). The mathematical and graphical relationships of Charles' Law are given below:

\begin{tabular}{c} Mathematical relationship \\ For n is constant and P is \\ constant, \\ \end{tabular}

### Graphical Relationships for Ideal Gases

The graphical relationships for simple gas laws are introduced in _section 2.1_. In this section, we will attempt to predict the graphical relationship between other variables, based on manipulation of the ideal gas equation PV = nRT. Figure out which of the four variables are constants, and rearrange this equation in the form \(y=mx+c\).

Figure 11: Graphical relationships for simple gas laws are introduced in _section 2.1_. In this section, we will attempt to predict the graphical relationship between other variables, based on manipulation of the ideal gas equation PV = nRT. Figure out which of the four variables are constants, and rearrange this equation in the form \(y=mx+c\).

#### Interpreting graphs

Each of the following graphs represents plots for an ideal gas at two different conditions. In each case, you should be able to identify the variable with the higher value by using either of the following two strategies:

1. Consider for a given value of a variable (taken to be the x-axis variable for consistency) by drawing a vertical line. Then compare how the other variable would change under the two different conditions given by looking at where the line you've drawn cuts the graphs.
2. (This works best for straight line graphs) Rearrange PV = nRT to fit the variable given by the y- and x-axes. Check how the changing variable affects the steepness of the gradient. Which temperature is higher, T\({}_{1}\) or T\({}_{2}\)? Rearrange PV = nRT and make P the subject of the equation, we will get P = (nRT)(1/V). Therefore, plotting P against 1/V will give us a straight line that passes through the origin with gradient = nRT.: Since the graph with T\({}_{2}\) is a steeper line than that of T\({}_{1}\), that means nRT\({}_{2}\) > nRT. This is only possible if T\({}_{2}\) > T\({}_{1}\). Hence T\({}_{2}\) has a higher temperature than T\({}_{1}\).

## 3 GAS MIxtures and partial pressures

_10 3(d) use Dalton's law to determine the partial pressures of gases in a mixture_

If a mixture of non-reacting gases is confined in a container, each gas occupies the volume (V) of the container and exerts its own pressure (P) on the walls of the container as if it alone were present. This observation is known as **Dalton's law of partial pressures**, and the pressure exerted by a particular gas in a mixture is referred to as its **partial pressure**.

If we let \(P_{total}\) be the total pressure of a gas mixture, we can write Dalton's law of partial pressures as:

\(P_{total}=P_{a}+P_{b}+P_{c}+\cdots\)

where \(P_{a}\), \(P_{b}\), \(P_{c}\) are the partial pressures of the individual gases \(\alpha\), \(\overline{b}\), \(c\)... respectively.

Since T and V are constant, the partial pressure of each component is directly dependent on (and proportional to) the amount of each gas in the mixture. So, for gases \(a\), \(b\), \(c\), \(etc\)...

Combining these into the expression for \(P_{total}\), we get:

\(P_{total}=P_{a}\left(\frac{RT}{V}\right)+P_{b}\left(\frac{RT}{V}\right)+\pi_{ c}\left(\frac{RT}{V}\right)+\cdots\)

\(P_{a}=P_{total}\left(\frac{RT}{V}\right)\)

Dividing the expression for \(P_{a}\) by that for \(P_{total}\), and rearranging:

\(P_{a}=P_{total}\left(\frac{RT}{V}\right)\)

where \(P_{a}\) is called the mole fraction, sometimes represented by the Greek letter \(chi\), \(\chi\), or:

Thus, in a gas mixture, the **partial pressure of any individual gas is directly proportional to its mole fraction** in the mixture.

# Assumptions about ideal gases

10 3(a): state the basic assumptions of the kinetic theory as applied to an ideal gas

The kinetic theory of gases is a model used to describe the microscopic behaviour of gas particles and their interactions. This theory was developed in reference to ideal gases (refer to _section 2.2_), though it can be applied reasonably well to real gases. The following assumptions are about ideal gases:

1. The size of the gas particles is so small compared to the space between them that we can assume that the particles themselves have negligible volume. In other words, **the gas particles have negligible volume compared to the volume of the container**.
2. The intermolecular forces of attraction between gas particles are negligible.
3. **Collisions between gas particles, and their collisions with the walls of the container, are perfectly elastic; i.e. there is no net loss or gain of kinetic energy during collision.**

**Examin tip**

In the A-level examinations, you may be asked to recall the assumptions of the Kinetic Molecular Theory as applied to ideal gases. Assumptions 1 and 2 are the most important ones, particularly for the discussion on how real gases deviate from ideal behaviour.

If you are required to state more than 2 assumptions, assumption 3 can be included.

### Conditions for real gases to behave ideally

_LO 3(b)(ii): explain qualitatively in terms of intermolecular forces and molecular size: the conditions necessary for a gas to approach ideal behaviour_

* At **low pressures**, the gaseous molecules are relatively far apart. The volume of the molecules themselves is negligible compared to the volume of the container. Thus, real gas molecules at low pressure can be approximated to have negligible volume. Also, intermolecular forces are negligible as the particles are far apart. Hence their behaviour at low pressures would approach that of ideal gases.
* At **high temperatures**, gas particles have enough kinetic energy to overcome intermolecular forces; which can thus be considered insignificant. As such, the behavior of real gases approach ideal gas behavior at high temperatures.

## 5 REAL GASES AND DEVIATION FROM IDEAL BEHAVOUR

_LO 3(b)(ii): expulin qualitatively in terms of intermolecular forces and molecular size: the limitations of ideality at very high pressures and very low temperatures_

Based on the reasons given in Section 4.1, real gases would therefore deviate from ideal behaviour at high pressures and low temperatures.

Under these conditions, the following two assumptions about ideal gases are no longer valid, namely:

1. The gas particles have negligible volume compared to the volume of the container; and
2. The intermolecular forces of attraction between gas particles are negligible.

Figure 4 shows a plot of PV/RT against pressure for some real gases compared with that of an ideal gas. For 1 mol of an ideal gas, the ratio PV/RT is equal to 1 at any pressure. In general, deviations from ideal behaviour become greater at higher pressures.

Figure 4 also shows how different gases deviate differently from ideal behaviour. Molecules with stronger intermolecular forces will violate assumption 2 and show greater deviation. For example, CO\({}_{2}\) has a larger electron cloud and hence stronger dispersion forces than N\({}_{2}\), hence CO\({}_{2}\) deviates more from ideal behaviour.

For molecules with similar electron cloud size, e.g. NH\({}_{3}\) (\(M_{r}=17.0\)) versus CH\({}_{4}\) (\(M_{r}=16.0\)), other intermolecular forces besides dispersion forces need to be considered. NH\({}_{3}\), with stronger hydrogen bonding, should deviate more from ideal behaviour than CH\({}_{4}\), with only intermolecular dispersion forces.

Figure 4: Effect of pressure on the behaviour of several real gases at 300 KFigure 5 shows how one mol of nitrogen behaves as a result of changing the temperature. The deviation is greatest at low temperatures.

Figure 5: effect of temperature on the behaviour of nitrogen gas

### Explaining deviations at high pressures

The gas particles can no longer be considered to have negligible volume compared to the volume of the container.

At high pressures, the volume of the container decreases. The molecules are pushed closely together and take up a significant portion of the container volume, resulting in less space in which the molecules can move. Thus, it is no longer valid to assume that its volume is negligible compared to the container volume, and so the gas deviates from ideal behaviour. (In fact, the total volume occupied by a real gas is actually greater than the volume predicted by the ideal gas equation.)

Also, since the gas particles are close together, they tend to interact with one another, hence intermolecular attractions are not negligible.

### Explaining deviations at low temperatures

The intermolecular forces between gas particles become significant.

As temperature is lowered, the kinetic energy of the gas particles decreases, causing them to move more slowly and intermolecular forces to become more significant. This also causes collisions to become inelastic (such that assumption 3 is no longer valid either). Eventually, it reaches a point where the particles can no longer overcome the intermolecular forces, at which point real gases liquefy (condense to form a liquid) when cooled to below its boiling point.

## 6 Distribution of molecular speeds

The **average kinetic energy** of the gas particles is **directly proportional** to the **absolute temperature**. So at a particular temperature, all types of gaseous particles have the same average kinetic energy.

Although collectively the molecules in a gas sample have the **same _average kinetic energy_**, the individual molecules are moving at **different speeds**. There exists a distribution of speeds among the particles in a sample of gas. At a given temperature, heavier gases travel slower while lighter gases travel faster (recall: KE = \(\gamma\)mv\({}^{2}\)), Figure 8 shows how the speed distribution varies with the molar mass of the gas for different gas samples at the same temperature.

For a gas sample at **different temperatures** as shown in Figure 9, the speed distribution of the molecules shifts toward higher speeds and becomes less sharply peaked as the temperature of the gas sample is increased. Even at low temperatures, a small number of molecules have high speed and kinetic energy. This number of molecules increases with temperature; while the number of molecules with low speed and kinetic energy becomes smaller but does not vanish.

The above speed distributions are referred to as **Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution curves**, or simply, the **Boltzmann distribution curve**.

Figure 8: Variation of speed distribution with molar mass at a given \(T\)

Figure 9: Variation of speed distribution with \(T\) for a given gas sampleNote the following about Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution curves:

**1**: _The examples above use speed on the horizontal axis. However, since kinetic energy of a molecule is proportional to the square of its speed, the graph would have the same shape if kinetic energy were used on the x-axis instead.
**2**: Common labels for the vertical axis include number of (gas) particles (or molecules), proportion of particles, or fraction of particles.
**3**: _The area under the curve generally represents the total number of particles in the sample. So for a fixed amount of sample at different temperatures, the area should remain the same even as the curve shifts.
**4**: _The peak of each curve represents the most probable speed (or most probable kinetic energy, depending on the x-axis label). As the temperature increases, the peak decreases in height and shifts to the right as the distribution of molecular speeds becomes more spread out.
**5**: _All curves start at the origin (0,0) because in a gas sample there are no particles with zero speed (or zero kinetic energy). In other words, all gas particles must be moving. [The only exception is at 0 K, absolute zero, which is the theoretical lowest possible temperature, one at which all particles have zero kinetic energy and particle motion stops.]
**6**: _The curves do not show a maximum speed (or kinetic energy) value and run asymptotically along the x-axis - i.e. the curves do not intersect the x-axis again as there is theoretically no limit to the amount of speed (or energy) a particle can have._

**Looking ahead**: _In this topic, you have learnt to describe the behaviour of a gas in macroscopic terms of pressure, volume, temperature and number of moles (ideal gas equation). This will set the foundation for your learning in subsequent topics so keep in mind the following questions:_

**1**: _How to calculate partial pressures of gaseous species in reactions? (This will be especially useful for Topic 7 Chemical Equilibria)_

The other reactant is added directly into the flask. _Care must be taken to ensure the two reactant do not come into contact at this stage_. To start the reaction, the flask is shaken/swirled to mix the two reactants. Gas produced is collected without loss.

The liquid reactant (e.g. aqueous acid) is placed into the dropping funnel with the tap closed. The other reactant (e.g. Na\({}_{2}\)CO\({}_{3}\) solid) is placed into the reaction flask. To start the reaction, the tap is opened to release the liquid reactant and closed when the desired volume of liquid is added. Gas produced is collected without loss.

###### Abstract

The data of the _HWA_ and _HWA_ are presented in the following sections.

1. Using an electronic balance, we show that the _HWA_ and _HWA_ are not affected by the _HWA_ and _HWA_. We show that the _HWA_ and _HWA_ are affected by the _HWA_ and _HWA_ are affected by the _HWA_ and _HWA_.
2. Set up the apparatus as shown in the diagram (8).
3. Fill a 50.0 cm\({}^{3}\) graduated dropping funnel with (aqueous reactant).
4. Record the initial reading, \(x\) cm\({}^{3}\), on the (measuring cylinder/burettle).
5. Take note of the initial reading on the graduated dropping funnel. Open the tap of the dropping funnel to add the (aqueous reactant) to the solid, When (volume) of (aqueous reactant) has been added, close the tap. Swift the flask to thoroughly mix the reactants. (Note: There will be a corresponding volume of air displaced by the added liquid)
6. When bubbling through the (measuring cylinder/burettle) has stopped, record the final reading, \(y\) cm\({}^{3}\), on the (measuring cylinder/burettle). The volume of gas collected is (\(y-x-\mathrm{V}_{displaced}\)) cm\({}^{3}\).

Note:

It may sometimes be necessary to allow the set-up to equilibrate to room conditions, for example, if the reaction is highly exothermic. However, in a kinetics experiment where the volume of gas needs to be read at appropriate time intervals, it would not be possible to allow the set-up to equilibrate to room conditions (Refer to planning section in Topic & Reaction Kinetics.)

If the reaction produces effervescence, it is possible to tell the reaction has stopped when no more effervescence is observed.

# Planning for an experiment that involves heating or drying to constant mass (gravimetry)

###### Abstract

_Gravimetry (or gravimetric analysis)_ refers to the quantitative determination of an analyte (i.e. the substance being analysed) based on the mass of a solid.

It may involve heating hydrated salts (e.g. Na\({}_{2}\)CO\({}_{3}\)-10H\({}_{2}\)O), or heating to decompose a solid (e.g. MgO\({}_{3}\)) or mixing two solutions to form a precipitate (e.g: BaSO\({}_{4}\) or AgCl), followed by filtering, drying, and weighing of the precipitate.

_Generic Procedure for Heating to Constant Mass_

Using an electronic balance, **weigh** accurately _(mass)_ g of _(solid)_ in a dry empty **crucible** (or boiling tube). Record mass of empty crucible, mass of crucible and solid, and mass of solid collected.

1. **Heat** the crucible and its contents gently first for 1 min then strongly for about 5 min.

2. **Allow the crucible and its contents to **cool** on a wire gauze.

3. **Re-weigh** the crucible with its contents.

4. **Repeat heating, cooling and re-weighing until there is no further change in mass.**

Heating to constant mass ensures that the solid is **completely** decomposed (or in the case of heating hydrated salts, water of crystallization has been **completely** driven off). The mass lost (or mass of residue) can then be used for stoichiometric calculations.

_Why must the crucible (or boiling tube) be **dry?**_

_Any water present will contribute to the mass lost determined, leading to inaccurate calculations._

_Why do we need to allow the crucible and contents to **cool** after every heating?_

_This is to prevent fluctuations of the mass readings on the electronic balance. Hot objects generate convection currents in the air that causes the readings to fluctuate._

## Looking Back

Chemistry is about the study of matter, its interactions and transformations. In the previous three topics, we have learnt about matter in the submicroscopic level: the atom and its electronic structure. Atoms interact and give rise to different types of bonding. We observe these interactions in our daily life at a macroscopic level, via the physical properties of elements, compounds and gases: In Topic 3 The Gaseous State, we have also learnt the concept of the mole. We shall now look at chemical transformations i.e. reactions, which involve the reorganisation or transfer of valence electrons among the reactants. In all reactions, matter and energy must be conserved. In this topic, we will apply the mole concept and key ideas of conservation of matter in the quantitative treatment of reactions - stoichiometry.

_LO 6(a): define the terms relative atomic, isotopic, molecular and formula mass_

### 1 Relative Masses of Compounds

In Topic 1 Atomic Structure, we learnt the definition of the relative mass of an atom and isotope.

The definitions may be extended to relative masses of molecules and ionic compounds as follows:

### Empirical and Molecular Formulae

#### 1.3.1 Definitions

_The empirical formula of a compound is the simplest formula which shows the ratio of the atoms of the different elements in the compound._

_The molecular formula of a compound is the formula which shows the actual number of atoms of each element in one molecule of the compound._

For example,

**Exercise 1.4** (Worked example):

**1.**: Caproic acid (\(M_{\text{r}}\equiv 116\)) occurs in goat's milk and has the following composition biomass: C, 62.1%; H, 10.3%; O, 27.6%. Determine the empirical formula and molecular formula of caproic acid.

**Exercise 1.4** (Worked example):

**1.**: Caproic acid (\(M_{\text{r}}\equiv 116\)) occurs in goat's milk and has the following composition biomass: C, 62.1%; H, 10.3%; O, 27.6%. Determine the empirical formula and molecular formula of caproic acid.

**1.**: Empirical formula of caproic acid is C\({}_{\text{r}}\)H\({}_{\text{o}}\)O;

**1.**: Let molecular formula of caproic acid be (C\({}_{\text{r}}\)H\({}_{\text{o}}\)O)\({}_{\text{n}}\).

**1.**: In 116 / 58 = 2

**2.**: A 0.4764 g sample of an oxide of iron was completely reduced by a stream of carbon monoxide to produce 0.3450 g of pure iron as the only iron-containing product. Find the empirical formula of the oxide.

_Thinking process: Since iron was the only iron-containing product formed, the mass of iron present in the oxide must have been 0.3450 g. The mass of oxygen present in the oxide can hence be found._

**Exercise 1.5**

**1.** The formula of a complex salt **Z** is NH4[Cr(SCN)](NHH),[] and analysis produced the following composition by mass: Cr, 15.5%; S, 38.1%; N, 29.2%. Calculate the values of x and y in the formula for **Z**.

**2.** On strong heating, 100 g of CaSO,[]NHHO is dehydrated and a constant mass of 79.09 g of anhydrous salt is obtained. Calculate n.

**2.**

#### 1.3.3 Derivation of Formulae using Combustion Data

_LO 6(e) : calculate empirical and molecular formulae using combustion data or composition by moss_

Organic compounds, on complete combustion with oxygen, form CO\({}_{2}\) and H\({}_{2}\)O. By measuring and calculating the amount of the reactants used (i.e. the compound and oxygen) and products formed (CO\({}_{2}\) and H\({}_{2}\)O) in a combustion experiment, the empirical and molecular formula of the organic compound can be obtained.

**Exercise 1.6 (Worked example)**

Complete combustion of a hydrocarbon (a compound that contains hydrogen and carbon only) gave 0.352 g of carbon dioxide and 0.072 g of water. Calculate the empirical formula and its molecular formula, given that it has a molar mass of 104 g mol\({}^{-1}\).

_(Thinking process: Since the reactants of this reaction are the hydrocarbon and oxygen only, the carbon present in CO\({}_{2}\) and the hydrogen present in H\({}_{2}\)O must have come from the hydrocarbon. Hence, the mass of carbon present in the hydrocarbon is equal to the mass of carbon present in CO\({}_{2}\), while the mass of hydrogen atoms present in the hydrocarbon is equal to the mass of hydrogen atoms present in H\({}_{2}\)O. This is an application of law of Conservation of Matter - Refer to Section 2.1._

**Exercise 1.7**

X is an organic iron compound containing only Fe, C and H: When a 0.944 g sample of Fe was subjected to complete combustion, 2.23 g of CO\({}_{2}\) and 0.457 g of H\({}_{2}\)O were formed.

What is the empirical formula of X?

## 2 Reactions and stoichiometry

Stoichiometry refers to the study of the quantitative aspects of chemical formulae and reactions. It involves both the determination of chemical formulae as well as calculations using balanced chemical equations based on the central idea of the mole.

### Law of Conservation of Matter (Background info)

A chemical equation represents what happens during a chemical reaction. The law of conservation of matter is the fundamental principle governing the balancing of chemical equations.

When balancing chemical equations, we have to ensure that every atom of every element is accounted for since they are not destroyed or created, but rearranged. There must be the same number of atoms of each element on the right-hand side as there are on the left-hand side.

**Exercise 2.1**

Write balanced chemical equations for the following reactions.

**1.** lead + silver nitrate + lead nitrate + silver (Worked example)

**2.** iron(II) chloride + chlorine - iron(III) chloride

Similarly, when substances chemically react to form products, the sum of the masses of all the products is always found to be equal to the sum of the masses of the reactants.

**E

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:125]

## Law of Conservation of Mass (Background info)

The Law of Conservation of Mass can be shown by the following experiment:

The following set-up is first done with lead(II), nitrate solution in the test tube and potassium iodide solution in the conical flask. The entire apparatus is then weighed.

When the conical flask is shaken to mix the contents, a precipitation reaction occurs (Refer to Section 2.2) forming yellow solid lead(II) iodide. On re-weighing the conical flask with its content, the mass should be the same as its initial mass.

### Limiting Reactants and Percentage Yield (Background info)

A balanced equation shows the **mode ratios** in which reactants react to give products, and the mole ratios in which the products are formed. It indicates that fixed proportions of reactants will react to give fixed proportions of products. It does _not_, however, represent the actual amount or proportion in which the reactants are present in a mixture. Hence, you should first determine whether there is a reactant in excess.

For example,

The mole ratio (1 : % 1), as shown by the **stoichiometric coefficients** in the balanced equation, tells us that 1 mole of H2 must react with % mole of O2 to give 1 mole of H2O.

If 1 mole of H2 is mixed with 1 mole of O2 then % mole of O2 must remain unreacted at the end of complete reaction. Reactants present **in excess** are not all consumed at the end of complete reaction. H2, on the other hand, is the limiting reactant. **Limiting reactants** are completely consumed in the reaction and limits how much products can form.

Many reactions do not, however, go to completion and there may also be a loss of product in practice (e.g. after purification or separation). Hence, the **actual yield** is usually less than 100% of the **theoretical yield** that is calculated based on the limiting reactant.

Figure 1: Experiment set-up to illustrate the Low of Conservation of Mass

### Types of Reactions (Background info)

In Chemistry, there are several different types of chemical reactions and more than one way of classifying them. From this section onwards, we will classify the reactions into the following reaction types:

(a) Precipitation reaction (b) Precipitation reactions are reactions which involve the formation of an insoluble solute which is known as a precipitate, from the reaction of two solutions. The precipitate and the supernatant liquid can be separated by filtration or decanting. In calculations involving precipitation reaction, the mass of the solid will be obtained to find out the number of moles of the solid product formed.

(c) Acid-base reaction - Refer to Section 3(d) Redox reactions - Refer to Section 4(e)

Most of the reactions you learn at A-level fall into one or more categories. Remember that no classification is perfect and so it would be highly possible to find some reactions that do not entirely into any category.

In the following sections, we will see calculations involving the use of:

(i) reacting masses (from formulae and equations)

(ii) volumes of gases (e.g. in the burning of hydrocarbons)

(iii) volumes and concentrations of solutions

However, it would be a good practice to try to identify the type of reactions taking place in each of the exercises given.

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:128]

**Exercise 2.4**

When 18.5 g of methane and 43.0 g of chlorine gas undergo a substitution reaction that has an 80.0% yield, what mass of chloromethane (CH\({}_{3}\)Cl) is obtained (the other product is HC)?

### Calculation using Volumes of Gases

_LO 6(g)port: perform calculations, including use of the mole concept, involving: (v) volumes of gases (e.g. in the burning of hydrocarbons)_

In Topic 3 The Gaseous State, we learnt about the Avogadro's Law.

**Avogadro's Law:**_Equal volumes of all gases, under the same temperature and pressure, contain the same number of particles (atoms or molecules)._

Hence, for gases in a balanced equation, _volume ratio = mole ratio_

For example, for a given equation: 2CO(g) + O\({}_{2}\)(g) \(\rightarrow\) 2CO\({}_{2}\)(g)

The balanced equation tells us that **20 cm\({}^{3}\)** of carbon monoxide will react with **10 cm\({}^{3}\)** of oxygen to give **20 cm\({}^{3}\)** of carbon dioxide.

Note that the ratio of volumes 20 cm\({}^{3}\): 10 cm\({}^{3}\): 20 cm\({}^{3}\) is the same as the mole ratio 2:1.2 indicated by the stoichiometric coefficients in the balanced equation.

The _molar volume_, _V\({}_{m}\)_ of any gas is the volume occupied by _1 mole_ of the gas at a specified temperature and pressure. Thus,

where \(n\) is the amount (in moles) of the gas

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:130]

**Exercise 2.6**

**1.**: In an experiment, 20 cm\({}^{3}\) of a gaseous organic compound was sparked with excess oxygen. 80 cm\({}^{3}\) of carbon dioxide and 80 cm\({}^{3}\) of water vapour were obtained. All gases are measured at the same temperature and pressure. Which of the following molecular formula fit the data?
**1**: CH\({}_{3}\)CH\({}_{2}\)CH\({}_{3}\)
**2**: CH\({}_{3}\)CH\({}_{2}\)CH\({}_{2}\)CHO
**3**: CH\({}_{3}\)CH\({}_{2}\)CH\({}_{2}\)CH\({}_{3}\)
**2**: What volume of oxygen is required for the complete combustion of a mixture containing 5 cm\({}^{3}\) of methane and 10 cm\({}^{3}\) of ethene?
**3**: When 20 cm\({}^{3}\) of a gaseous hydrocarbon **Y** was exploded with 150 cm\({}^{3}\) of oxygen, the residual gases occupied 130 cm\({}^{3}\). After shaking the products with excess aqueous sodium hydroxide, the final volume was 90 cm\({}^{3}\). Deduce the molecular formula of **Y**. (All volumes were measured at room conditions.)
**4**: 20 cm\({}^{3}\) of a gaseous hydrocarbon was mixed with 150 cm\({}^{3}\) of oxygen so that the hydrocarbon was completely burnt. The volume of gas remaining at the end of combustion was 100 cm\({}^{3}\). After passing over potassium hydroxide, this volume was reduced to 20 cm\({}^{3}\). All gases were measured at 20 \({}^{\circ}\)C and the same pressure. What is the formula of the hydrocarbon?

### Calculations using Concentrations

_10 6(a)part: perform calculations, including use of the mole concept, involving: (vi) volumes and concentrations of solutions_

When a solute is dissolved in a solvent, a **solution** is formed.

If the solvent is water, an aqueous solution is formed.

The **concentration** of a solution shows the amount of solute dissolved in a given volume of solution.

Notation for concentration of solute X in a solution in terms of mol dm\({}^{-3}\): [ X ]

A **standard solution** is a solution whose concentration is accurately known.

**Note: 1 dm\({}^{3}\) = 1000 cm\({}^{3}\) = 10\({}^{-3}\) m\({}^{3}\) ; 1 cm\({}^{3}\) = 10\({}^{-3}\) dm\({}^{3}\) = 10\({}^{-6}\) m\({}^{3}\)**

**Dilution**

When a solution is diluted (by adding more solvent), the concentration of the solution decreases but the _number of moles of the solute in the diluted solution remains unchanged_.

**Exercise 2.7 (Worked example)**

14.3 g of hydrated sodium carbonate, Na\({}_{2}\)CO\({}_{3}\)*10H\({}_{2}\)O (\(M_{r}\) = 286.0) were dissolved in water and the solution made up to 500 cm\({}^{3}\) using a volumetric flask. What is the concentration of sodium ions in the solution?

## 3 Acid-base reactions

Acids and bases are important in many chemical processes that occur around us, from industrial processes to biological ones and from reactions in the laboratory to those in our environment.

The concept of acids and bases has broadened over time as chemists seek to propose a more comprehensive model to classify, rationalise and predict acid-base chemistry. The current understanding of acids and bases is primarily based on the historical contributions of chemists such as Svante Arrhenius, Johannes Bronsted, Thomas Lowry, and Gilbert Newton Lewis.

### Definitions of Acids & Bases

#### Arrhenius Theory of Acids & Bases

LO4(a): show understanding of, and apply the Arrhenius theory of acids and bases

* An acid is a substance that dissociates in water to produce H\({}_{3}\)O*(aq). E.g. \(\text{HCl}(g)+\text{H}_{2}\text{O}(l)\to\text{H}_{3}\text{O}^{*}(\text{aq})+ \text{Cr}^{*}(\text{aq})\)

**Note**:

In aqueous solution, H+ (a 'bare' proton) does not exist on its own. Instead, it forms a coordinate bond with a water molecule to form H\({}_{3}\)O+, called _hydronium or hydroxonium_. Chemists often use H+(aq) and H\({}_{3}\)O+(aq) interchangeably to refer to the solvated H+ ion.

* A base is a substance that dissociates in water to produce OH+(aq). E.g. NaOH(s) Na(aa)+ OH+(aa)
* When an acid is added to a base, according to Arrhenius, the H+ ion reacts with the OH ion to produce a molecule of water, and undergoes _neutralisation_. E.g. \(\text{HCl}(\text{aq})+\text{NaOH}(\text{aq})\to\text{NaCl}(\text{aq})+\text{H}_{2} \text{O}(l)\)

_Ionic equation_: H+(aq)+OH+(aq)-H\({}_{2}\text{O}(l)\). The Na(aq) and Cr(aq) ions do not take part in the reaction. They are called'spectator ions'.

The limitation of this model is that it is restricted to aqueous solutions only. This limitation could be addressed through the introduction of the Bronsted-Lowry acid-base model.

#### Bronsted-Lowry Theory of Acids & Bases

_LO4(b): show understanding of, and apply the Br/Cnested-Lowry theory of acids and bases, including the concept of conjugate acids and conjugate bases_

* **An acid** is defined as any species which donates a proton, H*. An acid must thus contain H in its formula; E.g. HNO3 and H2PO4.
* **A base** is defined as any species which accepts a proton, H*. A base must contain a lone pair of electrons to bind the H' ion. E.g. NH3, CO3-F- and OH.

A Bronsted-Lowry acid-base reaction involves the **transfer of a proton from an acid to a base**. Bronsted-Lowry acid-base reactions do not only occur in aqueous solutions. They can also occur between gases and non-aqueous systems. E.g. HCI(g) + NH3(g) + NH4C(s).

While the Bronsted-Lowry acid-base model is more inclusive than Arrhenius model, it still could not explain why substances such as BF3 or _NC13_ which do not contain any hydrogen atom but are yet known to behave as acids. This limitation is addressed through the introduction of the Lewis acid-base model.

#### Lewis Theory of Acids & Bases

_LO4(c): show understanding of, and apply the Lewis theory of acids and bases (including non-aqueous system e.g. selection between BF3 and NH4)_

* An acid is a species that accepts an electron pair, e.g. BF3
* A base is a species that donates an electron pair, e.g. NH3

A Lewis acid-base reaction can be viewed as a transfer of a pair of electrons from the base to the acid. E.g. BF3 + NH3 + BF3*NH4 CIONG

Recall in Topic 2 Chemical Bonding we learnt that BF3 and NH3 can react to form white solid/NH3Br3. This can be considered an acid-base reaction according to the Lewis model. You will encounter more examples of Lewis acids and bases later in your A-Level course in organic chemistry.

**Note:**

The limitation of this theory is that it is too general. Thus, it is better to use the Bronsted-Lowry theory whenever possible for acid-base reactions, and apply Lewis theory only if the reaction does not involve proton transfer.

The three models of acids and bases can be used to interpret different acid-base systems. Bronsted-Lowry and Lewis theories are often used to describe specific acid-base reactions whereas Arrhenius theory is used to describe whether isolated substances are acids, bases or neither.

For example, in the case of nitric acid;

Using Arrhenius model, nitric acid is an Arrhenius acid as it generates hydronium ions in the presence of water.

Using Bronsted-Lowry model, nitric acid can be either Bronsted-Lowry acid or base, as seen in Exercise 3.1. It depends on what nitric acid reacts with. For instance, if it reacts with an alkali such as aqueous sodium hydroxide, it acts as a Bronsted-Lowry acid. If nitric acid reacts with a stronger acid such as sulfuric acid, it behaves like a Bronsted-Lowry base. (The concept of'strength of acid' will be dealt with in Topic 14 Acid-Base Equilibria)

### Titrations

Titration (or volumetric analysis) is a technique where a solution is gradually added from a buret to a fixed volume of another solution, i.e., the aliquot (measured with a pipette and placed in a conical flask), until the reactants in the two solutions have reacted completely. Titration is suitable for reactions in which the reactants react rapidly and completely.

It is used to obtain quantitative information such as the concentration of a solution or to establish the stoichiometry of a reaction. Usually one of the solutions used must be of an accurately known concentration, and this is called the **standard solution**.

The **equivalence point** occurs when the reactants in the two solutions react according to the stoichiometry of the reaction. The volume of solution added from the buret is the **title volume**.

For an acid-base titration, the completion of the reaction is often found by noting the colour change of an indicator added to the reaction flask. The point where the indicator changes colour is known as the **end point**.

Indicators for acid-base titration have distinct colours in the 'acid' and 'base' region as shown in Table 2. At certain pH, called the **working range**, the indicator will change its colour.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|} \hline \multicolumn{1}{|c|}{**indicators**} & \multicolumn{1}{|c|}{**pH working range**} & \multicolumn{1}{|c|}{**‘acid’ region**} & \multicolumn{1}{|c|}{**‘base’ region**} & \multicolumn{1}{|c|}{**colour at end**} \\ \multicolumn{1}{|c|}{} & \multicolumn{1}{|c|}{**range**} & \multicolumn{1}{|c|}{**point**} & \multicolumn{1}{|c|}{**point**} \\ \hline methyl orange & 3.1 - 4.4 & red & yellow & orange \\ \hline screened methyl orange & 3.0 - 4.6 & violet & green & grey \\ \hline bromothymol blue & 6.0 - 7.6 & yellow & blue & green \\ \hline phenolphthalein & 8.0 - 9.6 & colourless & pink & pink \\ \hline thymol blue & 8.0 - 9.6 & yellow & blue & green \\ \hline \end{tabular}

# The _H\({}_{2}\)SO\({}_{4}\)_

For KMnO\({}_{4}\) titrations, replace step 2 with "Add (volume) cm\({}^{3}\) of dilute H\({}_{2}\)SO\({}_{4}\) using a measuring cylinder". (To ensure that the acid is in excess. Normal laboratory concentration of H\({}_{2}\)SO\({}_{4}\) is 1.0 mol dm\({}^{-3}\).) [_Refer to Section 4.4.1 Potassium manganate(VII) titration]_

For I\({}_{2}\) / S\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{3}\)\({}^{-}\) titrations, remove step 2, and replace step 4 with: Titrate the I\({}_{2}\) against Na\({}_{2}\)S\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{3}\)(aq) until the solution changes (from brown) to pale yellow, then add 10 drops (or 1 cm\({}^{3}\)) of starch solution which gives an intense dark blue-black colour, then continue titration until the blue-black colour just disappears. [_Refer to Section 4.4.2 lodometric titrations - iodine / thiosulfate titration]_

### Back Titration (Application Example)

In a back titration, a known excess of one reagent A is allowed to react with an unknown amount of B. The amount of unreacted A is then determined by titration with a reagent C of known concentration. From the titration results, the amount of unreacted A and the amount of B can be found by simple stoichiometric calculations.

#### In summary

#### General Steps:

1. Determine the amount of C required in the titration.
2. Using stoichiometry, find amount of A that reacted with C in the titration.
3. Note: amount of A that reacted with C in the titration = amount of A that did not react with B earlier
4. Therefore, amount of A that reacted with B = total amount (known excess) of A added - amount of A that did not react with B earlier
5. Knowing now the amount of A that reacted with B, using stoichiometry, the amount of B is found.

#### Exercise 3.4 (Worked example)

1. A sample of impure magnesium was analysed by allowing it to react with excess HC solution. After 1.32 g of the impure metal was treated with 100 cm\({}^{3}\) of 0.750 mol dm\({}^{-3}\) HE, the remaining solution required 50 cm\({}^{3}\) of a 0.250 mol dm\({}^{-3}\) aqueous sodium hydroxide for complete neutralisation. Assuming the impurities do not react with the acid, what is the percentage by mass of Mg in the sample?

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:143]

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:144]

**Oxidation number (oxidation state)**: The total number of electrons that an atom either gains or loses in order to form a chemical bond with another atom.

An oxidation number is a number that is assigned to an atom in a substance. The oxidation-number could be positive, negative, or zero, and it indicates if electrons are lost or gained. In other words, the oxidation number is a number that helps us keep track of electrons in an atom (so called its electron environment).

The calculation of oxidation state by first principle is based on one simple assumption - a perfect ionic model, i.e. what is the charge that an atom would have if the more electronegative element takes all the electrons.

Two examples are used below, H\({}_{2}\)O and H\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{2}\). The dot-and-cross diagrams of both compounds are drawn and a boundary (represented using dotted lines) is drawn to show what happens if the more electronegative element takes all the electrons. If the same element is bonded next to each other, then each element 'will take back their own'.

For the oxygen atom in H\({}_{2}\)O, after drawing the boundary, a quick count reveals 8 electrons. Originally, oxygen has 6 electrons around it; the oxidation state of oxygen in H\({}_{2}\)O is \(-2\).

Similarly, for H\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{2}\), a quick count reveals 7 electrons. Therefore, the oxidation state of oxygen in H\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{2}\) is \(-1\).

### Assigning Oxidation Number

* When writing the oxidation number (O.N.), the +/- signs must be stated before the number.
* For a covalent compound, the covalent bond is 'converted' to ionic by assigning the shared electrons to the more _electronegative_ atom, such that the oxidation numbers of the atoms are therefore the 'charges' on the 'ions'.
* Here are the most important rules and exceptions to remember when assigning oxidation numbers:

**1.** For an atom in its elemental form, oxidation number = 0.

**2.** For a monoatomic ion, oxidation number = charge on the ion

**3.** For a polyatomic ion, sum of all the oxidation numbers

**4.** (O.N. of Mn) + 4(O.N. of O) = \(-1\)

**4.** O.N. of Mn = +7

### Balancing Redox Equations

_LO12(h): construct redox equations using the relevant half-equations_

In a redox reaction, there is a transfer of electrons from the reducing agent (which loses electrons and is oxidised) to the oxidising agent (which gains electrons and is reduced).

Hence, in a balanced redox equation, the number of electrons lost by the reducing agent must be _equal_ to the number of electrons gained by the oxidising agent, i.e. there are _no free electrons_ in the overall balanced equation. Once again, the Law of Conservation of Mass applies here.

When you are balancing an ionic equation, besides balancing the atoms, you also need to balance the charges as well.

Balancing redox equations using half equations (ion-electron method)In the ion-electron method (also called the half-equation method), the redox equations separated into two half-equations - one for oxidation and one for reduction. Each of these half-equations is balanced separately and then combined to give the balanced redox equation.

Divide the unbalanced redox equation into two half-equations (_an oxidation half-equation and a reduction half-equation_). If the equation is written in the molecular form, re-write it as an ionic equation before splitting it into half-equations.

Balance each half-equation as follows:

Balance the element undergoing oxidation or reduction in the reactant and product. Work out the oxidation number of the relevant elements.

Add the appropriate number of electrons according to the change in oxidation numbers of elements, taking into account the number of each element in the formula unit.

Balance the charges on both sides of the half-equation by adding the appropriate number of H\({}^{+}\) (under acidic conditions) or OH\({}^{-}\) (under alkaline conditions). Under neutral conditions, either H\({}^{+}\) or OH\({}^{-}\) can be used.

Balance the O (or H) atoms by adding H\({}_{2}\)O on the appropriate side.

Check the number of H (or O) atoms on both sides - it should be balanced.

Multiply each balanced half-equation by an appropriate integer, if necessary, to make electrons lost = electrons gained (i.e. total number of electrons lost by reducing agent = total number of electrons gained by oxidising agent).

Add the half-equations together (electrons on both sides must cancel out each other).

Simplify by cancelling any extra species appearing on both sides.

Make a final check that the redox equation is balanced in terms of atoms and charge.

### Redox Titrations

_LO13(g): describe and explain the use of Fe\({}^{+}\)/Fe\({}^{2+}\), MnO\({}_{4}\)/Mn\({}^{2+}\) and Cr\({}_{2}\)O\({}^{2-}\)/C\({}^{3+}\) as examples of redox systems_

In a redox titration, a known concentration of oxidising agent is used to find an unknown concentration of reducing agent (or _vice versa_). Redox titrations are also used to establish the stoichiometry of redox reactions. The calculations involved are based on the mole concept, similar to acid-base titrations.

#### 4.4.1 Potassium Manganate(VII) titration

1. The KMnO\({}_{4}\) solution is usually placed in the burette and added into the conical flask containing the reductant (e.g. Fe\({}^{2+}\) determination)
2. Typical reducing agents that can react with KMnO\({}_{4}\) are: Fe\({}^{2+}\), C\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{4}\)\({}^{2-}\), H\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{2}\) and I\({}^{-}\)
3. Manganate(VII) titrations are usually carried out in _acidic_ conditions. The acid used is Sulfuric acid (usually at 1 mol dm\({}^{-3}\)) and added into the conical flask.

**Note:**_Nitric acid and hydrochloric acid are both not suitable as nitric acid is itself on aiding agent while hydrochloric acid can be oxidised by manganate(VII) ion to give chlorine._

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:152]

A known excess of potassium iodide solution is added to the oxidant (with unknown concentration) in a conical flask to liberate iodine. (_Note: Excess I\({}^{-}\) ensures all the oxidant is reacted and serves to dissolve iodine in aqueous solution._)

_Example:_ H\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{2}\) + 2I\({}^{+}\) + 2H\({}^{+}\) \(\rightarrow\) 2H\({}_{2}\)O + I\({}_{2}\)

The iodine liberated is then titrated with standard thiosulfate solution from a burette. From the titration results, the amount of iodine liberated, and hence the amount of oxidant can be determined.

**Exercise 4.5 (Worked example)**

**1.**: 27.50 cm\({}^{3}\) of a 0.0200 mol dm\({}^{-3}\) solution of acidified potassium manganate(VII) was required to oxidise a 25.0 cm\({}^{3}\) solution of hydrogen peroxide. What was the concentration of hydrogen peroxide and the volume of oxygen (at _s.t.p._) evolved during the titration?

**2.**: A 0.1576 g of iron wire was converted into Fe\({}^{2+}\) ions and then acidified, and titrated against potassium dichromate(VI) solution of concentration 1.64 x 10\({}^{-2}\) mol dm\({}^{-3}\). Given that 27.30 cm\({}^{3}\) of the oxidant was required, calculate the percentage purity of the iron wire.

**3.**: 27.30 \(\times\)1000 \(\times\)1.64\(\times\)10\({}^{-2}\) = 4.477 \(\times\)10\({}^{-4}\) mol

**4.**: 10.000 \(\times\)1.64\(\times\)10\({}^{-2}\) = 4.477 \(\times\)10\({}^{-4}\) mol

**4.**: 10.000 \(\times\)1.64\(\times\)10\({}^{-2}\) = 4.477 \(\times\)10\({}^{-4}\) mol

**4.**: 10.000 \(\times\)1.64\(\times\)10\({}^{-2}\) = 4.477 \(\times\)10\({}^{-4}\) = 4.477 \(\times\)10\({}^{-4}\) = 4.477 \(\times\)10\({}^{-4}\) = 6.2686 \(\times\)10\({}^{-3}\) mol

**4.**: Mass of Fe in the wire = 2.686x 10\({}^{-3}\) x 55.8 \(\equiv\) 0.1499 g

**4.**: Percentage purity of the iron wire = \(\frac{\textbf{0.1499}}{\textbf{0.1576}}\times\textbf{100\%}\) = 95.1%

**Exercise 4.6** (Worked example): Chlorine reacts with iodine to form a compound **T**, \(\text{IC}I_{7}\). When dissolved in an excess of aqueous potassium iodide, **T** liberates iodine, **I\({}_{2}\)**, which is the only iodine-containing product in the reaction.**

**(i): Calculate the number of moles of iodine liberated when 1.00 g of **T** reacts with an excess of aqueous potassium iodide.**

**(ii): What volume of 1.00 mol dm**\({}^{-3}\) **sodium thiosulfate would be required to react with all the iodine liberated in (i)?**

**(ii): What volume of 1.00 mol dm**\({}^{-3}\) **sodium thiosulfate would be required to react with all the iodine liberated in (i)?

### Application of Oxidation Number and Electron Transfer (Application Example)

#### General Strategy:

To determine the change in oxidation number of **B** when a known amount of **A**-reactive with stoichiometric amount of **B** in a redox reaction, the following steps can be taken:

1. Construct the half-equation for **A**, the reactant whose initial and final oxidation numbers are known.
2. Calculate the number of moles of electrons lost (or gained) using amount of **A**. Equate this to the number of moles of electrons gained (or lost) by the other reactant (**B**).
3. Determine the mole ratio of **B** and the electrons gained (or lost) by **B**. This gives the number of moles of electrons transferred for 1 mol of **B**.
4. Hence determine the new oxidation number of **B**.

#### Exercise 4.7 (Worked example)

1. In an experiment, 50.0 cm\({}^{3}\) of a 0.10 mol dm\({}^{-3}\) solution of a metallic salt reacted exactly with 25.00 cm\({}^{3}\) of a 0.1 mol dm\({}^{-3}\) aqueous sodium sulfite. The half-equation for the oxidation of sulfite is shown below.

\(\text{SO}_{2}\)-(aq) + H\({}_{2}\)O(\(I\)) \(\rightarrow\) SO\({}_{4}\)-(aq) + 2H\({}^{+}\)(aq) + 2e\({}^{-}\)

If the original oxidation number of the metal in the salt was +3, what would be the new oxidation number of the metal?

2. 25.0 cm\({}^{3}\) of a solution of 0.0200 mol dm\({}^{-3}\) potassium ethanedioate, K\({}_{2}\)C\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{4}\), reacted with 20.0 cm\({}^{3}\) of an acidified solution of 0.0100 mol dm\({}^{-3}\) potassium manganate(VII).

Find the oxidation number of carbon in the product and hence suggest the identity of this product.

The stoichiometry concepts learnt in this topic will be applicable in almost all future topics where you are required to write balanced equations for all reactions, and work out quantities of reagents to be used (e.g. in organic synthesis) etc. Our knowledge of redox reactions and acid-base reactions will also be expanded in the extension topics of electrochemistry and acid-base equilibria.

###### Abstract

Students should be able to:

### Standard enthalpy change of reaction

The enthalpy change when **molar** quantities of reactants as specified by the chemical equation react to form products at **1 bar and 298 K (standard conditions).

### Standard enthalpy change of formation

The enthalpy change when **1 mole of a substance** is formed from its **constituent elements in their standard states at 298 K and 1 bar.

\(\Delta H^{\Theta}_{t}\) is a measure of the energetic stability of a substance relative to its constituent elements.

\(\Delta H^{\Theta}_{t}\) is positive compound is energetically less stable than its constituent elements greater likelihood for compound to decompose into its constituent elements compound is energetically more stable than its constituent elements less likelihood for compound to decompose into its constituent elements

Enthalpy changes of formation are often theoretical. Some reactions may not take place in practice. E.g. C\({}_{2}\)H\({}_{5}\)OH cannot be formed by just mixing C, H\({}_{2}\) and O\({}_{2}\). In such cases, \(\Delta H^{\Theta}_{t}\) can be calculated indirectly using Hess' law (Refer to Section 4).

**Exercise 2.1**

Write an equation to represent the standard enthalpy change of formation of CaSO\({}_{4}\)(s).

[MISSING_PAGE_POST]

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:164]

The enthalpy change of neutralisation involving a weak acid or weak base is slightly less exothermic than 57.0 k mol\({}^{-1}\)

Reason:

Weak acids (or weak bases) do not ionise completely in dilute aqueous solution. During neutralisation, energy is absorbed to ionise the un-ionised weak acid (or weak base). Thus, less energy is released and the resulting \(\Delta H^{\Theta}_{\rm neut}\) is less exothermic.

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:166]

# The enthalpy change can be calculated as follows:

Sign of \(\Delta H\) is positive. Heat is absorbed by the reaction. Temperature of the surrounding solution decreases.

Sign of \(\Delta H\) is negative. Heat is released by the reaction. Temperature of the surrounding solution increases.

#### The calorimeter

For reactions involving solutions, a simple **calorimeter** consisting of a polystyrene cup with a lid and a thermometer can be used to determine the heat change.

Figure 1: A simple calorimeter

Note:

\(\bullet\)Polystyrene is an excellent insulator so heat loss from the sides is minimised. The lid also helps to minimise heat exchange with the surrounding air.

\(\bullet\)The polystyrene cup is often supported in a 250 cm\({}^{3}\) beaker or using a retort stand, to prevent toppling under the weight of the thermometer. The insulation can be improved by nesting two cups.

\(\bullet\)The temperature changes are often small, so for accurate work the thermometer should have a precision of \(10.1^{\circ}\)C.

### Assumptions in the calculations

To ensure accurate results, **all** the heat released (or absorbed) by the reaction must be used to raise (or lower) the temperature of the solution. In practice, we cannot totally eliminate heat exchanges with the surrounding air or apparatus so we make the following assumptions in our calculations.

No heat loss to (or heat gain from) surrounding air

Heat capacity of the calorimeter (e.g. polystyrene cup) is omitted

\(\Delta H^{\Theta}_{c}\) (carbon monoxide) = \(-\)283 kJ mol\({}^{-1}\)

**Method 1a:** **Constructing an Energy Cycle**

1. _Start with the equation that represents_ \(\Delta H^{\Theta}_{f}\) _(CO)._
2. _Since_ \(\Delta H^{\Theta}_{c}\) _(C) and_ \(\Delta H_{c}\) _(CO) are given, we can draw a cycle where C(s) on the left-hand side of the equation undergoes complete combustion to form CO2(g). To do this we need to add % mol of O2(g). Hence % mol of O2 must also be added on the right-hand side of the equation. This % mol of O2(g) reacts with CO(g) to form CO2(g)._

2. _Sigent of_ \(\Delta H^{\Theta}_{c}\) _(CO) = \(-\)394 kJ mol\({}^{-1}\)

Lattice energy is **always negative** as heat is evolved in forming **electrostatic forces of attraction** between oppositely charged ions (i.e. ionic bonding).

Lattice energy is a measure of the strength of ionic bonding and the stability of the ionic compounds. The **more exothermic** the lattice energy, the **stronger** the ionic bonding and the more stable the ionic compound.

#### Calculations of \(\Delta G\) from \(\Delta G_{\rm f}\)

Like enthalpy change (\(\Delta H\)), Gibbs free energy change (\(\Delta G\)) is a state function. This means that the value that it takes only depends on the state of the substance, and not how it was brought to that state. The'state' is specified by variables such as temperature and pressure. Hence \(\Delta G\) of a reaction can be calculated in a similar way as \(\Delta H\) in Section 4 (Hess' law). Likewise, \(\Delta S\) is a state function and \(\Delta S\) of a reaction can also be calculated a similar way.

#### Temperature dependence of \(\Delta G\)

The term [-T\(\Delta S\)] in the equation \(\Delta G=\Delta H-\Gamma\Delta S\) indicates that \(\Delta G\) is temperature-dependent.

We can assume that \(\Delta H\) and \(\Delta S\) remain roughly constant regardless of temperature and use them to calculate \(\Delta G\) at other temperatures. This assumption is valid as shown in the following example involving the reaction between hydrogen gas and chlorine gas at 298 K and 500 K.

If we were to assume that \(\Delta H\) and \(\Delta S\) do not change with temperature, we can use the values of \(\Delta H\) and \(\Delta S\) at 298 K to calculate a value for \(\Delta G\) at 500 K as shown:

\(\Delta G_{\rm sok}\approx\Delta H_{\rm 2ssx}-500\) x \(\Delta S_{\rm 2psx}\)

\(=-184.6-500\) x \(20.0=-194.6\) kJ mol\({}^{-1}\)

This approximate value of \(\Delta G\) (-194.6 kJ mol\({}^{-1}\)) is close to the actual value (-194.4 kJ mol\({}^{-1}\)) obtained by using values of \(\Delta H\) and \(\Delta S\) at 500 K.

The assumption that \(\Delta H\) and \(\Delta S\) remain roughly constant is **not valid** if there is a **change in phase** of one of the reactants or products as the temperature is increased. Under these conditions, both \(\Delta H\) and \(\Delta S\) change significantly. For example, consider the synthesis of hydrogen iodide at 298 K and 500 K.

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:201]

#### 8.4.4 Effect of Temperature on spontaneity of a reaction

_LO 7(m);predict the effect of temperature change on the spontaneity of a reaction, given standard enthalpy and entropy changes_

For a reaction to be **spontaneous**, \(\Delta G\) should be **negative**. The sign of \(\Delta G\) depends on the signs and magnitudes of \(\Delta H\) and \(\Delta S\), as well as temperature. We observe that most exothermic reactions are spontaneous as the enthalpy contribution to \(\Delta G\) is much more than the entropy contribution. Hence a highly negative \(\Delta H\) is likely to make \(\Delta G\) negative. However, the temperature of a reaction influences the magnitude of the term \(T\Delta S\) and hence the spontaneity of many reactions depends on the temperature. We can use the equation \(\Delta G\doteq\Delta H=T\Delta S\) to predict the sign of \(\Delta G\) when temperature is varied (assuming \(\Delta H\) and \(\Delta S\) do not change with temperature).

There are four possibilities:

### Limitation in the use of \(\Delta G\) to predict spontaneity of a reaction

#### 8.5.1 Non-standard condition

\(\Delta G\) can only be used to predict spontaneity of a reaction under standard conditions. Under non-standard conditions, \(\Delta G\) must be calculated.

#### 8.5.2 Kinetics consideration

It is important to keep in mind that just because a reaction is spontaneous does not mean that it will occur at an observable rate.

While the Gibbs free energy change can be used to determine the spontaneity of a reaction, it does not take into account the kinetics of the reaction, that is, the rate at which the reaction takes place. The reacting species may have to overcome a large energy barrier (\(E_{s}\)) before reaction can occur.

Some reactions are thermodynamically (or energetically) favourable (\(\Delta G\) is negative) but kinetically not favourable (occur very slowly). Such reactions are spontaneous but slow, for example rusting. Another example is the conversion of diamond into graphite.

With respect to graphite, diamond is thermodynamically less stable (\(\Delta G\) < 0). However, due to the high activation energy for the reaction, diamond does not turn into graphite overnight. We say that diamond is kinetically stable.

Looking ahead

We have seen in this topic that energy is the key consideration for any transformation to take place - energy(and/or matter) tends to be dispersed during a chemical or physical change. However, not all transformations take place at considerable rate (as mentioned in Section 9.4) and transformation from reactants to products may not occur to completion. In the next two topics, we will be looking at some characteristics of chemical and physical change, such as the rate of change (reaction kinetics) as well as the extent of change (chemical equilibrium). We will revisit the concept of Gibbs free energy change and learn how the value of \(\Delta G\) can allow us to predict the extent of change (chemical equilibrium).

## 1 Introduction A Cionos

Rates of reaction are studied for two reasons:

* To discover the best conditions to make the reaction go as quickly or as slowly as possible. Some reactions need to be fast, for example, those which occur inside your body when you take a pain reliever, while some reactions should be as slow as possible, like the rusting of iron in machinery and motor vehicles.
* To gather information about the mechanism, that is, how the reaction actually takes place. Reaction mechanisms are particularly important when studying organic reactions.

## 2 The rate of a reaction

### Rate of reaction

_LO8(a)port: explain and use the terms: rate of reaction:_

_The rate of a reaction is defined as the change in concentration of a reactant or a product per unit time._

For every mole of H\({}_{2}\) that is consumed, one mole of I\({}_{2}\) is also consumed and 2 moles of HI are formed. Hence, the change in concentrations of H\({}_{2}\) and I\({}_{2}\) are the same, but the change in concentration of HI is two times faster.

We express the rate as: \[\text{rate}=-\frac{d[\text{H}_{2}]}{dt}=-\frac{d[\text{I}_{2}]}{dt}=\frac{1}{2 }\frac{d[\text{HI}]}{dt}\]

When there are different coefficients in the chemical equation, we commonly define the rate in terms of the substance with a coefficient of \(\bar{\bar{1}}\).

For the reaction, BrO\({}_{3}\)(aq) + 5Br(aq) + 6H\({}^{+}\)(aq) \(\rightarrow\) 3Br\({}_{2}\)(aq) + 3H\({}_{2}\)O(_l_), which of the following relationships are correct?

For every mole of BrO\({}_{3}\)(aq) consumed, 5 moles of Br(aq) and 6 moles of H\({}^{+}\)(aq) are consumed, while 3 moles of Br(aq) is produced. Hence we can see that the rate of consumption of H\({}^{+}\)(aq) is the highest, followed by rate of consumption of Br(aq), then rate of production of Br\({}_{2}\)(aq). The rate of consumption of BrO\({}_{3}\)(aq) is the slowest.

### Instantaneous, Initial and Average Rates

Since the rate of a reaction is defined as the change in concentration of a reactant or a product per unit time, we can obtain the rate of a reaction from the gradient of the tangent of a concentration-time graph.

Figure 1 shows the concentration-time graphs for the decomposition of dinitrogen tetraoxide into its monomers: N\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{4}\) (g) \(\xrightarrow{}2\)NO\({}_{2}\) (g).

The rate of a reaction at a specified time \(t\) is called the instantaneous rate of reaction. It can be determined from the gradient of the tangent at time \(t\), as shown in Figure 1.

When \(t=0\), the rate is called the initial rate of reaction, which is the rate at the start of a reaction. It can be determined from the gradient of the tangent at \(t=0\).

The average rate of reaction is the change in concentration of a reactant or a product over a specified time interval.

A _negative_ gradient indicates a _decrease_ in concentration while a _positive_ gradient indicates an _increase_ in concentration. In Figure 1, the [N\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{4}\)]-time graph has a negative gradient since N\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{4}\) is the reactant, while the [NO\({}_{2}\)]-time graph has a positive gradient since NO\({}_{2}\) is the product.

The _steeper_ the gradient, the _faster_ the rate of reaction. When gradient is zero, there is no change in concentration. This means rate of reaction is zero, i.e. the reaction has _stopped_.

By comparing the gradients of the tangents at time \(t\), we can see that the rate of change in concentration of NO\({}_{2}\) is twice as fast as the rate of change in concentration of N\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{4}\).

The rate of reaction at time \(t\) can be expressed as: rate \(\equiv\frac{d[N_{2}O_{4}]}{dt}\)\(=\frac{1}{2}\frac{d[NO_{2}]}{dt}\)

### Understanding order of reaction

The order of reaction with respect to a reactant, A, tells us how the concentration of that reactant affects the reaction rate.

Consider the reaction: \(a\) A + \(b\) B \(\rightarrow\) products

If the rate of reaction is

**independent** of the concentration of A, i.e. changes in [A] do not change the rate of reaction, then: rate \(\propto\) [A]\({}^{\text{q}}\) and order of reaction is zero order with respect to [A],

**directly proportional to [A]**, i.e. when [A] doubles, rate doubles, then: rate \(\propto\) [A]\({}^{\text{1}}\) and order of reaction is first order with respect to [A],

**directly proportional to [A]\({}^{\text{2}}\)**, i.e. when [A] doubles, rate quadruples (increases 4 times), then: rate \(\propto\) [A]\({}^{\text{2}}\) and order of reaction is second order with respect to [A].

The order of reaction are usually positive integers (0, 1, 2...) although they can also be fractional or even negative.

For the reaction between nitrogen monoxide and hydrogen gas,

\[2\text{NO(g)}+2\text{H}_{2}(\text{g})\rightarrow\text{N}_{2}(\text{g})+2\text {H}_{2}\text{O}(\text{g})\]

the rate equation was found experimentally to be: \(\qquad\qquad\text{rate}=k[\text{NO}]^{2}[\text{H}_{2}]\)

The reaction is thus second order with respect to [NO] and first order with respect to [H]. The overall order is third order (\(\cdot\cdot\) 2 + 1 = 3). Note that the power '1' after [H]\({}_{2}\) may be omitted in the rate equation.

**Exercise 3.1 (worked example)**: For the reaction between hydrogen peroxide and acidified iodide ions,

\[\text{H}_{2}\text{O}_{2}(\text{aq})+3\text{I}^{-}(\text{aq})+2\text{H}^{+}( \text{aq})\rightarrow\text{I}_{3}^{-}(\text{aq})+2\text{H}_{2}\text{O}(l)\]

the orders of reaction with respect to [H]\({}_{2}\text{O}_{2}\), [I'] and [H'] were found to be 1, 1 and 0 respectively.

**(a)**: Write the rate equation for the reaction:

\[\text{rate}=k[\text{H}_{2}\text{O}_{2}]^{2}[\text{I}^{-}]^{2}[\text{H}^{+} ]^{0}\text{ or rate}=k[\text{H}_{2}\text{O}_{2}][\text{I}^{-}]\]

_The power '1' may be omitted in the rate equation. Any term raised to the power of zero is equal to 1, so the term [H]\({}^{0}\) could be omitted altogether._
**(b)**: State the overall order of reaction.

overall order of reaction = 1 + 1 = 2

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:215]

## 4 Determining the rate equation

To determine the rate equation, experiments are conducted to obtain data so that suitable graphs can be plotted to determine the orders of reaction with respect to each reactant. Alternatively, the initial rates method can also be used to determine the orders of reaction.

### Determining order of reaction from graphs

Several graphs can be plotted to determine the order of reaction:

* concentration-time graph
* rate-concentration graph
* rate-time graph

#### 4.1.1 Concentration-time graphs and half-life

_LO8(b)port: construct and use rate equations of the form rate = k[A]\({}^{n}\)[B] limited to simple cases of single-step reactions and of multiple processes with a rate-determining step, for which m and n are 0.1 or 2), including: (0) justifying, for zero- and first-order reactions, the order of reaction from concentration-time graphs_

_LO8(a)port: explain and use the terms: half-life of a reaction_

For a particular reactant R that may affect the reaction rate, we express it as: rate = k[R]\({}^{m}\)

How do we tell the order of reaction, m, with respect to [R] from a concentration-time graph?

Figure 2 shows three possible concentration-time graphs.

When studying concentration-time graphs, look at the **shape** of the graphs and when necessary the **half-life**. It is also useful to remember that the gradient represents the rate of reaction (Section 2.2).

_The half-life, \(t_{\infty}\), of a reaction is the **time taken for the concentration of a reactant to decrease to half its initial value**.

* If the graph is a **straight line** with a constant gradient (Figure 2a), this means that rate is constant when [R] decreases during the course of reaction. i.e. rate is **independent** of [R]. Hence, the reaction is **zero order** with respect to [R].
* If the graph is a **curve** with **constant half-life*** (Figure 2b), the reaction is **first order** with respect to [R]. In addition, as [R] decreases, rate decreases proportionally (see Section 4.1.2 Figure 4b).

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:217]

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:218]

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:219]

#### 4.1.2 Rate-concentration graphs

Besides concentration-time graphs, another way to find the order is to use rate-concentration graphs. To obtain a rate-concentration graph, we find the gradient of the concentration-time graph at various points to obtain the rates. These rates can then be plotted against their corresponding concentrations.

For a particular reactant R that may affect the reaction rate, we express it as: rate \(=k[\text{R}]^{m}\)

How do we tell the order of reaction, m, with respect to [R] from a rate-concentration graph?

Figure 4 shows three possible rate-concentration graphs.

* If the graph is a **horizontal line** (Figure 4a), rate is constant when [R] changes or rate is **independent** of [R], i.e. rate = k[R]\({}^{0}\). The reaction is **zero order** with respect to [R].
* If the graph is a **straight line passing through the origin** (Figure 4b), rate is **directly proportional** to [R], i.e. rate = k[R]\({}^{1}\). The reaction is **first order** with respect to [R].
* If the graph is a **parabola** (Figure 4c), the order of reaction with respect to [R] is not 1. In order to confirm the order of reaction, we should plot a graph that is a straight line.

For example, if the order of reaction is 2, the rate equation is rate = k[R]\({}^{2}\). We can plot rate on the y-axis and [R]\({}^{2}\) on the x-axis as shown in Figure 5a. Alternatively, we can also obtain the log form of the rate equation: lg rate = lg \(k\) + 2lg[R]. When lg rate is plotted against lg [R], the gradient is the order of reaction (Figure 5b).

Figure 5:

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:221]

#### 4.1.3 Rate-time graphs

Rate-time graphs are less useful because they do not offer much more information than the concentration-time graphs on which they are based. To obtain a rate-time graph, we find the gradient of the concentration-time graph at various points to obtain the rates. These rates can then be plotted against time.

Figure 6 shows the rate-time graphs for reactions which are zero, first and second order with respect to [R] respectively.

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:227]

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:228]

There are several points to note for a sampling and titration method:

* The concentration of the reactants and products in the samples that are withdrawn (at various times) are the same as the concentrations in the reaction mixture.
* To determine the concentration of a reactant or product at a specific time, **the reaction in the sample should not continue to take place while it is being analysed**. Hence, quenching of the sample must be done before the titration by adding a large volume of cold water to slow down the reaction (by rapid dilution and cooling) or by neutralising an acidic reactant with a base or vice-versa which will stop the reaction completely.
* Since the titre is proportional to the concentration of the reactant (or product), a titre-time graph would be equivalent to a concentration-time graph. The order of reaction can then be determined from the graph (see Section 4.1.1).
* All other factors that might affect the rate should be kept constant:
* can be kept **constant*
* by placing the reaction mixture in a thermostatically controlled water bath.

For example, in the acid-catalysed iodination of propanone, we follow the changes in [I\({}_{2}\)] so propanone and H+ have to be in large excess. The graph of [I\({}_{2}\)] vs time reflects, the order w.r.t. [I\({}_{2}\)] _only_ if [propanone] and [H+] do not vary much during the course of reaction.

[FIGURE

Figure 7: A thermostatically controlled water bath

# Generic procedure for sampling followed by titration

1. To prepare the reaction mixture, measure (volume) cm\({}^{3}\) of (reactant X) into a 250 cm\({}^{3}\) beaker (or conical flask) using a (volume) cm\({}^{3}\) measuring cylinder.
2. **Measure (volume)** cm\({}^{3}\) of (last reactant) using a measuring cylinder. **Add (last reactant)** to the mixture and **start the stop-watch at the same time**. Swirl to ensure mixing.
3. Before (your chosen time, say 5 min from the start of the reaction), pipette 10.0 cm\({}^{3}\) of the reaction mixture into a conical flask.
4. **At (your chosen time)**, **quench** the withdrawn sample by adding to it (volume) cm\({}^{3}\) of (suitable quenching reagent). Record the exact time of quenching (but don't stop the stop-watch).
5. Carry out the **titration** of the quenched sample. (Details of titration steps needed. Refer to the Planning section in Topic 4 Reactions & Stoichiometry)
6. Before (each of your subsequent chosen times), repeat steps 3 and 4. Carry out the **titration** of each quenched sample. (At least 5 samples are collected to obtain data points to plot the graph.)

Note:

Only one accurate titration is possible for each withdrawn sample.

The reactant under study should be isolated, i.e. the other reactants should be in large excess (around 10 times more concentrated), so that the order of reaction with respect to that reactant alone can be determined.

A burette cannot be used to add the last reactant (Step 2) as it has to be added _rapidly_.

**Exercise 5.1** (N91/3/3 modified) **(worked example)**

A dilute solution of hydrogen peroxide can be used to bleach hair. It decomposes slowly in aqueous solution according to the following equation:

\[2H_{2}O_{2}(aq)\ \to\ 2H_{2}O(t)\ +\ O_{2}(g)\]

A solution with an original concentration of 3.0 mol dm\({}^{-3}\) was placed in a bottle contaminated with transition metal ions, which act as catalysts for the decomposition. The reaction was followed by withdrawing 10.0 cm\({}^{3}\) portions at various times and titrating with acidified 0.1 mol dm\({}^{-3}\) KMnO\({}_{4}\)(aq). (5 mol of H\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{2}\) react with 2 mol of KMnO\({}_{4}\))

The following results were obtained:

Time /min 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 Volume of KMnO\({}_{4}\)/cm\({}^{3}\) 30.00 23.40 18.30 14.20 11.10 8.70 6.80

(a) Plot a graph of volume of KMnO\({}_{4}\) against time and use it to find the order of reaction with respect to hydrogen peroxide.

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:232]

#### Sampling and measuring a physical property

This method is useful for reactions which produce gaseous products. For example, the reaction, 2H\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{2}\)(aq) \(\rightarrow\) 2H\({}_{2}\)O(\(l\)) + O\({}_{2}\)(g), may be studied by measuring the volume of O\({}_{2}\) gas produced using a graduated gas syringe or via the water displacement method.

The generic procedure is similar to the ones stated in the Planning section in Topic 3 The Gaseous State. In that section, two different set-ups were shown. We shall use set-up A as an example:

1. Using an electronic balance, weigh accurately about (mass) g of (solid reactant) in a weighing bottle.
2. Using a measuring cylinder, transfer (volume) cm\({}^{3}\) of (aqueous reactant) into a 250 cm\({}^{3}\) conical flask.
3. Carefully lower the weighing bottle containing (solid reactant) into the conical flask, ensuring the reactants do not mix. Insert the stopper to ensure a closed set-up.
4. **Set up** the apparatus as shown in the diagram (draw an appropriate diagram - refer to Planning section in Topic 3 The Gaseous State).
5. Record the **initial reading** (\(x\) cm\({}^{3}\)) on the gas syringe.
6. **Shake** the conical flask to mix the reactants and **start the stopwatch at the same time**.
7. Continue to gently swirl the flask and **record the reading** on the gas syringe every (your chosen time interval) minute until the reaction is complete.

The experimental results can be used to plot a graph of volume of O\({}_{2}\) gas produced against time.

The volume of O\({}_{2}\) produced is proportional to the _concentration_ of O\({}_{2}\) at time \(t\). The rate of change in volume of O\({}_{2}\) (gradient of tangent at time \(t\)) is directly proportional to the rate of reaction at time \(t\).

Hence, Figure 8 is equivalent to a product concentration-time graph.

To determine the order of reaction with respect to [H\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{2}\)], look at the shape of the graph and check if the half-life is constant (see Section 4.1.1).

# Measuring a change in absorbance using a colorimeter

This method is suitable for a reaction in which one of the substances (reactant or product) is coloured or has a different colour from the others.

CH\({}_{3}\)COCH\({}_{3}\)(aq) + I\({}_{2}\)(aq) + H\({}^{+}\)(aq) + T(aq)

###### Abstract

A colorimeter measures the amount of light which is absorbed as it passes through a coloured solution - recorded as the absorbance of the solution. The more concentrated the coloured species is in the solution, the more light it will absorb and the greater the absorbance. The absorbance can be measured at regular time intervals using the colorimeter, and the rate of reaction is directly proportional to the rate of change in absorbance.

This method is applicable for a reaction in aqueous solution in which there is a change in the concentration of ions (hence electrical conductivity).

## 11 Measuring a change in gas pressure

This method is suitable for reactions which involve a change in the number of moles of gases (hence total pressure).

For example, the reaction, N\({}_{2}\)(g) + 3H\({}_{2}\)(g) \(\rightarrow\) 2NH\({}_{2}\)(g) shows a reduction in number of moles of gases, hence total pressure decreases as the reaction proceeds. The total pressure of the reacting system is measured at regular time intervals by connecting the reaction flask to a **manometer**. The gaseous system is kept in a fixed-volume reactor maintained at constant temperature. Rate of reaction is directly proportional to the rate of change in pressure.

### 'Clock' method and initial rate

A sampling method can be very tedious if the analysis is by titration. An alternative is to use a 'clock' method.

A 'clock' method involves measuring the time taken for the reaction to occur to a **small extent**. The reaction is set up to produce a _prominent change_ e.g. colour change, when a small fixed volume (e.g. 5 cm\({}^{3}\)) of gas or small amount of precipitate is formed. The **time taken for the prescribed change** to occur may be used as an **approximation of the initial rate of the reaction**.

By comparing the initial rates of two reaction mixtures, in which a different initial concentration of one reactant is used, we can deduce the order of reaction with respect to that reactant. Alternatively, the graph of initial rate vs initial concentration can be plotted and the reaction order deduced from the shape of the graph (see Section 4.1.2).

#### 5.2.1 Reaction of \(S_{2}O_{4}{}^{2}\) and \(\Gamma\) (lodine Clock)

The reaction between \(S_{2}O_{4}{}^{2}\) and \(\Gamma\) can be followed using a 'clock' method. The two reactants are mixed with a known small amount of sodium thiosulfate, Na\({}_{2}S_{2}O_{3}\), and a little starch indicator.

\[S_{2}O_{4}{}^{2}(aq)+2\Gamma(aq)\to 2SO_{4}{}^{2}(aq)+I_{2}(aq)\] Reaction (1) \[I_{2}(aq)+2S_{2}O_{4}{}^{2}(aq)\to 2\Gamma(aq)+S_{4}O_{4}{}^{2}(aq)\] Reaction (2)

Reaction (1) is the reaction whose kinetics is to be investigated. Initially, the I\({}_{2}\) produced in reaction (1) reacts with the \(S_{2}O_{4}{}^{2}\)- to produce colourless products in reaction (2). Hence, the characteristic blue

###### Abstract

The distinct visual change can be when sufficient precipitate is formed to just obscure a mark; or when a particular colour first appears.

The total volume of the mixture is kept constant so that [A]\({}_{\text{Initial}}\) is directly proportional to the volume of reactant **A**. E.g., when volume of **A** is doubled, [A]\({}_{\text{Initial}}\) is doubled; when volume of **A** is unchanged, [A]\({}_{\text{Initial}}\) is kept the same.

[A]\({}_{\text{Initial}}\) is kept the same.

[A]\({}_{\text{Initial}}\) is doubled in this way is a measure of the initial rate of reaction, hence comparing the values of \(\frac{\textbf{1}}{t}\) and volume of **A** can give us the order w.r.t. **A** e.g. when volume of **A** is doubled and \(\frac{\textbf{1}}{t}\) is also doubled, it shows that the reaction is first order w.r.t **A**. Alternatively, plotting the values of \(\frac{\textbf{1}}{t}\) vs volume of **A** will effectively give us the rate-concentration graph, the shape of which will allow us to determine the order w.r.t. **A** (see Section 4.5).

Measuring cylinders are usually used to measure the volumes of liquids (common capacities: 10 cm\({}^{3}\), 25 cm\({}^{3}\), 50 cm\({}^{3}\), 100 cm\({}^{3}\)). A burette may be used if a chemical is to be added in a small quantity which has to be _exactly_ the same quantity for all experiments. However, a burette cannot be used to add the last reactant (Step 2) which has to be added _rapidly_.

## 6 Collision Theory, Activation Energy and Maxwell-Boltzmann Distribution

### Collision Theory

The Collision Theory states that to react, the reactant particles must collide with sufficient energy and with the correct orientation.

These collisions are the **effective** collisions which will result in product formation.

### Activation energy and Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution

_LOS(a)part: explain and use the term: activation energy_

_LOS(g): show understanding, including reference to the Boltzmann distribution, of what is meant by the term activation energy_

_The activation energy of a reaction (E\({}_{a}\)) is the energy barrier the reactants must overcome in order to become the products._

In any sample, the particles present will possess a range of energies. In order to estimate the fraction of collisions that have sufficient energy to overcome the activation energy barrier, we need to know their energy distribution. For gases, the distribution of energies can be represented by the Maxwell-Boltzmann energy distribution curve (refer to Topic 3 The Gaseous State for explanation on the shape of the curve).

The total area under the graph represents the total number of molecules present.

The shaded area represents the fraction of molecules that have kinetic energies greater than or equal to E\({}_{a}\), the activation energy for a particular reaction. This fraction is usually small.

In general,

* Reactions with low E\({}_{a}\) are fast because a large proportion of molecules have sufficient energy to overcome the energy barrier. Examples of such **kinetically favourable** reactions include:
* reactions between two free radicals
* reactions between ions of opposite charge
* acid-base (neutralisation) reactions

Figure 13: The Maxwell-Boltzmann energy distribution curve* Reactions with high E\({}_{a}\) are slow because only a small proportion of molecules have sufficient energy to overcome the energy barrier. Examples of such kinetically unfavourable reactions include: reactions between two neutral molecules or involve breaking strong covalent bonds reactions between ions of similar charge reactions where a bond breaks to form free radicals (which are usually highly unstable)

### Molecular orientation

Consider the reaction, NO:Cl + Cl \(\rightarrow\) NO\({}_{2}\) + Cl\({}_{2,z}\), where a collision between a NO\({}_{2}\)Cl molecule and a Cl atom forms a NO\({}_{2}\) molecule and a Cl\({}_{2}\) molecule.

### Activation energy and energy profile diagram

_LO7(b): Construct and interpret an energy profile diagram, in terms of the enthalpy change of the reaction and of the activation energy_

An energy profile diagram (or reaction pathway diagram) shows the change in the energy of the reactants as they become the products. The activation energy, E\({}_{a}\), as well as the enthalpy change, \(\Delta\)H, of a reaction are also reflected in such a diagram.

Figure 16 shows the energy profile diagram for an exothermic single-step reaction.

Figure 16: Energy profile diagram for a single-step, exothermic reaction, A + BC \(\rightarrow\) AB + C

Figure 14: A correctly oriented collision

Figure 15: A poorly oriented collision

Figure 17 shows the energy profile diagram for an exothermic two-step reaction. A two-step reaction has two transition states and an **intermediate**. An intermediate is a definite species which is formed during the reaction but are not part of the final products (as they are consumed in a later step). Intermediates are relatively reactive with energy higher than the reactants and products, but may be stable enough to be detected or isolated. Unlike a transition state (which occurs at an energy maximum), an intermediate occurs at an energy minimum, i.e. the valleys in the energy profile diagram.

The first step in Figure 17a has a larger E\({}_{\text{a}}\) so it is the slower step while the second step in Figure 17b is the slower step as it has a larger E\({}_{\text{a}}\).

Figure 17: Energy profile diagrams for a two-step reaction. In (a), step 1 is slower than step 2. In (b), step 2 is slower than step 2.

## 7 Reaction Mechanism

Reaction mechanism and rate-determining step LO8(a)port: explain and use the term:rate-determining step

Many chemical reactions are too complex to occur in one simple step. Instead, the reaction may involve a series of steps.

A **reaction mechanism** is a _sequence of elementary steps_ that _adds up to the overall reaction_. It shows us how the reaction actually takes place at the _particulate level_ - how the atoms in the reactants rearrange to form the products and the order in which bonds are broken and formed. Reaction mechanisms are postulated from kinetics studies which include experiments to obtain the rate equation (see Sections 4 and 5) and experiments to test the mechanism (see examples on 87).

Elementary steps cannot be broken down into simpler steps. The number of particles (atoms, molecules or ions) reacting in an elementary step is the **molecularity** of that step. _Unimolecular_ reactions involve only 1 particle; _bimolecular_ reactions involve the collision of 2 particles; _termolecular_ reactions involve the collision of 3 particles. Molecularity does _not_ apply to an overall reaction.

Elementary steps must be physically reasonable. It seldom involves the collision of 3 particles (low probability) or collision between ions of the same charge (high E\({}_{a}\)).

In the example below, the mechanism consists of two _elementary steps_:

* Step 1 is _unimolecular_; one **A** reacts in this step.
* Step 2 is _bimolecular_; one **B** reacts with one **E** (which is an intermediate).

The **rate-determining step (r.d.s.)** is the **slowest** (elementary) step in a mechanism. In a single-step mechanism, the only step must be the rate-determining step. In a multi-step mechanism, the step with the _highest activation energy_ is the r.d.s. (see Figure 17).

The rate of the r.d.s. is essentially the _overall rate_ of the reaction. Any step before the r.d.s. should also affect the overall rate. Any step that takes place after the r.d.s. has no effect on the overall rate.

In the example above, step 1 is the slower step of the two, hence it is the rate determining step. The rate of step 1 (r.d.s.) gives the overall rate of the reaction. This means that if experiments are done to measure the reaction's rate, we are measuring the rate of step 1.

The rate of step 1 is affected by changes in **[A]**. Since one **A** reacts in that step, when **[A]** is doubled, number of **A** reacting per unit time doubles so rate is also doubled, implying the order of reaction w.r.t. **[A]** is one. Hence, we can relate the order of reaction (obtained from experiments) to the molecularity of the r.d.s. (and any steps before it since they also affect the overall rate). This will be elaborated further using the examples in Section 7.2.

### Effect of temperature on rate and rate constant

_L08(h):_ explain qualitatively, in terms of both the Boltzmann distribution and of collision frequency, the effect of temperature change on a rate constant (and hence, on the rate) of a reaction.

_What is the effect of temperature change on rate?_

When temperature is increased, the reactant particles have **greater average kinetic energy**. They move more quickly and so **collide more frequently**. More importantly, the **proportion** of particles that have kinetic energies greater than or equal to the activation energy **increases** (see Figure 21).

_What is the effect of temperature change on the rate constant?_

From the rate equation, \(\text{rate}=k\,\text{[A]}^{m}\text{[B]}^{k}\)

If [A] and [B] are kept constant, \(\text{rate}\propto k\)

When temperature increases, rate increases so \(k\) must have increased.

In other words, since an increase in temperature, while keeping concentrations the same, increases the rate of a reaction, the rate constant must have increased.

Alternatively, the Arrhenius equation, \(k=\text{Ae}^{-\text{E}/\text{RT}}\) (Section 3.3) can also be used to show that when temperature increases, rate constant \(k\) increases exponentially.

**Exercise 8.1**_[12003/1/12]_ **(worked example)**:

It is often said that the rate of a typical reaction is roughly doubled by raising the temperature by 10\({}^{\circ}\)C.

What explains this observation?

ARaising the temperature by 10\({}^{\circ}\)C doubles the average energy of each molecule.

BRaising the temperature by 10\({}^{\circ}\)C doubles the velocity of each molecule.

CRaising the temperature by 10\({}^{\circ}\)C doubles the number of molecular collisions in a given time.

DRaising the temperature by 10\({}^{\circ}\)C doubles the number of molecules having more than a certain minimum energy.

Figure 21: Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution showing the effect of temperature change on the proportion of particles with kinetic energies greater than or equal to the activation energyFrom the Boltzmann Distribution, it is clear that the main reason for an increase in rate of reaction is due to the increase in proportion of particles having kinetic energy greater than or equal to the activation energy. D is correct.

Effect of catalyst on rate and rate constant LOD(1): (I) explain that, in the presence of a catalyst, a reaction has a different mechanism, i.e. one of lower activation energy, giving a larger rate constant (ii) interpret this catalytic effect on a rate constant in terms of the Boltzmann distribution

Since a catalyst provides an _alternative reaction pathway of lower activation energy_ (see Figure 22), the **proportion** of particles that have kinetic energies greater than or equal to the lower E\({}_{s}\) increases (see Figure 23). _Frequency of effective collisions_ hence rate of reaction increases.

Figure 23: Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution showing the effect of catalyst on the proportion of particles with kinetic energies greater than or equal to the activation energy.

Figure 22: Energy profile diagram for a reaction, with and without a catalyst

_What is the effect of a catalyst on rate?__What is the effect of a catalyst on the rate constant?_

From the rate equation,

\[\text{rate}=k\left[A\right]^{m}\left[B\right]^{n}\]

If [A] and [B] are kept constant, \(\text{rate}\propto k\)

In the presence of a catalyst, rate increases so \(k\) must have increased.

In other words, since a catalyst increases the rate of a reaction, while keeping concentrations the same, the rate constant must have increased.

Alternatively, in the presence of a catalyst, the reaction proceeds via a different mechanism that is of lower \(E_{a}\) (see Figure 22), giving a larger rate constant \(k\) (see Arrhenius equation: \(k=\text{Ae}^{-t_{2}/\text{NT}}\)).

**Other factors that affect rate:**

**Effect of surface area (of solids) on rate**

For a chemical reaction involving a solid, only the particles on its surface are available for reaction. If the solid reactant is in a more finely divided state, the **surface area of the boundary between the reactants** (e.g. between the solid and a solution) is larger. Hence, collision frequency increases, reaction rate increases.

For example, powdered calcium carbonate reacts faster with acid than lumps of the solid do.

**Effect of light on rate**

Reactions that are affected by light are called **photochemical reactions**. They tend to be slow in the dark but take place rapidly in the presence of light. When the reactant molecules absorb light energy, the average kinetic energy of the particles increases, hence increasing the fraction of reacting particles with enough energy to overcome the activation energy barrier.

Examples of photochemical reactions include:

* breakdown of silver bromide to silver and bromine (used in black-and-white photography):
* reaction of hydrogen with chlorine which is slow in the dark but explosive in sunlight:
* \(H_{2}(g)+C_{2}(g)\to 2HCI(g)\)
* chlorination of alkanes:

\[\text{CH}_{4}+C_{2}\]

\[\text{CH}_{3}C_{I}+HCI\]

_Did you know?_

_Photochromic sunglasses dorken on exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation._

_Photochromic or photochromic lenses have millions of particles of substances such as silver chloride embedded in them. When exposed to UV rays, as in direct sunlight, the particles undergo a chemical reaction that causes them to change shape; The new structure absorbs portions of the visible light, causing the lenses to dorken. The number of particles that change shape varies with the intensity of the UV rays. When you go indoors and out of the UV light, a different chemical reaction takes place. The absence of UV radiation causes the particles to "snap back" to their original shape, resulting in the loss of their light absorbing properties. In both directions, the entire process happens very rapidly._

#### 9.2.1 Mode of action of heterogeneous catalyst: Haber process

_1.08(1)port: outline the different modes of action of homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysis, including: (1) the Haber process_

The mode of action of heterogeneous catalyst is explained below with reference to the reaction in the Haber process: \(\text{N}_{2}(\text{g})+3\text{H}_{2}(\text{g})\rightleftharpoons 2\text{NH}_{3}(\text{g})\), catalysed by finely divided iron.

The three stages involved are:

* _Adsorption_ (Figure 26a): The gaseous reactant molecules (\(\text{N}_{2}\) and \(\text{H}_{2}\)) are **adsorbed** onto the **active sites** by formation of weak attraction forces. This process brings reactant molecules **closer together** (increasing their surface concentration), **weakens the covalent bonds** in the reactant molecules, thus **lowering the activation energy,** and **orientates** reactant molecules **correctly** for reaction to occur.
* _Reaction_ (Figure 26b-e): Reaction occurs where bonds are broken and new bonds are formed.
* _Desorption_ (Figure 26f): Product molecule (\(\text{NH}_{3}\)) **desorbs** from the catalyst surface so that **active sites are exposed for further reaction**.

The rate of reaction is controlled by how fast the gaseous reactants are adsorbed and how fast the products are desorbed. When the active sites are fully occupied (i.e. when the catalyst is **saturated**), there is no increase in reaction rate even if the concentration of reactants or pressure of the system is increased. Since rate is no longer affected by [reactant], _order of reaction with respect to [reactant] becomes zero when the catalyst is saturated_.

Figure 26: Mode of action of heterogeneous catalysis in the Haber ProcessApplication of heterogeneous catalysis: Catalytic removal of harmful gases in the exhaust gases from car engines

1.08(1)part: _outline the different modes of action of homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysis, including: (ii) the catalytic removal of oxides of nitrogen in the exhaust gases from car engines_

The combustion of petrol in car engines not only gives carbon dioxide and water but also three harmful products:

* oxides of nitrogen (from the reaction between N\({}_{2}\) and O\({}_{2}\) from the air, under the high temperatures in the car engine)
* carbon and carbon monoxide (from incomplete combustion)
* unburnt hydrocarbon

Catalytic converters are used to remove these harmful gases by oxidising or reducing them.

* reduction of NO to N\({}_{2}\): CO + NO \(\rightarrow\) CO\({}_{2}\) + \(\gamma\)N\({}_{2}\)
* oxidation of CO to CO\({}_{2}\): CO + \(\gamma\)O\({}_{2}\) \(\rightarrow\) CO\({}_{2}\)
* oxidation of hydrocarbons to CO\({}_{2}\) and H\({}_{2}\)O: hydrocarbon + O\({}_{2}\) \(\rightarrow\) CO\({}_{2}\) + H\({}_{2}\)O

The exhaust gases are passed through the converter, which contains metals such as platinum and rhodium coated on a honeycomb support (see Figure 27). The harmful gases are _adsorbed_ onto the surface of the metals, go through a _reaction_ and the harmless gases then _desorb_ from the surface.

Catalytic converters only work with unleaded petrol because lead 'poisons' the catalyst in the converter (i.e. destroy their catalytic action).

### Autocatalysis

In autocatalysis, the reaction is catalysed by one of its products. For example, Mn\({}^{2+}\) ions catalyse the reaction between manganate(VII) ions and ethanolicoate ions:

\(2\)MnO\({}_{4}\)-(aq) + \(16\)H\({}^{+}\)(aq) + \(5\)C\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{4}\)-(aq) \(\to 2\)Mn\({}^{2+}\)(aq) + \(10\)CO\({}_{2}\)(g) + \(8\)H\({}_{2}\)O(_I_)

### 9.4 Biological catalysts - Enzymes

#### 9.4.1 Catalytic action of enzymes

Lo8(k): describe enzymes as biological catalysts which may have specific activity

Enzymes are biological catalysts that speed up chemical reactions in living cells. They are **proteins**, which are polymers made up of hundreds of units of **amino acids**. Enzymes are mainly globular proteins which are soluble in water. Hence they are **homogeneous catalysts**, though the mechanism of **action** resembles **heterogeneous** catalysis:

The mechanism, described as a "lock-and-key", hypothesis, is illustrated in Figure 29. It may be simplified as the following two steps:

enzyme + substrate \(\rightleftharpoons\) enzyme-substrate complex enzyme + products (slow, rate-determining)

The **substrate** first **binds** to the **active** site of the enzyme to form the **enzyme-substrate complex**. Within the complex, the substrate molecule then undergoes **reaction** (bond reorganisation and/or reaction with other molecules). Finally, the products are **released** from the enzyme and diffuse away. The **active** site is empty again and ready to take in another substrate.

Most enzymes are **highly specific**, catalysing only one reaction, or one group of similar reactions. Only a reactant molecule of the correct size and shape can attach to the enzyme's active site.

Enzymes are **highly efficient**. Enzyme-catalysed reactions have _very low activation energies_. Virtually every collision of the substrate with the **active** site leads to **reaction**. Hence, despite the low body temperature and concentrations, reactions in living cells take place rapidly.

Enzymes extracted from organisms are used in many industrial processes such as the manufacture of antibiotics and laundry detergents. Genetically engineered enzymes have also been used to make useful compounds such as 1,3-propanediol for making polymers, esters used in cosmetics and drugs for treatment of diabetes and cancer.

#### 9.4.3 Effects of temperature and pH on enzyme activity

Each enzyme has an optimum set of temperature and pH at which it functions best. Changes in these conditions will cause the enzymes to **denature**. The denatured enzyme loses their globular structure, i.e. the active site changes shape and can no longer bind to the substrate (see Figure 31).

Figure 32 shows the effect of temperature and pH changes on the rate of enzyme activity.

Introduction

Many chemical reactions appear to go to **completion**, converting reactants to products until the limiting reactant is used up. An example is the combustion of methane:

A reaction is considered as having gone to completion if any reactants in the final mixture are present at such low concentrations that they cannot be detected when the mixture is analysed; in practical terms, this means that if the reaction is more than 99% complete, it can be regarded as having gone to completion. Reactions that go to completion may be represented using the concentration-time graph below:

However, there are other reactions which may not go to completion. At the end of these reactions, a detectable amount of reactant remains, mixed with the product. Such reactions are called reversible reactions.

Figure 1: Concentration-time graph for reactions that go to completion

## 2 Reversible Reactions

_LO9(a)part: explain, in terms of rates of the forward and reverse reactions, what is meant by a reversible reaction_

A reversible reaction is one which can occur in both directions.

A double-headed arrow is used to denote a reversible reaction.

### Dynamic Equilibrium

_LO9(a)part: explain, in terms of rates of the forward and reverse reactions, what is meant by dynamic equilibrium_

A reversible reaction will reach a state of equilibrium where no overall change of reactant and product concentrations is observed. It seems as though the reaction has stopped, but it is actually not the case.

The _forward reaction continues to occur_ since reactants are still present! The reason why concentrations are not changing is because the _reverse reaction_ is also going at _exactly the same rate_, turning the 'new' products back into reactants:

A **dynamic equilibrium** refers to a reversible reaction in which the forward and reverse reactions are both taking place at the same rate resulting in no overall changes in concentrations.

The word 'dynamic' means that the reactions are still taking place although there is no observable change, i.e. the equilibrium is not static. An analogy of dynamic equilibrium is that of a child-running up an escalator which is moving in the opposite direction. When the child and the escalator are moving at the same rate, the position of the child appears unchanged (although he is still running). An analogy of static equilibrium would be that of two children on a see-saw. At 'equilibrium', the see-saw remains horizontal (i.e. not moving up or down) and the positions of the children are fixed.

Figure 2: Concentration-time graph for a reversible reaction* At time = 0 (start of reaction), only N\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{4}\) is present. Then the forward reaction starts to occur: N\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{4}\) decomposes to form brown NO\({}_{2}\) gas.
* As [N\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{4}\)] decreases, rate of forward reaction (rate\({}_{i}\)) decreases. On the other hand, [NO\({}_{2}\)] increases so rate of reverse reaction (rate\({}_{i}\)) increases. Observation: The contents of the flask slowly turn pale brown and darken.

Figure 4: Decomposition of N\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{4}\) into its monomers

Figure 3:

At time = t\({}_{i}\), the system reaches **dynamic equilibrium**. [N\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{4}\)] and [NO\({}_{2}\)] remain constant i.e. there is **no net change in concentrations** (note [N\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{4}\)] does not decrease to zero) and **rate** = **rate**\({}_{i}\)** (but not zero)**.

Observation: Intensity of the brown colour stops changing.

In this example, the flask has to be sealed as **equilibrium can only be achieved in a closed system**, one in which no substances are lost to or gained from the surroundings. An open system allows substances to escape or to enter and equilibrium cannot be established.

Consider the thermal decomposition of CaCO\({}_{3}\): CaCO\({}_{3}\)(s) \(\rightleftharpoons\) CaO(s) + CO\({}_{2}\)(g)

In an open system, CO\({}_{2}\) once formed escapes and is not present to react with CaO. Eventually, all the CaCO\({}_{3}\) is decomposed, i.e. forward reaction goes to completion, in the closed system, CO\({}_{2}\) is able to react with CaO to form CaCO\({}_{3}\). Eventually, the system reaches equilibrium. Further heating will not change the amount of CaCO\({}_{3}\), CaO and CO\({}_{2}\):

Figure 5: Equilibrium can be achieved “from either direction”. This means that we can establish equilibrium starting with either the reactants or products (or actually any amounts of reactants and products). This is illustrated in Figure 6 using the reaction N\({}_{2}\)(g) + 3H\({}_{2}\)(g) \(\rightleftharpoons\) 2NH\({}_{3}\)(g).

**Exercise 2.1** (Worked Example): Some NO\({}_{2}\) was placed in a closed vessel. Sketch a graph showing how the pressure of each substance varies over time until equilibrium is reached.

Let x (in Pa) be the increase in P\({}_{0_{2}}\). The change in the partial pressures of the reactants and the products must follow the stoichiometry of the chemical equation. Hence as P\({}_{0_{2}}\) changes by x Pa, it must mean that P\({}_{\text{NO}_{2}}\) & P\({}_{\text{NO}_{2}}\) change by 2x Pa. This is reflected in the relative height of the changes shown in the graph. Note also that the pressures of all the 3 compounds reaches the new equilibrium values at the same time. This time, t\({}_{\text{eam}}\) signifies that a new equilibrium position has been achieved.

**Exercise 2.2** (Worked Example): Some NO\({}_{2}\) was placed in a closed vessel. Sketch a graph showing how the pressure of each substance varies over time until equilibrium is reached.

Let x (in Pa) be the increase in P\({}_{0_{2}}\). The change in the partial pressures of the reactants and the products must follow the stoichiometry of the chemical equation. Hence as P\({}_{0_{2}}\) changes by x Pa, it must mean that P\({}_{\text{NO}_{2}}\) & P\({}_{\text{NO}_{2}}\) change by 2x Pa. This is reflected in the relative height of the changes shown in the graph. Note also that the pressures of all the 3 compounds reaches the new equilibrium values at the same time. This time, t\({}_{\text{eam}}\) signifies that a new equilibrium position has been achieved.

### Equilibrium constant for reactions involving pure liquids and solids

Consider the following equilibria involving pure liquids and solids:

(a) CaCO\({}_{3}\) (\(\rightleftharpoons\) CaO(s) + CO\({}_{2}\)(g) + CH\({}_{3}\)CO\({}_{2}\)H(I) + CH\({}_{3}\)CO\({}_{2}\)C\({}_{3}\)H\({}_{3}\)(I) + H\({}_{2}\)O(I) (c) CO\({}_{2}\)(aq) + H\({}_{2}\)O(I) \(\rightleftharpoons\) H\({}_{2}\)CO\({}_{3}\)(aq) Reaction (a) is an example of heterogeneous equilibrium as the components are in different phases. Reactions (b) and (c) are examples of homogeneous equilibria as the components are in the same phase.

Applying the Equilibrium Law, the equilibrium constant expression for reaction (a) may be written as:

(a) (note: [CaCO\({}_{3}\)] and [CaO] are constant) Rearranging, (c) (= CO\({}_{2}\)] (group the constant terms together) or (c) (= CO\({}_{2}\)] Pa

Hence, when writing equilibrium constant expressions for heterogeneous equilibria, we omit the concentration of pure solids or liquids as they are considered a constant.

[] Why are the concentrations of pure solids or liquids considered constant? (Background Info)concentration of pure solid = \(\frac{n}{V}\) = \(\frac{m}{M_{V}V}\) = \(\frac{density}{M_{t}}\) = constant (since density and \(M_{t}\) are constant)

This also applies to the concentration of a pure liquid. For example,

The **concentration** of liquids which are acting as a **solvent** remains almost constant since a **solvent** is present in large excess so the changes, if any, will be negligible.

\begin{tabular}{l} Hence, for reaction (c), \(K_{c}\) = [CO\({}_{2}\)] (no units) \\ \end{tabular}

## 5 Position of Equilibrium and Le Chatelier's Principle

_LO9(b): state Le Chatelier's Principle and apply it to deduce qualitatively (from appropriate information) the effects of changes in concentration, pressure or temperature, on a system at equilibrium_

_LO9(c): deduce whether changes in concentration, pressure or temperature or the presence of a catalyst affect the value of the equilibrium constant for a reaction_

Changes in conditions such as concentration, pressure or temperature, can disturb the position of equilibrium of a system. The system reacts in a way to re-attain equilibrium. The changes in the position of equilibrium can be predicted (qualitatively) from Le Chatelier's Principle.

_Le Chatelier's Principle states that if the conditions of a system at equilibrium are changed, the position of equilibrium shifts so as to reduce that change._

### Effect of Changes in Concentration

Consider the equilibrium:

\(N_{2}(g)\) + \(3H_{2}(g)\)\(\rightleftharpoons\) 2NH\({}_{3}(g)\)

What is the effect of adding some \(N_{2}\) to the equilibrium mixture?

When some \(N_{2}\) is added to the equilibrium mixture, concentration of \(N_{2}\) increases.

By Le Chatelier's principle, position of equilibrium shifts to the right to consume some of the \(N_{2}\) so as to decrease concentration of \(N_{2}\).

Concentration of \(H_{2}\) will also decrease while that of \(NH_{3}\) will increase.

Figure 8 shows how the concentrations of \(N_{2}\), \(H_{2}\) and \(NH_{3}\) changes with time, when \(N_{2}\) is added at \(t_{1}\).

Figure 8: Changes in concentration after some \(N_{2}\) is added at \(t_{1}\)Key points to note:

* At t\({}_{\text{L}}\), [N\({}_{2}\)] increases sharply due to the addition of N\({}_{2}\).
* As predicted, [NH\({}_{3}\)] at the new equilibrium position is higher than its original concentration.
* [N\({}_{2}\)] still ends up higher than before the addition at t\({}_{\text{L}}\). The position of equilibrium can only shift to reduce (not completely remove) the change.
* [H\({}_{2}\)] ends up lower than before because some reacted with the added N\({}_{2}\).
* Most importantly, although the position of equilibrium shifted to the right, the value of equilibrium constant, \(K_{\text{c}}\) remains the same.

Before t\({}_{1}\) (initial equilibrium), \(K_{\text{c}}=\frac{[\text{NH}_{3}]^{2}}{[\text{H}_{2}]^{3}}=\frac{2^{2}}{(0.5) (3)^{3}}=0.30\) mol\({}^{-2}\) dm\({}^{6}\)

After t\({}_{2}\) (new equilibrium), \(K_{\text{c}}=\frac{[\text{NH}_{3}]^{2}}{[\text{H}_{2}]^{3}}=\frac{2.38^{2}}{(1. 31)(2.43)^{3}}=0.30\) mol\({}^{-2}\) dm\({}^{6}\)

Changing [N\({}_{2}\)] affects the position of equilibrium but does not change the value of \(K_{\text{c}}\).

As the above is a gaseous system, the partial pressure of N\({}_{2}\) is also increased when some N\({}_{2}\) is added since [N\({}_{2}\)] ( P\({}_{\text{H}2}\). Hence, we can say that changing the partial pressure of a gaseous component, by adding some of that component e.g. N\({}_{2}\), will have the same effect as changing its concentration.

Consider another equilibrium: [CaCO\({}_{3}\)(s) \(\Leftarrow\) CaO(s) \(+\) CO\({}_{2}\)(g)

Adding more CaCO\({}_{3}\) or CaO will not affect the position of equilibrium because the position of equilibrium is unaffected by pure solids or liquids since their concentrations are considered constant (see Section 3.2).

**Exercise 5.2**

Haemoglobin (Hb) is a protein found in red blood cells. They are large proteins that contain _heme_ groups in them. Each haemoglobin molecule contains four _heme_ groups, and each _heme_ group contains an iron at its active sites which allow for reversible binding to O2 molecule. Each Hb can bind up to four oxygen molecules and the binding occurs in successive steps.

The entire system of oxygen transport and delivery in the body depends on the pickup and release of O2 by haemoglobin according to the series of equilibria:

### Effect of Changes in Total Pressure

For a system with gaseous components, changing the volume of the container changes the total pressure. The change in total pressure can cause the position of equilibrium to shift. The effect on systems containing only liquids and solids is negligible as liquids and solids are nearly incompressible.

Consider the same equilibrium: N2(g) + 3H2(g) =2NH3(g)

What is the effect of decreasing the volume of the container?

If the volume of the container is decreased, the pressure will increase (Figure 8(b)).

The system will try to reduce the pressure by reducing the total number of gas molecules.

Hence, the position of equilibrium will shift right towards the side with fewer moles of gas.

Figure 9 shows that when [NH3] increases by 2 units, [N2] and [H2] decrease by 1 unit and units respectively. Overall, there is a decrease of 2 units of gas molecules. At the new equilibrium (Figure 9c), the pressure is lower than the pressure immediately after volume decreases (Figure 9b). Figure 10 shows how the concentration of N2, H2 and NH3 changes with time, when volume of the container is decreased at 1.

* At 1, [N2], [H2] and [NH3] all increase sharply due to the reduction in volume of container.
* As predicted, since the position of equilibrium shifts right, [NH3] is higher than its concentration at 1 when the volume of container is decreased, but [N2] and [H2] are lower.
* Similar to changing concentration, although the position of equilibrium shifted to the right, the value of equilibrium constant, \(K_{\alpha}\) remains the same.

In some reactions, the total number of moles of gases on each side of the stoichiometric equation are the same i.e. number of moles of gases do not change during reaction. For example,

\[\text{H}_{2}(\text{g})\,+\,\text{I}_{2}(\text{g})\,\text{=}2\text{HI}(\text{g})\]

In this case, changes in pressure have no effect on the position of equilibrium.

Figure 9: Changes in the no. of molecules when volume of container decreases

**Exercise 5.3**

Consider the following system at equilibrium:

\[\text{N}_{2}\text{O}_{4}(\text{g})\rightleftharpoons 2\text{NO}_{2}(\text{g})\]

How would increasing the total pressure affect the position of the equilibrium? What would you observe?

When the total pressure increases, by Le Chatelier's principle, the position of equilibrium shifts to the left so as to decrease the pressure by favouring the reaction that results in fewer moles of gases. Thus less NO\({}_{2}\) will be present and intensity of brown colour decreases.

### Effect of Changes in Temperature

The effect of temperature on the position of equilibrium depends on the enthalpy change of the reaction.

Consider the equilibrium: \[\text{N}_{2}(\text{g})+3\text{H}_{2}(\text{g})\rightleftharpoons 2\text{NH}_{3}(\text{g})\]

What is the effect of decreasing the temperature of the equilibrium mixture?

When temperature is decreased, the system will try to produce additional heat by favouring the exothermic reaction.

Since the forward reaction is exothermic in this equilibrium, by Le Chatelier's Principle, the position of equilibrium shifts to the right.

Hence, [NH\({}_{3}\)] increases while [N\({}_{2}\)] and [H\({}_{2}\)] decreases.

If a forward reaction is endothermic, the position of equilibrium would shift to the left instead.

Figure 11 shows how the concentrations of N\({}_{2}\), H\({}_{2}\) and NH\({}_{3}\) changes with time when temperature is decreased at t\({}_{1}\).

Figure 11: Changes in concentration after temperature is decreased at t\({}_{1}\)* Unlike changes in concentration or pressure, at t\({}_{1}\), [N\({}_{2}\)], [H\({}_{2}\)] and [NH\({}_{3}\)] did not change sharply.
* As predicted, at the new equilibrium position, [NH\({}_{3}\)] increases while [N\({}_{2}\)] and [H\({}_{2}\)] decreases.
* Unlike changes in concentration or pressure, changes in temperature affects both the position of equilibrium and the value of the equilibrium constant.

Before t\({}_{1}\) (initial equilibrium), \(K_{\rm c}\)\(=\)\(\frac{\left[{\rm NH}_{3}\right]^{2}}{\left[{\rm N}_{2}\right]\left[{\rm H}_{2}\right]^{3}}\)\(=\)\(\frac{2^{2}}{(0.5)(3)^{3}}\)\(=\)\(0.3\)\({\rm mol}^{-2}\)\({\rm dm}^{6}\)

After t\({}_{2}\) (new equilibrium), \(K_{\rm c}\)\(=\)\(\frac{\left[{\rm NH}_{3}\right]^{2}}{\left[{\rm N}_{2}\right]\left[{\rm H}_{2}\right]^{3}}\)\(=\)\(\frac{2.6^{2}}{(0.2)(2.1)^{3}}\)\(=\)\(3.8\)\({\rm mol}^{-2}\)\({\rm dm}^{6}\)

When the forward reaction is exothermic, a decrease in temperature increases the value of \(K_{\rm c}\) or \(K_{\rm p}\).

Why does \(K\) increase when temperature decrease for exothermic reactions? (BackgroundInfo)

In Section 3.2 Background Info, we derived the relationship: \(K\)\(=\)\(\rm{K_{b}}\).

The Arrhenius equation (Topic 6 Reaction Kinetics) shows that when temperature is decreased, rate constant, \(k\), will decrease. Hence when temperature is decreased, **both the rate constants** of the forward and backward reactions, \(k_{\rm t}\) and \(k_{\rm b}\), will decrease. So both the forward and backward reactions become slower.

However, since the forward reaction is exothermic, the backward reaction has a larger activation energy. Hence, \(k_{\rm b}\) will decrease more than \(k_{\rm t}\) when temperature decreases so \(K\) increases since \(K_{\rm t}\)\(=\)\(\rm{K_{b}}\).

Because the rate of the backward reaction decreases more than that of the forward reaction, the system would favour the forward reaction to produce additional heat (as predicted by Le Chatelier's Principle).

Alternatively, the _van't Hoff_ equation can be used to show how the equilibrium constant, \(K\), increases when temperature is decreased for exothermic reactions:

\[ln\ K=-\frac{H^{\rm o}}{R}\Big{(}\frac{1}{T}\Big{)}+\frac{S^{\rm o}}{R}\]

Section 9(BackgroundInfo) will show the derivation of the _van't Hoff_ equation from thermodynamics.

## 6 The Reaction Quotient

Consider the reversible reaction:

At any instant, \(Q_{c}\) = [A]\({}^{+}\)[B]\({}^{+}\) where [ ] denotes the instantaneous concentration in mol dm\({}^{-3}\)

Units of \(Q_{c}\) is (mol dm\({}^{-3}\))(c-d) (i-a)

\(Q_{c}\) and \(K_{c}\) have the same expressions and units. However, at a given temperature, \(Q_{c}\) can take on any value while \(K_{c}\) has a constant value. When \(Q_{c}\) = \(K_{c}\) the system is at equilibrium.

We can compare the values of \(Q_{c}\) and \(K_{c}\) to determine the direction in which a reaction will proceed towards equilibrium.

* If \(Q_{c}\) < \(K_{c}\) reaction will proceed in the forward direction to consume more reactants and form more products until \(Q_{c}\) equals to \(K_{c}\) (i.e. until system reaches equilibrium).
* If \(Q_{c}\) > \(K_{c}\) reaction will proceed in the backward direction to form more reactants and consume more products until \(Q_{c}\) equals to \(K_{c}\) (i.e. until system reaches equilibrium).

Using the above, the changes in the position of equilibrium due to changes in concentration or pressure can be predicted (quantitatively).

**Exercise 6.1 (Worked Example)**

Consider the reaction: \(N_{2}(g)+3H_{2}(g)=2NH_{3}(g)\)

There are 0.249 mol of \(N_{2}\), 3.21\(\times\)10\({}^{-2}\) mol of \(H_{2}\) and 6.42\(\times\)10\({}^{-4}\) mol of \(NH_{3}\) in a 3.50 dm\({}^{-3}\) reaction vessel at 375 \({}^{\circ}\)C. The numerical value of the equilibrium constant, \(K_{c}\) is 1.20 at this temperature.

Decide whether the system is at equilibrium. If it is not, predict in which direction the reaction will proceed to achieve equilibrium.

We first convert the quantities of each compound from moles to mol dm\({}^{-3}\) as the Qc expression contains concentration terms:

\([N_{2}]=0.249/3.50=7.114\times 10^{-2}\) mol dm\({}^{-3}\)

\([H_{2}]=(3.21\times 10^{-2})/3.50=9.171\times 10^{-3}\) mol dm\({}^{-3}\)

\([NH_{3}]=(6.42\times 10^{-4})/3.50=1.834\times 10^{-4}\) mol dm\({}^{-3}\)

\(Q_{c}=[NH_{3}]^{2}\)

\([N_{2}][H_{2}]^{3}=(7.114\times 10^{-2})(9.171\times 10^{-3})^{3}\)

\(Q_{c}\neq K_{c}\) so the system is not at equilibrium.

Since \(Q_{c}<K_{c}\) reaction will proceed in the forward direction

to increase \([NH_{3}]\), and decrease \([N_{2}]\) and \([H_{2}]\), until \(Q_{c}=K_{c}\).

Given that the equilibrium constant, \(K_{c}\), for the reaction, H\({}_{2}\)(g) + I\({}_{2}\)(g) \(\rightleftharpoons\) 2HI(g), is 54.3 at 430 \({}^{\circ}\)C, calculate the equilibrium number of moles of H\({}_{2}\),I\({}_{2}\) and HI.

## 8 Haber process

_LO9(h): Describe and explain the conditions used in the Haber process, as an example of the importance of an understanding of chemical equilibrium in the chemical industry_

The principles of Chemical Equilibria and Reaction Kinetics play an important part in the design and working conditions of an industrial process. The conditions are chosen so that reactants are converted into products as _quickly_ as possible (a _kinetics_ problem) and as _completely_ as possible (an _equilibrium_ problem).

The Haber process is used to manufacture ammonia from nitrogen and hydrogen.

The reaction is slow and does not go to completion. Figure 13 shows that a high yield of NH\({}_{3}\) is produced by low temperature and high pressure.

However, the optimal conditions used in the Haber process are:

* Temperature: **450 \({}^{\circ}\)C**
* Pressure: **250 atm**
* Catalyst: finely divided iron catalyst
* A low temperature would favour the forward exothermic reaction and increase the yield of NH\({}_{3}\) but the reaction would be too slow to be economical. In practice, the operating temperature is kept at a.moderate temperature of about **450 \({}^{\circ}\)C**.
* A catalyst is used to increase the rate of reaction thus increasing efficiency without affecting yield.
* A high pressure favours the forward reaction as it reduces the number of moles of gases but the cost and maintenance of the equipment would be too high. In practice, the operating pressure is relatively high at **250 atm**.
* The yield of NH\({}_{3}\) is further increased by removing it as it forms as this continuously shifts the position of equilibrium to the right.

## 9 Equilibrium Constant and Gibbs Free Energy (connecting Equilibrium and Thermodynamics)

_LO9(g): Show understanding that the position of equilibrium is dependent on the standard Gibbs free energy change of reaction, \(\delta G^{\sharp}\)(Quantitative treatment is not required)_

Recall in Topic 5 Chemical Energetics & Thermodynamics, that standard Gibbs free energy change of reaction (\(\Delta G^{\sharp}\)) is the change in Gibbs free energy needed to convert reactants into products of 1 bar and constant temperature (usually at 298 K). Its sign can be used to predict where the position of equilibrium (POE) lies for a reversible reaction.

A negative value for \(\Delta G^{\sharp}\) represents a driving force in the forward direction, and POE lies to the right. A positive value represents a driving force in the reverse direction, and POE lies to the left.

**Relation between \(\Delta G^{\sharp}\) and \(K\) (Useful Tool)**

For a reversible reaction taking place under non-standard conditions, the Gibbs free energy change, \(\Delta G\), is related to the _standard Gibbs free energy change_, \(\Delta G^{\sharp}\), according to this equation:

\[\Delta G=\Delta G^{\sharp}+RT\ln Q\]

where \(R\) is the gas constant \(T\) is temperature in Kelvin \(Q\) is the reaction quotient \(\Delta G=-RT\ln K\)

For a reaction at equilibrium, \(Q=K\) and \(\Delta G=0\), and the previous equation may be written as:

\[0=\Delta G^{\sharp}+RT\ln K\]

Rearranging the equation gives us:

\[\Delta G^{\sharp}=-RT\ln K\]

This equation provides a useful link between these two essential ideas, standard Gibbs free energy change and equilibrium constant, both are measures of the extent of a reversible reaction.

The table below summarises how the sign for \(\Delta G^{\sharp}\) can provide information on POE.

**Exercise 9.1** _[N2017 P1 Q14]_

The graph shows how \(\Delta\)G\({}^{6}\) changes with temperature for the reaction shown.

###### Abstract

The study of organic chemistry in the A-level syllabus is based on the chemistry of different functional groups. Besides the first two general topics on Introduction and Isomerism, each topic in organic chemistry will cover one functional group: its nature, physical properties, chemical reactivity, reactions and mechanisms.

The properties and reactions of the functional groups can be explained using concepts in Topic 1 Atomic Structure and Topic 2 Chemical Bonding atomic orbitals, hybridization, electronegativity, covalent bonding, and intermolecular forces. Their reactions and mechanisms can be understood based on concepts in Topic 4 Reactions & Stoichiometry (stoichiometry, redox, acid-base reactions), Topic 5 Energetics & Thermodynamics (bond energies, enthalpy changes) and Topic 6 Reaction Kinetics (rate equations, orders of reaction, transition states, intermediates).

Besides drawing on knowledge from previous topics, the organic topics themselves are also closely linked because each functional group can be converted to other functional groups via reactions. It is helpful to draw up a concept map at the end of all the organic topics to get a visual overview of all possible reactions and functional group conversions.

## 1 Introduction

The study of organic chemistry is centred on the structures, properties and reactions of organic compounds. Organic compounds are compounds that contain carbon, and usually hydrogen and/or halogens. Other elements such as oxygen, nitrogen, phosphorus and sulfur can also be present. (Note that carbon dioxide, carbonates, cyanides are not considered organic compounds.)

Carbon can form many compounds because:

* a carbon atom can form covalent bonds to as many as 4 other atoms
* it can form stable and strong covalent bonds with other carbon atoms and/or atoms of many different elements
* it can form different types of bonds, e.g. single, double and triple bonds
* it can form long chains or rings of carbon atoms

Due to the unique properties above, carbon atoms can bond with one another and with atoms of different elements in a multitude of ways, to form large numbers of organic compounds. Fuels, plastics, painkillers, antibiotics and vitamins are organic compounds that have become vital to our present way of life.

## 2 Keywords

## 2 CLASSES OF ORGANIC COMPOUNDS

Organic compounds can be classified based on the:

types of carbon chain (Section 2.1)

functional groups present (Section 2.2)

### Types of carbon chain

Organic compounds can be grouped based on whether they are saturated; contain rings or aromatic systems, e.g.:

Aliphatic compounds

compounds with open chains of carbon atoms, e.g. propane

may be unbranched or branched

may contain single, double or triple bonds or combinations of these

Alicyclic compounds

compounds with closed rings of carbon atoms, e.g. cyclohexane:

Aromatic compounds

compounds containing at least one aromatic system such as a benzene ring:

Organic compounds (aliphatic or alicyclic) containing only single bonds are saturated. Compounds with at least one double or triple bond or aromatic ring are unsaturated.

### Functional groups

_LO11.1(b)_: _internet, and use the following terminology associated with organic reactions: (i) functional group_

Organic compounds can be grouped into different classes based on functional groups they contain.

Functional groups refer to particular atoms or a group of atoms within an organic molecule, that define the physical properties and chemistry of that compound.

The following page shows the classes of organic compounds in the A Level syllabus, with their corresponding functional groups.

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:296]

#### 2.2.1 Homologous series

A homologous series is a family of compounds containing the same functional group, and each successive member increases by one -CH\({}_{2}\)- unit.

Compounds of the same homologous series:

1. can be represented by a general molecular formula
2. show a regular trend in physical properties
3. can usually be prepared by similar methods
4. have similar chemical properties

An example of a homologous series is that of alkanes, with general molecular formula C\({}_{n}\)H\({}_{2n+2}\). The table below shows the trend in the boiling point of the first six members of the series.

#### 2.2.2 Degree of Substitution

_LO11.T (b)port:interpet, and use the following terminology associated with organic reactions: (ii) degree of substitution: primary, secondary, tertiary, quaternary_

Some organic compounds are classified based on how many substituents (usually alkyl or aryl) are joined to the carbon atom bearing the functional group.

A **substituent** refers to an atom or group of atoms that takes the place of a hydrogen atom on the hydrocarbon chain.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|} \hline Formula & Name & Boiling point/ \({}^{\circ}\)C \\ CH\({}_{4}\) & methane & \(-\)162 \\ CH\({}_{3}\)CH\({}_{3}\) & ethane & \(-\)89 \\ CH\({}_{2}\)CH\({}_{2}\)CH\({}_{3}\) & propane & \(-\)42 \\ CH\({}_{3}\)CH\({}_{2}\)CH\({}_{3}\) & butane & 0 \\ CH\({}_{3}\)CH\({}_{2}\)CH\({}_{2}\)CH\({}_{3}\) & pentane & 36 \\ CH\({}_{3}\)CH\({}_{2}\)CH\({}_{2}\)CH\({}_{2}\)CH\({}_{3}\) & hexane & 69 \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 2: Homologous series of alkanes

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|} \hline
**No. of carbons atoms in the alkyl group** & **name** & **structure** \\ \hline
**1** & methyl & \(-\)CH\({}_{3}\) \\ \hline
**2** & ethyl & \(-\)CH\({}_{2}\)CH\({}_{3}\) \\ \hline
**3** & propyl & \(-\)CH\({}_{2}\)CH\({}_{2}\)CH\({}_{3}\) \\ \hline
**4** & butyl & \(-\)CH\({}_{2}\)CH\({}_{2}\)CH\({}_{2}\)CH\({}_{3}\) \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 3: Examples of alkyl groupsAn **aryl group** is a type of substituent derived from an aromatic ring (such as a benzene ring) by removing a hydrogen atom. An example of an aryl group is the phenyl group, represented by.

A useful way of classifying alcohols is to place them in one of the three categories: **primary (1"), secondary (2") and tertiary (3")**. Figure 1 shows primary, secondary, and tertiary alcohols have one, two and three alkyl or aryl groups (represented by R) attached respectively, to the carbon bearing the OH group. The same classification can be applied to halogenalkanes, radicals and exdocations.

For amines, however, it is the number of alkyl or aryl groups attached to the _nitrogen_ atom, that determines whether an amine is primary, secondary or tertiary. Note that there can be a **quaternary (4") ammonium cation when the nitrogen atom uses its lone pair to form a fourth bond to an alkyl (or aryl) group.

###### Abstract

The longest carbon chain has five C atoms and has all C-C single bonds (stem: pentan-)

The **suffix** (highest priority functional group) is identified as the alcohol functional group -OH (suffix: -ol)

Number the C atoms along the longest carbon chain such that

the smallest number is given to the suffix (C bonded to -OH group numbered as C1)

the smallest set of numbers is given to the groups identified as prefixes

identify the **prefixes** (substituents) and assign their **individual** (position in the molecule)

One -CH3 substituent on C3 position (3-methyl)

Two -CI substituents on C3 and C4 positions (3,4-dichloro)

placing the prefixes in alphabetical order: 3.4-dichloro-3-methyl. (This alphabetical order does not take into consideration "dir", "tri", "tetra" etc, This means that the "dichloro" substituents are placed before "methyl" in the name despite the presence of "d" in "dichloro" as we still follow the first letter of the original name of the substituent i.e. "c" in chloro.)

Note: Use comms () to separate numbers and use hyphens (-) to separate numbers and words.

The systematic IUPAC name of the molecule is obtained by putting together the prefixes, stem and suffix: 3,4-dichloro-3-methylpentan-1-ol.

## 5 Key ideas in organic reactions

### Types of organic reactions

_LO11.1(b)port: interpret, and use the following terminology associated with organic reactions: (iii) addition, substitution, elimination, condensation, hydrolysis (viii) oxidation and reduction_

In addition to acid-base reactions (transfer of H+ ions) learnt in Topic 4 Reactions and Stoichiometry, there are seven types of reactions applicable to organic reactions.

Study carefully the changes that occur in each type of reaction so that you can recognise them in novel reactions.

When an organic molecule, usually containing a double bond (e.g. C=C), reacts with another molecule to give only one product. The \(n\) bond of the double bond breaks to form two new \(\alpha\) bonds. Opposite of elimination.

e.g.

When two molecules come together to form a bigger molecule, with the elimination of a small molecule such as water or HC/ etc.

***Not the same as elimination which requires formation of a new double bond.

e.g.

When a molecule is split into two by the action of water, often catalysed by dilute acids or dilute alkalis.

***Not the same as elimination which requires formation of a new double bond.

e.g.

e.g.

When a molecule is split into two by the action of water, often catalysed by dilute acids or dilute alkalis.

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:307]

### _Mechanisms of organic reactions_

*_students are expected to be able to interpret and use the curly arrow notation to represent the movement of electrons in organic reaction mechanisms_

The mechanism of a reaction is a detailed description of which bonds break, which bonds form, and the sequence in which they occur in the reaction. Since bonds consist of shared electrons, a mechanism shows how electron(s) move to break bonds and form new bonds when reactants are converted to products.

In organic chemistry we use the **curly arrow notation** to show the movement of electrons:

The **tail** of the arrow represents the source of the electron(s) e.g. an unpaired electron, lone pair or a bond while the **head** of the arrow represents where the electron(s) go to e.g. an atom or a new bond.

To represent the movement of **a single electron**, we use a partial head or "fish-hook' arrow:

To represent the movement of **a pair of electrons**, we use a full head arrow:

#### 5.2.1 Bond Breaking represented by curly arrow notation

L011.1 (b)port: interpret, and use the following terminology associated with organic reactions: (iii) homolytic and heterolytic fission (iv) carbocation (v)port: free radical

Homolytic fission

Breaking of a covalent bond where the bonding pair of electrons are given **equally** to **each** atom. Since this involves movement of single electrons, we use the fish-hook arrow:

**Example:** In the homolytic fission of a C-H bond in methane, the C atom and H atom each take one electron from the bonding pair of electrons to form two radicals.

Figure 8(b) shows the actual electron distribution and movement:

Figure 8(b): Actual electron distribution and movement of electrons in the homolytic fission of C-H bond in methane

At the same time, X-Y bond undergoes _homolytic fission_, forming the radical Y*.

**via movement of electron pairs**

The **full head arrow** shows the movement of the lone pair of electrons from Z* ion to X in molecule XY, forming the new bond.

At the same time, X-Y bond undergoes _heterolytic fission_, forming the anion Y*.

#### 5.2.3 Polar Reactions and their Mechanisms

LO11.1 (b)ort: interpret, and use the following terminology associated with organic reactions: (u) electrophile (lewis acid), nucleophilic (lewis base) LO11.1(g): apply 11.1 (b) and 11.1 (c) to the understanding of mechanisms in terms of organic structure and bonding LO11.1(h): recognise that the mechanisms of polar reactions involve the flow of electrons from electron-rich to electron-poor sites

In polar reactions, **heterolytic** fission and bond formation occur. **Electron pairs move from electron-rich to electron-poor sites.** Electron-rich sites are termed "**nucleophilic**" and electron-poor sites are termed "**electrophilic**".

The diagram below shows a mechanism of a polar reaction:

OH- ion has a lone pair of electrons and is electron-rich. It donates its lone pair to the electron-poor (electron-deficient) carbon in CH3Br. Hence in this mechanism, OH- acts as the **nucleophile**.

CH3Br contains the partial positively-charged carbon atom which is electron-deficient. Hence CH3Br is acting as the **electrophilic** and its **electrophilic** site is at the 6+ carbon atom.

**Electrophilic**

An electrophile is a species that **accepts an electron pair to form a covalent bond** in a reaction. It is **electron-deficient** due to having:

a positively-charged centre (e.g. H+, NO2+, and carbocations like CH3+), or

an induced or permanent partial positive charge "6+" (e.g. polarised Br2, HBr)

Electrophiles are also known as _lewis acids_.

**Nucleophile**

A nucleophile is a species that **donates an electron pair to form a covalent bond** in a reaction. It is electron-rich and possesses electrons that can be shared, such as:

lone pairs of electrons (H2O, NH3, OH-, CN-, carbanions)

m bond (e.g. ethene, benzene)

Nucleophiles are also known as _lewis bases_.

 Did you know?

The terms _nucleophile_ and _electrophile_ were introduced by British chemist, Christopher Kelk Ingold, in 1933. Derived from the word _philos_ - which means "love" in Greek - _electrophile_ means "electron-loving" and _nucleophile_ means "nucleus-loving"1

Placement of each curly arrow in a mechanism is _very important_: the tail of the first arrow is placed _precisely_ at the **source of the electron pair** i.e. the lone pair on OH- (not at the negative charge, or O or H), while the head of the arrow is placed _exactly_ **at the atom where the new covalent bond forms** i.e. at the carbon atom in CH3Br.

The second curly arrow represents a heterolytic fission. Its tail starts _precisely_ from the C-Br bond which is to be broken (i.e. the **source of electron pair**) and ends with its head pointing _exactly_ at the Br atom, the **atom which receives both electrons**, to form Br- ion.

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:312]

### Factors Affecting Organic Reactivities

_LO111 (c): interpret, and use the following terminology associated with organic reactivities: (i) delocalisation (ii) electronic effect (electron-donating and electron-withdrawing effect) (iii) steric effect (steric hindrance)_

#### 5.3.1 Electronic Effects

Electronic effects influence the distribution of electrons in a particular chemical species and hence its reactivity. They can be electron-withdrawing or electron-donating, depending on the functional groups involved.

The inductive effect arises from the polarisation of electron density in a bond due to the electronegativity of nearby atoms.

Consider chloroeethane, propan-1-ol and ethylamine below. C/, O and N are more electronegative than C, hence they draw electron density away from carbon, resulting in a partial positive charge (6+) on the carbon next to them. This is the inductive effect.

Inductive effect occurs via **q bonds** and decreases along the \(\alpha\) bond as we go further away from the electronegative atoms. Hence in the above molecules, the carbon atoms further away from the one labelled with 6+ also have a slight partial positive charge but which is much weaker due to greater distance from the electronegative atoms.

Since _C/,_ -OH and -NH\({}_{2}\) groups draw electron density away from carbon adjacent to them, they are _inductively electron-withdrawing_ groups.

Alkyl groups, on the other hand, are _inductively_**electron-donating** groups. The reason is due to hyperconjugation which will not be covered here. We shall see examples of how inductive electron-withdrawing and electron-donating effects affect reactivities of organic compounds in subsequent topics.

**Delocalisation**

Delocalisation of electrons occurs when **p orbitals** on 3 or more adjacent atoms overlap, forming a **n electron cloud** in which the electrons from all the overlapping \(p\) orbitals can be found. These electrons are said to be 'delocalised'. This delocalisation of electrons in compounds generally results in stabilisation, which is also known as the resonance stabilisation effect.

Consider the buta-1,3-diene molecule which has alternating single and double bonds:

Figure 16: Inductive effect in chloroeethane, propan-1-ol and ethylamine molecules

## 6 Practical aspects of organic chemistry

### Distinguishing Tests

A distinguishing test is a simple chemical test that aims to confirm the presence of a particular compound, or differentiate between organic compounds, through identification of key functional groups. Such tests require an **observable chemical change** (e.g. colour change, appearance of precipitate, evolution of a gas, etc.) and are usually quick tests carried out in test tubes (unlike in synthesis) **without use of complicated set-up or equipment** (i.e. no reflux or distillation set-ups).

You may be asked to:

* present the sequence of tests. (You may use a flowchart or table.)
* write the procedure with essential details of quantities and conditions for each test.
* In general, all tests are carried out in clean test-tubes using about 1 cm\({}^{3}\) (or 1 cm depth) of the unknown solution or 1 spatula of the unknown solid unless otherwise required.
* Reagents are added dropwise until no further change occurs.
* Heating, if required, is carried out using a water bath/oil bath/sand bath or a heating mantle.
* state the expected observations for both positive and negative tests.
* explain the chemistry underlying each test: type of reaction, identity of species responsible for precipitate/gas/colour change observed, name or structure of functional group/structure of organic product etc.

### Synthesis

An organic synthesis generally involves carrying out a reaction to form the desired organic product with reasonable yield and purity. Various strategies are used in syntheses to obtain high yield and good purity of products. This usually involves careful sequencing of steps, controlled reaction conditions, complex set-up and/or equipment, and often, the investment of time. The product must also be isolated (i.e. separated from the reaction mixture) and purified.

The main stages in an organic synthesis are:

* Carrying out the reaction by heating the reaction mixture under reflux.
* Separation and purification of product by filtration, extraction with separating funnel, distillation or recrystallisation.
* Checking purity of product by determining its melting or boiling point.
* Determining structure of the product via spectroscopy methods e.g. IR, UV, MS, NMR etc. (H3 Chem)

#### 6.2.1 Carrying out the reaction

Compared to inorganic reactions between ionic compounds in solutions, organic reactions are generally slow (as such reactions typically have high activation energy due to breaking covalent bonds) so the organic reaction mixture needs to be heated for some time. You will be learning many reactions that involve heating reagents under reflux in the A-level organic chemistry syllabus.

Heating under reflux means to heat the mixture in a flask so that the solvent boils continually. A condenser is placed vertically in the neck of the flask to condense the solvent vapour. This method allows the temperature of the reaction mixture to be kept at the boiling point of the solvent, while minimizing the loss of solvent, reactants or products due to evaporation.

#### 4.2.2.3 Generic procedure for heating under reflux

1. Measure (mass/volume) of (reactant/reactants) using a (apparatus e.g. measuring cylinder for liquids/micropipette for small volumes <5cm3/electronic mass balance and weighing bottle for solids). Transfer to a 100 cm3/250 cm3 round-bottom flask).

#### 4.2.3 Set up the apparatus as shown in the diagram.

#### 4.2.3 Gently heat the mixture under reflux for (duration in minutes/hours).

As most organic compounds are volatile and flammable, heating is done using a **water/oil/sand bath** or **heating mantle** (instead of a **B**unsen f**i**ame).

For very exothermic reactions (e.g. when diluting a concentrated acid), cooling may be necessary when adding the reagents to each other, e.g. by immersing the reaction flask in an ice water bath. A **dropping funnel** is used if the reactant needs to be added slowly (see diagram below).

# Isomers are molecules with the same molecular formula, but different arrangement of the atoms.

Imagine that you have a model of a molecule. To create an isomer of this molecule, you have to take the model apart, i.e. break the bonds and reconnect the atoms in a different way. If you make a'seemingly different' molecule just by rotating the original model as a whole or rotating about the single bonds, it is **not** an isomer - it is still the same molecule!

For example, Figure 1 shows the same butane molecule, rotated about the centre C-C single bond:

There are many ways a molecule of butane can possibly twist itself, because there is completely **free rotation around all the C-C single bonds**. If you rotate the centre C-C bond through various angles, you obtain different _conformations_ of butane, **not** isomers. At room temperature, a particular molecule will be constantly changing from one conformation to another due to free rotation of its single bonds e.g. pentane:

When drawing isomers, take care not to draw repeats of the same isomer. For example, the following structures all describe the **same** pentane molecule. They are **not isomers**.

Isomers have different IUPAC names, which tells us that they are different molecules.

In this topic, we will focus on the following types of isomerism: constitutional isomerism, _cis-trans_ isomerism and enantiomerism.

## 2 Constitutional (structural) Isomerism

_LO11.2(0): describe constitutional (structural) isomerism_

**Constitutional isomers** are molecules with the **same molecular formula** but **different structural formula**. The physical and chemical properties of constitutional isomers can be very different due to different carbon chains and functional groups. Constitutional isomerism can be categorised into three categories - chain isomerism, positional isomerism and functional group isomerism. Do note that there is no need to memorise these three terms - they are merely guides to help identify constitutional isomerism in compounds.

### Constitutional isomers, with different carbon chains (chain isomers)

These isomers arise because of the possibility of **branching in carbon chains**. For example, pentane, 2-methylbutane and 2,2-dimethylpropane are isomers with the molecular formula C\({}_{5}\)H\({}_{2}\):

### Constitutional isomers with different positions of same functional group (positional isomers)

These isomers arise because of the possibility of placing the **functional group at different carbon atoms** in the carbon chain. For example, pent-1-ene and pent-2-ene are isomers with molecular formula C\({}_{5}\)H\({}_{10}\), where the position of the alkene (C=C) functional group differs.

### Constitutional isomers with different positions of same functional group (positional isomers)

These isomers arise because of the possibility of placing the **functional group at different carbon atoms** in the carbon chain. For example, pent-1-ene and pent-2-ene are isomers with molecular formula C\({}_{5}\)H\({}_{10}\), where the position of the alkene (C=C) functional group differs.

### Constitutional isomers with different positions of same functional group (positional isomers)

These isomers arise because of the possibility of placing the **functional group at different carbon atoms** in the carbon chain. For example, pent-1-ene and pent-2-ene are isomers with molecular formula C\({}_{5}\)H\({}_{10}\), where the position of the alkene (C=C) functional group differs.

### Constitutional isomers with different functional groups (functional group isomers)

These isomers arise when different functional groups consist of the same type of atoms and bonds. For example, aldehydes and ketones can be constitutional isomers because they both consist of one oxygen atom and a C=O bond. Hence propanal and propanone are isomers with molecular formula C3H6O:

### Deducing possible constitutional isomers

_1.01121_: deduce the possible isomers for an organic molecule of known molecular formula

Here is a systematic way to draw all constitutional isomers with a given molecular formula:

1. From the molecular formula, **identify likely functional group(s)** and check if any double/triple bond or ring present - see Section 2.4.1.
2. Using the number of carbon atoms, draw all possible carbon chains: start with straight chain first, then gradually increase the branching to draw all possible branched chains.
3. For each carbon chain from step 2, draw structures with the functional group(s) placed at all possible different positions on the carbon chain.
4. Repeat step 3 with **other** likely functional group(s), until all possibilities are exhausted.

Figure 5: Further examples of functional group isomers. Note: ether consists of a C–O–C group

#### Degrees of unsaturation (Useful info)

We can find out how many double bonds, triple bonds or ring(s) are present in a compound by comparing its **molecular formula** with the **general formula of alkanes** with same number of C atoms.

Recall aliphatic alkanes have the general formula, **C**\({}_{\textbf{n}}\)**H**\({}_{2\textbf{n}2}\). They are saturated and have zero degrees of unsaturation e.g. butane or methylpropane is **C**\({}_{\textbf{n}}\)**H**\({}_{10}\):

If a compound with \(n\) carbon atoms has **fewer H atoms** than \(2n+2\), it must contain double/triple bonds and/or ring(s).

_How to tell how many double/triple bonds or rings?_

* **Every decrease of two H atoms** from the alkane general formula contributes to **1\({}^{\textbf{o}}\) unsaturation**.
* **A 1\({}^{\textbf{o}}\) unsaturation** indicates **either one double bond or one ring** present, hence e.g. **C**\({}_{\textbf{n}}\)**H**\({}_{\textbf{s}}\) can be butene or cyclobutane.

The more degrees of unsaturation, the more possible combinations of double, triple bonds or rings. Double bonds include C=C, C=O, C=N and triple bonds include C=C, C=N so this also provides clues on the likely functional groups present.

_What if the molecule contains atoms other than C and H?_

Halogen atoms do not affect the degree of unsaturation, e.g. **C**\({}_{\textbf{n}}\)**H**\({}_{\textbf{n}}\)**B**r has 0\({}^{\textbf{o}}\) unsaturation, just like **C**\({}_{\textbf{n}}\)**H**\({}_{3}\)**C**\({}_{\textbf{n}}\)**H**\({}_{3}\)**C**\({}_{\textbf{n}}\)**C**\({}_{\textbf{n}

## 3 STEREOISOMSERISM

Stereoisomers are molecules with the same molecular formula and structural formula but different arrangement in space. They contain the same atoms bonded to each other, the bonding and functional groups are identical and differ only in the way the atoms are arranged in 3-D space.

### _Cis-trans_ isomerism

_L011.2(b): describe cis-trans isomerism in alkenes, and explain its origin in terms of restricted rotation due to the presence of \(\pi\) bonds (use of E,Z nomenclature is not required)_

_L011.2(b): identify cis-trans isomerism in a molecule of given structural formula_

For a molecule to exhibit cis-trans isomerism, it must have:

1. a covalent bond with restricted rotation, e.g. presence of \(\pi\) bond or ring structure, AND
2. non-identical groups attached to each end of this bond with restricted rotation

#### 3.1.1 Alkenes

Unlike the case of the C-C single bond which rotates freely at room temperatures, it is not possible to rotate one end of a double bond (e.g. C-C) with respect to the other end, without breaking the \(\pi\) bond:

#### 3.1.3 _Cis-trans_ isomers in nature (Application)

Our sight is dependent on a compound known as retinal. When light enters the eye, retinal molecules bound to opsin proteins in the eye are converted from the 11-_cis_ isomer to the all-_trans_ isomer within a few picoseconds. Once formed, the _trans_-retinal diffuses away from the opsin protein and takes several minutes to be isomerized back to the _cis_-isomer.

### _Emantiomerism_

_LO11.2(d): deduce whether a given molecule is chiral based on the presence or absence of chiral centres and/or a plane of symmetry_

For a molecule to exhibit enantiomerism (i.e. to be **chiral**, pronounced _'kai-raf'_), its mirror image must be non-superimposable onto itself. These two non-superimposable mirror images are called **enantiomers**.

Molecules which exhibit enantiomerism:

1. often contain one or more **chiral centres**
2. **do not possess any internal plane (or centre) of symmetry**

#### _Molecules with one chiral centre_

_LO11.2(c): explain what is meant by a chiral centre_

_LO11.2(d): identify chiral centres in a molecule of given structural formula_

Consider molecule I below. The central carbon atom has four different groups attached to it in a tetrahedral geometry. This carbon atom is referred to as a chiral centre. Any **atom with a tetrahedral geometry around it that is bonded to four different groups** is known as a **chiral centre**. A chiral centre is denoted with an asterisk(*) on the structure.

Molecule II also has a chiral centre attached to the same four groups that are present in molecule I. They have the same structural formula. However, the two molecules differ in the spatial arrangement of these groups around the chiral centre. Because of this different arrangement in space, these **two molecules that are non-superimposable mirror images of each other are called **enantiomers**.

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:335]

#### Molecules with more than one chiral centre

Molecules with more than one chiral centre can also exhibit enantiomerism (i.e. be chiral), if they do not possess any internal plane of symmetry.

Consider molecule III below. It contains two chiral centres. Each chiral centre can have two ways of arranging its four different groups in 3D space, giving two enantiomers. Hence there can be a total of 4 stereoisomers for molecule III, i.e. 2 pairs of enantiomers:

Note that for **A** and **C**, however, the arrangement around one chiral centre (the carbon on the left-hand side) is exactly the same, so **A** and **C** are not enantiomers, just stereoisomers. Similarly, **B** and **D** are not enantiomers. Stereoisomers with at least one chiral centre of the same arrangement are called "diastereomers" (usage of this term is not required for H2 Chemistry). The arrangement around _all_ chiral centres must be different in order for two stereoisomers to be considered enantiomers.

[0.5cm] **Meso compounds**

Consider molecule IV. It also contains two chiral centres. However, each chiral centre is bonded to the same four groups: OH, H, CH\({}_{3}\) and CH(OH)CH\({}_{3}\). Again we may draw 4 possible stereoisomers:

[0.5cm] **Internal plane of symmetry**

Note that **P** and **Q** are equivalent structures, not enantiomers!

**P** has an internal plane of symmetry, so its mirror image is **superimposable onto itself**.

Hence, **P** is **achiral** (i.e. not chiral) even though it has chiral centres, due to its internal plane of symmetry.

A stereoisomer with two or more chiral centres but no optical activity due to an internal plane of symmetry is called a meso compound.

#### 3.2.3 Molecules without chiral centres (other examples of chirality)

Ensantiomerism can occur in molecules without chiral centres. Consider 1,3-dichloropropa-1,2-diene. It has the allene functional group: C=C=C.

Due to the orientation of the overlapping \(p\) orbitals forming the two \(n\) bonds - see Figure 9(a), the H and \(Cl\) atoms at one end do not lie in the same plane as the other end (they lie in perpendicular planes). There is no internal plane of symmetry in the molecule. Its mirror image is non-superimposable onto itself, hence it has two enantiomers, and is chiral.

# Kinetic Resolution (Method of separation of enantiomers)

In kinetic resolution, a mixture of enantiomers is reacted with a chiral reagent. The chiral reagent is chosen such that it reacts quickly with one enantiomer but reacts very slowly with the other enantiomer.

For example, to separate an enantiomer of mandelic acid from its racemic mixture, we add a limited amount of a pure sample of (-)-menthol (chiral reagent). Only one enantiomer of mandelic acid reacts with the (-)-menthol to produce an ester. The other enantiomer of mandelic acid, due to difference in rate of reaction, does not form an ester with the (-)-menthol.

The ester product now has different physical and chemical properties with the unreacted mandelic acid and can be easily separated through conventional separation techniques. The desired enantiomer is then recovered by hydrolysing the ester.

#### Counting the total number of stereoisomers

_1011.2(1): deduce the possible isomers for an organic molecule of known molecular formula_

_1011.2(0): identify chiral centres and/or cis-trans isomerism in a molecule of given structural formula_

Stereoisomers include _both cis-trans_ isomers and enantiomers.

If a molecule has \(m\) chiral centres and \(n\) double bonds that can give rise to _cis-trans_ isomers, the maximum number of stereoisomers it can have = 2\({}^{mn}\).

The _actual_ number of stereoisomers is determined by considering any **internal plane of symmetry** in the possible structures.

For example, in the methoprene molecule below, there is only one chiral centre, and both C=C double bonds can give rise to _cis-trans_ isomerism. As such, the maximum number of possible stereoisomers for methoprene is 2\({}^{(1-2)}\) = 8. There is no internal plane of symmetry, so the actual total number is 8.

### Cycloalkanes

To name a cycloalkane, add _"cyclo-"_ as a prefix in front of the parent name of the corresponding alkane.

#### Examples

Substituted cycloalkanes are named by rules similar to those used for open-chain alkanes.

#### Examples

If there is just one substituent, no numbering is needed.

#### Exercise 2.1

(a) Write the general formula of aliphatic alkanes and cycloalkanes.

(b) Which class of compounds is isomeric with cycloalkanes?

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:348]

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:349]

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:350]

The boiling point of alkanes increases regularly with increasing number of carbon atoms in the chain.

As the number of carbon atoms increases, the **number of electrons in the molecule increases**, hence **size of the electron cloud increases** leading to **stronger dispersion forces** between the molecules. Thus, **more energy is required to overcome** the stronger dispersion forces between the molecules.

**Branched-chain alkanes have lower boiling points than the straight-chain alkanes with the same number of carbon atoms. Recall what you have learned in Topic 2 Chemical Bonding that explains this observation.**

### Melting point

**The increase in melting point of alkanes is not as regular as that observed for their boiling points; this is because the dispersion forces between the molecules in a crystal depend not only on the size of the molecules, but also on the arrangement of molecules in a solid crystal lattice. The table below illustrates the effect of structure on the melting point of four different C**\({}_{6}\)H**\({}_{4}\) **isomers.**

**Figure 3.** _Boiling and melting points of C**\({}_{6}\)H**\({}_{4}\) **isomers**

### Solubility

In order for dissolution to occur, the solute molecules and the solvent molecules should have favourable intermolecular forces of attraction.

Alkanes can form favourable dispersion forces with non-polar solvents such as benzene and tetrachloromethane. Hence they are soluble in non-polar solvents.

Alkanes can only form permanent dipole-induced dipole intermolecular forces with water, which are much weaker than the hydrogen bonding between water molecules themselves (as well as the dispersion forces between alkane molecules). Hence they are insoluble in water.

### Density

Liquid alkanes are less dense than water and form an immiscible layer above water.

Their densities increase slightly with increasing number of carbon atoms present. This is because the increase in the strength of dispersion forces causes the alkane molecules to attract more closely together, resulting in a slightly smaller volume of the liquid. Since p = m/V, with a larger relative molecular mass, the density of the liquid increases.

### Viscosity

Viscosity describes a fluid's internal resistance to flow and may be thought of as a measure of fluid friction. The viscosity of liquid alkanes increases with increasing number of carbon atoms present as the dispersion forces between the molecules increases. In addition, longer-chain alkanes have higher viscosity as the long molecules tend to "tangle up" with one another.

[FIGURE:S4.F1][EN

## 5 Chemical properties

_1011.3(a): explain the general unrecativity of alkanes, including towards polar reagents_

The only two types of bonds contained in alkanes, C-C and C-H, are strong and non-polar. The C-C and C-H bonds are essentially non-polar due to similarity in electronegativities of the C and H atoms. Hence, alkane molecules do not contain any significant amount of positive or negative charge, and are unreactive towards polar reagents.

The net result is that alkanes have a fairly restricted set of reactions, namely: combustion and free radical substitution.

### Combustion of alkanes

_LO11.3(b): describe the chemistry of alkanes as exemplified by the following reactions of ethane: (i) combustion_

Alkanes react with excess oxygen (complete combustion) to give carbon dioxide and water. The reaction is a highly exothermic process.

Although the combustion of alkanes is highly exothermic, it also has a high activation energy. For example, a mixture of methane and oxygen is stable unless ignited by a spark. The reaction, once started, accelerates explosively due to large amount of heat liberated.

Alkanes only burn in the gaseous state. Liquid and solid alkanes must be vapourised before they will burn.

When they are burnt in a limited supply of oxygen (incomplete combustion), carbon (soot) and carbon monoxide are also formed and these have adverse environmental consequences.

_Example_

The complete combustion of alkanes to produce carbon dioxide and water is an important exothermic reaction. Which line on the graph shows the relationship between the number of carbon atoms in the alkane and the number of moles of oxygen gas needed for complete combustion of the alkane?

_[12003/1/23]_

### Free radical substitution

_1011.3(b): describe the chemistry of alkanes as exemplified by the following reactions of ethane: (ii) free-radical substitution by chlorine and by bromine_

Alkanes react with halogens (CI\({}_{2}\) and Br\({}_{2}\)) in the presence of ultraviolet light or heat to form halogenoalkanes (or alkyl halides). This type of reaction is known as free radical substitution, an example of non-polar reactions.

When initiated (started off) by the absorption of UV light or sunlight, the reaction is called a photochemical reaction. Nevertheless, remember that the free radical substitution can also be initiated if sufficient heat is supplied: In the reaction; one or more of the hydrogen atoms in the alkane can be substituted by the halogen atom(s).

#### 5.2.1 Mechanism of the free radical substitution of methane by chlorine

_1011.3(c): describe the mechanism of free-radical substitution with particular reference to the initiation, propagation and termination reactions_

#### 5.2.2 The CH-CI bond

The CH-CI bond is **homolytically** broken to give chlorine free radicals (CI\({}_{*}\)). The energy required comes from the light absorbed or the heat supplied.

#### 5.2.3 The energy is insufficient to break the stronger C-H bond.

(From the Data Booklet, Bond Energy (CI\({}_{-}\)CI) = 242 kJ mol\({}^{-1}\); Bond Energy (C\({}_{-}\)H) = 410 kJ mol\({}^{-1}\))

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:355]

#### Formation of by-products

Halogenation of alkanes via free radical substitution may seem like a good method of obtaining halogenalkanes at first, but in reality, the extent and the position of substitution is difficult to control.

A free radical is highly reactive and can react with almost any C-H bond present in the reaction mixture. In the presence of excess halogen, further substitutions of the product may occur resulting in a mixture of multi-substituted halogenoalkanes.

For example, chloromethane formed may further react with a chlorine radical to form dichloromethane:

Similarly, CH\({}_{2}\)_CI\({}_{2}\) can undergo further chlorination to give CH\({}_{3}\) and CCl\({}_{4}\).

#### Ratios of products formed when an alkane has non-equivalent hydrogen atoms

As all hydrogen atoms are susceptible to substitution, when an alkane contains 3 or more carbon atoms, isomeric products are formed depending on which H atom is substituted. The proportion of the isomers depends on the probability of the intermediates formed and the relative stability of the intermediates.

Let's look at the chlorination of propane: two monochrominated products are possible and their experimental yields are shown in the equation below. How can we explain their ratios?

Before we examine their ratios, let's look at the classification of hydrogen atoms in alkanes and the stability of alkyl radicals.

#### 5.2.4 Reactivity of halogens with alkanes

The reactivity of halogens in the free radical substitution of alkanes decreases in the following order: \(F_{2}>Cl_{2}>Br_{2}>I_{2}\).

From the table, the trend in reactivity matches the trend in \(\Delta H_{n}\), which is calculated as the overall enthalpy change for both propagation steps. Recall Topic 5 Chemical Energetics for the calculation of \(\Delta H\), by the use of bond energies of the bonds broken and formed.

The C-H bond is broken in the first propagation step (Step 1), whereas H-X is formed. The X-X bond is broken in the second propagation step (Step 2) and C-X bond is formed.

\begin{tabular}{l l l l} Step 1: & CH\({}_{3}\)-H + X\(\bullet\) & \(\bullet\)CH\({}_{3}\) + H-X & \(\Delta H_{1}=\) BE(C-H) - BE(H-X) \\ Step 2: & \(\bullet\)CH\({}_{3}\) + X-X \(\rightarrow\) CH\({}_{3}\)-X + X\(\bullet\) & \(\Delta H_{2}=\) BE(X-X) - BE(C-X) \\ Overall reaction: & CH\({}_{4}\) + X\({}_{2}\) \(\rightarrow\) CH\({}_{3}\)X + HX & \(\Delta H_{t}=\Delta H_{1}+\Delta H_{2}\) \\ \end{tabular}

**Exercise 5.7 (Worked Example)**

Chloroalkanes and bromoalkanes can be made by the reaction of the corresponding halogen with alkanes, for example:

\(C_{2}H_{6}+C_{2}\rightarrowC_{2}H_{3}Cl+HCl\)

## 6 AlkANES AS FUELS

Alkanes are found in crude oil and their main use is as fuels. A huge fraction of the energy we use comes from the combustion of alkanes. The gas in cookers, the petrol in cars, aviation fuel and diesel oil for powering ships and electric generators are all mixtures of alkanes.

### Processing of crude oil

Fractional distillation (Background info)

Crude oil is a mixture of many hundreds of hydrocarbons. It also contains some compounds containing sulfur and nitrogen. It is an important source of aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons.

The first stage in the processing of crude oil is fractional distillation, carried out at atmospheric pressure.

#### 6.3.3 Catalytic converter

A catalytic converter removes pollutant gases from the exhaust by oxidising or reducing them. The exhaust gases pass through a converter containing an alloy of platinum or rhodium. The mechanism of the reaction is that of a heterogeneous catalyst reaction (recall Topic 6 Reaction Kinetics for the mechanism). The harmful gases are adsorbed onto the surface on the metals, go through a reaction and then the harmless gas products desorb from the surface.

Three main pollutants (CO, NOx and unburnt hydrocarbons) are removed from exhaust gases by the catalytic converter. According to the following equations, these harmful gases are converted into less harmful CO\({}_{2}\), N\({}_{2}\) and water vapour.

However, catalytic converters only work with unleaded petrol because lead 'poisons' the catalyst in the converter (i.e. destroy their catalytic action).

Figure 5: Expanded view of a catalytic converter

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:368]

Many chemical compounds present in Earth's atmosphere behave as 'greenhouse gases'. These are gases which allow direct sunlight (relative shortwave energy) to reach the Earth's surface unobstructed. As the shortwave energy (that is in the visible and ultraviolet portion of the spectra) heats the surface, longer-wave (infrared) energy (heat) is re-radiated to the atmosphere. Greenhouse gases absorb this energy, thereby allowing less heat to escape back to space, and 'trapping' it in the lower atmosphere.

Many greenhouse gases occur naturally in the atmosphere, such as **carbon dioxide**, methane, water vapour, and nitrous oxide, while others are synthetic. Those that are man-made include the chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) and perfluorocarbons (PFCs), as well as sulfur hexafluoride (SF\({}_{6}\)). Atmospheric concentrations of both the natural and man-made gases have been rising over the last few centuries due to the industrial revolution. As the global population has increased and our reliance on fossil fuels (such as coal, oil and natural gas) has been firmly solidified, so emissions of these gases have risen. While gases such as carbon dioxide occur naturally in the atmosphere, through our interference with the carbon cycle (through burning forest lands, or mining and burning coal), we artificially move carbon from solid storage to its gaseous state, thereby increasing atmospheric concentrations, making carbon dioxide a major greenhouse gas.

### _Cis-trans_ isomerism in alkenes

In Topic 9 isomerism, you have learnt that _cis-trans_ isomerism arises in alkenes due to **restricted rotation about the C=C bond** and **2** different groups attached to each C=C carbon atom.

But-2-ene can exist as _cis_-but-2-ene and _trans_-but-2-ene as shown below. _Cis_-but-2-ene has the same groups on the **same side of the double bond**, whereas _trans_-but-2-ene has the same groups on the **opposite sides of the double bond**.

_Cis-trans_ isomerism cannot exist if any one of the C=C carbons carries two identical groups.

2-methylropene is an example of a constitutional isomer of _cis_-but-2-ene and _trans_-but-2-ene.

Cycloalkenes with **up to 7 carbon atoms** exist only as the "_cis_ isomers". Cycloalkenes with **8 or more carbon atoms** can exist as _cis-trans_ isomers.

Draw the _cis-trans_ isomers of (_Cl_)CH+C(CH_)Br.

**Answer:**

The shape and bond angles of 120\({}^{\circ}\) of sp\({}^{2}\) hybridised carbon atoms of alkene must be clearly shown in your drawing. In your syllabus, there is no need to assign which is the cis or trans isomer for alkenes with no same groups on each C of C=C.

###### Abstract

In order for the intermolecular forces of attraction to work well in a solid, the molecules must be able to pack together efficiently in the solid state.

The _trans_ isomer pack better than the _cis_ isomer due to the higher symmetry of the trans isomer. The "U" shape of the _cis_ isomer does not pack well compared to the straighter shape of the _trans_ isomer.

The better packing of the _trans_ isomer in the solid state means that the dispersion forces work more effectively in holding the molecules together when compared to the _cis_ isomer.

Hence more energy is required to overcome the forces of attraction between _trans_ isomer, leading to a higher melting point.

### _Solubility_

In order for dissolution to occur, the solute molecules and the solvent molecules should have favourable intermolecular forces of attraction.

Non-substituted alkenes can form favourable dispersion forces with non-polar solvents such as benzene and tetrachloromethane. Hence they are soluble in non-polar solvents.

Non-substituted alkenes can only form permanent dipole-induced dipole intermolecular forces with water, which are much weaker than the hydrogen bonding between water molecules themselves (as well as the dispersion forces between non-substituted alkene molecules). Hence they are insoluble in water.

## 1 Introduction

In order for the intermolecular forces of attraction to work well in a solid, the molecules must be able to pack together efficiently in the solid state.

* The _trans_ isomer pack better than the _cis_ isomer due to the higher symmetry of the trans isomer. The "U" shape of the _cis_ isomer does not pack well compared to the straighter shape of the _trans_ isomer.
* The better packing of the _trans_ isomer in the solid state means that the dispersion forces work more effectively in holding the molecules together when compared to the _cis_ isomer.
* Hence more energy is required to overcome the forces of attraction between _trans_ isomer, leading to a higher melting point.

### _Solubility_

In order for dissolution to occur, the solute molecules and the solvent molecules should have favourable intermolecular forces of attraction.

Non-substituted alkenes can form favourable dispersion forces with non-polar solvents such as benzene and tetrachloromethane. Hence they are soluble in non-polar solvents.

Non-substituted alkenes can only form permanent dipole-induced dipole intermolecular forces with water, which are much weaker than the hydrogen bonding between water molecules themselves (as well as the dispersion forces between non-substituted alkene molecules). Hence they are insoluble in water.

### Density

Liquid alkenes are less dense than water and form an immiscible layer above water.

Their densities increase slightly with increasing number of carbon atoms present. This is because the increase in the strength of intermolecular dispersion forces causes the alkene molecules to attract more closely together, resulting in a slightly smaller volume of the liquid. Since \(p=m/V\), with a larger relative molecular mass, the density of the liquid increases.

### Viscosity

The viscosity of liquid alkenes increases with increasing number of carbon atoms present as the strength of dispersion forces between the molecules increases. In addition, straight-chain alkenes have higher viscosity as compared to branched alkenes.

## 3 Preparation of alkenes

Alkenes can be prepared by the following reactions:

* Elimination of hydrogen halide from halogenalkanes (to be covered in Topic 15 Halogen Derivatives)
* Dehydration of alcohol (to be covered in Topic 16 Hydroxy Compounds)

## 4 Reactions of alkenes

### Reactivity of alkenes towards electrophilic reagents

_1011.3(d): explain the general reactivity of alkenes towards electrophilic reagents/electrophile_

Even though C=C bond is stronger than C-C bond, alkenes are more reactive than alkanes. This is due to the electron-rich C=C. The \(\pi\) bond (electron cloud), which lies on the surface of the molecules, attracts electrophiles.

During reaction, the weaker \(\pi\) bond is broken instead of the \(\alpha\) bond in the C=C bond. In place, two strong bonds (C-A and C-B) are formed in the product, leaving the carbon atoms joined by a single bond. This typical reaction of alkenes is known as electrophilic addition.

The overall reaction for electrophilic addition of alkenes can be represented as:

### Electrophilic addition

#### General mechanism of electrophilic addition

Step 1: Initial attack by the \(\pi\) electrons of the C=C bond on the electrophile, forming a positively-charged carbonocation intermediate.

Step 2: Subsequent attack of the unstable carbocation intermediate by nucleophilic to generate a stable product.

#### Carbocation intermediate

In electrophilic addition to alkenes, the carbocation is an important intermediate. Before studying the reactions of alkenes, we need to learn more about the structure and factors affecting the stability of carbocations.

The central carbon atom is positively charged and \(sp^{2}\) hybridised. The 3 substituents are arranged in a trigonal planar geometry around the central carbon atom. As the carbon atom has lost an electron, the unhybridised \(p\) orbital is empty.

Due to the positive charge on the carbon atom, the carbon atom is electron-deficient and strongly attracts any **nucleophile** towards it. And because the geometry around the carbon atom is **planar**, the nucleophiles may **attack from either side of the plane**.

#### Stability

In general, organic species with a charge on it are less stable. Therefore, anything that disperses the charge would stabilise the species as a whole. Conversely, anything that intensifies the charge on it would destabilise it.

As mentioned earlier, the central carbon atom of the carbocation is positively charged. The 3 substituents bonded to it can affect the stability of the carbocation as a whole depending on whether they are electron donating or electron withdrawing.

Alkyl groups e.g. methyl (-CHj) are considered electron donating groups. Therefore, the more alkyl substituents the carbocation has, the more stable it would be, as the electron donating groups disperse the positive charge on the central carbon atom.

Conversely, electron withdrawing substituents like halogens would destabilise the carbocation as they **intensity** the positive charge on the central carbon atom.

#### 4.1.3 Electrophilic addition of hydrogen halides (H-X)

_1011.3(e)(part): describe the chemistry of alkenes as exemplified, where relevant, by the following reactions of ethene: (1) electrophilic addition of water/steam, hydrogen halides and halogens_

The general reaction mechanism of electrophilic addition applied to the reaction between ethene and HBr is illustrated as follows:

* This is the **rate-determining step** (involves breaking of the \(\pi\) bond).
* As the polar HBr molecule approaches the \(\pi\) electron cloud of ethene in the correct orientation, the high electron density of the \(\pi\) electron cloud "attacks" the electron deficient H atom on the HBr molecule. (*Note: arrow must show the direction of electron movement.)
* The \(\pi\) bond in the C=C bond breaks, forming a new C-H bond. The H-Br bond undergoes heterolytic fission producing a carbocation intermediate and a bromide ion.

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:383]

### Addition to an unsymmetrical alkene

_1011.3(g): apply Markovinkov's rule to the addition of hydrogen halides to unsymmetrical alkenes and explain the composition of products in terms of the stability of carbocation intermediates_

When a hydrogen halide adds across the double bond of an unsymmetrical alkene, there are two possible products. One of them is preferred over the other. Why is this so?

To explain this observation, we need to look at the 2 possible intermediates that generate each product.

### Markovinkov's rule

The Markovinkov's rule states that in the addition of HX to an alkene, the H atom adds to the C atom of the double bond that holds the greater number of H atoms. Reactions that follow this rule are said to follow Markovinkov orientation and give the Markovinkov product.

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:385]

### Formation of a racemic mixture

When a hydrogen halide adds across the double bond of an alkene that produces an intermediate carbocation with 3 different groups attached to it, it produces equal amounts of 2 enantiomers, forming a racemic mixture.

This occurs because the geometry about the positively charged carbon is planar, hence it has equal chances of being attacked from the top or bottom by the bromide ion in the second step, thereby producing the two enantiomers in equimolar ratio.

#### 4.1.4 Electrophilic addition of halogens (X\({}_{2}\))

_1011.3(e)(part): describe the chemistry of alkenes as exemplified, where relevant, by the following reactions of ethene: (i) electrophilic addition of water/steem, hydrogen halides and halogens 1011.3(f): describe the mechanism of electrophilic addition in alkenes, using bromine/ethene as an example_

Alkenes also readily react with chlorine or bromine to form halogenalkanes with two atoms of halogens attached to adjacent carbon atoms. The reaction with fluorine is very violent while iodine does not react with most alkenes.

Electrophilic addition of halogens can occur in the presence of UV light but the reaction is usually carried out in the absence of UV light to prevent free radical substitution of the alkyl substituents on the alkene or of the product.

For the mechanism, we will use the electrophilic addition of Br\({}_{2}\) to ethene as an example. The mechanism takes place in two steps.

* As the non-polar Br\({}_{2}\) molecule approaches the \(\pi\) electron cloud of ethene; the high electron density of the \(\pi\) electron cloud polarises the electron cloud of the Br\({}_{2}\) molecule.
* The Br-Br bond undergoes heterolytic fission resulting in a bromide anion with the other bromine atom bonded to the alkene to form a positively charged carbocation intermediate.
* This is the rate-determining step as it involves breaking the \(\pi\) bond in ethene and Br-Br bond.

* In this step, the bromide anion acts as a nucleophilic to attack the carbocation intermediate to form the product, 1,2-dibromoethane.
* This step is fast as it involves the reaction between oppositely charged species. The mutual electrostatic attraction results in the easy formation of the stable 1,2-dibromoethane.

* Although the mechanism Section 4.1.4 is reasonable and follows that of the alkene reaction with hydrogen halides, studies have shown that it is not completely consistent with some observations.

* For instance, it was observed in the reaction of bromine with cyclopentene, that only the _trans_ product is formed rather than an expected mixture of _cis_ and _trans_ products if a planar carbocation intermediate was involved.

Hence, it was proposed that the intermediate in the mechanism was a cyclic three-membered bromonium ion during electrophilic addition of bromine on alkene.

Alkenes react with bromine water to form bromoalcohol (or bromohydrin) as the major product instead of the dibromo compound.

This is because the carbocation intermediate is susceptible to attack by any nucleophile present in the reaction mixture.

### Electrophilic addition of water/steam mechanism:

Using ethene as an example, the mechanism for the acid-catalysed hydration of ethene is as follows:

#### Step 1

Protonation of the double bond to form a carbocation.

#### Step 2

Nucleophilic attack by "OSO\({}_{3}\)H on carbocation to produce a hydrogensulfate.

The hydrogensulfate is then added to cold water. Water acts as a nucleophile to attack the hydrogensulfate. The -OSO\({}_{3}\)H group is substituted with -OH group, producing the alcohol and regenerating the sulfuric acid catalyst.

#### 1.1.1 Benzene

Benzene has a molecular formula of C6H6. The benzene ring is often represented using the skeletal formula as shown below.

#### 1.1.2 Mono-substituted benzenes

When one H atom of benzene is replaced by another atom or group of atoms comprising 6 carbon atoms or less, the benzene ring is considered the **parent** and a suffix - **benzene** is employed in naming.

Some mono-substituted benzenes are more common such that their conventional names are used instead.

10 11.1(f)port: predicting shapes of, and bond angles in, molecules analogous to benzene

In benzene, each carbon is bonded to two other carbons and one hydrogen. The geometry around each carbon atom in benzene is trigonal planar with C-C-C bond angle of 120\({}^{\circ}\). Recall from Topic 2 Chemical Bonding where you learnt about the hybridisation of atomic orbitals. Each carbon atom in benzene is \(sp^{2}\)**hybridised**. The mixing of one \(s\) orbital and two \(p\) orbitals gives three \(sp^{2}\) hybrid orbitals oriented at 120\({}^{\circ}\) to one another for each carbon atom. One \(p\) orbital remains unhybridised, and this \(p\) orbital is arranged perpendicular to the three \(sp^{2}\) hybrid orbitals as shown in Figure 3.

Figure 4: \(\alpha\) bonds between two carbon atoms and between carbon and hydrogen atoms in benzene.

Figure 3: _Arrangement of sp\({}^{2}\) hybrid orbitals and unhybridised \(p\) orbital around each carbon in benzene._The remaining unhybridised \(p\) orbitals of the six carbon atoms are all parallel to one another due to the planarity of the benzene molecule, These \(p\) orbitals could overlap side-on as shown in Figure 5a to produce three \(\pi\) bonds between atoms 1 and 2, 3 and 4 and 5 and 6 of the ring, or just as likely, overlap as shown in Figure 5b to produce \(\pi\) bonds between atoms 2 and 3, 4 and 5 and 6 and 1 of the ring. In reality, **all six unhybridised \(p\) orbitals overlap side-on with each other equally** to produce two continuous rings of \(\pi\) electrons above and below the plane of the benzene ring, known as the **delocalised \(\pi\) electron cloud**, as shown in Figure 5c. The six electrons found in this delocalised \(\pi\) electron cloud are free to move throughout the entire \(\pi\) electron cloud, so the electrons are said to be delocalised.

### Implications of \(\pi\) electron cloud delocalisation

The delocalised \(\pi\) electron cloud is responsible for the following physical and chemical properties of benzene;

It causes all carbon-carbon bond lengths to be equal, creating a planar, regular hexagonal shape.

It prevents benzene from undergoing any of the typical addition reactions that alkenes show.

### Carbon-carbon bond lengths and bond energies in benzene

Instead of three C=C double bonds and three C-C single bonds, X-ray measurements showed that all six carbon-carbon bonds of benzene are identical in length and intermediate between a C-C single bond length and a C=C double bond length. The carbon-carbon bond energy in benzene is also between that of a C-C single bond and a C=C double bond. (Note: When quoting the carbon-carbon

# Difference in reactivities of benzene versus alkenes

1011.3(h): explain, in terms of delocalisation of \(n\) electrons, the difference between benzene and alkene: (i) reactivity towards electrophiles, (ii) preference of benzene to undergo substitution rather than addition reaction

Similar to electron-rich alkenes, the \(n\) electron cloud in benzene attracts electrophiles (electron-deficient species). However, the **delocalisation of electrons in the \(n\) electron cloud in benzene** results in **extra stability** of benzene (which is also known as resonance-stabilisation). As a result, the \(n\) electron cloud in benzene is less susceptible to attack by electrophiles compared to the C=C double bonds in alkenes. Hence, benzene requires stronger electrophiles to react as compared to alkenes. In addition, **benzene undergoes electrophilic substitution rather than electrophilic addition reactions** because electrophilic addition destroys the delocalised \(n\) electron cloud and this requires a significant amount of energy, which is highly unfavourable. Benzene preferentially undergoes electrophilic substitution reactions (where one or more hydrogen atoms is substituted by electrophiles) which preserve its aromaticity.

The following shows an example of the electrophilic addition in alkenes, and the electrophilic substitution in arenes. While electrophilic addition of cyclohexene using liquid bromine can be carried out at room temperature and without a catalyst, electrophilic substitution of benzene with liquid bromine requires warming, and FeBr\({}_{3}\) as a Lewis acid catalyst to generate strong electrophile Br\({}^{+}\) (to be discussed in Section 4.2).

The stabilisation energy of benzene (Application example)We can get a quantitative idea of benzene's stability from the comparison of various enthalpy change of hydrogenation. The experimentally determined enthalpy change of hydrogenation of cyclohexa-1,4-diene is -118 kJ mol\({}^{-1}\). The experimentally determined enthalpy change of hydrogenation of cyclohexa-1,4-diene is -232 kJ mol\({}^{-1}\), which is approximately twice of the experimentally determined enthalpy change of hydrogenation of cyclohexene. Hence the theoretical prediction for benzene's enthalpy change of hydrogenation, based on the model of 3 alternating C-C and C=C bonds (i.e. hypothetical cyclohexatriene), is -354 kJ mol\({}^{-1}\) (-118 kJ mol\({}^{-1}\) x 3). However, the experimentally determined enthalpy change of hydrogenation of benzene was found to be -205 kJ mol\({}^{-1}\). Hence, benzene is estimated to be more stable than the hypothetical cyclohexatriene by about \(354-205=149\) kJ mol\({}^{-1}\). The difference of 149 kJ mol\({}^{-1}\) is known as the stabilisation energy.

* Unlike in alkenes where an anion 'adds on' to the carbocation intermediate, the proton i.e. H' on the carbon-1 of the benzene intermediate is removed by a Bronsted base, so as to reform the delocalised \(\pi\) system. A stable substitution product results, and aromaticity is restored.

### **Substituent effect on the reactivity of the benzene ring towards electrophilic substitution**

_1011.1(c)part: interpret, and use the following terminology associated with organic recctivities: (i) delocalisation (ii) electronic effect (electron-donating and electron-withdrawing effect)_

Electron-donating groups increase the electron density in the benzene ring. On the other hand, electron-withdrawing groups decrease the electron density in the benzene ring

From Topic 8 Introduction to Organic Chemistry, electron-donating and electron-withdrawing effects can occur through:

(i) \(\alpha\) bonds via inductive effect

(ii) \(\alpha\) electron cloud via delocalisation

Inductive effect

The inductive effect arises from the polarisation of electron density in a bond due to the electronegativity of nearby atoms.

Electron-withdrawing groups via inductive effect

These groups, e.g. -OH, -NH2, -Cl, inductively withdraw electron density from the benzene ring via the \(\alpha\) bond, because O, N and the halogens are more electronegative than the C atom in the benzene ring:

Other examples include: -OR, -NHR, -NR2, -CHO, -COR, -CO2H, -CO2R, -NO2, and -CN etc.

Electron-donating groups via inductive effect

Alkyl groups (e.g. -CH3, -CH3CH3) inductively donate electron density into the benzene ring via the \(\alpha\) bond. The reason is due to hyperconjugation which will not be covered here.

Delocalisation

Delocalisation occurs when \(p\) orbitals on 3 or more adjacent atoms overlap, forming a \(n\) electron cloud. For substituents with \(\alpha\)\(p\) orbital on the atom joined to the benzene ring, the \(p\) orbital can overlap with the \(\pi\) electron cloud of the ring.

Electron-donating groups via delocalisation

These groups have a **lone pair of electrons in the \(p\) orbital** of the atom directly joined to the benzene ring, and can therefore **donate the lone pair of electrons into the benzene ring** via delocalisation. Examples include: -OH, -QR, -NH2, -NR2, -Cl, -Br, and -I.

in phenol below, the \(p\) orbital on the O atom joined to the benzene ring can overlap with the \(\pi\) electron cloud of the ring, enabling the lone pair of electrons on O to be donated into the \(\pi\) system.

#### 5.6.1 Free Radical Substitution

_LO11.3(I): predict whether halogenation will occur in the side-chain or aromatic nucleus in crenes depending on reaction conditions_

During the side-chain halogenation, methylbenzene and other alkylbenzenes undergo free-radical substitution with chlorine or bromine in the presence of UV light or heat. The alkyl side chain reacts like an alkane (Recall from Topic 10 Alkanes).

More than one chlorine or bromine atom can be incorporated onto the alkyl side chain if excess \(Cl_{2}(\text{g})\) or Br\({}_{2}(I)\) is used. For example:

## 6 Distinguishing tests

Bromine in tetrachloromethane can be used as a distinguishing test to differentiate between alkenes and arenes. For example: 1-methylcyclohexene and benzene.

**Procedure for distinguishing test between 1-methylcyclohexene and benzene as example**

1. Add bromine in tetrachloromethane dropwise with shaking to 1 cm\({}^{3}\) of each compound in separate test tubes.

**Observations**

 Benzene: Br\({}_{2}\) in CCl\({}_{4}\) remains reddish-brown

1-methylcyclohexene: Reddish-brown Br\({}_{2}\) in CCl\({}_{4}\) decolourises

**Note**

* Bromine in tetrachloromethane is usually employed instead of liquid bromine because it is easier to handle than liquid bromine which is a volatile liquid at rtp that constantly gives rise to toxic bromine gas.
* In the presence of light, both electrophilic addition and free radical substitution occur to 1-methylcyclohexene. However, free radical substitution is **not** usually used as a distinguishing test.

Aqueous bromine can also be used as a **distinguishing test to differentiate between alkenes and arenes**. For example: 1-methylcyclohexene and benzene.

**Procedure for distinguishing test between 1-methylcyclohexene and benzene as example**

1. Add aqueous bromine dropwise with shaking to 1 cm\({}^{3}\) of each compound in separate test tubes.

**Observations**

 Benzene: Br\({}_{2}\)(aq) remains yellow-orange

1-methylcyclohexene: Yellow-orange Br\({}_{2}\)(aq) decolourises

**Note:**

The difference between aqueous bromine and bromine in tetrachloromethane is that in the presence of light, free radical substitution does not occur with the use of aqueous bromine.

Heating with aqueous potassium manganate(VII) and dilute H\({}_{2}\)SO\({}_{4}\) can be used as a **distinguishing test to differentiate between certain alkenes and certain alkylbenzes, and between certain alkylbenzes**. For example: hexene and methylbenzene, and methylbenzene and _tert_-butylbenzene.

Consider the nitration of phenol in the following example. The carbocation intermediates formed from 2- and 4-substitution are more stable than the intermediate formed from 3-substitution. This is because carbocation intermediates formed from 2- and 4-substitution each have resonance structures where the positive charge is dispersed by the OH substituent via delocalisation of lone pair of electrons from O atom.

Consider the nitration of chlorobenzene in the following example. The carbocation intermediates formed from 2- and 4-substitution are more stabilised than the intermediate formed from 3-substitution. This is because carbocation intermediates formed from 2- and 4-substitution each have resonance structures where the positive charge is dispersed by the CI substituent via delocalisation of lone pair of electrons from _CI_ atom.

## 3 Solubility equilibria and solubility product, \(K_{\text{sp}}\)

_10 10.10.2(a): show understanding of, and apply, the concept of solubility product, \(K_{\text{sp}}\)_

When increasing quantities of a sparingly soluble ionic salt are added to water, a saturated solution will eventually be formed. Upon addition of excess solute, a dynamic **equilibrium** is set up, in which there is simultaneous dissolution of the excess undissolved solute and precipitation of the solute from the ions in the solution. These two processes take place at the same rate. Ions in the saturated solution are at equilibrium with the excess undissolved solute:

\[\text{MX(s)}\rightleftharpoons\text{M}^{\ast}\text{(aq)}+X^{\ast}\text{(aq)}\]

Now, consider a mixture containing a saturated aqueous solution of silver chloride and some undissolved silver chloride. The system is at **equilibrium**:

\[\text{AgCl}(s)\rightleftharpoons\text{Ag}^{\ast}\text{(aq)}+Cl(\text{aq)}\]

We can write:

\[\text{HX}_{\text{sp}}\]

However, [AgCl] represents the 'concentration' of a pure solid, and is therefore a constant.

\[\text{Therefore,}\]

\[\text{$K_{\text{sp}}$}\times\text{[AgCl]}=\text{[Ag}^{\ast}][Cl^{\ast}]\]

\[\text{$K_{\text{sp}}$}\Rightarrow\text{[Ag}^{\ast}][Cl^{\ast}]\]

The new constant, \(K_{\text{sp}}\), is called the solubility product of AgCl.

\[\text{Units of $K_{\text{sp}}$}\text{of $AgCl$:mol^{2}\,dm^{-6}}\]

DEFINITION

**Solubility product, \(K_{\text{sp}}\), of a sparingly soluble salt** is the product of the molar concentrations of the constituent ions in a **saturated solution**, raised to the appropriate powers at a given temperature.

_Note_: Appropriate power refers to the stoichiometric coefficient of the substance in the balanced equation for the reaction.

* The concept of solubility product is valid only for sparingly soluble salts. For soluble salts such as NaCl, CuSO\({}_{4}\) and AgNO\({}_{3}\), the use of the \(K_{\text{sp}}\) concept is inappropriate.
* As such, for sparingly soluble salts, the numerical value of \(K_{\text{sp}}\) is always very small, rarely exceeding \(10^{-4}\) and can be as low as \(10^{-40}\).
* Like other equilibrium constants, the value of \(K_{\text{sp}}\) changes only with temperature.

## 6 FACTRS Affecting Solubility

### Common Ion Effect

_LO 10.2(c)(ii): discuss the common ion effect on the solubility of ionic salts_

Consider a mixture of solid calcium fluoride and its aqueous ions in a saturated solution:

\[\text{CaF}_{2}(\text{s})\rightleftharpoons\text{Ca2}^{+}(\text{aq})+2\text{F}( \text{aq})\]

If a water-soluble solute containing the **common ion**\(\text{Ca2}^{+}\) or F is added, e.g. adding Ca\(Cl_{2}\)(aq) or NaF(aq), by [Le Chatelier's Principle, the position of equilibrium will shift to the left to decrease [Ca2-] or [F-]. Less CaF\({}_{2}\) will dissolve, reducing the solubility of CaF\({}_{2}\).

**Exercise 6.1**

The numerical value of \(K_{\text{sp}}\) of Ag\(Cl\) is \(2.00\times 10^{-10}\) at 25 *C.

(i) What is the solubility of Ag\(Cl\)?

(ii) Calculate the solubility of Ag\(Cl\) in \(0.100\) mol \(\text{dm}^{3}\) NaCl (aq).

Comments on the data:

When a saturated solution is obtained by dissolving the pure salt in water, the concentrations of the ions are in the ratio determined by the stoichiometry of the salt.

Solubility of Ag\(Cl\) decreases in the presence of \(Cl_{Y}\) the common ion (\(2.00\times 10^{-9}\) mol \(\text{dm}^{-3}\) in (ii) \(<1\AA 0\times 10^{-5}\) mol \(\text{dm}^{-3}\) in (i)). This is known as the **common ion effect**.

In other words, the solubility of a sparingly soluble salt **decreases** in the presence of a second solute that contains a common ion.

### Formation of complex ion:

_LO 10.2(c)(ii): discuss the effects on the solubility of ionic salts by formation of complex ions, as exemplified by the reactions of halide ions with aqueous silver ions followed by aqueous ammonia_

Some metal ions can accept electron pairs from neutral molecules or anions to form **complex ions**.

**Example 1:**

When NaOH(aq) is added to a solution containing Al\({}^{3+}\), a white precipitate of Al/(OH)\({}_{3}\) is formed. This precipitate dissolves in excess NaOH to form the complex ion [Al/(OH)\({}_{4}\)]-. Such complex ions are soluble in water.

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:448]

The subsequent addition of ammonia results in the formation of the stable diammine silver(l) complex, [Ag(NH\({}_{3}\))]\({}^{+}\)

Addition of NH\({}_{3}\) shifts the position of equilibrium (2) to the right, causing [Ag\({}^{+}\)] to decrease (and the value of ionic product, [Ag\({}^{+}\)][X\({}^{+}\)], to decrease). The decrease in [Ag\({}^{+}\)] causes the position of equilibrium (1) to shift to the right, hence **increasing** the solubility of AgX. The solubility of the silver halides in ammonia depends on the \(K_{\rm ap}\) of the silver halides. For the AgX solid to dissolve completely in ammonia, the ionic product must decrease to \(\leq K_{\rm ap}\).

The \(K_{\rm ap}\) values of silver halides decrease in the order: AgCl \(>\) AgBr \(>\) AgI.

For AgCl, when dilute NH\({}_{3}\) is added, the precipitate dissolves completely because the addition of dilute NH\({}_{3}\) is sufficient to lower [Ag\({}^{+}\)] such that the ionic product becomes **smaller** than \(K_{\rm ap}\) of AgCl.

For AgBr\({}_{3}\), \(K_{\rm ap}\) is lower, so the addition of dilute NH\({}_{3}\) is not sufficient to lower [Ag\({}^{+}\)] till the ionic product becomes smaller than \(K_{\rm ap}\) of AgBr. Hence, AgBr does not dissolve completely in dilute NH\({}_{3}\) However, when **concentrated** NH\({}_{3}\) is used, it will sufficiently lower [Ag\({}^{+}\)] such that the ionic product becomes **smaller** than \(K_{\rm ap}\) and the precipitate dissolves completely.

For AgI, the value of \(K_{\rm ap}\) is extremely low, thus the addition of either dilute or concentrated NH\({}_{3}\) is not sufficient to lower [Ag\({}^{+}\)] such that the ionic product becomes smaller than \(K_{\rm ap}\) of AgI. Hence AgI precipitate remains when dilute or concentrated NH\({}_{3}\) is added.

**Exercise 6.2 (Worked Example)**

Explain why the solubility of PbCl\({}_{2}\) decreases in dilute HCl but increases in concentrated HCl.

In dilute HCl, the common ion [Cl] causes the position of equilibrium in (1) to shift to the left to lower, [Cl], hence less PbCl, dissolves.

Pb-(aq) + 4Cl(aq) \(\equiv\) [PbCl]-(aq) -(2)

In concentrated HCl, Pb- will form a water soluble complex, [PbCl]-, with excess \(Cl\).

Formation of the complex ion removes Pb- from solution.

The position of equilibrium in (1) shifts to the right to produce more Pb-, and PbCl, dissolves (i.e. solubility of PbCl, increases).

### Effects of pH

Changes to the pH of a solution may affect the solubility of a sparingly soluble salt **containing either Brgnsted acids or bases**. A Brgnsted acid is a proton donor whereas a Brgnsted base is a proton acceptor. The Brgnsted acid-base theory was introduced briefly in Topic 4 Reactions & Stoichiometry.

### Strong and Weak Acids and Bases

_TO 10.1(a): explain qualitatively the differences in behaviour between strong and weak acids and losses in terms of the extent of dissociation_

A strong Bronsted acid is a **proton-donor** that dissociates or ionises completely in water to give H\({}_{3}\)O\({}^{+}\). It donates a proton more readily compared to the H\({}_{3}\)O\({}^{+}\) ion.

e.g. \(\mathrm{HCI}\) + H\({}_{2}\)O \(\rightarrow\)\(\mathrm{C}I^{-}\) + H\({}_{3}\)O\({}^{+}\)

\(\bullet\) The conjugate base of a strong acid has a very low tendency to accept a proton.

\(\bullet\) The reverse reaction is negligible : single-headed arrow (\(\rightarrow\)).

\(\bullet\) Other examples of strong acids: HNO\({}_{3}\), HBr, HTiO\({}_{3}\), HCO\({}_{4}\), H\({}_{3}\)SO\({}_{4}\)

A **weak Bronsted acid** is a **proton-donor** that **dissociates partially** in water to give H\({}_{3}\)O\({}^{+}\). It donates a proton less readily compared to the H\({}_{3}\)O\({}^{+}\) ion.

e.g. \(\mathrm{CH_{3}CO_{2}H}\) + H\({}_{2}\)O \(\rightarrow\)\(\mathrm{CH_{3}CO_{2}}\) + H\({}_{3}\)O\({}^{+}\)

\(\bullet\) The conjugate base of a weak acid (CH\({}_{3}\)CO\({}_{2}\)) has a tendency to accept a proton.

\(\bullet\) CH\({}_{3}\)CO\({}_{2}\)H and CH\({}_{3}\)CO\({}_{2}\)-is a conjugate acid-base pair that differ by one proton.

\(\bullet\) The reverse reaction occurs to some extent : double-headed arrow (\(\rightleftharpoons\)).

\(\bullet\) A mixture of mainly undisociated CH\({}_{3}\)CO\({}_{2}\)H molecules and the ions' exists in solution.

\(\bullet\) Other examples of weak acids: H\({}_{3}\)SO\({}_{3}\), HNO\({}_{2}\), H\({}_{2}\)CO\({}_{3}\), H\({}_{2}\)S, HF, HCN, most organic acids

A **strong Bronsted base** is a **proton-acceptor** that dissociates or ionises completely in water to give OH\({}^{+}\).

\(\bullet\) Other examples of weak bases: hydrazine N\({}_{2}\)H\({}_{4}\), amines such as CH\({}_{3}\)NH\({}_{2}\), C\({}_{6}\)H\({}_{5}\)NH\({}_{2}\)

\(\bullet\) The strength of an acid (or base) is _different_ from the concentration of the acid (or base).

\(\bullet\) Strength of an acid (or base) refers to the extent of its dissociation at equilibrium.

\(\bullet\) Concentration of an acid (or base) refers to the no. of moles of acid (or base) dissolved in 1 dm\({}^{3}\) of solution.

### Degree of dissociation

The **fraction** of molecules which is **ionised** into ions in water is called the degree of dissociation, \(\alpha\).

For an acid,

### pH of Weak Acid / Weak Base Solutions

_LO 10.1(c)port: calculate [H']_ (_aq_) and pH values for weak monobasic (monoprot) acids, and weak monocatalytic bases [Calculations involving weak acids/bases will **not** require solving of quadratic equations]

Since weak acids and weak bases dissociate **partially** in water, [H'] or [OH'] in the solution will be **lower than** the initial concentration of the weak acid or weak base.

We use \(K_{\alpha}\) or \(K_{\upsilon}\) to calculate the [H'] or [OH'] in the solution at equilibrium.

**Exercise 2.4 (Worked Example)**

**1.** Find **(a)** the pH and **(b)** the degree of dissociation of a solution of ethanolic acid, CH\({}_{3}\)CO\({}_{2}\)H, of concentration 0.1 mol dm\({}^{-3}\). [Given: \(K_{\alpha}\) of CH\({}_{3}\)CO\({}_{2}\)H = \(1.8\times 10^{-5}\) mol dm\({}^{-3}\)]

_Important note: [H']_\({}_{\text{gen}}\) = [A']_\({}_{\text{gen}}\) is true only if the solution contains only weak acid HA (i.e. all H' ions and A' ions present in the solution come only from the dissociation of HA and there are no added H' ions or A' ions). This equation cannot be used for calculations involving buffer solutions (see Section 4.4)._

_Note: Solving quadratic equations is not required for Chemistry 'A' Levels. The assumption (x << 0.1) is valid since a weak acid only dissociates partially. Without the approximation, [H'] would have been 1.33 x 10\({}^{-3}\) mol dm\({}^{-3}\). The difference is insignificant because it is within the limits of the accuracy to which the data is given._

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:462]

### Strength of Acids and Bases

_10 10.10(a): explain qualitatively the differences in behaviour between strong and weak acids and bases in terms of the extent of dissociation_

The strength of an acid (or base):

* is a measure of **how readily** the acid (or base) donates its proton (or accepts a proton).
* depends on its **structure** (refer to Organic Chemistry Topic 16 Hydroxy Compounds, Topic 18 Carboxylic Acids for acid strengths of different phenols and carboxylic acids, as well as Topic 19 Nitrogen Compounds to compare the basic strength of amines)
* is indicated by its **K\({}_{a}\) (or K\({}_{a}\))** value [see Section 2.5.1 and 2.5.2]
* is _different_ from the concentration of the acid (or base) [see Exercise 2.4]

Are pH or degree of dissociation, \(\alpha_{i}\) reliable indicators of the strength of an acid (or base)?

**Exercise 2.8**

In **Exercise 2.4**, the pH and the degree of dissociation of a solution of ethanoic acid of concentration 0.1 mol dm\({}^{-3}\) were found to be: pH: degree of dissociation, \(\alpha\):

[Given: \(K_{a}\) of CH\({}_{3}\)CO\({}_{2}\)H = 1.8 \(\times\) 10\({}^{5}\) mol dm\({}^{-3}\)]

Now, find **(a)** the pH and **(b)** the degree of dissociation of ethanoic acid of concentration 0.001 mol dm\({}^{-3}\). How have the pH and \(\alpha\) been affected by the dilution?

The diagrams below show how the values of pH, \(\alpha\) and \(K_{a}\) for a weak acid vary with dilution (i.e. volume of water increases) at a constant temperature:

### Salt derived from a weak acid and a strong base

* Consider CH\({}_{3}\)CO\({}_{2}\)Na\({}^{*}\) which is derived from the salt of CH\({}_{3}\)CO\({}_{2}\)H and NaOH.
* CH\({}_{3}\)CO\({}_{2}\)H is a weak acid so its conjugate base CH\({}_{3}\)CO\({}_{2}\)' is a stronger base than water. CH\({}_{3}\)CO\({}_{2}\)' undergoes hydrolysis forming OH' ions.

* Hence [OH+] > [H\({}_{3}\)O] and the salt solution of CH\({}_{3}\)CO\({}_{2}\)'Na\({}^{*}\) is alkaline.
* **At 25 \({}^{\circ}\)C, pH of a solution of CH\({}_{3}\)CO\({}_{2}\)'Na\({}^{*}\) is > 7.**

Note:

* CH\({}_{3}\)CO\({}_{2}\) (aq) is a stronger base than water so is able to accept a proton from water. However, it is still a weak base (\(K_{\rm o}\) of CH\({}_{3}\)CO\({}_{2}\) = 5.6 \(\times\) 10\({}^{-10}\) mol dm\({}^{-3}\)). Hence a reversible arrow '=' is used in the salt hydrolysis equation.
* The cation Na\({}^{*}\) does not undergo hydrolysis due to its low charge density.

### Salt derived from a strong acid and a weak base

* Consider NH\({}_{4}\)'C\({}_{2}\)' which is derived from the salt of HCI and NH\({}_{3}\).
* NH\({}_{3}\) is a weak base so its conjugate acid NH\({}_{4}\)' is a stronger acid than water. NH\({}_{4}\)' undergoes hydrolysis forming H\({}_{3}\)O' ions.

NH\({}_{4}\)'(aq) + H\({}_{2}\)O(I) + NH\({}_{3}\)(aq) + H\({}_{2}\)O(Iaq)
* Hence [H\({}_{3}\)O] > [OH] and the salt solution of NH\({}_{4}\)C\(I\) is acidic.

* At 25 \({}^{\circ}\)C, pH of a solution of NH\({}_{4}\)C\(I\) is < 7.

Note:

* NH\({}_{4}\)' is a stronger acid than water so is able to donate a proton to water. (see Exercise 2.9) However, it is still a weak acid (\(K_{\rm o}\) of NH\({}_{4}\)' = 5.56 \(\times\) 10\({}^{-10}\) mol dm\({}^{-3}\)). Hence a reversible arrow '=' is used in the salt hydrolysis equation.
* The anion \(C\)\(I\) (derived from strong acid HCI) is a weaker base than water and so does not hydrolyse.

### Salt derived from a weak acid and a weak base

* Both cation and anion hydrolyse.
* pH of the salt solution depends on \(K_{\rm o}\) of the acid (cation) and \(K_{\rm o}\) of the base (anion) if \(K_{\rm a}\)(cation) > \(K_{\rm b}\)(anion) \(\rightarrow\) salt solution is acidic \(K_{\rm a}\)(cation) = \(K_{\rm b}\)(anion) \(\rightarrow\) salt solution is neutral \(K_{\rm a}\)(cation) < \(K_{\rm b}\)(anion) \(\rightarrow\) salt solution is basic \(K_{\rm a}\)(anion) < \(K_{\rm b}\)(anion) \(\rightarrow\) salt solution is basic \(K_{\rm a}\)(anion) < \(K_{\rm b}\)(anion) < \(K_{\rm

### Salt containing an aqueous metal cation with high charge density

_TO 5(e)/u/part: describe and explain the reactions of the chlorides with water (for AIC/i)_

Consider the ionic compound, aluminium nitrate A/(NO3)3. When it dissolves in water, the A/\({}^{\pm}\) and NO3- ions are separated and surrounded by water molecules.

\[\text{A/(NO3)}_{3}\text{(s) + 6H2O(I) \rightarrow [A/(H2O)_{6}]^{3+}(aq) + 3NO3-(aq)}\]

The A/\({}^{\pm}\) cations are coordinated to water molecules through dative (co-ordinate) bonds to form the complex ion, [A/(H2O)6]3.

The A/\({}^{\pm}\) ion is small and highly charged, so it has high charge density. It withdraws sufficient electron density from the O-H bonds of the coordinated H2O molecules, weakening the O-H bonds. When one O-H bond breaks, a proton is released:

\[\text{[A/(H2O)_{6}]^{3+}(aq) + H2O(I) \rightleftharpoons[A/(H2O)_{6}]^{2+}(aq) + H3O^{+}(aq)}\]

We call this a **hydrolysis** reaction. Observe that [A/(H2O)]3+ is acting as a weak Br\(\ddot{\text{o}}\)nsted acid. Since [H3O+] > [OtT], A/\({}^{\pm}\)(aq) is acidic and pH < 7 at 25. \({}^{\circ}\)C.

Figure 1: [A/(H2O)]3+ acting as an acid, donating a proton to another H2O molecule

Other metal cations like Fe+ and Cr+ also form complex ions with water which undergo the hydrolysis reaction to produce an acidic solution.

### Calculating pH of Buffer solutions

#### 4.4.1 pH of buffer consisting of weak acid HA and its conjugate base A-

In a buffer consisting of HA and its conjugate base A-, the following equilibrium exists:

Hence pH of the buffer can be found easily.

Important note:

In this case of the buffer, [H+] #[A-] since the solution consists of _significant_ amounts of HA and A- and the A- ions do not just come from the weak acid dissociation of HA alone, unlike in a solution of pure weak acid HA (see Exercise 2.4):

Alternatively, to find pH of a buffer, take -lg on both sides of boxed equation,

\[-\lg[H^{+}]=-\lg K_{a}-\lg\frac{[\text{caid}]}{[\text{conjugate base}]}\]

#### 4.4.2 pH of buffer consisting of weak base and its conjugate acid

In a similar manner as above, the pOH and pH of this buffer can be found using:

[DH+] = \(K_{b}\times\) [\(\text{conjugate acid}\)] or \(\text{pOH}\) = \(\text{pK}_{a}+\lg\) [\(\text{conjugate acid}\)]

Figure 14: The \(\mathrm{pH}\) at the initial part of the titration curve and the part immediately before complete neutralisation changes more sharply as these lie outside the effective buffer range of the buffer.

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:481]

#### 5.1.3 Strong Acid - Weak base Titration

Consider addition of 0.10 mol dm\({}^{-3}\) NH\({}_{3}\) to 25.0 cm\({}^{3}\) of 0.10 mol dm\({}^{-3}\)HCl.

H\({}^{\prime}\) is a strong acid (fully dissociated in water).

At 0 < V\({}_{\text{weak base}}\) < 25 cm\({}^{3}\)

pH gradually rises as increasing amount of H\({}^{\prime}\) is neutralised by added weak base. However, no buffer is formed as there is no weak base present in excess in the conical flask.

At V\({}_{\text{weak base}}\) = 25 cm\({}^{3}\)

Equivalence point is reached. pH <7 as the cation undergoes hydrolysis to produce H\({}_{3}\)O\({}^{\prime}\):

NH\({}_{4}\)(aq) + H\({}_{2}\)O(\(I\)) = NH\({}_{3}\)(aq) + H\({}_{3}\)O\({}^{\prime}\)(\(\overline{\text{aq}}\))

Suitable indicator: methyl orange or screened methyl orange

At V\({}_{\text{weak base}}\) > 25 cm\({}^{3}\)

There is excess weak base present. The solution contains a mixture of weak base and its conjugate acid = a buffer solution forms,

Exercise 5.1 (a) With reference to the above example, determine the pH of the solution in the conical flask at the point when 12.50 cm\({}^{3}\) of NH\({}_{3}\) is added. (\(K_{\text{b}}\) of NH\({}_{3}\) = 1.8 \(\times\) 10\({}^{-5}\) mol dm\({}^{-3}\))

(b) Calculate the pH at equivalence point.

(c) What is volume of NH\({}_{3}\) added when maximum buffer capacity occurs? What is the pH at this point?

[(a) 1.48, (b) 5.28, (c) Volume of NH\({}_{3}\) at maximum buffer capacity = 50.00 cm\({}^{3}\), pH = 9.26]

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:483]

#### 5.1.5 Titration Curves involving polyprotic acids or bases

Polyprotic acids have more than one ionisable proton. The successive \(K_{\mathrm{s}}\) values may differ by several orders of magnitude. This means the first H\({}^{+}\) is lost more easily than subsequent ones. (Why?)

\begin{tabular}{l l l} E.g. & H\({}_{2}\)SO\({}_{3}\)(aq) & + H\({}_{2}\)O\((l)\) & HSO\({}_{3}\)-(aq) & \(K_{\mathrm{s1}}=1.4\times 10^{-2}\) mol dm\({}^{-3}\) \\ HSO\({}_{3}\)(aq) & + H\({}_{2}\)O\((l)\) & \(\mathrm{SO}_{3}\)-(aq) & + H\({}_{3}\)O\({}^{+}\)(aq) & \(K_{\mathrm{s2}}=6.5\times 10^{-8}\) mol dm\({}^{-3}\) \\ \end{tabular} In a titration of H\({}_{2}\)SO\({}_{3}\), we can assume that all the H\({}_{2}\)SO\({}_{3}\) molecules will lose one H\({}^{+}\) ion before any of the HSO\({}_{3}\) ions loses its H\({}^{+}\).

Note that the titration curve usually has two steep portions, which corresponds to **two equivalence points**.

A similar curve is also obtained for a titration involving a mixture of two acids with an appreciable difference in \(K_{\mathrm{s}}\) values (or a mixture of 2 bases with an appreciable difference in \(K_{\mathrm{s}}\) values). In practice, we can observe the two separate end-points with the proper choice and use of two different indicators.

Consider the titration of sodium carbonate with dilute H\(CI\).

### Acid-Base Indicators (Background Info)

An acid-base indicator is a weak aqueous acid whose acid form, Hin, is a different colour from its ionised form (or conjugate base form), In-. As such, it shows different colours in solutions of different pH.

For litmus:

In acidic solutions, [H+] is high. The position of equilibrium lies on the left. Predominant form of litmus is Hin, so the solution will appear red.

In alkaline solutions, [OH+] is high so [H+] is low. The position of equilibrium lies on the right. Predominant form of litmus is In-. Hence the solution will appear blue.

### Working pH Range of Indicators (Background info)

For most indicators, the predominant form must be at least 10 times more concentrated than the other form for its colour to be distinguished from the other coloured form.

Since for an indicator, Hln (aq) \(\rightleftharpoons\) H\({}^{+}\) (aq) + \(\ln^{-}\) (aq)

The dissociation constant of an indicator, \(K_{\rm in}\), will be:

For litmus:

If the ratio of \([\ln^{-}]/[\rm{Hln}]\geq 10/1\), i.e. pH \(\geq\) pH\({}_{\rm in}+1\), the solution appears blue.

If the ratio of \([\ln^{-}]/[\rm{Hln}]\leq 1/10\), i.e. pH \(\leq\) pH\({}_{\rm in}-1\), the solution appears red.

Therefore, the litmus changes from red to blue over a pH range of

# Introduction

There are only a few naturally-occurring organic halogen compounds. One example is thyroxine, a hormone secreted by the thyroid gland;

Organic halogen compounds are often used as intermediates in organic synthesis; they are readily formed from common materials and can easily be transformed into many different functional groups.

Two main types of halogen compounds will be discussed: halogenalkanes and halogenoarenes.

### Halogenoalkanes (alkyl halides)

They are alkanes with one or more H atoms replaced by the halogen atom, F, Cl, Br or I.

In IUPAC nomenclature, the halogen is considered as a substituent of the hydrocarbon. These compounds are therefore named using the prefixes, fluoro-, chloro-,bromo- and iodo-. Some examples are given below.

Halogenoalkanes may show constitutional isomerism and enantiomerism. For example, there are five isomers with the molecular formula, CH\({}_{3}\)Br.

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:495]

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:496]

## 3 Reactions of Halogenoalkanes

Halogenoalkanes undergo two types of reactions: nucleophilic substitution and elimination.

### Nucleophilic Substitution Reactions

Halogenoalkanes are fairly reactive compounds, owing largely to the polarity of the C-X bond. Halogens are more electronegative than carbon, so the carbon-halogen bond is polar. The electron-deficient carbon atom has a partial positive charge which causes it to be attractive to **nucleophiles**.

During reaction, the halogen atom in the halogenoalkane can be substituted by a nucleophile e.g. OH\({}^{+}\), CN\({}^{-}\) and NH\({}_{3}\). This reaction typical of halogenoalkanes is called **nucleophilic substitution**.

The overall reaction for nucleophilic substitution can be represented as:

#### 3.1.1 General mechanisms of nucleophilic substitution mechanisms

Nucleophilic substitution reactions can proceed by either an **S**u**1 or **S**u**2 mechanism. Generally, primary halogenoalkanes undergo nucleophilic substitution via the one-step mechanism **S**u**2 while tertiary halogenoalkanes undergo reactions via the two-step mechanism **S**u**1. Secondary halogenoalkanes may react via either mechanism.

The C-Br bond in bromoethane is **polar** due to the difference in electronegativity between the carbon and bromine atoms.

The **nucleophile** attacks the partially positively charged carbon atom from the side opposite to the bromine atom. The nucleophilic donates its lone pair to the electron-deficient carbon so that a bond begins to form between the nucleophile and the carbon atom.

At the same time, the C-Br bond is simultaneously weakened and begins to break. Both the bonding electrons in the C-Br bond are donated to the Br atom to form Br\({}^{-}\).

An unstable, activated complex called a **transition state** is formed where the entering nucleophile and the leaving Br\({}^{-}\) ion are partially bonded to the same carbon atom. Bond breaking and bond forming occur simultaneously. This is a **one-step mechanism**.

**H**N**C**HOSCThe mechanism is known as Sn2 (bimolecular nucleophilic substitution), because two species are involved in the rate determining step of the mechanism.

The energy profile or reaction pathway diagram for the S\({}_{N}\)2 mechanism is given below.

###### Stereochemistry

_LO 1.14(c)(f) explain the stereochemical outcome in nucleophilic substitution involving optically active substrates: inversion of configuration in S\({}_{N}\)2 mechanism_

If the original RX molecule is chiral, the stereochemistry at the electron-deficient carbon will be **inverted** after the substitution reaction (see below).

If the reaction occurs purely through the S\({}_{N}\)2 mechanism, only one of the enantiomers will be formed as the product. There will not be a mixture of two enantiomers. As a result, the product obtained through the S\({}_{N}\)2 mechanism will be optically active, if there is a chiral carbon present.

* In the first step, heterolytic fission of the C-Br bond occurs, giving a **carbonation intermediate** and a bromide ion. The electron-donating alkyl groups help to stabilise the carbocation intermediate. In the second step, the highly reactive carbocation is readily attacked by the **nucleophile** to form the product.
* This is a **two-step** mechanism.
* Rate = \(K\)[RBr]
* The mechanism is known as \(S_{\text{N}}\)1 (**unimolecular nucleophilic substitution**) because only one species is involved in the rate determining step of the mechanism.

The energy profile or reaction pathway diagram for the \(S_{\text{N}}\)1mechanism is given below.

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:500]

**Effect of structure of the halogenalkane on the relative rates of S\({}_{n}\)T and S\({}_{n}\)2**

_LO11.4(b)() describe and explain the mechanism of nucleophilic substitution in halogenalkanes:Sa1 in terms of stability of the carbocation intermediate_

* **S\({}_{n}\)1 in terms of stability of the carbocation intermediates**

Alkyl groups donate electrons to the carbocations and help to stabilise them. As such, the stability of carbocations increases in the order primary < secondary < tertiary. As the carbocation becomes more stable, the activation energy for the reaction leading to it decreases. See the figure below for the reaction profiles for the S\({}_{n}\)1 mechanism for a primary vs. a tertiary promoalkane:

**We therefore expect that the rate of S\({}_{n}\)1 will increase in the order primary < secondary < tertiary.**

**Reagents and conditions:** ethanolic concentrated NH\({}_{3}\), heat in sealed tube

(the sealed tube is to prevent the ammonia from escaping)

("ethanolic concentrated NH\({}_{3}\)" means a concentrated solution of NH\({}_{3}\) in ethanol.)

A primary amine is formed in the above reaction. Like ammonia, this primary amine possesses a lone pair of electrons on the N atom. The electron-donating alkyl group makes the amine more nucleophilic than ammonia. If an excess of halogenalkane is present, the amine can readily react with the halogenalkane to form a secondary amine. Further reactions can then occur to form more substituted amines:

The following mechanisms show how primary and secondary amines may be formed from the nucleophilic substitution of a halogenalkane, using ammonia and bromomethane as an example:

Ammonia as the nucleophile can react with bromomethane to form methylamine (primary amine):

The formation of the different amines when excess halogenalkane is used causes the yield of the primary amine to decrease, and also makes the separation of products difficult. As such, to obtain the primary amine as the main product and avoid the further reactions described above, **excess ammonia** should be used.

## 4 Reactions of Halogenoarenes

_10.11.4(e) explain the unreactivity of chlorobenzene compared to halogenoalkanes towards nucleophilic substitution in terms of the delocalisation of the lone pair of electrons on the halogen and steric hindrance_

### Reactivity of Halogenoarenes

Halogenoarenes are very much less susceptible to nucleophilic substitution than halogenoalkanes.

1. The lone pair of electrons on the halogen atom delocalises into the benzene ring.
2. Sterically, the rear side of the C-X bond in halogenoarenes is blocked by the benzene ring. Also, the \(\pi\)-electron cloud of the benzene ring will repel the lone pair of electrons of an incoming nucleophilic, rendering attack of the nucleophilic difficult.

Hence, nucleophilic substitution of halogenoarenes cannot be achieved by the same reagents and conditions used for halogenoalkanes, and is only possible under very vigorous conditions.

### Electrophilic Substitution on the Benzene Ring of Halogenoarenes

The halogenoarenes undergo electrophilic substitution on the benzene ring similar to other arenes. [See Topic 12 Arenes]

However, halogenoarenes are less susceptible to electrophilic substitution as the halogen substituent is deactivating. The halogen substituent is also 2,4-directing. An example of such a reaction is given below.

## 5 Distinguishing tests for halogenoalkanes

### Comparing Colour of AgX Precipitate

The general method for distinguishing between the type of halogen substituents present in halogenalkanes is to compare the colour of the silver halide precipitates that are formed after the compound undergoes nucleophilic substitution by hydroxide ion. The test involves 3 steps.

Step 1: Add NaOH(aq) and heat. [Reaction: RX + OH\({}^{-}\)\(\rightarrow\) ROH + \(X\)] Step 2: Add excess dilute HNO\({}_{3}\). [Removes unreacted OH\({}^{-}\) so that brown AgO ppt will not be formed in the next step] Step 3: Add AgNO\({}_{3}\)(aq) and observe the colour of precipitate formed. [ Ag\({}^{*}\)(aq) + \(X^{-}\)(aq) \(\rightarrow\) Ag\(X\)(s) ] The expected observations (for the positive tests) are given in the table below. Sometimes, the colours of Ag\(Cl\) and AgBr are difficult to differentiate. We can follow up by adding NH\({}_{3}\)(aq); Ag\(Cl\) dissolves in dilute aqueous NH\({}_{3}\) while AgBr does not.

### Comparing Rate of Formation of AgX Precipitate

The three different halogenoalkanes can also be distinguished using ethanolic AgNO\({}_{3}\). In this method, the rates of the formation of the silver halide precipitates will be different. The identity of the halogenoalkane can also be determined from the colour of the Ag\(X\) precipitate formed.

## 6 Halogenoalkanes and the environment

### Uses of Halogenoalkanes

_10 11.4(g) explain the uses of fluoroalkanes and fluoroalkanes in terms of their relative chemical inertness_

Halogenoalkanes are used as refrigerants, aerosol propellants and fire extinguishers.

Fluoroalkanes are less reactive than chloroalkanes due to the high bond energy of the C-F bond. They are more useful in certain applications where their inertness are required, such as non-stick coating on pots and pans and as taps and stoppers in laboratory glassware like burettes and standard flasks. The commercial name for polytetraftluoroethane is Teflon*.

Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), often known by the trade name 'Freons', are used as refrigerants, aerosol propellants and in fire extinguishers.

These compounds have some useful properties:

(1) they are inert and non-flammable

(2) they are non-toxic

(3) they are compounds that liquefy under pressure and therefore vapourise readily when that pressure is released

(4) they are odourless

### Effect of CFCs on the Ozone Layer

_10 11.4(h) recognise the concern about the effect of chlorofluoroalkanes (CFCs) on the ozone layer [the mechanistic details of how CFCs deplete the ozone layer are not required]_

**Depletion of the ozone layer**

Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) in aerosol sprays deplete the ozone (O\({}_{3}\)) layer and expose us to ultraviolet radiation from the sun. The O\({}_{3}\) layer absorbs ultraviolet rays and is vital in screening the earth from excess ultraviolet radiation. Too much exposure to ultraviolet radiation causes skin cancer and widespread crop failure.

Due to the strength of C-F and C-Cl bonds, fluoroalkanes and CFCs are stable molecular entities under ambient conditions, which exhibit low toxicity, low reactivity, and low flammability. However, this lack of reactivity also provides CFCs a lifespan that can exceed 100 years, giving them time to diffuse into the stratosphere, where the strong UV radiation will cleave the weaker C-Cl bond (bond energies: C-Cl = +340 vs. C-F = +485 kJ mol-1) homolytically to generate reactive C-F radicals, which will catalyse the decomposition of ozone into oxygen, leading to depletion of the ozone layer.

In the stratosphere, oxygen atoms are produced when O\({}_{2}\) absorbs UV light at 250 nm wavelength.

###### Abstract

In Topic 4 Reactions and Stoichiometry, we discussed various definitions of acids and bases. In Topic 14 Acid-Base Equilibria, we further learnt that the strength of weak acids and bases can be indicated by the equilibrium constants \(K_{a}\) and \(K_{b}\). In our continuation of organic chemistry, we will see the application of the above acid-base concepts in the context of relatively weak organic acids (e.g. alcohols, phenols and carboxylic acids) and organic bases (e.g. amines). Fundamental concepts in Introduction and isomerism (e.g. types of reactions, polar/non-polar mechanisms, delocalisation, electronic/steric effects and isomerism) continue to play an important role in explaining the nature and reactions of these acidic and basic functional groups in organic chemistry. The use of halogen derivatives as a starting material to prepare these compounds will also be revisited.

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:515]

### Classification of Alcohols

Alcohols can be subdivided into three different classes (similar to halogenoalkanes). An alcohol is classified as **primary (1*)**; secondary (2*)**, or **tertiary (3*)** according to the number of carbon atoms bonded to the carbon that bears the -OH group:

Each class of alcohol undergoes chemical reactions differently. When asked to identify the alcohol functional group in a compound, you should state whether it is a primary, secondary or tertiary alcohol explicitly and not just a generic "alcohol".

### Nomenclature

Alcohols are named by replacing the terminal -_e_ of the corresponding alkane name with -_ol_.

The longest carbon chain containing the hydroxy group is considered the parent structure.

Number the alkane chain beginning at the end nearer the hydroxy group, and use the appropriate number to indicate the position of the -OH group.

Number any substituents according to their positions on the chain, and list the substituents in alphabetical order. The priority of the functional groups can be found in Topic 8: Introduction to Organic Chemistry, subtopic 4.1.

### **Aidid-Base Reactions of Alcohols and Phenols**

_10 11.5(e): explain the relative activities of water, phenol and ethanol in aqueous medium (interpret as Bransted-Lowry Acids)_

Due to the presence of the -OH group, alcohols and phenols can act as either Bronsted acids or Bronsted bases. The electron-deficient hydrogen can be removed in the presence of a sufficiently strong base, while the electron-rich oxygen can be protonated in the presence of a sufficiently strong acid.

While this section mainly focuses on alcohols and phenols acting as Bronsted acids, we do see alcohols acting as Bronsted bases later in Section 4.3.

In general, the strength of an acid depends on the **stability** of the conjugate base formed after dissociation. When a more stable conjugate base is formed, it is less likely to accept a proton to reform the acid. Hence, the extent of dissociation is greater, resulting in a stronger acid and a larger (\(K_{\mathrm{s}}\) (Topic 14 Acid-Base Equilibria).

#### 4.2.1 **Aidity of alcohols**

In alcohols, the O-H bond can break to give H+ and R-O- (alkoxide ion). The extent of dissociation is lower than that of water. Therefore alcohols do not turn blue litmus red.

#### Why are alcohols weaker acids than water?

Alkyl groups are inductively electron-donating and will **intensity** the negative charge on the alkoxide ion. The alkoxide ion has a greater tendency as compared to the hydroxide ion to accept a proton to re-form the alcohol molecule. Thus the alkoxide ion is said to be **destabilised**, and deprotonation of the alcohol does not take place as easily. (Note: the length of the alkyl chain does not have a significant impact on the acidity.)

#### Effect of substituents on acidity of alcohols

The presence of electron-withdrawing groups (e.g. -NO2, -F, -Cl, -Br, -I, -COCH3, -CO2H, -CN, -CO2R, -NH2, -OH, -OCH3) help to stabilise the alkoxide ion formed by dispersing the negative charge on the alkoxide ion, thus promoting the ionisation of the alcohol.

However, the presence of electron-donating groups (e.g. -CH3) decreases the acidic strength of alcohols by intensifying the negative charge on the alkoxide ion, destabilising the alkoxide ion.

The distance of the electron-withdrawing group from the negatively charged oxygen of the alkoxide ion also affects the degree of dispersion of the negative charge, as the inductive effect decreases with increasing distance. Thus, the nearer the electron-withdrawing group is to the negatively charged oxygen in the alkoxide ion, the greater the degree of dispersion of the negative charge and the greater the acid strength of the alcohol.

#### 4.2.2 **Acidity of phenols**

Phenols are more acidic than alcohols (and water). The pH of a 0.1 mol dm\({}^{-3}\) phenol solution in water is 5.4, so a solution of phenol will turn blue litmus red.

The negative charge on the phenoxide ion can be delocalised over the benzene ring as shown in the following diagrams.

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:524]

#### 4.2.3 Acid-metal reaction with sodium (redox)

Alcohols and phenols react with Group 1 metals such as sodium and potassium to form alkoxides or phenoxides respectively and hydrogen gas. This reaction involves the breaking of the O-H bond.

Acohols and phenols both act as acids; liberating H+, which is then reduced by sodium to H2. Both reactions are similar to that of sodium with water. However, alcohols react more slowly as they are weaker acids than water. Phenols, being stronger acids than water, react more vigourously.

#### 4.2.4 Acid-base reaction with sodium hydroxide

Phenols are acidic enough to react with bases like sodium hydroxide (and potassium hydroxide) to yield phenoxide salts and water. Phenol will form a cloudy mixture when mixed with water due to its poor solubility. Upon addition of aqueous NaOH; the phenol will dissolve to form a homogeneous colourless solution.

Note that phenols are not acidic enough to react with carbonates to liberate CO2 gas.

Alcohols, being weaker acids than water, are not acidic enough to react with aqueous sodium hydroxide or carbonates to form the corresponding alkoxides.

ANA CH3CH2OH + NaOH + no acid-base reaction

### _Nucleophilic Substitution (mechanism not required)_

Alcohols can be converted to halogenalkanes by nucleophilic substitution. In this reaction, the C-O bond is broken.

We have seen in Topic 15 Halogen Derivatives that the OH-ion can attack a halogenalkane, e.g. RCI, to form an alcohol. In this reaction, the halide ion, C_T_, is called the **leaving group**.

Recall also from Topic 14 Acid-Base Equilibria, that C_T_ and OH-ions are conjugate bases of acids HCI and H_O_ respectively.

Since HCI is a stronger acid than H_O_, its conjugate base C_T_ is a weaker base than OH-. Weaker bases are generally better leaving groups. Hence C_T_, being a better leaving group than OH-, is readily substituted by OH- ions in halogenalkanes to form alcohols in nucleophilic substitutions. This also applies to Br- and C-.

On the other hand, as OH- is a poor leaving group, the conversion of alcohols to halogenalkanes involves reagents such as acid or SOCI2. These reagents first convert the -OH group into a better leaving group before the halide ion attacks, forming the halogenalkane.

#### _Nucleophilic substitution with hydrogen halides_

##### Reaction with hydrochloric acid

Tertiary alcohols react readily with concentrated hydrochloric acid upon shaking at room temperature to form the corresponding chloroalkane.

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:527]

#### 4.3.2 Nucleophilic substitution with phosphorus halides

Reaction with phosphorus trihalides:

Alcohols react with the various phosphorus trihalides to form the corresponding halogenalkanes and phosphoric(III) acid.

**Reaction with phosphorus(V) chloride:**

Phosphorus(V) chloride converts an alcohol into the corresponding chloroalkane with the evolution of hydrogen chloride. As it is highly reactive with water, the reagents must be free of water or moisture. \(PC_{l}\)s is a good distinguishing test for an alcohol functional group if a carboxylic acid is absent (as \(PC_{l}\)s will also react with carboxylic acids to produce \(HCI\) gas; see Topic 18 Carboxylic Acids and derivatives).

**Reagents & Conditions:**

#### 4.3.3 Nucleophilic substitution with thinyl chloride

Another good reagent to convert alcohols to chloroalkanes is thinyl chloride, SOC\(l_{2}\). Thionyl chloride and P\(CI_{5}\) will react with both alcohols and carboxylic acids, liberating H\(CI\) in the process. The use of thionyl chloride confers an additional advantage over the use of P\(CI_{5}\) in that both by-products are acidic gases and are hence more easily separated from the chloroalkane product. Also, since both by-products are gases, the reaction is entropically driven (entropy change more positive, reaction more thermodynamically feasible).

#### 4.3.4 Non-reactivity of phenols towards nucleophilic substitution

Phenols are very much less susceptible towards nucleophilic substitution, in which the \(-\)OH group is replaced by a halide, than alcohols. Extremely harsh conditions are required for conversion of phenols to halogenarenes (which will not be discussed in this syllabus).

Reasons for the inertness of phenols towards nucleophilic substitutionThere are several reasons for the reduced susceptibility of phenols to form halogenarenes. These reasons are similar to those given for the reduced susceptibility of halogenarenes to nucleophilic substitution reactions (see Topic 15 Halogen Derivatives).

1. The lone pair of electrons on the O atom in phenol delocalises into the benzene ring, resulting in partial double bond character in the C-O bond. The C-O bond strength in phenols is higher than in an alcohol, making it more difficult to break.
2. Sterically, the approach of a nucleophilic to the rear side of the C-O bond in phenols is hindered by the benzene ring. The \(\pi\)-electron cloud of the benzene ring will also repel the lone pair of electrons on the approaching nucleophilic.

These two factors make the attack by the nucleophilic difficult.

### Dehydration (Elimination)

Dehydration of alcohols is carried out by heating the alcohol in the presence of a suitable catalyst. The loss of the hydroxy group together with a H atom bonded to an adjacent carbon will result in the formation of an alkene and a water molecule.

Dehydration may form a mixture of alkenes, depending on the position of the hydroxy group. Consider the reaction of butan-2-ol with excess concentrated sulfuric acid:

Note: There are some similarities and differences between the dehydration reaction of alcohols and elimination of halogen@alkanes. In both cases, an alkene is formed, but the differences are in the reagents used, as well as formation of H\({}_{2}\)O and HX in the cases of alcohols and halogen@alkanes respectively.(See Topic 15 Halogen Derivatives).

If there are no hydrogen atoms bonded to the carbon atom that is adjacent to the carbon atom bearing the hydroxy group, dehydration cannot take place:

[FIGURE:S4.F1][ENDFIGUR

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:531]

### Condensation

Alcohols and phenols possess an -OH group with two lone pairs of electrons on the oxygen atom. This allows them to act as nucleophiles (Lewis base) in their reaction with carboxylic acids and/or acyl chlorides to form esters in a condensation process.

#### 4.5.1 Condensation with carboxylic acids

Alcohols will react with carboxylic acids in a slow and reversible reaction, with a few drops of concentrated sulfuric acid as catalyst, to form the ester with the condensation of a water molecule. Note that concentrated sulfuric acid can act as a catalyst for both dehydration (to alkenes) and condensation. In this case, only a few drops of concentrated sulfuric acid are used, making the sulfuric acid less likely to act as a dehydating agent.

Unlike alcohols, phenols do **not** react with carboxylic acids in a similar condensation reaction. This is due to the delocalisation of the lone pair of electrons on the oxygen atom into the benzene ring. The lone pair of electrons is thus less available to attack the carboxyl carbon of the carboxylic acid to form the ester.

#### 4.5.2 Condensation with acyl chlorides

Acyl chlorides react much more readily with alcohols in condensation reactions than their corresponding carboxylic acids. No heating and no catalysts are required, and the reaction goes to completion instead of establishing an equilibrium.

### The Tri-iodomethane (iodoform) Test

_10 11.5(c): deduce the presence of a CH\({}_{3}\)CH(OH)- group in an alcohol from its reaction with alkaline aqueous iodine to form tri-iodomethane_

Alcohols with a CH\({}_{3}\)CH(OH)- group will react with warm alkaline aqueous iodine. In this reaction, the carbon bearing the hydroxy group is oxidised to a carboxyl carbon.

Note that this reaction involves the **breaking of a C-C bond** with the removal of the methyl (-CH\({}_{3}\)) group. It is therefore a useful method to shorten a carbon chain by a single carbon (known as a **step-down reaction**).

Examples:

**For your information:**

**Why do both the CH\({}_{3}\)CH(OH)- and the CH\({}_{3}\)CO- groups give a positive iodoform test?**

(Mechanism not required)

In this reaction, the CH\({}_{3}\)CH(OH)- group is first oxidised _in-situ_ to the corresponding CH\({}_{3}\)CO- group (a methyl ketone) by the iodate(I) ion. This is then followed by a series of substitutions, leading to cleavage of the -CI\({}_{3}\) group to give CH\({}_{3}\).

Hence, methyl ketones also give a positive iodoform test, forming CH\({}_{3}\) (to be covered in Topic 17 Carbonyl Compounds).

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:539]

### Other Reactions of Phenols

In addition to the reactions discussed in earlier sections, phenol also undergoes some other reactions of interest.

#### 4.8.1 Electrophilic substitution of the benzene ring

_LO 11.5(d): recall the chemistry of phenol, as exemplified by the following reactions: (i) with bases, (ii) with sodium, (iii) nitration of, and bromination of, the aromatic ring_

Due to the delocalisation of the lone pair of electrons of oxygen into the benzene ring, the electron density in the ring is greatly increased, making phenol much more susceptible to electrophilic attack than benzene (contrast this to the reagents and conditions required for electrophilic substitution of benzene in Topic 12 Arenes). Hence, the presence of the \(-\)OH group highly activates the benzene ring towards electrophilic substitution. Two general observations are noted:

1. Electrophilic substitution of the benzene ring in phenols takes place under milder conditions compared to benzene: **no catalyst** and **no heating** required.
2. The \(-\)OH group is strongly activating and 2,4- directing, which may result in **multi-substituted products** at the 2-, 4-, and 6- positions easily.

Note: as the \(-\)NH\({}_{2}\) group in phenylalanine is even more strongly activating than the \(-\)OH group in phenol, similar observations will be made regarding electrophilic substitution of the benzene ring in phenylalanine (to be covered in Topic 19 Nitrogen Compounds).

#### Electrophilic substitution with nitric acid (nitration)

When phenol is treated with dilute aqueous nitric acid at room temperature, mono-substitution occurs to form a mixture of 2- and 4- nitrophenol.

If concentrated nitric acid at room temperature is used, 2,4,6-trinitrophenol is produced.

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:541]

#### 4.8.2 Complex formation with iron(III) chloride

When a neutral solution of iron(III) chloride is added to a dilute solution of a phenol, a coloured complex is formed. [The reason for the complex having colour will be discussed in Topic 22 Chemistry of the Transition Elements.] The colour of the complex depends on the other substituents (if any) on the benzene ring. With phenol, a violet colour is observed.

This reaction is used as a distinguishing test for the presence of a phenolic group in an organic compound.

Carbonyl compounds are commonly found in biologically important molecules such as carbohydrates and hormones, as well as other natural and synthetic dyes, fragrances and pharmaceuticals.

Hedione (methyl hydrojasmonate) was discovered in the early 1960s and is one ingredient found in almost all fine fragrances. During a quest to identify the characteristic smell of Bulgarian rose oil, the rose ketones, damascenones, were discovered and synthesised. In general, aldehydes contribute to the floral concept in feminine perfumery and aliphatic aldehydes with 8-13 carbon atoms have a very pleasant odour, and can be detected in very low concentrations.

Benzaldehyde, the simplest aromatic aldehyde, has a pleasant almond-like odour, while cinnamaldehyde gives cinnamon note. Vanillin (4-hydroxyl-3-methoxybenzaldehyde) is used as vanilla note, an ubiquitous note in almost all fragrances.

A carbonyl group is composed of a carbon atom which is double bonded to an oxygen atom.

The two simplest types of carbonyl compounds are aldehydes and ketones.

## 2 Physical properties of aldehydes and ketones

### Boiling Points

Aldehydes and ketones have higher boiling points than corresponding hydrocarbons of similar number of electrons in the molecule, but have lower boiling points than their corresponding alcohols and carboxylic acids.

\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|c|c|} \hline
**Compound** & \begin{tabular}{c} **Structural** \\ **formula** \\ \end{tabular} & 
\begin{tabular}{c} **No. of electrons** \\ **in the molecule** \\ \end{tabular} & **b.p. / \({}^{\circ}\)C** & **Predominant intermolecular forces** \\ \hline butane & CH\({}_{3}\)CH\({}_{2}\)CH\({}_{3}\) & 34 & \(-0.5\) & dispersion forces \\ \hline propanal & CH\({}_{3}\)CH\({}_{2}\)CHO & 32 & 49 & permanent dipole - permanent dipole \\ \hline propanone & CH\({}_{3}\)COCH\({}_{3}\) & 32 & 56 & permanent dipole - permanent dipole \\ \hline propan-1-ol & CH\({}_{3}\)CH\({}_{2}\)CH\({}_{2}\)OH & 34 & 97 & hydrogen bonding \\ \hline ethanoic acid & CH\({}_{3}\)CO\({}_{2}\)H & 32 & 118 & hydrogen bonding \\ \hline \end{tabular}

* The **carbonyl** group is **polar**, thus **permanent dipole-permanent dipole** interactions exist between molecules in aldehydes and ketones (in addition to dispersion forces) which require more energy to overcome compared to only dispersion forces present in non-polar alkanes. Hence, carbonyl compounds have **higher boiling point** than the corresponding alkanes.
* **Alcohols** and **carboxylic acids** can form **hydrogen bonds** between molecules, which are **stronger** and require more energy to overcome than **permanent dipole-permanent dipole** interactions in the corresponding aldehydes and ketones. Hence, carbonyl compounds have **lower** boiling point than the corresponding alcohols and carboxylic acids.

### Solubility in Water

Aldehydes and ketones have both polar and non-polar regions. They can act as solvents to both polar and non-polar solutes, which gives them a wide range of uses as solvents.

The smaller aliphatic aldehydes and ketones are soluble in water due largely to their ability to form hydrogen bonds with water molecules.

\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|c|} \hline
**Approgen bonding** & \begin{tabular}{c} **The** **all-order** \\ \end{tabular} & \begin{tabular}{c} **The** **all-order** \\ \end{tabular} & \begin{tabular}{c} **The** **all-order** \\ \end{tabular} & \begin{tabular}{c} **The** **all-order** \\ \end{tabular} & 
\begin{tabular}{c} **The** **all-order** \\ \end{tabular} \\ \hline \end{tabular}

Carbonyl compounds containing more than 5 carbons or aromatic rings, are virtually insoluble in water. As the number of carbon atoms in the alkyl chain increases, the strength of the dispersion forces between molecules of the carbonyl compound increases. Energy released from hydrogen bonding formed between the carbonyl group and water is less able to overcome the increasingly stronger dispersion forces, as well as the existing hydrogen bonding in water. In addition, the hydrogen bonding with water is disrupted by the larger non-polar alkyl chain.

(a) The boiling point increases in the order, **A** < B < C.

## 4 Reactions of aldehydes and ketones

**Reactivity of aldehydes and ketones towards nucleophilic reagents and addition**

_LO 11.6(c): explain the differences in reactivity between carbonyl compounds and alkenes towards nucleophilic reagents, such as lithium aluminium hydride and hydrogen cyanide_

LiA/H\({}_{a}\), NaBH\({}_{a}\) and HCN are nucleophilic reagents.

(LiA/H\({}_{a}\) and NaBH\({}_{a}\) can be considered as sources of the hydride anion, H\({}^{-}\))

The \({}^{8+}\)C=O\({}^{5-}\) bond is polar, so the aldehyde-carbon or the ketone-carbon has \(\delta+\) charge. \(\delta+\) carbon attracts nucleophiles. Hence, aldehydes and ketones react with the above nucleophilic reagents.

The C=C bond (in alkenes) is non-polar and has no \(\delta+\) carbon to attract nucleophiles. In fact the electron rich C=C bond would repel nucleophiles (e.g. H\({}^{-}\) anion, or the A/H\({}_{a}\)- or BH\({}_{a}\)- anions themselves).

### Nucleophilic Addition Reaction

The overall reaction for nucleophilic addition of carbonyl compounds can be represented as:

Examples of nucleophiles that can react with aldehydes and ketones in a nucleophilic addition include CN\({}^{-}\), H\({}_{2}\)O and ROH.

#### 4.1.1 General mechanism of nucleophilic addition

Step 1: A nucleophilic attacks the electron-deficient carbonyl carbon, breaking the \(\pi\) bond of the C=O group, to form an alkoxide ion.

Step 2: The tetrahedral intermediate is protonated by water or acid to give an alcohol as the final product.

#### 4.1.2 Relative reactivity of aldehydes and ketones in nucleophilic addition reactions

Aldehydes are generally more reactive than ketones in nucleophilic addition reactions.

#### (i) Steric reason:

The presence of two relatively large substituents in ketones versus only one large substituent in aldehydes means that attacking nucleophiles are able to approach the carbonyl carbon in aldehydes with less steric hindrance than in ketones.

Aldehydes have one electron donating alkyl group while ketones have two. Hence, an aldehyde-carbon has a higher partial positive charge compared to a ketone-carbon, making the former more susceptible towards nucleophilic attack.

#### 4.1.3 Nucleophilic addition with hydrogen cyanide, HCN

_LO 11.6(b): describe the mechanism of the nucleophilic addition reactions of hydrogen cyanide with aldehydes and ketones_

Aldehydes and ketones undergo nucleophilic addition with hydrogen cyanide, HCN, under appropriate conditions to form cyanohydrins.

_Note:_

 HCN is a toxic gas and has a boiling point of 25.6\({}^{\circ}\)C. It is usually generated _in situ_ by the reaction between KCN(s) and cold dilute H\({}_{2}\)SO\({}_{4}\).

2 KCN + H\({}_{2}\)SO\({}_{4}\)\(\rightarrow\) K\({}_{2}\)SO\({}_{4}\) + 2 HCN

The reaction mixture is kept cold (at 10-20\({}^{\circ}\)C) to ensure that HCN remains as a liquid.

## Mechanism

The mechanism of the nucleophilic addition with HCN involves two steps:

_Step 1:_ The carbonyl carbon is attacked by the CN\({}^{-}\) nucleophilic

The CN\({}^{-}\) ion acts as nucleophilic and attacks the electron-deficient carbonyl carbon breaking the n-bond of the C=O.

This leads to the formation of a stable tetrahedral intermediate anion (an alkoxide ion).

This is the rate-determining step.

_Step 2:_ Protonation of the intermediate to give a cyanohydrin

The CN\({}^{-}\) nucleophilic is regenerated.

KineticsThis nucleophilic addition mechanism is _bimolecular_, as it involves both the carbonyl compound and the nucleophilic :CN\({}^{-}\) in the _rate-determining_ step. Hence, the rate equation is:

\[\text{rate}=k\text{ [carbonyl compound] [CN}^{-}\]

To increase the rate of reaction, the following methods are used:

1. _add a trace amount of KCN as catalyst_
2. HCN is a weak acid, which only partially ionises in water to give CN\({}^{-}\). \[\text{HCN}+\text{H}_{2}\text{O}\rightleftharpoons H_{3}\text{O}^{+}+\text{CN}^{-} K_{a}=6.2\times 10^{-10}\text{ mol dm}^{-3}\]
3. The reaction takes place very slowly if only HCN is used because the solution contains a very low concentration of CN\({}^{-}\) ions.
4. The reaction can be speeded up by adding a trace amount of KCN, a salt which completely dissociates to provide free CN\({}^{-}\) ions. \[\text{KCN (aq) }\rightarrow\text{ K}^{+}\text{(aq) }+\text{ CN}^{-}\text{(aq)}\]
5. CN\({}^{-}\) ions used in the addition reaction are regenerated at the end of the reaction as shown in the mechanism.

#### 4.2.2 add a small amount of base (e.g. NaOH)

\[\text{HCN}+\text{H}_{2}\text{O}\rightleftharpoons H_{3}\text{O}^{+}+\text{CN}^{-}\]

When a small amount of base is added, the H\({}_{3}\)O\({}^{-}\) ions are neutralised, which by Le Chatelier's Principle, shifts the position of the above equilibrium to the right such that the concentration of the CN\({}^{-}\) increases. Hence the rate of reaction increases.

#### Stereochemistry

The geometry about the carbonyl carbon atom in aldehydes and ketones is planar. Hence the nucleophile can attack the \(\delta\)+ carbonyl carbon atom in equal probability from the top or bottom of the plane, producing equal amounts of both enantiomers to give a racemic mixture, if the resulting \(sp^{3}\) carbon is chiral.

Refer to the similar circumstances leading to the formation of racemic mixtures in Topic 11 Alkenes and Topic 15 Halogen Derivatives. In electrophilic addition and S\({}_{n}\)L mechanisms, the **geometry about** the _positively-charged carbon in the carbocation intermediate_ is also **planar**, allowing a nucleophilic to attack from either side of the plane with equal probability.

#### Importance of cyanohydrins in synthesis

Nucleophilic addition with CN- ion is an important method of lengthening the carbon chain by carbon (step-up reaction).

The cyanohydrin product can be easily converted to other usable forms since the nitrile group (-CN) can be converted to other functional groups such as:

carboxylic acids by acid hydrolysis using mineral acids such as dilute H\({}_{2}\)SO\({}_{4}\)

carboxylate salts by alkaline hydrolysis using alkalis such as dilute NaOH

amines by reduction using lithium aluminium hydride (LiA/H\({}_{4}\)) in dry ether or hydrogen with nickel catalyst

#### Exercise 4.1

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:556]

#### 4.2.2 Condensation reaction with 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine (2,4-DNPH)

_LO 11.6(a): describe the use of 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine (2,4-DNPH) to detect the presence of carbonyl compounds_

2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine, also known as Brady's reagent, is a yellow solution. It reacts with aldehydes and ketones to form a 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazone derivative, which is an orange precipitate. A water molecule is eliminated in the reaction. This is a characteristic test for the presence of aldehydes and ketones.

### 4.3 Reduction

Aldehydes and ketones undergo reduction to form primary and secondary alcohols respectively.

#### 4.3.1 Comparing reducing agents LiA/H\({}_{4}\) and NaBH\({}_{4}\)

Lithium aluminium hydride (LiA/H\({}_{4}\)) and sodium borohydride (NaBH\({}_{4}\)) are useful hydride reagents that can reduce aldehydes and ketones in excellent yields.

LiA/H\({}_{4}\) is a grayish powder that is soluble in ether. It reacts violently with water to form H\({}_{2}\) gas and decomposes explosively when heated above 120 \({}^{\circ}\)C. NaBH\({}_{4}\) is a white, crystalline solid that can be handled in the open atmosphere and used in either water or alcohol solution.

Due to the hazardous nature of LiA/H\({}_{4}\) and ether (which forms highly explosive mixtures in air), the use of NaBH\({}_{4}\) is usually preferred.

Both LiA/H\({}_{4}\) and NaBH\({}_{4}\) can be considered as sources of the nucleophilic hydride anion, H\({}^{-}\). They both have hydrogen atoms covalently bonded to aluminium and boron respectively and because hydrogen is more electronegative than aluminium and boron, the hydrogen atoms will bear the negative charge, making it a good nucleophile. As such, LiA/H\({}_{4}\) and NaBH\({}_{4}\) are able to react with aldehydes and ketones bearing the polar C=O group with an electron-deficient carbon.

Aluminium is less electronegative than boron, thus more of the negative charge in the A/H\({}_{4}\) ion is borne by the hydrogen atoms. Therefore, LiA/H\({}_{4}\) is a much stronger reducing agent, and is much less selective than NaBH\({}_{4}\).

Both LiA/H\({}_{4}\) and NaBH\({}_{4}\) do not reduce the non-polar electron-rich alkene group. The alkene functional group is reduced using H\({}_{2}\)(g) over a nickel catalyst. Refer to Topic 6 Reaction Kinetics for the mechanism of this heterogeneous catalysis reaction.

### Oxidation

_LO 11.6(e): deduce the nature (aldehyde or ketone) of an unknown carbonyl compound from the results of simple tests (i.e. Fehling's and Tollens' reagents; ease of oxidation)_

The aldehyde group undergoes oxidation reactions with acidified potassium dichronate(VI), Tollens' reagent and Fehling's solution, while the ketone group does not. As such, these three tests are good distinguishing tests between aldehydes and ketones.

#### 4.4.1 Oxidation with acidified potassium dichronate(VI) or acidified potassium manganate(VII)

Aldehyde has a hydrogen atom attached directly to the carbonyl carbon. This enables it to be oxidised to carboxylic acids.

\begin{tabular}{l l} \hline Reagents and conditions: & \(\text{K}_{2}\text{Cr}_{2}\text{O}_{7}\) / dilute H\({}_{2}\text{SO}_{4}\) or KMnO\({}_{4}\) / dilute H\({}_{2}\text{SO}_{4}\), heat under reflux \\ Comments: & Orange solution (Cr\({}_{2}\text{O}_{7}\)-) turns green (Cr\({}^{3+}\)) or \\ Purple solution (MnO\({}_{4}\)-) turns colourless (Mn\({}^{2+}\)) \\ \hline \end{tabular}

Ketones do not have a hydrogen atom attached directly to the carbonyl carbon, thus are not easily oxidised.

\begin{tabular}{l l} \hline
**Exercise 4.3** & \\ How would you oxidise only the aldehyde group in cinnaldehyde to carboxylic acid? & \\ \end{tabular}

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:560]

#### 4.4.3 With Fehling's reagent

Fehling's reagent is an alkaline solution of copper(ll) tartrate.

Aldehydes (except benzaldehyde and its derivatives) reduce the copper(ll) in Fehling's reagent to the reddish-brown copper(l) oxide, which is precipitated.

**Reagents and**:
**conditions:**:
**Observations:**:
**Reddish-brown (brick-red) precipitate formed**:
**Comments:**:
**Ketones, benzaldehyde and its derivatives do not reduce Fehling's reagent.**:
**In fact, benzaldehyde undergoes disproportionation instead due to the presence of NaOH in Fehling's reagent.**:
**Fehling's reagent deteriorates on keeping, and is usually prepared in two parts which are added together just before the test is carried out.**:
**It consists of:**:
**1. Fehling's solution A (CuSO\({}_{4}\) solution) and**:
**2. Fehling's solution B (sodium potassium tartrate + excess NaOH)**:
**HO\({}_{\text{CO}^{2}}\)**:**:
**A deep blue solution is obtained on mixing the two solutions owing to the formation of copper(ll) tartrate, the tartrate ions present prevent the precipitation of Cu(OH)\({}_{2}\) by complexing with the copper(ll) ions.**

### Tri-iodomethane (iodoform) Test

_LO 11.6(f): deduce the presence of a CH\({}_{3}\)CO\(-\) group in a carbonyl compound from its reaction with alkaline aqueous iodine to form tri-iodomethane_

This test specifically identifies aldehydes and ketones with the structure:

"R" can be a hydrogen atom or a hydrocarbon group (alkyl or aryl).

If "R" is hydrogen, the compound is ethanol, CH\({}_{3}\)CHO. Ethanol is the only aldehyde that gives positive tri-iodomethane test.

**Note:**

This reaction breaks a C-C bond and removes a methyl (-CH\({}_{3}\)) group. It is therefore a useful method of shortening a carbon chain by a single carbon atom (step-down reaction).

Recall: Alcohols with the structure below also give a positive tri-iodomethane test. Refer to the tri-iodomethane test in Topic 16 Hydroxy Compounds.

(i) butanal and butanone

(ii) propanone and propan-1-ol

### Nomenclature

Straight chain carboxylic acids are named by replacing the terminal '-e' of the corresponding alkane with "-oic acid". For branched carboxylic acids, find the longest chain containing the -CO\({}_{2}\)H group, and change the terminal '-e' of the parent alkane to the suffix '-oic acid'. The carboxyl carbon is numbered C1.

Compounds that contain the -CO\({}_{2}\)H group bonded to a ring are named using the suffix 'carboxylic acid'. If the carboxyl group is directly attached to an aromatic ring, the suffix used is 'benzoic acid'. The carbon in the ring that is attached to the -CO\({}_{2}\)H group is numbered C1.

For aromatic acids which have 2 -CO\({}_{2}\)H groups attached directly to the benzene ring, it is named as dicarboxylic acids.

\begin{tabular}{c c c}  & **Exercise 1.6** (Worked Example)1. Hydrogen bonding between carboxylic acid molecules is stronger than that between alcohol molecules. This is due to the presence of the electron-withdrawing C=O group causing the 6+ on the H atom to be intensified and the O-H bond to be more polarised in the carboxylic acid.
2. Carboxylic acids can dimerise (in the pure liquid) through hydrogen bonding (diagram below), effectively doubling the number of electrons (or size of electron cloud) in the dimer. This results in stronger dispersion forces between dimers.

### 2.2 Solubility

In non-hydrogen-bonding solvents such as benzene, carboxylic acids can form the hydrogen-bonded dimers. Carboxylic acids, especially those with longer hydrocarbon chains, are generally soluble in such non-polar solvents as dispersion forces can be formed between the solvent molecules and the hydrocarbon chain of the dimers.

In water, the carboxylic acid does not dimerise. The carboxylic acid molecules (the -CO\({}_{2}\)H group) can form hydrogen bonding with the water molecules.

For carboxylic acids with longer hydrocarbon chains, solubility in water decreases as the hydrocarbon chain gets longer. The longer the non-polar hydrocarbon chain, the stronger the dispersion forcesbetween carboxylic acid molecules. Energy released from hydrogen bonding between -CO:H group and water molecules is less than the energy needed to overcome these dispersion forces, as well as the existing hydrogen bonding between water molecules.

Similarly, benzoic acid (a white crystalline solid at room temperature) is only slightly soluble in cold water but dissolves readily in hot water.

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:574]

The halogen (e.g. _CI_), -OH or -NH\({}_{2}\) group exert an electron-withdrawing inductive effect (O and N are electronegative atoms), The more electronegative the halogen atom, the greater the electron-withdrawing effect, the stronger the acid.

The nearer the electron-withdrawing group is to the carboxyl group, the greater the inductive effect, and the stronger the acid. As inductive effect decreases with increasing distance, it becomes insignificant when the electron-withdrawing effect is acting through more than 4 atoms.

The effects of electron-donating and electron-withdrawing groups are also observed for substituted benzoic acids.

The higher the pK\({}_{a}\) value, the weaker the acid. The strength of the acid depends on the stability of its anion. The more stabilised the anion, the stronger the acid.

Ethanol is less acidic than water. The electron donating alkyl group (R) intensifies the negative charge on the alkoxide anion, destabilising it.

Phenol is more acidic than ethanol and water. The negative charge on the phenoxide anion is delocalised over the benzene ring. The negative charge is dispersed and phenoxide anion is stabilised.

Ethanoic acid is more acidic than phenol. The negative charge on the ethanoate anion is delocalised equally over two highly electronegative oxygen atoms. The delocalisation in the ethanoate anion is greater than that in the phenoxide ion so the ethanoate anion is more stabilised than the phenoxide ion.

Chloroethanoloic acid is more acidic than ethanoic acid. The electron-withdrawing chlorine atom in chloroethanoloic acid disperses the negative charge on the carboxylate anion causing it to be more stabilised.

#### 4.1.3 Acid-metal (redox)/acid-base reactions

Like inorganic acids, carboxylic acids react with metals, bases, carbonates and hydrogencarbonate to form salts.

CO2 forms a white ppt when bubbled through limewater.

### Nucleophilic (acyl) Substitution

Carboxylic acid and its derivatives can undergo nucleophilic (acyl) substitution reactions at the C=O carbon, This type of reaction occurs because;

* the C=O carbon has a partial positive charge due to the electronegative O
* the C=O carbon has a planar geometry and is relatively unhindered, which makes it susceptible towards nucleophilic attack.

#### For your information only (not in H2 syllabus)

Nucleophilic (acyl) substitution reactions of carboxylic acids, esters, amides and acyl chlorides involves first the nucleophilic addition of nucleophilic across the C=O, to form a tetrahedral intermediate, followed by elimination of a small molecule of H2O, ROH, NH3 or HCI respectively:

#### 4.2.1 Condensation to form esters

Carboxylic acids can react with alcohols, but not phenols, in a condensation reaction to form esters, when heated in the presence of concentrated sulfuric acid (refer to Topic 16 Hydroxy Compounds).

In this reaction, the C=O bond of the COH group is broken, as evidenced by isotopic labelling (recall this technique under Reaction Mechanisms in Topic 6 Reaction kinetics).

#### 4.2.2 Formation of acyl chlorides

Like alcohols, the \(-\)OH group in carboxylic acids can be replaced with a \(-\)_CI_ group to form acyl chlorides, using the same chlorinating reagents: PCI\({}_{S}\), PCI\({}_{I}\) and SOC\({}_{I}\).

### Physical Properties of Carboxylic Acid Derivatives

#### 5.3.1 Boiling points

Esters and acyl chlorides have lower boiling points than their corresponding carboxylic acids. Their intermolecular **permanent dipole-permanent dipole attractions** are weaker than the hydrogen bonding for carboxylic acids, and require less energy to break. (Esters and acyl chlorides are unable to form intermolecular hydrogen bonding as they lack a hydrogen atom _directly_ attached to a highly electronegative oxygen atom.)

#### 5.3.2 Solubility

Esters are much less soluble in water compared to carboxylic acids and alcohols. Many esters are immiscible with water. Acyl chlorides, on the other hand, hydrolyse in water:

#### 5.3.3 Odour

Acyl chlorides are colourless liquids with a sharp, irritating odour (partly due to the rapid hydrolysis to HCI and carboxylic acids).

Esters are colourless liquids with a pleasant and sweet or fruity smell. Esters are often used in the preparation of perfumes and artificial flavourings.

**Exercise 5.1 (Worked Example)**

Suggest a reason why the boiling point of ethanol chloride is higher than that of 2-chloropropane.

In the ethanol chloride, the C=O group provides a stronger electron-withdrawing effect which results in a larger permanent dipole compared to 2-chloropropane. Hence more energy is required to overcome the stronger permanent-dipole-permanent dipole interactions between ethanol chloride compared to 2-chloropropane.

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:596]

#### Nomenclature

##### 1.1.1 Amines

Simple amines are named by adding the suffix _-amine_ to the name of the longest alkyl group that is attached to the nitrogen atom.

The longest carbon chain containing the amine group is considered the parent structure. Number the alkane chain beginning at the end nearer the amine group.

**Note**: An alternative way of naming amines is to replace the final -e in the name of the parent compound with the suffix _-amine_.

In secondary and tertiary amines, the capital N denotes the location of the substituents directly attached to the nitrogen atom.

If there is a functional group of higher priority, the -NH2 group can be considered as an _amino_ substituent in the prefix.

##### 1.1.2 Amides

Primary amides with an unsubstituted -NH2 group are named by replacing the _-oic acid_ of the parent carboxylic acid with _-amide_.

If the nitrogen atom is further substituted, the location of the substituent group is denoted by a capital N.

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:598]

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:599]

Amides are white crystalline solids at room temperature, apart from methanamide, which is a liquid. Amides, can form extensive intermolecular hydrogen bonds as a result of the polar nature of the N-H bond, and these hydrogen bonds result in relatively high melting and boiling points.

### Solubility in water

Aliphatic amines with four carbon atoms or fewer are readily soluble in water due to their ability to form strong hydrogen bonds with water molecules.

Phenylamines and amines with increasing length of hydrocarbon chain are virtually insoluble in water because the energy released from hydrogen bonding formed between these amines with water is less able to overcome the energy required to overcome the increasing strength of dispersion forces between larger hydrocarbon chains, as well as the existing hydrogen bonding in water. In addition, the non-polar large hydrocarbon skeletons also disrupt the hydrogen bonding with water molecules. These compounds do dissolve, though, in organic solvents, e.g. benzene.

For amides, their ability to form extensive hydrogen bonds with water also means that simple amides are very soluble in water.

## 3 BASICITY OF NITROGEN COMPOUNDS

_LO 19(6): describe and explain the basicity of primary, secondary and tertiary amines in the gaseous phase (interpet as Lewis bases) LO 19(6): explain the relative bosicities of ammonia, ethylamine and phenylamine, in aqueous medium, in terms of their structures_

### Amines

Like ammonia, amines contain a lone pair of electrons on the nitrogen atom that can form a coordinate (dative covalent) bond with a proton. Hence, amines can act as proton-acceptors or Bronsted-Lowry bases. Amines can also act as Lewis bases by donating this electron pair to an acid. (Refer to Topic 4 Reactions and Stoichiometry for the theories of acids and bases.) The basicity of amines depends on the availability of the lone pair of electrons on nitrogen for protonation (or donation to an acid).

#### 3.1.1 Basicity of amines in the gaseous phase (Lewis bases)

In the gaseous phase, aliphatic amines are more basic than ammonia because alkyl groups are electron-donating; they increase the electron density on nitrogen atom, making the lone pair of electrons more available to form a dative bond with an acid.

#### 3.1.2 Basicity of amines in the aqueous medium

When amines are dissolved in water, an equilibrium is established in which the water donates a hydrogen ion to the amine. The extent of this reaction is a measure of the amine's basicity.

\begin{tabular}{l l l l l l} \(\text{RNH}_{2}\) & \(+\) & \(\text{H}_{2}\text{O}\) & \(\text{RNH}_{3}\) & \(+\) & \(\text{OH}^{-}\) & \(\text{OH}^{-}\) \\ Base & Conjugate acid & \(K_{\text{b}}=\frac{[\text{RNH}_{3}^{+}][\text{OH}^{-}]}{[\text{RNH}_{2}]}\) & and \(\text{pK}_{\text{b}}=-\text{lg}\,\text{K}_{\text{b}}\) \\ \end{tabular}

The larger the \(K_{\text{b}}\) values, the greater its basicity; the smaller the pK\({}_{\text{b}}\), the stronger the base.

\begin{tabular}{l l l l l l} \(\text{HWA CHONG}\) & \(\text{HWA CHONG}\) & \(\text{HWA CHONG}\) & \(\text{HWA CHONG}\) & \(\text{HWA CHONG}\) & \(\text{HWA CHONG}\) \\ \end{tabular}

### _Phenylamines_

The p_K_ values below show phenylamines are considerably less basic than ammonia.

This is because in phenylalanine, the lone pair of electron on nitrogen is delocalised into the benzene ring. This decreases the electron density on the nitrogen atom, making the lone pair of electrons less available to form a dative bond with a proton.

Figure 1: _Resonance structure of phenylamines_

Ther relative basicity depends on the nature of the substituent attached to the benzene ring.

### Amides

_10 19(g): explain why amide is neutral in terms of delocalisation of the lone pair of electrons on nitrogen_

Amides give neutral solutions in water (not basic). The delocalisation of the lone pair of electrons on the nitrogen atom over the C=O bond reduces the electron density on the nitrogen atom such that the lone pair of electrons on the nitrogen atom is not available for protonation.

In the aqueous medium, tertiary amines are less basic than expected because the resulting conjugate acids are not as effectively solvated through hydrogen bonding by the surrounding water molecules (absent in gaseous phase) as compared to conjugate acids of primary and secondary amines. Thus, the conjugate acids are less stable, resulting in tertiary amines to ionise in water to a smaller extent.

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:604]

## 5 REACTIONS OF AMINES AND AMIDS

### Amines

The chemistry of amines is dominated by the lone pair of electrons on nitrogen atom. They can behave:

* as bases (donating the lone pair to a H+ ion or an acid)
* as good nucleophiles (being able to attack at the partial positive end of a polarized bond)
* refer to Topic 22; Chemistry of the Transition Elements

#### 5.1.1 Reaction with acids

_LO 19(b); describe the reaction of amines in the formation of salts_

Amines (both aliphatic and phenylamines) can act as a base to react with acids (mineral or carboxylic acids) to form salts.

Amines with bulky R-groups are insoluble in water (forming two immiscible layer when mixed) due to the presence of non-polar hydrocarbon skeleton which hinder the formation of hydrogen bonds with water molecules.

However, soluble ionic salts are formed through acid-base reaction when acids are added. The ionic salts are soluble in water (forming a homogeneous solution as they can form favourable ion-dipole interaction with water molecules) but insoluble in organic solvents. Thus an amine can be separated from other organic compounds by converting it to a water-soluble ammonium salt. You may refer to Topic 8: Introduction to Organic Chemistry on the details of the extraction procedure.

The amines can be regenerated from their corresponding salts by using strong bases, such as NaOH(aq).

#### 5.1.2 Nucleophilic substitution

Primary, secondary/and/tertiary amines can act as a nucleophile to react with halogenalkanes and form secondary amines, tertiary amines and quaternary ammonium salts respectively (refer to Topic 15: Halogen Derivatives).

#### 5.1.3 Condensation

Primary and secondary amines (both aliphatic and phenylamines) can act as a nucleophile to react with acid chlorides to form amides (refer to Topic 18: Carboxylic Acids & Derivatives).

#### 5.1.4 Electrophilic substitution of phenylamine

_LO 19(e): describe the reaction of phenylamine with aqueous bromine_

Phenylamine reacts very quickly with aqueous bromine via an electrophilic substitution mechanism to form a white precipitate. This is similar to the reaction of phenol with bromine (refer to Topic 16: Hydroxy Compounds). Aliphatic amines do not react with bromine.

**Reagents & Conditions**:

**Aboveous bromine, room temperature**

**Observations**:

Yellow-orange solution decolourise; white ppt formed

(White fumes of HBr may not be observed as HBr dissolved in aqueous solution.)

**Comments**:

2,4,6-tribromophenylamine is formed because the -NH\({}_{2}\) group is 2,4-directing. No Lewis acid catalyst (halogen carrier) is required for this reaction, unlike bromination of benzene (which requires _AICI\({}_{3}\)_ or _FeCl\({}_{3}\)_).

**Explanation**:

Like phenol, the lone pair of electrons on the nitrogen atom is delocalised into the benzene ring, the electron density in the ring is greatly increased, making it much more susceptible to electrophilic attack than benzene. Hence, the presence of the -NH\({}_{2}\) group highly activates the benzene ring towards electrophilic substitution and no catalyst is required.

### Amides

_LO 19(h): describe the chemistry of omides, exemplified by the following reactions: (i) hydrolysis on treatment with aqueous alkali or acid (ii) reduction to amines with lithium aluminium hydride_

In amides, the lone pair of electrons on the nitrogen atom is delocalised into the adjacent C=O bond. Thus, the electron density on the nitrogen atom is reduced, making it unable to act as a nucleophile, unlike amines.

The delocalisation also gives good stability to amides and makes them the least reactive of the carboxylic acid derivatives.

**A

#### Reduction of amides

Amides can be reduced to amines by lithium aluminium hydride.

#### 5.2.2 Hydrolysis of amides

Amides can be hydrolysed by aqueous acids (e.g. dil H\({}_{2}\)SO\({}_{4}\)) or alkalis (e.g. dil NaOH) when heated under reflux to yield the carboxylic acid or salt respectively. Although the exact same bond is cleaved in both acidic and alkaline hydrolysis, the products of hydrolysis depend on the pH of the environment.

### Acid-Base behaviour (Application Example)

Having both the acidic and basic groups, amino acids are amphoteric, reacting with both acids and bases to form ionic salts.

Figure 6.1: (Worked Example) Draw the structures of the major species of lysine that can exist in aqueous solution of various pH. Start with the species in a solution of very low pH and consider the change in structure as pH increases. Hence identify the major species that exists at isoelectric point.

### Titration curves of amino acids (Application Example)

Titration of amino acids are very similar to the titration of polyprotic acids. Refer to Topic 14 Acid-Base Equilibria for titration curves and polyprotic acids.

Using glycine as an example,

At pH < 2.34, all possible sites of glycine are protonated. Since -CO2H group is a stronger acid than NH3 group, the stronger acidic -CO2H group will be neutralised first by the addition of base, OH-, followed by the -NH3 group. The reaction is as follows:

In the titration curve, the protonated (cationic) form of glycine was titrated against NaOH of same concentration. The cationic form predominates at low pH before OH- is added. When some OH- is added, a portion of the cationic form undergoes neutralisation to form zwitterion, resulting in buffer region X (mixture of cationic form and zwitterion).

Note that when 0.5 equivalent of OH- is added, amount of cationic form unreacted = amount of zwitterion formed. This is the maximum buffering capacity where pH=pK4.

The solution only contains zwitterion when at the first equivalence point and pH = pI of glycine.

As more OH- is added, the -NH3 group is neutralised to form the anionic form, leading to a new buffer mixture containing zwitterion and the anionic form in region Y. Note that when 1.5 equivalent of OH- is added, amount of zwitterion unreacted = amount of anionic form produced. This is the maximum buffering capacity where pH=pK4.

At the second equivalence point and beyond, all sites are de-protonated and the solution only contains the anionic form of glycine.

In the above set-up (Figure 1), Zn and Cu\({}^{2+}\)ions are in the same beaker so the electrons are transferred **directly** from Zn to Cu\({}^{2+}\) hence no electrical energy can be generated. If, however, the half-reactions are physically separated in an **electrochemical cell** (Figure 2), we can harness the electrical energy from the spontaneous reaction. Each half-reaction occurs in a **half-cell**. The electrons are now "forced" to move through an external circuit, resulting in an electric current. The electrical energy produced can be used to operate electrical devices such as a light bulb. Hence, an electrochemical cell is essentially a battery.

We will discuss more about half-cells and electrochemical cells in Section 2 and Section 3 respectively.

## 2 HAL-CELL AND ELECTRODE POTENTIAL

### HAL-CELL

In every half-reaction, there is an oxidised form and a reduced form. An oxidised form in equilibrium with the reduced form makes a **half-cell**.

\[\text{oxidised form + ne}^{-}\rightleftharpoons\text{reduced form}\]

For a half-cell containing a metal placed in a solution containing its ions, M\({}^{n+}\) is the oxidised form while M is the reduced form.

\[\text{M}^{n+}(\text{aq})+\text{ne}^{-}\rightleftharpoons\text{M}(\text{s})\]

At equilibrium, the rate of M dissolving into the solution as M\({}^{n+}\) is equal to the rate of M\({}^{n+}\) reforming M. The position of equilibrium depends on the reactivity of the metal. The more reactive the metal, the more the position of equilibrium lies on the left.

Consider a reactive metal such as Zn. As Zn tends to dissolve into the solution to form Zn\({}^{2+}\) ions, there is a build-up of electrons on the Zn rod. This results in a negative charge on the Zn rod which is surrounded by a layer of positive ions (Figure 3). A potential difference develops between the metal and its solution. This is the **electrode potential** of the metal (symbol: \(E[\text{M}^{n+}/\text{M}]\)).

### HWA CNO\({}_{3}\)

Figure 2: An electrochemical cell consisting of a Zn\({}^{2+}\)/Zn half-cell and a Cu\({}^{2+}\)/Cu half-cell

We cannot measure the absolute electrode potential of a half-cell. In practice, the electrode potential of a half-cell has to be measured by connecting it to a reference half-cell (Section 2.1.1).

Besides the metal-metal ion half-cell, a half-cell can also consist of a non-metal in contact with its aqueous ions (Figure 4) or ions of the same element in different oxidation states (Figure 5).

In half-cells that consist of a metal and its ions (e.g. Zn\({}^{2+}\)/Zn), the metal acts as the **electrode** which is used to transfer electrons in the electrochemical cell: In half-cells that do not include a metal, platinum (Pt) is usually used as the **inert electrode**. It transfers electrons without taking part in the reaction.

Figure 3: Zn\({}^{2+}\)/Zn half-cell

#### 2.1.1 Standard Hydrogen Electrode

_LO12(c): describe the standard hydrogen electrode_

The **standard hydrogen electrode** (Figure 6) is a commonly used reference half-cell or reference electrode against which the electrode potential of all other half-cells are measured. Its electrode potential is assigned a value of **0.00 V**.

The standard hydrogen electrode comprises:

* a platinum wire and a piece of platinum foil covered with finely divided platinum (**platinised platinum**) that serves as an inert surface for redox reaction to take place,
* a solution of **1 mol dm-3 H-(aq)** ions, in which the platinum electrode, encased in a glass tube, is immersed,
* hydrogen gas at a pressure of **1 bar** and **298 k** bubbling over the electrode.

On the surface of the platinum, equilibrium is established between hydrogen gas and hydrogen ions.

### Measuring Standard Electrode (redox) Potential, \(E^{\circ}\)

_LO12(b)(l): define the term standard electrode (redox) potential_.

Electrode potential_; \(E_{i}\) depends on the position of equilibrium so its value depends on conditions such as temperature, pressure and concentration (to be discussed in Section 3.4.1). As such, electrode potentials are measured under a set of standard conditions.

Standard conditions for measuring electrode potential are:

* temperature of **298 K**
* pressure of **1 bar** for any gas
* concentration of **1 mol dm-3** for any aqueous ions / species

### Understanding Standard Electrode Potential, \(E^{\bullet}\)

Standard electrode potentials, \(E^{\bullet}\) values, can be obtained from the _Data Booklet_. By convention, the half-reactions are written as reductions (i.e. electrons are written on the left). Hence \(E^{\bullet}\)value is also called standard reduction potential or standard redox potential.

For example, in the _Data Booklet_, we see:

\(Cr_{2}O_{2}\)- 14H+ 6e- 22Cr3+ 7H2O +1.33 V

This means that the "standard reduction potential of \(Cr_{2}O_{2}\)- (to be reduced to Cr3+)" is +1.33 V. We can also write "\(E^{\bullet}Cr_{2}O_{2}\)- 1.33 V.

When the half-reaction is reversed, the \(E^{\bullet}\)of the reversed half-reaction will have the same magnitude but opposite sign.

Using the same example as above:

\(2Cr^{3+}+7H_{2}O=Cr_{2}O_{2}\)- 14H+ 6e- -1.33 V

The value -1.33 V is the standard oxidation potential of Cr3+ (to be oxidised to Cr2O,2-) and is less commonly used.

The standard electrode potential (or standard reduction potential) is a measure of how favourable the forward reduction process is.

The **more positive** the \(E^{\bullet}\)value, the **more favourable** the forward **reduction** half-reaction.

The **more negative** the \(E^{\bullet}\)value, the **more favourable** the backward **oxidation** half-reaction.

Multiplying a half-equation by a factor will not change the \(E^{\bullet}\)value (as it is an intensive property.

Example:

\(Ag^{\bullet}\)(aq) + \(e^{\bullet}\rightleftharpoons Ag(s)\)

\(E^{\bullet}\) = +0.80 V

\(2Ag^{\bullet}\)(aq) + \(2e^{\bullet}\rightleftharpoons 2Ag(s)\)

\(E^{\bullet}\) = +0.80 V

_Intensive Property and Extensive Property (Background Info)_

Intensive property is a physical property that does not depend on the amount of substance present.

Examples: density, concentration

Examples: volume, mass

### Standard cell potential, \(E^{\bullet}\)_cell_

_LO12(0)(ii): define the term standard cell potential_

If the two half-cells that make the electrochemical cell are at standard conditions, the cell potential is the standard cell potential, \(E^{\bullet}\)_cell.

The standard cell potential is the potential difference between two half-cells measured at standard conditions (298 K, 1 bar for gases, 1 mol dm\({}^{-3}\) for solutions).

_LO12(e): calculate a standard cell potential by combining two standard electrode potentials_

The standard cell potential, \(E^{\bullet}\)_cell, can be calculated by combining two standard electrode potentials.

Consider the electrochemical cell in Figure 2 (Section 3.1). The standard electrode potentials of the two half-cells are:

The voltmeter shows a reading of +1.10 V which is equal to the standard cell potential. Notice that this value is the numerical difference between the \(E^{\bullet}\) values of the two half-cells.

Hence,

Remember to include the sign (+) or (-) as well as the units (V) for \(E^{\bullet}\)_cell.

In general, to calculate \(E^{\bullet}\)_cell of an electrochemical cell, we

select the two standard electrode potentials from the _Data Booklet_

decide which half-cell undergoes reduction and which half-cell undergoes oxidation

In an **electrochemical cell, reduction** occurs in the half-cell with the **more positive \(E^{\bullet}\)value**.

**Oxidation** occurs in the half-cell with a **less positive \(E^{\bullet}\)value**. The electrode in the reduction half-cell is the **cathode** while the electrode in the oxidation half-cell is the **anode**.

In the above example, since \(E^{\bullet}\) (Cu\({}^{2+}\)/Cu) is _more positive_ than \(E^{\bullet}\) (Zn\({}^{2+}\)/Zn), _reduction_ occurs in the Cu\({}^{2+}\)/Cu half-cell and Cu is the cathode while oxidation occurs in the Zn\({}^{2+}\)/Zn half-cell and Zn is the anode.

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:633]

### Standard Cell Potential and Gibbs' Free Energy

_LO12(i)part: state and apply the relationship \(\Delta G=-nF\)e\({}^{\alpha}\) to electrochemical cells_

In Topic 5, we discussed the change in Gibbs free energy, \(\Delta G\), that accompanies chemical reactions. The change in Gibbs free energy of a redox reaction can be converted into electrical energy in an electrochemical cell.

The following equation shows the relationship between Gibbs' free energy change and cell potential:

\[\Delta G^{\bullet}=nF\,E^{\bullet}_{\text{cell}}\]

where \(\Delta G^{\bullet}\) is the standard Gibbs free energy change in joules per mole (\(\lambda\) mol\({}^{-1}\)),

n is the number of moles of electrons transferred per mole of the cell reaction and

F is the Faraday's constant (96500 C mol\({}^{-1}\)).

Hence, a spontaneous redox reaction (\(\Delta G<0\)) would imply that \(E_{\text{cell}}>0\).

We will use \(\Delta G^{\bullet}=-nF\,E^{\bullet}_{\text{cell}}\) in calculations in Section 3.5.

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:635]

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:636]

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:637]

#### Limitations of Using Standard Cell Potentials

LO12(g): understand the limitations in the use of standard cell potentials to predict the spontaneity of a reaction

Using \(E^{\bullet}_{\text{cell}}\) to predict the spontaneity of a reaction may not be correct for two reasons:

* **Non-standard conditions** \(E^{\bullet}_{\text{cell}}\) values apply only to standard conditions (298 K, 1 bar, 1 mol dm\({}^{-3}\)). Since changes in concentration, pressure and temperature may affect the values of electrode potentials, they will also affect the cell potential calculated and hence the prediction.
* **High activation energy (energetic vs kinetic feasibility)**

Similar to \(\Delta\)G, \(E^{\bullet}\)values cannot predict the rate of a redox reaction. It only tells us whether a reaction is **thermodynamically feasible** i.e. spontaneous. No information is given about the kinetic feasibility, which is related to activation energy.

For example, \(E^{\bullet}\)values predict that Cu\({}^{2+}\)(aq) should oxidise H\({}_{2}\)(g) to H\({}^{+}\)(aq).

However, in practice, no reaction, occurs when hydrogen is bubbled into copper(n) sulfate solution at r.t.p. because the reaction rate is effectively zero due to a very high activation barrier.

### Calculation of \(E^{\bullet}\) for combined half reactions

_1012(i):apr: apply AG = -nfE* to electrochemical cells, including the calculation of \(E^{\bullet}\) for combined half reactions_

\(E^{\bullet}\)values cannot be combined directly to evaluate the \(E^{\bullet}\) for another half-reaction.

Consider the following three redox half-equations:

The sum of half-equations (1) and (2) gives half-equation (3), but \(E^{\bullet}\)s is **not** +0.33 V (sum of \(E^{\bullet}\)s and \(E^{\bullet}\)s). The number of electrons transferred in each half-reaction must be taken into account. To find the \(E^{\bullet}\)value of combined half reactions, we use the relationship \(\Delta\)G\({}^{2}\)= -nfE*.

Using the above example, we shall first convert the relevant \(E^{\bullet}\)values to \(\Delta\)G:

(1) Fe\({}^{2+}\) + 2e\({}^{-}\) Fe\({}^{3}\) = -0.44 V \(\Delta\)G\({}^{5}\) = -(2)(96500)(-0.44) + +84920 J mol\({}^{-1}\)

(2) Fe\({}^{2+}\) + Fe\({}^{2+}\) + Fe\({}^{2+}\) + 0.77 V \(\Delta\)G\({}^{5}\) = -(1)(96500)(+0.77) = -74305 J mol\({}^{-1}\)

Using Hess' Law, \(\Delta\)G\({}^{5}\)s = \(\Delta\)G\({}^{5}\) + \(\Delta\)G\({}^{5}\) = +84920 + (-74305) + +10615 J mol\({}^{-1}\)

Since \(\eta\) = 3 for half-equation (3),\(E^{\bullet}\)s = \(\Delta\)G\({}^{5}\) / nF = -10615/(3 x 96500) = -0.04 V

# Practical applications of electrochemical cells

Ud12(k): state the possible advantages of developing other types of cell, e.g. the H\({}_{2}\)/O\({}_{2}\) fuel cell, and improved batteries (as in electric vehicles) in terms of smaller size, lower mass and higher voltage

Fuel cells (Section 4.1) and batteries (Section 4.2) are two common examples of electrochemical cells that provide a portable and convenient way of obtaining energy from chemical reactions.

Hydrogen-oxygen fuel cells have been used for years to provide electricity and pure water during space. flights. Similar ones are being used to supply electric power for transportation (e.g. electric vehicles), residential and commercial needs.

#### Advantages of fuel cells

No pollution

High efficiency and good energy-to-mass ratio

They convert about 75% of the chemical energy of the fuel into useable power as compared to 40% for a coal-fired power plant and 20-25% for a gasoline-powered car engine.

Disadvantages of fuel cells

Expensive

High temperature to operate

The electrode reactions are slow, even when the electrodes are made of platinum which acts as a catalyst.

The alkali may absorb CO\({}_{2}\) from air to form carbonates that clog up the porous electrodes.

Bulky storage of fuel

For cars, the hydrogen must be transported either in cylinders (heavy) or at very low temperatures as a liquid. Efforts are made to carry the hydrogen in the form of transition metal hydrides but these are costly and can absorb only a limited amount of hydrogen. As an alternative to transporting hydrogen to fuel cars, methanol is a fuel that is easy to carry and can be broken down to produce carbon dioxide and hydrogen (which is then used as the fuel in the H\({}_{2}\)/O\({}_{2}\) fuel cell). However, there is the danger that some poisonous carbon monoxide may be produced in addition to the carbon dioxide.

Despite steady progress, the focus of current fuel cell research remains on lowering costs by improving membrane conductivity and developing more efficient catalysts.

Although the operation of a battery is similar in principle to that of the electrochemical cells described in Section 3.1, a battery has the advantage of being completely self-contained and required no auxiliary components such as salt bridges.

The trend in developing improved batteries is to look for batteries with

smaller size

lower mass

higher voltage

longer shelf-life

lower production cost

### Fuel Cells (Background Info and Application Example)

When a fuel is burnt in a power station, the heat is usually used to produce steam to drive a piston or to turn the blades of a turbine. The overall efficiency is always low \(\overline{\mathrm{n}\mathrm{o}}\) matter how well the plant is designed.

In order to achieve higher efficiencies, efforts have been made to convert the chemical energy of a fuel _directly_ into electrical energy by means of a **fuel cell**. In contrast to batteries, the reactants in a fuel cell are supplied _continuously_ and the cell is able to operate without theoretical limit as long as the supply of reactants is maintained.

The fuel (e.g. hydrogen, a hydrocarbon or an alcohol) and an oxidant (usually oxygen) enter the fuel cell, and the products leave, generating electricity through the controlled oxidation of the fuel. The fuel _does not burn_ because, as in other batteries, the half-reactions are separated and the electrons are transferred through an external circuit.

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:646]

In both cells, oxidation takes place at the anode and reduction takes place at the cathode. However, the **polarities of the electrodes are reversed.** To understand this, keep in mind the following:

* In an electrochemical cell, electrons are generated at the anode, so the anode is negative (having excess electrons), and electrons are consumed at the cathode, so the cathode is positive (lack of electrons).
* In an electrolytic cell, the electrons come from an external power source e.g. a battery, which _supplies electrons_ to the **cathode**, so the cathode is **negative** (excess electrons), and _removes electrons from_ the **anode**, so the anode is **positive** (lack of electrons).

## 6 Predicting the products of electrolysis

_LO12(m): predict the identity of the substance liberated during electrolysis from the state of electrolyte (molten or aqueous), position in the redox series (electrode potential) and concentration_

In an electrolytic cell the cathode is negative so **cations** are attracted to the **cathode** and are **reduced**. On the other hand, the anode is positive so **anions** are attracted to the **anode** and are **oxidised**.

When there is more than one species that can be oxidised or reduced, the substance that is liberated at each electrode is the one that requires the least energy. This is called **selective discharge** which depends on:

* electrode potential, \(\varepsilon\) values
* At the **cathode**, the **reduction** of the species with the **more positive** (or less negative) electrode potential occurs.
* At the **anode**, the **oxidation** of the species with the **more negative** (or less positive) electrode potential occurs.
* concentration of the ion (which affects the electrode potential (recall Section 3.4.1)
* nature of the electrode

### **Electrolysis of pure molten salts**

Predicting the product at each electrode is simple if the salt contains one cation and one anion.

Figure 18: _Electrolysis of molten Pb_f_2 = 373 °C, m.p. of Pb = 327 °C, b.p. of Br = 58.8 °C

### 6.2 **Electrolysis of dilute aqueous solutions**

Aqueous salt solutions are mixtures of ions and water, so we have to compare the electrode potentials of the ions and water to predict the products at each electrode.

Water is a polar molecule so it can also be attracted to the electrodes and be discharged. In aqueous salt solutions, water is the solvent and present in large excess while the concentrations of H\({}^{+}\) and OH\({}^{+}\) ions are very low (in pure water at 25 \({}^{\circ}\)C, [H\({}^{+}\)] and [OH\({}^{+}\)] are 10\({}^{-7}\) mol dm\({}^{-3}\) each). Hence, we consider the **reduction of H\({}_{2}\)O** (not H\({}^{+}\)) at the cathode and the **oxidation of H\({}_{2}\)O** (not OH\({}^{+}\)) at the anode. H\({}^{+}\) and OH\({}^{+}\) ions are discharged only when the electrolyte contains aqueous acid or alkali respectively.

Consider the electrolysis of aqueous NaCl solution using platinum electrodes.

At the **cathode** (negative electrode), the possible reduction and their electrode potentials are:

Since \(E^{\bullet}\)(H\({}_{2}\)O/H\({}_{2}\)) is more positive than \(E^{\bullet}\)(Na\({}^{+}\)/Na), H\({}_{2}\)O has a higher tendency to be reduced than Na\({}^{+}\) so H\({}_{2}\)O is preferentially reduced.

Note: Cations of highly reactive metals e.g. Na\({}^{+}\) are not reduced in aqueous solution. H\({}_{2}\)O is always reduced in preference.

At the **anode** (positive electrode), the possible oxidation and their electrode potentials are:

Since \(E^{\bullet}\)(O\({}_{2}\)/H\({}_{2}\)O) is less positive (or more negative) than \(E^{\bullet}\)(Cl\({}_{2}\)/Cl\({}^{+}\)), H\({}_{2}\)O has a higher tendency to be oxidised than \(Cl^{\prime}\) so H\({}_{2}\)O is preferentially oxidised.

Reaction at anode; 2H\({}_{2}\)O(\(I\)) \(O_{2}\)(g) + 4H\({}^{+}\)(aq) + 4e\({}^{-}\)

Overall reaction: 2H\({}_{2}\)O(\(I\)) \(O_{2}\)(g) + 2H\({}_{2}\)(g)The above is effectively the electrolysis of water. Pure water is not used because very few ions are present to conduct the current ([H\({}^{+}\)] = [OH] = 10-7mol dm\({}^{-3}\)). The electrolyte used is often an aqueous solution like aqueous sodium chloride.

**Exercise 6.2** (N2006/3/1a modified)

Predict the products formed at the anode, and at the cathode, when the following liquids are electrolysed using inert electrodes.

**i)** NaBr(aq)

**ii)** CuF\({}_{2}\)(aq)

In each case explain your reasoning, using data from the _Data Booklet_: Write equations, including state symbols, for the electrode reactions.

**Exercise 6.3** (197/2/3a)

The electrolysis of aqueous sodium sulfate containing litmus indicator was carried out in the apparatus illustrated. Inert electrodes were used. After some time, the volumes of gas liberated were as shown in the diagram. The litmus in both electrode compartments had changed colour.

**a)** Write the appropriate ion-electron half-equations, with state symbols, for the changes which take place in each electrode compartment. Indicate whether oxidation or reduction has occurred.

The negative electrode:

The positive electrode:

**b)** Hence explain why the gas volumes are in the ratio 2:1.

**c)** State and explain the colour of the litmus around each electrode.

**HVA CHONG**

### 6.3 _Electrolysis of concentrated aqueous solutions_

Ions which are present in high concentrations may be preferentially discharged even though its standard electrode potential suggests otherwise: This is because changes in concentration may affect the value of the electrode potential.

Consider the electrolysis of concentrated NaCl solution (brine) using platinum electrodes.

At the anode (positive electrode), the possible oxidation and their electrode potentials are:

The high _C_' concentration in brine causes the position of equilibrium (I) to shift to the left. _E_(_Cl_/_Cl_') **decreases and becomes less positive than _E_(O_2/_H_2O_). Thus, _Cl_' is preferentially oxidised at the anode.

At the cathode (negative electrode), the possible reduction and their electrode potentials are:

In this case, the difference between _E_(Na*/Na) and _E_(H_2O/H_2) is too large, hence the effects of concentration is not enough to cause Na* to be reduced.

The electrolysis of brine is used in the industrial production of chlorine. In addition to chlorine, sodium hydroxide is also obtained as a useful by-product.

_Overvoltage (Background Info)_

The production of H2 and O2 by electrolysis often requires a greater voltage than is predicted by the standard electrode potentials. We say that H2 and O2 need an **overvoltage** before they are discharged. This overvoltage is required to overcome the high activation energy. Hence, in the electrolysis of brine, the overvoltage to form O2 and the high [_C_'] makes it easier to form _Cl_2.

## 8 Applications of Electrolvisis

### Electrolytic purification of copper

_L012(0)(ii): explain, in terms of the electrode reactions, the industrial process of: (ii) the electrolytic purification of copper_

Copper is a good conductor of electricity, and is used extensively to make electrical wiring and components. The extraction of copper from copper ore is done by reduction with carbon. However, the copper produced is not pure enough for use as a conductor, so it is purified using electrolysis.

Electrolyte: CuSO4(aq)

Anode: impure copper

Cathode: pure copper

During electrolysis, the voltage used is such that copper at the anode will be oxidised into Cu2* ions.

Reaction at anode: Cu(s) Cu2*(aq) + 2e

* Metal impurities that have _E*_values less positive than _E*_(Cu2*/Cu) are more readily oxidised than Cu. They will also be oxidised and enter the electrolyte as the **metal ions**.
* Metal impurities that have _E*_values more positive than _E*_(Cu2*/Cu) will **not be oxidised** at the anode. These metals will stay as solid metal and eventually drop off as **anode sludge**.

At the cathode, the Cu2* ions in the electrolyte are **preferentially reduced**. Hence more copper deposits onto the pure copper cathode.

Reaction at cathode: Cu2*(aq) + 2e- Cu(s)

* The metal ions that came from the metal impurities which dissolved at the anode have _E*_values that are **less positive** than _E*_(Cu*/Cu). These ions are **less easily reduced** than Cu2* ions. They are not reduced and remain in the electrolyte.

Overall, there is a net transfer of copper from the impure copper anode to the cathode. The anode decreases in mass and the cathode increases in mass. Metal impurities that are above copper in the electrochemical series (e.g. Zn, Fe) will remain in the electrolyte as ions while those below copper in the series (e.g. Ag, Au) will form the anode sludge.

# Looking Back

In this topic, we will study the trends in chemical properties of elements and their compounds. It is essential to recall knowledge from earlier topics on Atomic Structure & Physical Periodicity and Chemical Bonding ionisation energy trends and electronegativity have an impact on the types of the bonding found in compounds, and this will in turn affect their physical properties. To explain chemical properties and trends, concepts on redox reactions, electrode potential and acid-base behaviour are also relevant.

Periodicity is the study of repeating patterns in the physical and chemical properties of the elements in the periodic table.

The arrangement in the periodic table is closely related to the electronic configuration of the elements.

In the periodic table, elements are arranged in order of increasing proton number.

Prior to 1913, Mendeleev's Periodic Table, which arranged elements according to _atomic mass_, was widely accepted by chemists though there were inconsistencies. Then in 1913, Henry Moseley, using new technology (X-ray electron gun) at that time, showed the link between _atomic number_ and element's position in the table, which addressed the inconsistencies and led to the Periodic Table we use today.

The period number is the same as the number of quantum shells. Elements in the same period show a periodic change in their chemical and physical properties across the period.

Thus, knowledge of periodicity is useful in understanding and predicting the physical and chemical behaviour of elements.

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:665]

## 3 Variation in Oxidation Number of Period 3 Oxides and Chlorides

_LO 5(E)(I): for elements across the third period; state and explain the variation in the highest oxidation number of the elements in oxides (for NaO; MgO; Al;O\({}_{Si}\); SiO; P,O\({}_{15}\) SO) and chlorides (for NaCl; MgO; Al;Cl; SiCl; PCls)_

The following diagram and table summarise the oxidation numbers that are found in the oxides and chlorides of Period 3 elements.

A few trends can be observed across the period:

* Oxidation numbers of the elements in their oxides are always positive (except for fluorine, where O.N. of F is -1 in F\({}_{2}\)O) as oxygen is the most electronegative element other than fluorine.
* From Na to _CI_, there is a regular increase in the number of O and _CI_ atoms that can combine with an atom of the element.
* The maximum positive oxidation number shown by an element often corresponds to the number of valence electrons in an atom of the element.
* e.g. phosphorus has 5 valence electrons and thus has a maximum oxidation number of +5.
* From left to right, the elements show increasing variation in possible oxidation numbers: e.g.
* In their oxides and chlorides, the metals Na, Mg and Al display only one possible oxidation number each, corresponding to the loss of all their valence electrons.
* P, S and _CI_ exhibit a wider range of oxidation numbers because they can expand their octets (by utilising their vacant _d_-orbitals, which are close enough in energy to their valence electrons to be used for chemical bonding as well). The oxidation number thus depends on the number of electrons used for bonding.

## 4 Hwa Chong

Hwa Chong is a very important tool for the study of the oxidation number of the elements in the oxides. The first step is to use the Hwa Chong's method to calculate the oxidation number of the elements in the oxides. The second step is to use the Hwa Chong's method to calculate the oxidation number of the elements in the oxides.

The second step is to use the Hwa Chong's method to calculate the oxidation number of the elements in the oxides.

### Trend in melting points of the oxides

The trend in melting points of the oxides across the period can be explained by the structure and bonding involved in each oxide.

[FIGURE:S4.F1][ENDFIGUR

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:668]

### Acid-base behaviour of the oxides and hydroxides

_LO 5(e)(iii): describe the reactions of the oxides with water_

_(iv): describe and explain the acid/base behaviour of oxides, including, where relevant, amphoteric behaviour in reaction with sodium hydroxide (only) and acids_

_(vi): suggest the types of structure and bonding present in the oxides from observations of their chemical and physical properties_

_LO 5(h): predict the characteristic properties of an element in a given Group by using knowledge of chemical periodicity_

_LO 5(i): deduce the nature, possible position in the Periodic Table, and identity of unknown elements from given information of physical and chemical properties_

From their structure and bonding, the oxides of Period 3 elements can be classified into ionic oxides and covalent oxides. Ionic oxides tend to act as bases whereas covalent oxides act as acids. Oxides of elements that are near the ionic/covalent boundary tend to form amphoteric oxides - i.e. oxides that can act as acids or bases depending on the conditions.

This section will also cover the acid-base behaviour of the three metal hydroxides, NaOH, Mg(OH)\({}_{2}\) and _A_I(OH)\({}_{3}\).

* **tonic oxides** contain the O\({}^{2-}\) ions in their ionic lattice. The O\({}^{2-}\) ions readily hydrolyse in water to form OH\({}^{-}\) ions. Hence, ionic oxides tend to be **basic** in nature: **Covalent oxides** are usually classified as **acidic** oxides because they form acidic solutions when reacted with water, producing H\({}_{3}\)O\({}^{+}\) and an oxo-anion (i.e. a negatively charged ion containing the element covalently bonded to a number of oxygen atoms, e.g. SO\({}_{4}\)\({}^{2-}\) and PO\({}_{3}\)\({}^{-}\)). [Refer to section 4.3.5 on the acidic oxides]

#### 4.3.1 The basic oxides

Sodium oxide and magnesium oxide both react with water and acids, as shown in the table below.

#### 4.3.2 The basic hydroxides

Both sodium and magnesium hydroxides contain the hydroxide ion, OH-, which is a strong base. Thus, they are basic hydroxides, and can react with acids to form salt solutions in a classic neutralisation reaction.

Figure 4.3.1: The basic hydroxides

#### 4.3.3 The amphoteric oxide - Aluminium oxide

Aluminium oxide is an ionic oxide containing Al\({}^{n}\) and O\({}^{2-}\) ions. However, the high charge density of the Al\({}^{n}\) ion gives it great polarizing power, allowing the O\({}^{2-}\) ion to be slightly polarized, despite its small size. This confers some covalent character to the oxide.

This mixture of ionic and covalent character allows Al\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{3}\) to display both basic and acidic properties i.e. it is amphoteric.

#### 4.3.4 The amphoteric hydroxide - Aluminium hydroxide

Just like aluminium oxide, aluminium hydroxide is also amphoteric.

With acids, it reacts just like sodium and magnesium hydroxides, dissolving to form a colourless salt solution of the metal cation, Al\({}^{n+}\).

With strong bases like sodium hydroxide, the hydroxide shows its acidic nature and reacts to form the aluminate anion.

## 1 Introduction

### Definition of Transition Elements

_LO 13(a): explain what is meant by a transition element, in terms of d-block elements forming one or more stable ions with partially filled d subshells_

**Transition elements** are d-block elements that form one or more stable ions with partially filled d subshell.

By this definition, both scandium and zinc are **excluded** from the class of transition elements, even though they are part of d-block elements. This is because:

* Scandium forms only 5c\({}^{\text{\tiny{a}}}\) ion, which has no electron in the 3d subshell (3d\({}^{\text{\tiny{0}}}\)).
* Zinc forms only 2n\({}^{\text{\tiny{2+}}}\) ion which has 10 electrons in the 3d subshell (3d\({}^{\text{\tiny{10}}}\)).

Electronic Configurations of First Row Transition Elements and its ions (covered in Topic 1 Atomic Structure and Physical Periodicity)

_LO 13(b): state the electronic configuration of a first row transition element and its ion_

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:695]

**Exercise 1.1**

Calcium is a fairly soft, silvery-grey metal which quickly tarnishes in air. Vanadium is a hard grey metal which is resistant to corrosion at ordinary temperatures. Metallic calcium has no commercial uses; vanadium is widely used as an alloying element in steels. Data about calcium and vanadium are given below.

\begin{tabular}{l l l}  & **calcium** & **vanadium** \\ electronic configuration & [Ar] 4s\({}^{2}\) & [Ar] 3d\({}^{3}\) 4s\({}^{2}\) \\ atomic radius/nm & 0.197 & 0.135 \\ melting point/\({}^{\circ}\)C & 843 & 1710 \\ density/g cm\({}^{-3}\) & 1.54 & 6.07 \\ \end{tabular}

**(Worked Example)**

**a)**: The melting point of vanadium is significantly higher than that of calcium. Explain this in terms of the type and strength of bonding in each metal. (Worked Example)

Answer:

Both metals contain metallic bonding.

In Ca, only the 2 valence electrons (from 4s subshell) are contributed to the'sea' of delocalised electrons.

For V, the 4s and 3d electrons are close in energy, therefore all these electrons could be involved in metallic bonding. In addition, vanadium cation has higher charge and smaller radius than Ca2+. Hence, metallic bonding in V is significantly stronger than that in Ca.

More energy is needed to overcome the metallic bonding in V during melting and thus it has higher melting point.

Comments:

_This question is asking about the physical properties of metals. You should now recall relevant knowledge of metallic bonding from the Chemical Bonding chapter and the structure and bonding affects specifically melting point of the metal. The relevant properties are the charge density of the cations and the number of delocalised electrons._

_The firs part of your answer should be to describe the metal structure and bonding within vanadium and calcium, followed by linking the relevant properties to the melting point._

**b)**: Explain why the density of vanadium is significantly higher than that of calcium.

### Chemical Properties of Transition Elements

The transition elements and their compounds display the following chemical properties that are different from s-block elements and their compounds.

\end{table}
Table 3: Chemical properties of transition elements.

## 2 Variable Oxidation States

_LO 13(e): describe the tendency of transition elements to have variable oxidation states_

The transition elements show variable oxidation states due to the close similarity in energy of the 4\(s\) and 3\(d\) electrons. Hence, once the 4\(s\) electrons are removed, some or all the 3\(d\) electrons may also be removed without requiring much more energy.

In contrast, the _s_-block elements are limited to form compounds with oxidation states of +1 (Group 1) or +2 (Group 2). This is because once the outermost electrons in the \(s\) orbital are removed, subsequent removal of electrons would be from the inner quantum shell which requires too much energy.

Scandium and zinc, which are not part of transition elements, can only form one oxidation state, as shown in Table 4 above.

### General trends in oxidation states of transition elements

_LO 13(f): predict from a given electronic configuration, the likely oxidation states of a transition element_

* In their elemental states, the elements are assigned an oxidation number of zero.
* The value of the maximum oxidation number for the elements suggests that in each element, all the **available 3\(d\) and 4\(s\) electrons may be used for bonding to form various compounds (either ionic bond by losing electrons or covalent bond by sharing electrons).
* The lower oxidation state metals are usually found in ionic compounds, e.g. FeSO4 and MnCl2.
* The higher oxidation state metals tend not to exist as free ions, e.g. Mn7+ or Cr6+ do not exist. However, they are involved in covalent bonds, such as TiO2, V2O5, Mn2O7 and oxo-anions (e.g. VO3+, CrO42-, Cr2O7-, MnO4-).
* The number of available oxidation states of the elements increases from Ti to Mn and decreases from Mn to Cu. After Mn (3\(d\)5), **pairing of _d_-electrons occurs such that there is a decrease in the number of electrons available for bond formation. This results in the decrease in the number of oxidation states exhibited by the elements with more than five _d_-electrons (from Fe to Cu).

_Students should work out the oxidation states of P, Q, R, T in the options given and compare them to the possible oxidation numbers given in the table. This can be done by using the overall charge of the ion and assuming the oxidation state of Oxygen is \(-2\). Option A: For the anion to have an overall charge of +2, with 1 oxygen atom, P needs to have an oxidation state of +4. Using this same logic, we can work out that Q has a +5 oxidation state, R and T has +6 oxidation state. Hence only Option D is correct, where T has a possible oxidation state of +6 in the table given._

### Redox reactions involving transition elements

_10 13(9): describe and explain the use of Fe\({}^{+}\)/Fe\({}^{+}\), MnO\({}_{x}\)/Mn\({}^{2+}\) and Cr\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{x}\)/C\({}^{+}\) as examples of redox systems LO 13(h): predict, using Fe\({}^{+}\) values, the likelihood of redox reactions_

One of the applications of transition metal compounds is in the field of redox chemistry. In general, ions that have the transition metal in a high oxidation state tend to be oxidising agents (e.g. Cr\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{x}\)\({}^{2-}\), MnO\({}_{x}\)\({}^{4}\)) while transition metal in low oxidation state tends to be reducing agents (e.g. Cr\({}^{2+}\), V\({}^{2-}\)). When transition metal ions undergo redox reactions, a colour change is usually observed.

Common redox systems involving transition elements include:

\begin{tabular}{|p{113.8pt}|p{113.8pt}|} \hline Fe\({}^{3+}\)(aq) + e\({}^{-}\)\(\rightleftharpoons\) Fe\({}^{2+}\)(aq) & As a homogeneous catalyst in the redox reaction between iodide ions and peroxodisulfate ions. \\ \hline MnO\({}_{4}\) + 8H\({}^{+}\) + 5e\({}^{-}\)\(\rightleftharpoons\) Mn\({}^{2+}\) + 4H\({}_{2}\)O & As an oxidising agent for organic compounds such as oxidation of primary alcohols to carboxylic acids. \\ \hline Cr\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{x}\)\({}^{2-}\) + 14H\({}^{+}\) + 6e\({}^{-}\)\(\rightleftharpoons\) 2Cr\({}^{3+}\) + 7H\({}_{2}\)O & \\ orange & green & \\ \hline \end{tabular}

To predict whether a redox reaction is feasible, or to explain colour changes due to redox reactions, we can make use of \(E^{\bullet}\) values of the relevant species to find overall \(E^{\bullet}\), as learnt in Topic 20 Electrochemistry.

**If \(E^{\bullet}\)< 0, redox reaction is feasible.**

**Exercise 2.2**: By quoting and using relevant \(E^{\bullet}\) values from the _Data Booklet_, explain each of the following observations. Write balanced equations for the reactions.

(Worked Example)
**(i)**: The green precipitate obtained when aqueous sodium hydroxide is added to aqueous iron(II) sulfate rapidly turns brown on exposure to air.

Answer: The green precipitate is Fe(OH)\({}_{2}\).

Fe2+ + 2OH- Fe(OH)\({}_{2}\)

O2+ 2H2O+ 4e- = 4OH- = +0.40 V

Fe(OH)\({}_{3}\)+ e- Fe(OH)\({}_{2}\)+ OH- = +0.56 V

Fe(OH)\({}_{2}\) is oxidised by O2 in the air to form brown Fe(OH)\({}_{3}\)

O2+ 2H2O+ 4Fe(OH)\({}_{2}\)+4Fe(OH)\({}_{3}\) = +0.40-(-0.56) = +0.96 V > 0

Comments:

_Students should first recall their QA knowledge and realise the green precipitate is iron(II) hydroxide and give the relevant equation for precipitation._

_Students should then consider what would cause the green ppt to turn brown on standing, in this case it would be atmospheric oxidation. Hence to show this, students need to extract the relevant electrode potentials from the Data Booklet to prove that this is the case. In this case, oxygen is the oxidising agent._

_Students should then use this information to formulate the overall balanced equation, AND calculate the standard cell potential._

**(ii)**: The blue solution, containing Cr2+(aq), obtained by dissolving chromium metal in dilute sulfuric acid slowly turns green even in the absence of air.

## 3 Catalytic properties

_10 13(m): explain how some transition elements and/or their compounds can act as catalysts_

Transition elements, both in the elemental form and in their compounds, are important catalysts. We have learnt about catalysts and their mode of action in Topic 6 Reaction Kinetics. In this section, pay attention to the part played by transition elements and why they are able to act as catalysts. Also learn to apply your knowledge of \(E^{\text{e}}\) values to explain the mechanism of homogeneous catalysis.

A **catalyst** is a substance that increases the rate of a reaction by providing an alternative reaction pathway that requires lower activation energy than the uncatalysed reaction. The catalyst does not undergo any permanent chemical change during the process.

Transition elements and their compounds can act as heterogeneous catalysts as well as homogeneous catalysts:

\begin{tabular}{p{142.3pt}|p{142.3pt}|p{142.3pt}}
**Type** & **Homogeneous Catalyst** & **Heterogeneous Catalyst** \\ \hline
**phase of catalyst vs. phase of reactants** & & Catalyst operates in a different phase as the reactants (most as the reactants & Catalyst operates in a different phase as the reactants (most commonly the catalysts are solids, and the reactants are gases) \\ \end{tabular}

\begin{tabular}{p{142.3pt}|p{142.3pt}}
**reason why the transition metal or its compound** & & Availability of partially filled 3d orbitals to accept electron pairs from, or donate electrons pairs to reactant molecules, for adsorption of reactant molecules onto the surface of the catalyst. \\ \end{tabular}

### Heterogeneous Catalysis

In heterogeneous catalysis, the catalyst and the reactants are in different physical phases.

* The catalyst is usually in the solid phase and it provides active sites at which the reaction can take place.
* The reactants are usually gases or liquids.

Example: Haber process (manufacturing of ammonia)

#### Mode of action of the catalyst

* Adsorption: Gaseous reactant molecules, N2 and H2, diffuse towards surface of the Fe catalyst. N2 and H2 adsorb onto the active sides of Fe catalyst by formation of weak attraction forces.
* The adsorption process brings reactant molecules closer together, thus increasing their concentration on the catalyst surface, increasing frequency of collisions; the process also weakens the N=N and H=H covalent bonds within the molecules; and allows these molecules to be orientated in the right positions for reaction to form new bonds between N and H. All these lower the activation energy of the reaction.
* Desorption: Product molecule, NH3, desorbs and diffuses away from catalyst surface so that active sites are exposed for further reaction.

Figure 1: Heterogeneous catalysis in the Haber Process

Figure 2: Energy profile diagrams for the catolysed and uncactolysed reactions.

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:704]

Aqueous iron(III) ions can catalyse this reaction via an alternative pathway involving 2 steps:

_Step 1: Fe\({}^{3+}\) oxidises iodide, itself reduced to Fe\({}^{2+}\), taking electrons from the \(I^{-}\)_

\[\begin{array}{ccccc}2\text{Fe}^{2+}&+&2\text{I}^{-}&\rightarrow&2\text{Fe}^{2+ }&+&\text{I}_{2}&\text{$E^{0}$}_{\text{cell}}=E^{0}_{\text{red}}-E^{0}_{ \alpha x}&=+0.77-(+0.54)&=+0.23\text{ V}\\ \end{array}\]

_Step 2: Fe\({}^{2+}\) transfer electrons to, and reduces peroxolsulfate, itself oxidised to Fe\({}^{3+}\), thus Fe\({}^{3+}\) is regenerated_

\[\begin{array}{ccccc}2\text{Fe}^{2+}&+&\text{S}_{2}\text{O}_{8}^{2-}& \rightarrow&2\text{Fe}^{2+}&+&2\text{SO}_{4}^{2-}&\text{$E^{0}$}_{\text{cell}}= E^{0}_{\text{red}}-E^{0}_{\alpha x}&=+2.01-(+0.77)&=+1.24\text{ V}\\ \end{array}\]

This 2-step alternative pathway requires a lower activation energy because both steps involve collision between two oppositely charged ions. Fe\({}^{3+}\) is regenerated at the end of the reaction.

If Fe\({}^{2+}\) were present at the start instead, the two steps above will take place in the reverse order and the net effect will still be the same.

Note that the \(E^{0}_{\text{cell}}\) value for both steps must be positive, because:

\(\text{Fe}^{3+}+\text{e}^{-}\equiv\text{Fe}^{2+}\)\(E^{0}\) = +0.77 V

Other redox couples of transition metal cations could also be used as catalysts in this reaction as long as their \(E^{0}\) values were between +0.54 V and +2.01 V, such that each of the two steps in the alternative pathway are feasible.

Figure 3: Energy profile diagrams for a catalysed and uncotolysed reaction

**Exercise 3.1**

The rate of the reaction between iodide and peroxodisulfate(VI) ions

\[\text{S}_{2}\text{O}_{8}\text{a}^{-2}\text{(aq) + 2}\text{I}\text{(aq) }\to 2\text{SO}_{4}\text{-(aq) + I}_{2}\text{(aq)}\]

is increased by the presence of small concentrations of Co2+(aq). Suggest how Co2+(aq) ions are able to participate in this reaction.

_Hint: In this question, students need to demonstrate that the Co2+ is acting as a homogeneous catalyst to aid the transfer of electrons from the I- ions to the S2O3- ions. Extract 3 relevant half equations and their electrode potential from the Data Booklet and construct 2 balanced equations for each step of the homogeneous catalyst mechanism. The standard cell potential for each step should be positive._

## 4 Transition Element Complexes

_10 13(I): define the terms ligand and complex as exemplified by the complexes of copper(II) ions with water, ammonia and chloride ions as ligands (including the transition metal complexes found in the Qualitative Analysis Notes)_

### 4.1 Introduction

Transition elements and their ions tend to form complexes.

A **complex** is a molecule or ion formed by a central metal atom or ion surrounded by one or more *ligands.

_*Refer to Section 4.2 for the meaning of ligands_

When white anhydrous CuSO\({}_{4}\) solid is dissolved in water, a pale blue solution is formed. In water, Cu(II) exists as the aqua complex, with formula [Cu(H\({}_{2}\)O)\({}_{6}\)]\({}^{2+}\). When we write "Cu\({}^{2}\)(aq)", it refers to [Cu(H\({}_{2}\)O)\({}_{6}\)]\({}^{2+}\)(aq).

In this complex, the central metal ion is Cu\({}^{2+}\), with six H\({}_{2}\)O molecules acting as ligands.

Each H\({}_{2}\)O molecule bonds to the Cu\({}^{2+}\) ion by forming a **coordinate (dative) bond**.

Notice that the formula of a complex ion is usually written with a square bracket, the charge of the complex is indicated outside the square bracket.

This complex is called the 'aqua complex' since its ligands are water.

A complex can be neutral, cationic or anionic. The net charge on the complex is the sum of the oxidation number of the central metal ion and the total charges of the ligands that surround it. The charge on the central metal is the oxidation number of the metal in that complex ion.

To maintain charge neutrality, complex ion is typically associated with **counter ions**, as in the case of the compound [Co(NH\({}_{3}\))\({}_{6}\)]\(Cl_{3}\), in which the complex ion is [Co(NH\({}_{3}\))\({}_{6}\)]\({}^{3+}\), the six NH\({}_{3}\) molecules acting as ligands, and the three \(CI\)' ions are counter ions. So the whole compound is like a salt.

Figure 4: Copper(II) complex with waterWhen [Co(NH\({}_{3}\))\({}_{6}\)]\(Cl_{3}\) dissolves in water, the complex ion and counter ions separate from each other. The complex ion behaves like a polyatomic ion with **the ligands remaining attached to the central metal ion/atom**.

The tendency of transition metal ions to form complex ions rather than simple ions is due to two main factors:

* The "bare" cations of transition elements, with their incomplete 3d subshells are relatively small and highly charged. The resulting **high charge density** and hence **high polarising power** of the transition metal cations, produces a strong tendency towards covalent bond formation with ligands.
* The transition metal cations have **vacant 3d orbitals** (as well as 4s and 4p orbitals) which can be used to accommodate the lone pair of electrons from the ligands, resulting in dative bond formation.

### Ligands

A **ligand** is an ion or molecule with one or more lone pairs of electrons available to be donated into the vacant orbitals of transition metal atom or ion.

Ligands can be classified according to the number of dative bonds that it forms with the central metal atom or ion.

* Monodentate ligands bond using the electron pair of a single donor atom.
* Bidentate ligands bond using electron pairs on two donor atoms.
* Polydentate ligands bond using electron pairs on more than one donor atom (which includes bidentate ligand).

Polydentate ligands are sometimes called **chelating agents** (pronounced as _key-late-ting_) because of their ability to hold a metal ion like a claw. Chelating ligands form a stable complex ion with the central metal ion as the pincer-like grip of these polydentate ligands are able to hold the cation more securely. They typically form rings in the complex ion.

### Coordination Number and Geometry

The **coordination number** indicates the **number of dative bonds** around the central atom or ion. The most common values are 4 and 6, but 2 is also observed and is particularly important in the chemistry of copper(I) and silver(I) compounds.

The shape (geometry) of the complex ion depends on the coordination number.

For coordination number of 4, the geometry can be square planar or tetrahedral depending on the transition metal and ligands involved. The determination and reasons for this is not in syllabus.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|} \hline \hline Formula & Coordination number & Geometry & Shape \\ \hline \([\)Ag(NH\({}_{3}\))\({}_{2}\)\(]^{*}\) & 2 & linear & H\({}_{3}\)N = Ag\({}^{*}\)NH\({}_{3}\) \\ \hline \([\)Ni(CN)\({}_{4}\)\(]^{2-}\) & 4 & square planar & CN\({}^{*}\)CN\({}^{*}\) \\ \hline \([\)CuC\({}_{4}\)\(]^{2-}\) & 4 & tetrahedral & CN\({}^{*}\)CN\({}^{*}\) \\ \hline \([\)Fe(CN)\({}_{6}\)\(]^{3-}\) & 6 & octahedral & CN\({}^{*}\)CN\({}^{*}\) \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 5: Coordination number and shape of some complex ions

**Exercise 4.1**

1. Complete the missing information in the table below.

_There are 6 monodentate CN ligands in the complex, so a total of 6 dative bonds formed. Hence the coordination number is 6. The overall charge of the complex is \(-3\), so to balance out the 6 CN ligands, the Cr must have an oxidation number of +3._
2. A complex is obtained by reacting aqueous cobalt(III) chloride with ammonia. It is found that the co-ordination number of cobalt is 6 and that only one third of the total chloride is precipitated as AgCl when the complex is treated with an excess of aqueous silver nitrate. What is the formula of the compound?

**A** Co(NH3)\({}_{6}\)Cl\({}_{3}\)**C** C Co(NH3)\({}_{3}\)**C**\(I_{3}\)**B** Co(NH3)\({}_{5}\)Cl\({}_{3}\)**D** Co(NH3)\({}_{5}\)Cl\({}_{3}\)

### **Acidity of aqua complexes**

In aqueous solution, the transition metal ions exist as aqua complexes. Aqua complexes containing high charge density transition metal cations like Fe\({}^{3+}\) and Cr\({}^{3+}\), undergo **hydrolysis** in water to give a **mildly acidic solution**.

\[[\text{Fe(H${}_{2}$O$)}_{6}]^{3+}(\text{aq})\ +\ H${}_{2}$O(l)\ \rightleftharpoons\ \ [\text{Fe(H${}_{2}$O$)}_{5}( \text{OH})]^{2+}(\text{aq})\ +\ H${}_{3}$O${}^{\prime}(\text{aq})\] \[[\text{Cr(H${}_{2}$O$)}_{6}]^{3+}(\text{aq})\ +\ H${}_{2}$O(l)\ \rightleftharpoons\ \ [\text{Cr(H${}_{2}$O$)}_{5}( \text{OH})]^{2+}(\text{aq})\ +\ H${}_{3}$O${}^{\prime}(\text{aq})\]

This is due to the **high charge density** on the central transition metal cation and these aqua complexes undergo appreciable hydrolysis in a similar fashion to the [A/(H\({}_{2}\)O)]\({}^{3+}\) ion. The mechanism for this reaction was covered in the salt hydrolysis section in Topic 15 Acid-Base Equilibria.

However, for oxidation states higher than +3, the polarising power of the central metal cation is so great that the release of protons and loss of water molecules results in the **formation of oxoanions**.

For instance, [Cr(H${}_{2}$O$)}_{6}]^{5+} ions do not exist in aqueous solution. Instead, Cr(VI), occurs in two well-known oxoanions, the chromate (VI) ion, CrO\({}_{4}\)\({}^{2-}\), and the dichromate (VI) ion, Cr\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{7}\)\({}^{2-}\).

#### 4.4.1 Chromium complexes and oxoanions

When aqueous sodium hydroxide or aqueous ammonia is added dropwise to aqueous solution of chromium(III) ion, a grey-green ppt is formed. This is due to the formation of Cr(OH)\({}_{3}\). This is an acid-base reaction as chromium(III) ion is acidic.

\[[\text{Cr(H${}_{2}$O$)}_{6}]^{3+}(\text{aq})+\text{3OH}^{+}(\text{aq})\ \rightarrow\ [\text{Cr(H${}_{2}$O$)}_{3}(\text{OH})_{3}](\text{s})+\text{3H${}_{2}$O$($I })\]

or

\[\text{Cr}^{3+}(\text{aq})+\text{3OH}^{+}(\text{aq})\rightarrow\text{Cr(OH)}_{3}( \text{s})\]

When aqueous sodium hydroxide is added in excess, a dark green solution is formed. This is due to the formation of \([\text{Cr(OH)}_{6}]^{3-}\) complex ion.

\[[\text{Cr(H${}_{2}$O$)}_{3}(\text{OH})_{3}](\text{s})+\text{3OH}^{+}(\text{ aq})\ \rightarrow\ [\text{Cr(OH)}_{6}]^{3-}(\text{aq})+\text{3H${}_{2}$O$($I })\]

When acid is added to yellow solution of chromate(VI) ion, an orange solution of dichromate(VI) is formed. Notice that the oxidation state of the chromium ion remains the same.

\[\begin{array}{c}2\text{Cr}\text{O}_{4}^{-}(\text{aq})+\text{2H}^{+}(\text{ aq})\ \rightleftharpoons\ \text{Cr}_{2}\text{O}_{7}^{-}(\text{aq})+\text{H${}_{2}$O$($I })\]

### Ligand exchange reaction

_LO 13(I): explain qualitatively that ligand exchange may occur, as exemplified by the formation of the complexes in (I), including the colour changes involved, and CO/O\({}_{2}\) exchange in haemoglobin_

The ligands in a complex ion can be exchanged for other ligands. This reaction is known as **ligand exchange reaction**. This reaction will happen readily if the new complex formed is more stable than the original complex. A change in colour of the solution is usually observed.

Ligand exchange reactions are largely reversible reactions, and therefore, are represented by the equilibrium sign '\(\rightleftharpoons\)'. For example, the ligand exchange reaction between the water ligands in \([\text{Fe(H${}_{2}$O$)}_{6}]^{3+}\) and SCN\({}^{-}\)(thiocyanate) ions is represented by:

\[[\text{Fe(H${}_{2}$O$)}_{6}]^{3+}(\text{aq})+\text{SCN}^{-}(\text{aq})\ \rightleftharpoons\ \text{[Fe(SCN)(H${}_{2}$O$)}_{5}]^{2+}(\text{aq})+\text{H${}_{2}$O$($I })\]

yellow

A colour change from yellow to blood-red will be observed in this ligand exchange reaction.

The equilibrium constant of this reaction is given by \(K_{c}=\frac{[\text{Fe(SCN)(H${}_{2}$O$)}_{6}^{2+}]}{[\text{Fe(H${}_{2}$O$)}_{ 6}^{3-}][\text{SCN}]}\).

Note that although water is a reacting species (in the reverse reaction), it is also a solvent. Hence, \([\text{H${}_{2}$O$}]\) is almost constant and excluded from the \(K_{c}\) expression.

If the new complex formed is much more stable than the original complex, \(K_{c}\) would be large, the equilibrium position will lie very much to the right, and a single arrow may be used in the equation.

\[\begin{array}{c}[\text{Fe(H${}_{2}$O$)}_{6}]^{3+}(\text{aq})+\text{SCN}^{-}( \text{aq})\ \rightarrow\ [\text{Fe(SCN)(H${}_{2}$O$)}_{5}]^{2+}(\text{aq})+\text{H${}_{2}$O$($I })\\ \text{yellow solution}\end{array}\]

#### 4.5.1 Ligand exchange reactions involving copper complexes

This section concerns some common complexes of Cu(II) and the reactions in which they can be formed (often seen in Inorganic QA tests).

* To a solution of Cu\({}^{2+}\)(aq), add aqueous ammonia dropwise then in excess. Observation: pale blue ppt formed, which dissolves in excess ammonia to give dark blue solution. Explanation: Cu(OH)\({}_{2}\) is first precipitated when aqueous ammonia is added dropwise. Cu\({}^{2+}\)(aq) + 2OH\({}^{2}\)(aq) \(\rightarrow\) Cu(OH)\({}_{2}\)(s) \(\rightarrow\) pale blue ppt When excess ammonia is added, ligand exchange reaction takes place, with NH\({}_{3}\) ligands replacing H\({}_{2}\)O ligands to form a dark blue solution. The Cu\({}^{2+}\)(aq) is equivalent to the hexaaqua cation [Cu(H\({}_{2}\)O)\({}_{6}\)]\({}^{2+}\)(aq). [Cu(H\({}_{2}\)O)\({}_{6}\)]\({}^{2+}\)(aq) + 4NH\({}_{3}\)(aq) \(\rightarrow\) [Cu(NH\({}_{3}\))\({}_{4}\)(H\({}_{2}\)O)\({}_{2}\)]\({}^{2+}\)(aq) + 4H\({}_{2}\)O(_{1}\)_ dark blue solution This causes the concentration of Cu\({}^{2+}\)(aq) to drop, thus the equilibrium below will shift to the right. Thus the ppt will dissolve to give a dark blue solution. Cu(OH)\({}_{2}\)(s) \(\rightarrow\) Cu\({}^{2+}\)(aq) + 2OH\({}^{2}\)(aq)
* To a solution of Cu\({}^{2+}\)(aq), add concentrated hydrochloric acid dropwise. Observation: solution turns from pale blue to green then yellow Explanation: When conc. HCl is added, ligand exchange reaction takes place, with Cl\({}^{-}\) ligands replacing H\({}_{2}\)O ligands. [Cu(H\({}_{2}\)O)\({}_{6}\)]\({}^{2+}\)(aq) + 4Cl\({}^{-}\)(aq) \(\rightarrow\) [CuCl\({}_{4}\)]\({}^{2-}\)(aq) + 6H\({}_{2}\)O(_{1}\)_ yellow solution The green colour is observed due to the mixture of both the blue aqua complex and the yellow chloro complex present.

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:714]

#### 4.5.3 Ligand exchange reaction in haemoglobin

Haemoglobin is the iron-containing protein in red blood cells that transports oxygen in blood. It consists of four protein chains loosely held together in a cluster. Each chain has a haem molecule within its folds. Iron (in the +2 oxidation state) is located in the centre of a plane of four nitrogen atoms. A haemoglobin molecule in the lungs picks up an O\({}_{2}\) molecule, which forms a dative bond with the iron to form a species called _oxyhaemoglobin_. This binding is reversible and enables haemoglobin to carry oxygen around the body and release it where it is needed.

Carbon monoxide, CO, can replace O\({}_{2}\) as the ligand attached to the iron(II). This is a **ligand exchange reaction**. The new complex is called _carboxyhaemoglobin_. The binding between CO and the iron(II) is irreversible, thus making carboxyhaemoglobin a very stable complex. The affinity of human haemoglobin for CO is about 210 times greater than that for O\({}_{2}\). As a result, a relatively small quantity of CO can inactivate a substantial fraction of the haemoglobin for oxygen transport. If the concentration of CO is high and the level of carboxyhaemoglobin becomes too high, oxygen transport is effectively shut down and death occurs.

Figure 5: **(a)** Structure of the haem group. **(b)** Haem, haemoglobin and oxygen transport. The central iron(II) exhibits hexa co-ordination. Four of the co-ordination sites are taken up by nitrogen from a ring system called a porphyrin that acts as a tetradentate ligand. Below the plane of this ring is a fifth nitrogen atom from a histidine side-chain on a protein molecule called globin. The O\({}_{2}\) molecule may be reversibly bonded at the sixth site. **(c)** O\({}_{2}\) molecules bind to the deoxyhaemoglobin, forming oxyhaemoglobin that is transported around the circulatory system in red blood cells. The O\({}_{2}\) molecules bind reversibly with the iron, thus allowing easy release of O\({}_{2}\) for cellular respiration

## 5 Coloured Compounds and Complexes

Transition metal compounds are frequently coloured, both in the solid state and in solution. This is due to absorption of part of the visible spectrum by the solution. The reason behind the observed colour can be explained using crystal field theory.

### Light and Colour

White light is an electromagnetic radiation consisting of all wavelengths in the visible range. It can be dispersed into a spectrum of colours, each of which has a narrower range of wavelengths. For example, it can be dispersed into seven colours commonly known as the rainbow by using a prism.

Each colour has a complementary colour. For example, green and red are complementary colours. This is shown as opposite wedges in the colour wheel diagram below.

The energy of the light is inversely proportional to its wavelength. Therefore, red colour, with longer wavelength is lower in energy as compared to blue light, which is shorter in wavelength.

Objects appear coloured in white light because they absorb certain wavelengths and reflect or transmit others: an opaque object reflects light, whereas a clear one transmits it. The reflected or transmitted light enters the eye and the brain perceives a colour. If an object absorbs all visible wavelengths, it appears black; if it reflects all, it appears white.

### Crystal Field Theory

The crystal field theory was first developed to account for the properties of transition metal ions in solids. In this theory, the lone pair on ligand is modelled as a point negative charge that attracts the positive central metal ion, which provides the stability to the complex. They also repel the electrons in the d orbitals of the metal ion.

Figure 6: A diagram of the colour wheel, with approximate wavelength ranges (in nm), shown as wedges.

#### 5.2.1 Splitting of degenerate d orbitals in octahedral complex

LO 13(k): describe, using the shape and orientation of the d orbitals, the splitting of degenerate d orbitals into two energy levels in octahedral complexes

In a free transition metal ion, all five orbitals are degenerate (have the same energy).

In the presence of ligands in an octahedral field, the ligands approach the metal ion along the mutually perpendicular \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\) axes.

As the ligands approach, their electron pairs repel electrons in the five \(d\) orbitals of metal ions, causing all five d orbitals to increase in energy.

However, the d electrons are repelled unequally due to the different orientations of d orbitals. As the ligands move along the \(x\), \(y\) and \(z\) axes, they approach directly toward the lobes of the \(d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}\) and \(d_{z^{2}}\) orbitals but between the lobes of the \(d_{xy}\), \(d_{yz}\) and \(d_{\alpha}\) orbitals. Thus, the electrons in \(d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}\) and \(d_{z^{2}}\) orbital experienced stronger repulsion, which causes the energy of these orbitals to be higher than the \(d_{xy}\), \(d_{yz}\) and \(d_{\alpha}\) orbitals.

The five \(d\) orbitals therefore are no longer degenerate, but are split into two groups with an energy gap (\(\Delta E\)) between them.

Figure 8: Ligands approach along the mutually perpendicular axes.

#### 5.2.2 Electronic d-d transition

* Let us consider the [Ti(H\({}_{2}\)O)\({}_{6}\)]\({}^{3+}\) ion, which appears purple in aqueous solution. Ti\({}^{3+}\)(aq) is a \(d^{4}\) ion, with the \(d\) electron in one of the three lower energy orbitals.
* When white light shines on the solution, the electron at the lower energy level will absorb energy from the light and jump to one of the higher energy orbitals. Since the electron jumps from one d-orbital to another d-orbital, this movement is called a d-d transition.
* The energy gap (\(\Delta E\)) between the two levels corresponds to the energy of photons with a range of wavelength in the visible spectrum. For Ti\({}^{3+}\)(aq), it happens to be in the green and yellow range.
* The complementary colours red, orange, blue and violet lights are transmitted, thus the solution looks purple.
* _LO 13(I): explain, in terms of d orbital splitting and d-d transition, why transition element complexes are usually coloured [knowledge of the relative order of ligand field strength is not required]_ In the presence of ligands, the partially filled degenerate 3\(d\) orbitals of a transition metal ion are split into two different energy levels with a small energy gap \(\Delta E\) between them. There are vacancies in the higher energy \(d\) orbitals. The promotion of an electron from the lower to the higher of these \(d\) orbitals requires the absorption of radiation in the visible spectrum with energy corresponding to the energy gap. Such a d-d transition is responsible for the colour of the complex ion. The colour observed is the complement of the colours absorbed.

### Factors affecting the colour of complexes

#### 5.3.1 Oxidation state of the metal

Different number of electrons in the \(d\) orbitals of the transition metal ion will result in different interactions with the electrons from the ligands. This will give rise to different energy gap (\(\Delta E\)) thus the wavelengths of light absorbed will also be different. The table below shows the example of vanadium complexes.

The absence of colour in 5c\({}^{3+}\), T1\({}^{4+}\), Cu\({}^{+}\) and Zn\({}^{2+}\) is due to them having either no \(d\) electrons (3\(d^{0}\) for Sc\({}^{3+}\) & Ti\({}^{4+}\)) or fully filled \(d\) orbitals (3\(d^{10}\) for Cu\({}^{+}\) & Zn\({}^{2+}\)). In such cases, no \(d\)-\(d\) electronic transition is possible.

#### 5.3.2 Nature of ligand

Different ligands have different effects on the splitting of the \(d\) orbitals. The difference in magnitude of \(\Delta E\) will lead to different colours observed. The diagram below shows the example of some nickel octahedral complexes.

_Note: Other splitting patterns exist (and may appear as application questions) but student are only expected to be able to recall splitting of \(d\)-orbitals for octahedral complexes._

### Using colorimetry in experiments

#### 5.5.1 Determining the concentration of complex ions by colorimetry

To determine the concentration of a coloured complex using colorimetry

Example: N2013/P2/Q1 (Planning Question)

_Approach:_

A calibration graph is first obtained by measuring the absorbance of a series of solutions containing the coloured complex at various known concentrations. Then measure the absorbance of the unknown solution and read its concentration off the calibration graph.

Generic procedure

1. A suitable filter (of a complementary colour) is selected.
2. A 'blank' absorbance reading is taken using water as a reference.
3. A series of solutions of known concentrations of _(the coloured complex)_ are made up (usually by dilution from a stock solution).
4. The absorbance of the solutions are measured in turn with the colorimeter.
5. A calibration graph of absorbance against concentration is plotted.
6. The absorbance of the test solution is now measured, and the calibration curve is used to determine the unknown concentration.

Absorbance of test solution

If the UV-VIS spectrophotometer is used instead of the colorimeter, the absorbance readings are measured at a fixed wavelength (usually at the wavelength where absorbance is the greatest or the complementary colour), instead of using a filter in Step 1.

#### 5.5.2 Investigating the stoichiometry of complex ions by colorimetry

The formula of a complex ion can be determined by measuring the colour intensity of the complex ion, provided the colour of the complex is quite different from the colours of the separate aqueous ions.

E.g. When Fe\({}^{3+}\)(aq) react with thiocyanate ions SCN\({}^{-}\)(aq), a deep red (blood red) colour is produced:

\(\text{Fe}^{3+}\)(aq) + \(x\) SCN\({}^{-}\)(aq) \(\rightarrow\) [Fe(SCN)]\({}^{3-x}\)(aq)

The stoichiometry of the complex can be determined by the **method of continuous variation**. Mixtures of Fe\({}^{3+}\) and SCN\({}^{-}\) with Fe\({}^{3+}\) : SCN\({}^{-}\) in molar proportions of 10:0, 9:1, 8:2, 7:3, 6:4, etc. is made. In other words, the relative proportions of Fe\({}^{3+}\) : SCN\({}^{-}\) are continuously varied from 10:0 to 0:10.

Clearly, the mixture with the most intense coloured solution corresponds to molar proportions of Fe\({}^{3+}\) and SCN\({}^{-}\) which just react completely leaving neither in excess. In some cases, it might be possible to tell by eye which mixture contains the darkest-coloured solution, but the judgment can be done much more reliably and accurately using a spectrophotometer. The spectrophotometer measures the absorbance of the test solution, which is proportional to the concentration of the complex.

The table below shows a typical set of results for the Fe\({}^{3+}\)/ SCN\({}^{-}\)investigation.

\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|} \hline Tube number & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 & 7 & 8 & 9 & 10 & 11 \\ \hline Volume of & 10 & 9 & 8 & 7 & 6 & 5 & 4 & 3 & 2 & 1 & 0 \\ \hline Volume of & 0 & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 & 7 & 8 & 9 & 10 \\ \hline Absorbance & 8 & 20 & 32 & 40 & 48 & 52 & 45 & 36 & 24 & 16 & 0 \\ \hline \end{tabular}

The results are represented graphically below.

Extrapolate the two straight lines to find the maximum absorbance (which corresponds to the highest concentration of the complex).

* In what molar proportions do Fe\({}^{3+}\) and SCN\({}^{-}\) react to form the blood red complex ion?
* Write the balanced equation for the formation of the complex ion by ligand exchange.

Planning an experiment involving qualitative analysis

You may be asked to propose a sequence of test-tube reactions to identify inorganic ions. This means you need to review your inorganic Chemistry Qualitative Analysis notes. **Inorganic QA tests** are based on four main types of chemical reactions that produce precipitates, gases, and colour changes. Try to identify these four main types of inorganic reactions in your QA notes:

* Ionic precipitation reactions
* Acid-base reactions
* Redox reactions
* Complex forming reactions including ligand exchange

When planning a qualitative analysis experiment, you may be asked to:

* Present the sequence of tests. You may use a flowchart or table.
* Write the procedure with essential details of quantities and conditions for each test.
* State the expected observations for both positive and negative tests.
* Explain the chemistry underlying each test e.g. type of reaction, identity of species responsible for precipitate / gas / colour change.

The unknown ions might be present in a mixture, and you might be required to plan a filtration to separate the ions or precipitates. For example, **FA1** contains **two cations** (Fe\({}^{2*}\) and Zn\({}^{2*}\)). NaOH(aq) and NH\({}_{3}\)(aq) are common test reagents for cations: Fe\({}^{2*}\) forms an insoluble basic hydroxide while Zn\({}^{2*}\) forms a soluble amphoteric hydroxide, which can be separated by filtration. A sample plan is shown below.

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|} \hline _Test_ & _Observations_ & _Location of ions_ \\ \hline To 1 cm\({}^{3}\) of **FA1** in a test & Green ppt insoluble in excess & Fe\({}^{2*}-\)Fe(OH)\({}_{2}\) ppt \\ tube, add excess & NaOH & \\ NaOH(aq). & & \\ Filter the mixture and & Colourless filtrate & Zn\({}^{2*}-\)in the filtrate as [Zn(OH)\({}_{4}\)]\({}^{2}\)- \\ collect the filtrate in a & & \\ separate test tube. & Green residue turns reddish & Fe(OH)\({}_{2}\) oxidised to Fe(OH)\({}_{3}\) \\  & brown on contact with air & \\ \hline \end{tabular}

You may also present your plan as a flowchart.
