Key Concept

Digestive System

Digestion

## Overview of digestive system

1. Mouth and buccal cavity (a) Teeth: chewing, breakdown large pieces of food to smaller size. * **Increase surface area to volume ratio of the food** that enzyme can act on more efficiently. (b) Salivary glands: Secrete saliva into mouth via salivary ducts. * saliva contains salivary amylase that **digest starch to maltose** (c) Tongue: mix food with saliva into bolus **Maltose**
2. Oesophagus * A narrow muscular tube that connects the buccal cavity and stomach * It is made up of two layers of muscle. The external layer is the **longitudinal muscle** and the inner layer is the **circular muscle**.

Overview of digestive system

Peristalsis

Peristalsis

* Rhythmic wave-like contractions of the muscles
* Peristalsis allows mixing of food and digestive juices and propel the contents of the alimentary canal
* The circular and longitudinal muscles are antagonistic muscles.
* When the **circular muscles contract**, the **longitudinal muscles relax**. As a result, the wall of the gut **constricts**, and the gut becomes narrower and longer. The food is **pushed forward**.
* When the **longitudinal muscles contract**, the **circular muscles relax**. The gut **dilates**, and it becomes wider and shorter. This widens the lumen for **food to enter**.
* These muscles found along much of the entire length of the alimentary canal (oesophagus, stomach, small intestine, large intestine)Overview of digestive system

Stomach

Stomach wall has pits that lead to **gastric gland**, which secretes

(I) mucus which protects the stomach walls

(2) gastric acid/dilute hydrochloric acid

* Gastric acid is pH 2, **denatures salivary amylase** thus stop its activity
* changes the **inactive pepsinogen into the active form, pepsin
* provides an acidic environment as pepsin **optimum pH** is 2
* **kills germs and bacteria.**

(3) pepsinogen (inactive form)

* dilute HCl activates pepsinogen to pepsin
* pepsin **digest proteins to polypeptides**

* Food normally remains in the stomach for about three to four hours. The partly digested food becomes liquefied, forming chyme.
* The pyloric sphincter is located at the place where the stomach joins the small intestine. When the muscle contracts, the entrance to the small intestine closes. When the ring relaxes, chyme passes in small amounts into the duodenum Overview of digestive system

Small Intestine

* The small intestine is divided into three parts: the duodenum, jejunum and ileum.
* In the duodenum, chyme from the stomach mixes with

1. **Pancreatic juice** secreted from pancreas
2. **Intestinal juice** secreted by epithelial cells of small intestine
3. **Bile** from gall bladder
* all three juices are alkaline, thus they neutralise the acidic chyme from stomach and provide an optimum alkaline environment for pancreatic and intestinal enzymes

Bile
* Bile is produced by the liver and stored in the gall bladder.
* It passes into the small intestine through the bile duct.
* Bile **emulsifies large fat droplets** into **smaller** fat droplets,

**increasing the surface area to volume ratio** of the fats for **lipase** to work on and **speeds up fat digestion**Overview of digestive system

## Assimilation

* **blood capillaries** of the villi **converge** into a large blood vessel called the **hepatic portal vein**, which then transport **glucose and amino acid** to the liver
* **lacetal or lymphatic capillaries** join to form larger **lymphatic vessels**, which discharge fats into the bloodstream.

* **Glucose is assimilated and then oxidised during tissue respiration to release energy for the vital activities of the cells.** **Excess glucose is returned to the liver and stored as glycogen.**

* **Amino acids which enter the cells are converted into new protoplasm that is used for growth and repair of worn-out parts of the body.** **Amino acids are used to form essential proteins such as enzymes and hormones** **Excess amino acids are deaminated in the liver.**

* **When there is a sufficient supply of glucose, fats are not broken down, but are used to build protoplasm.** **When glucose is in short supply, fats are broken down to provide energy needed by the body.** **Excess fats are stored in the adipose tissues beneath the skin and around the vital organs such as heart and kidneys, which act as shock absorbers.**

## 4 Production of bile (fat digestion)

* Liver produces bile that is stored temporarily in the gall bladder
* Bile flows into the duodenum via the bile duct.
* Bile emulsifies large fat droplet into smaller droplet, increase the surface area to volume ratio for lipase to act on, increasing efficiency of digestion

## 5 Iron storage

* Spleen destroys aging red blood cells.
* Haemoglobin in red blood cells is transported to liver and broken down. The iron content is stored in the liver
* Other metabolic by-products of the breakdown form bile pigments.

## Function of liver

\begin{tabular}{|c|} \hline _Alcohol dehydrogenase_ \\ \hline _Acetaldehyde dehydrogenase_ \\ \hline _Acetic acid_ \\ \hline _6. **Detoxification** \\ - The liver breaks down **toxic substances** for **excretion** in urine or bile. \\ - E.g. alcohol is broken down **acetaldehyde**, catalysed by **alcohol dehydrogenase**. \\ - **Acetaldehyde** is then converted to harmless **acetic acid** by **acetaldehyde dehydrogenase**. \\ \end{tabular}

**Effects of excessive consumption of alcohol:**

* Alcohol irritates oesophageal, stomach and intestinal linings, leading to inflammation and ulcers
* When liver cells are inflamed and damaged, liver cells are replaced with fibrous scar tissues. This is called liver cirrhosis.
* reduced ability of previous 6 functions has very serious complications
* Alcohol is also a depressant, which inhibit the central nervous system (CNS), impairs and slows the activity of the brain and nervous system leading to a slower reaction time and reduced self control.
* Greater risk taking and poor decision making
* vulnerable to unintentional accidents and injuries.
