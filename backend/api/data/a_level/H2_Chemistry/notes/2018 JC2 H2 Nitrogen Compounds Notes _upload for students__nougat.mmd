## 1 Introduction on Amines

### Structure & Classification

* **General formula of primary (1o) amines :** **RNH2**
* **Functional Group :** **primary** _or_ **secondary** _or_ **tertiary amine**
* Amines may be classified as primary (1o), secondary (2o) or tertiary (3o) depending on the number of alkyl/aryl groups attached to the N atom.

### Nomenclature

* Many **aliphatic amines** are named by specifying the alkyl groups attached to the N atom, following by the ending **-amine**.
* Many **aromatic amines** are named as derivatives of the simplest aromatic amine, e.g. _phenylamine_ (aniline).

Examples:

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|} \hline  & **Alkylamines** & **Arylamines** \\ \hline CH3CH2NH2 & CH3CH2CH2CH3 & NH2 \\ **ethylamine** & **2-pentylamine** & **phenylamine** \\ \hline \end{tabular}

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|} \hline  & **Alkylamines** & **Arylamines** \\ \hline CH3CH2NH2 & CH3CH2NH2 & NH2 \\ **ethylamine** & **2-pentylamine** & **phenylamine** \\ \hline \end{tabular}

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|} \hline  & **Alkylamines** & **Arylamines** \\ \hline CH3CH2NH2 & CH3CH2NH2 & NH2 \\ **ethylamine** & **2-pentylamine** & **phenylamine** \\ \hline \end{tabular}
For polyfunctional amines with other functional groups of higher priority,

* treat the amine group as a substituent and add the prefix -_amino_ to the parent compound

E.g.

H\({}_{2}\)NCH\({}_{2}\)COOH

**2-aminoethanoic acid**

**4-aminophenol**

### Physical Properties of Amines

#### 1.3.1 Boiling Point

* Amines have **higher boiling points** than hydrocarbons with similar \(M\) due to **stronger intermolecular hydrogen bonding**.

* However, amines have **lower boiling points** than **alcohols** of similar \(M\), due to the **intermediate hydrogen bonds** in amines being **weaker** than those in alcohols since the **N-H bond is less polar than O-H bond**.

**Quick Check**

Arrange the following compounds in order of increasing boiling points.

\begin{tabular}{|l|c|} \hline
**Compound** & **M\({}_{r}\)** \\ \hline (CH\({}_{3}\))\({}_{3}\)N & 59 \\ \hline (CH\({}_{3}\))\({}_{3}\)CH & 58 \\ \hline CH\({}_{3}\)CH\({}_{2}\)CH\({}_{2}\)NH\({}_{2}\) & 59 \\ \hline \end{tabular}

**Answer:** (CH\({}_{3}\))\({}_{3}\)CH \(<\) (CH\({}_{3}\))\({}_{3}\)N \(<\) CH\({}_{3}\)CH\({}_{2}\)CH\({}_{2}\)NH\({}_{2}\)

**(b)**: **Solubility in water**

Amines with **small molecular size** are soluble in water.

_Reason:_ Amines can form **hydrogen bonds with water molecules.**

However, as the **alkyl group(s) becomes bulkier/heavier**, the **solubility in water**

**decreases** because of the **greater hydrophobic nature of the R group.**

**Example**  Ammonolysis of 2-bromopropane:

(CH\({}_{3}\))\({}_{2}\)CHBr + NH\({}_{3}\)\(\longrightarrow\) (CH\({}_{3}\))\({}_{2}\)CHNH\({}_{2}\) + HBr

**Note:**

If an **excess of NH\({}_{3}\)** is used, the main product formed is the **1o amine**. Side-products can include the 2\({}^{\circ}\) and 3\({}^{\circ}\) amines as well as the quaternary ammonium salt.

**Example:** _Reaction of excess chloromethane with ammonia_

Predict with reasoning, the solubility of the end-product of the reaction in water.

Answer: The ammonium salt is soluble in water. The **ionic** quaternary ammonium salt can form **ion-dipole interactions** with water molecules which **releases energy that cause the detachment of ions from the crystal lattice for solvation**.

### Reduction of Nitrobenzenes

**Reagents & Conditions:**

**Sn in excess concentrated HCI, heat, followed with addition of NaOH (aq), r.t.p.**

**Type of reaction: Reduction**

_Note:_

* Fe can be used in place of Sn as the reducing agent.
* The first formed product in Step 1 is \(\text{C}_{6}\text{H}_{8}\text{NH}_{3}^{*}\text{C}l^{-}\) or \(\left(\text{C}_{6}\text{H}_{8}\text{NH}_{3}^{*}\right)_{2}\overset{\text{ \bf nv}}{\text{Sn}}\text{C}l_{6}^{2-}\).
* Aqueous NaOH is added for _acid-base reaction_ with the acidic \(\text{C}_{6}\text{H}_{8}\text{NH}_{3}^{*}\) to form the required phenylamine product in Step 2.
* LiAH\({}_{4}\) in dry ether cannot be used as the nitrobenzene is reduced **to other unintended products**, _i.e._ azo compounds, \(\text{N}^{*}\text{N}\).

## 3 Basicity of Amines

* In the gaseous phase, amines behave like a Lewis base _i.e._**electron-pair donor**.
* In aqueous medium, amines behave like a Bronsted Lowry base _i.e._**proton acceptor**.

### Lewis Theory

* Lewis Theory of acids and bases states that:

* An **Lewis acid** is a substance that can accept a pair of electrons from a Lewis base to form a dative bond i.e. **a Lewis acid is an electron-pair acceptor.**
* A **Lewis base** is a substance that that can donate a pair of electrons to a Lewis acid to form a dative bond i.e. **a Lewis base is an electron-pair donor.**

* In the gaseous phase, amines behave like a Lewis base.

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:8]

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:9]

In phenylalanine, the lone pair of electrons on the nitrogen atom is delocalised into the benzene ring. Hence the lone pair on N atom is less available for donation to a proton.

_Note:_

In general, for amines:

* **electron-donating groups increase the basicity** of amines
* **electron-withdrawing groups decrease the basicity** of amines

(ii) Effect of substituents on basicity

(a) Electron-donating substituents cause an increase in basicity

_Effect._ In the presence of electron donating group, the lone electron pair on N atom is more available to accept H+ ions. Hence, the amine compound is more basic.

(b) Electron-withdrawing substituents cause a decrease in basicity

_Effect._ In the presence of electron withdrawing group, the lone pair on N atoms is less available to accept H+ ions. Hence, the amine compound is less basic.

**3 factors determining the extent of effect**

1 Number of electron-withdrawing groups

**More electron-withdrawing groups \(\Rightarrow\) greater electron-withdrawing effect**

2 Strength of the electron-withdrawing groups

**The more electronegative the atom \(\Rightarrow\) greater electron-withdrawing effect**

3 Distance of the electron-withdrawing groups from **aliphatic/alicyclic** amine

**Nearer to the amine group \(\Rightarrow\) greater electron-withdrawing effect**

**Quick Check**

State and explain the relative basic strength of phenylalanine, 4-chlorophenylamine and 4-methylphenylamine

**Order of basicity: 4-methylphenylamine > phenylalanine > 4-chlorophenylamine**

_Equations to represent basicity_

**4-methylphenylamine**

**The electron donating -CH3 group increases the electron density of the lone pair on N atom. Hence, the lone pair on N atom is more available for donation to a proton**

4-methylphenylamine is the strongest base.

**4-chlorophenylamine**

* The **electron withdrawing chloro group decreases the electron density of the lone pair on N atom**. Hence, the **l**one pair on N atom is less available for donation to a proton**.
* 4-chlorophenylamine is the **weakest** base.

**Concept on Comparison of Acidity and Basicity of Salts [conjugate acid and bases]**

_Quick Check (H2 Chemistry N07/1/29)_

* Which salt will be the most acidic in aqueous solution?
* **A** C\({}_{2}\)HsNH\({}_{3}\)*C\(I^{-}\) **B** C\({}_{6}\)HsNH\({}_{3}\)*C\(I^{-}\) **C** K\({}^{+}\)C\(I^{-}\) **D** NH\({}_{4}\)*C\(I^{-}\)

**Explanation:**

* For Option C: KC\(I\) is neutral since it dissolves in water to form K\({}^{+}\)(aq) and C\(I\)-(aq).
* For Option A, B, D:

* **RNH\({}_{2}\) + H\({}_{2}\)O** RNH\({}_{3}\)* + OH\({}^{-}\) **RNH\({}_{2}\) + NH\({}_{3}\) + NH\({}_{3}\) + CH\({}_{3}\)** conjugate acid**
* Since basicity:

* Hence, acidity of the conjugate acid:

* **B** C\({}_{2}\)**HsNH\({}_{3}\) + NH\({}_{4}\) + C\({}_{6}\)HsNH\({}_{3}\)* (Answer: B)

**Concept:** The stronger the base, the weaker the conjugate acid.

### Electrophilic Substitution of Phenylamine

\begin{tabular}{|p{113.8pt} p{113.8pt}|} \hline
**Reagents \& Conditions:** & **Aqueous bromine, r.t.p.** \\
**Type of reaction:** & **Electrophilic Substitution** \\
**Observation:** & **Decolourisation of orange bromine solution with the formation of a white precipitate.** \\
**Application:** & As a chemical test for phenylalanine (same test as phenol) \\
**Question:** & **Why are the conditions required for this reaction mild? (i.e. no catalyst required)** \\
**_Phenylamine is more reactive than benzene towards electrophilic substitution as the -NHz group activates the ring towards electrophilic substitution. This is due to lone electron pair on N atom being delocalised into the benzene ring hence increasing the electron density in the ring._ \\ \hline \end{tabular}

**Quick Check**

Phenol and phenylalanine reacts similarly with Br\({}_{2}\) (aq) to give the same observations. How can phenol and phenylalanine be distinguished?

\begin{tabular}{p{113.8pt} p{113.8pt}} _Test:_ & Add aqueous neutral FeCl3 solution separately to each unknown compound. \\
**_Observation:_ & Phenol forms a violet complex. \\
**Phenylamine does not form a violet complex.** \\ \hline \end{tabular}

## 5 Introduction on Amino Acids

* Amino acids are **building blocks of proteins**. Of the 20 amino acids needed to make up our proteins, eight cannot be synthesised in our bodies. These eight are called essential amino acids and must be part of our diet.
* An amino acid contains at least 1 carboxylic acid group (-CO\({}_{2}\)H) and 1 amino group (-NH\({}_{2}\)).
* The C atom to which the -CO\({}_{2}\)H group is bonded to is called \(\alpha\)-carbon.
* _Definition of \(\alpha\)-amino acid_ : An amino-acid where both the -NH\({}_{2}\) and the -COOH group are directly bonded to the same C atom (\(\alpha\)-carbon)

* The side chain, R, varies considerably in the 20 naturally occurring \(\alpha\)-amino acids (see Annex). The composition of the R group confers an individual set of properties to each amino acid, which affects the properties of the proteins in which they are found. If the R group contains **one or more carboxyl group**, -COOH: **acidic** amino acid. If the R group contains **one or more amino group**, -NH\({}_{2}\): **basic** amino acid. If the R group contains **neutral group(s)**: **neutral** amino acid.
* All \(\alpha\)-amino acids that can be found in our bodies have at least 1 **chiral C centre** (except aminoethanoic acid (glycine) where R = H) with no plane of symmetry, thereby exhibiting **enantiomerism**.

### Nomenclature of Amino Acids

* Amino acids are named as derivatives of carboxylic acids.

Examples of some naturally occurring amino acids:

### Bonding of Amino Acids

_Definition of zwitterion_

* Amino acids readily exist as **electrically neutral dipolar ions** called _zwitterions_.

* The dipolar **zwitterion** is formed as a result of an **intramolecular acid-base reaction**, in which the **most acidic group** (usually a carboxylic acid) **donates a proton to the most basic group** (usually a amine group)
* Hence, amino acids are **ionic** in nature.

### Physical Properties of Amino Acids

(a)Exist as crystalline solids with high melting points (above 200\({}^{\circ}\)C)

_Reason:_High amount of energy is required to overcome the strong electrostatic forces of attraction between the zwitterions.

_Simplified structure of solid aminoethanoic acid:_

(b)Soluble in water

Amino acids are very soluble in water (and other polar solvents) but not in non-polar solvents.

_Reason:_The charged ends of the zwitterions can form strong ion-dipole interactions with the water molecules results in the release of sufficient energy that causes the detachment of zwitterions from the crystal lattice for solvation.

Amino acids can also form hydrogen bonds with water molecules.

(c)Amphoteric in nature amino acids can act as acids and bases

**Separation of Amino Acids**

Amino acids, obtained from the hydrolysis of proteins / polypeptides, can be separated by a process known as **electrophoresis**. Different amino acids can exist as zwitterions, positive ions or negative ions, depending on the pH of the solution. To separate the amino acids, the pH of the solution is varied slightly over time and the different amino acids will migrate to the electrodes at different pH values.

Amino acids can also be separated by paper chromatography. The different amino acids are separated based on different solubilities in a solvent as well as their molecular masses. Amino acids which are more soluble will move faster, and lighter amino acids will move faster than heavier amino acids. A reagent, ninhydrin, is then used to indicate the position of amino acids by the observation of a blue or purple colouration.
