The Role Concept & Stoichiometry

### Relative Atomic Mass (symbol: \(A\), no unit)

Relative atomic mass is the **ratio** of the **weighted average mass of an atom of _an element_ to **1** of the **mass of a \({}^{12}\)C atom**.

The relative atomic mass of element can be determined by the expression:

\(A=\sum\)\(\left(\begin{array}{c}\text{relative isotopic mass}\times\frac{ \text{relative abundance }\%}{100}\end{array}\right)\)

Q: Why is the relative atomic mass (_A_) not necessarily close to a whole number?

A: The naturally occurring elements often consist of a mixture of isotopes and the relative atomic mass of an element accounts for the **different isotopes and their relative proportions**.

We need Example A

Chlorine consists of two naturally-occurring isotopes, \({}^{35}\)_Cl_ and \({}^{37}\)_Cl_, with the relative abundance of 75.77% and 24.23% respectively. Calculate the relative atomic mass of chlorine.

Apply the formula: \(A_{t}=\sum\left(\begin{array}{c}\text{relative isotopic mass}\times\frac{ \text{relative abundance }\%}{100}\end{array}\right)\)

\(A_{t}\) of chlorine = \(\left(\begin{array}{c}35\times\frac{75.77}{100}\end{array}\right)+\left( \begin{array}{c}37\times\frac{24.23}{100}\end{array}\right)=\frac{35.5}{2}\)

Given the \(A\) of copper is 63.54, calculate the relative abundance of its two isotopes, \({}^{63}\)Cu and \({}^{65}\)Cu.

Let the relative abundance of \({}^{63}\)Cu be \(x\) %. (_i.e. relative abundance of \({}^{65}\)Cu is (100-x) %_)

\(63.54=\left(\begin{array}{c}63\times\frac{x}{100}\end{array}\right)+\left( \begin{array}{c}65\times\frac{100-x}{100}\end{array}\right)\)

\(x=73.0\)

The relative abundance of \({}^{63}\)Cu is 73.0 % and that of \({}^{65}\)Cu is 27.0 %.

For calculations, numerical answers for intermediate steps are generally:

**given to 4 sig. fig.**, and final steps to be expressed to 3 sig. fig.**, unless

The Role Concept & Stoichiometry

Weaker Example 1.1. Most elements contain more than one isotope, atoms that have the same chemical properties but different masses.

Which expression correctly defines the term _relative atomic mass_ of an element?

* the mass of 1 atom of an element relative to the mass of 1 atom of \({}^{12}\)C.
* the mass of 1 mole of atoms of an element divided by 6.02 x 10\({}^{23}\).
* the mass of 1 mole of atoms of an element relative to the mass of 1 atom of \({}^{12}\)C.
* the mass of 1 mole of atoms of an element relative to the mass of 1 mole of \({}^{12}\)C atoms.

**N2005/01/1**

## 2 The Role and Related Concepts (INDEPENDENT STUDY)

* (b) define the term _mole_ in terms of the Avogadro constant; (g) perform calculations, including use of the mole concept, involving: (i) reacting masses (from formulae and equations); (ii) volume of gases and; (iii) volumes and concentrations of solutions

### The Role and Avogadro constant

#### 2.1.1 Definition of the mole

* The mole is the SI unit for measuring the amount of substance. Usual symbol: \(n\); unit: mol
* The definition of the mole is as follows:

One **mole** of _any substance_ is the **amount** of that substance which **contains 6.02 x 10\({}^{23}\)** (Avogadro constant) elementary entities (or particles).

_Note_: The term elementary entities must be specified and could refer to atoms, molecules, ions or electrons etc.

* The _Avogadro constant, L_, is the **number of particles (_N_) in one mole** of a substance. i.e. \(L\) = 6.02 x 10\({}^{23}\) mol\({}^{-1}\)
* Since 1 mole of particles = 6.02 x 10\({}^{23}\) particles,

**amount of particles (in mol) = 6.02 x 10\({}^{23}\) (in mol\({}^{-1}\)) \(n\)**

Hence, the relative masses (Section 1.1 to 1.4) can be defined in terms of "1 mole" instead of "1 atom/molecule/formula units". Refer to worked example 1B.

We need to prepare each of the following:

2. 500 cm\({}^{3}\) of a solution containing 2 mol dm\({}^{-3}\) of H\({}^{+}\) ions.
3. Amount of H\({}_{2}\)SO\({}_{4}=4\times\frac{500}{1000}=\underline{2.00}\) mol

Mass of H\({}_{2}\)SO\({}_{4}\) needed = \(2.00\times\left[2\left(1.0\right)+32.1+4\left(16.0\right)\right]=\underline{196}\) g
4. Amount of H\({}^{+}\) ions = \(2\times\frac{500}{1000}=\underline{1.00}\) mol

Since H\({}_{2}\)SO\({}_{4}=2\)H\({}^{+}\),

Amount of H\({}_{2}\)SO\({}_{4}=\frac{1}{2}\times 1.00=\underline{0.500}\) mol

Mass of H\({}_{2}\)SO\({}_{4}\) needed = \(\underline{0.500}\times\left[2\left(1.0\right)+32.1+4\left(16.0\right)\right]= \underline{49.1}\) g

## 3 Empirical and Molecular Formulae (INDEPENDENT STUDY)

LO (d) define the terms _empirical_ and _molecular formula_ and;

(e) calculate empirical and molecular formulae using composition by mass

### Definitions

**Empirical formula** is the formula that shows the **simplest whole number ratio** of the number of atoms of each element present in the substance.

**Molecular formula** is the formula that shows the **actual number of atoms** of each element in **one molecule** of the compound. It is a **multiple of the empirical formula**.

* _Example:_ 

* The formulae of _tonic_ compounds are _usually_ the same as their empirical formulae.

### Calculations on Acid-Base Reactions (INDEPENDENT STUDY)

We added Example A1.

25.0 cm\({}^{3}\) of aqueous sodium hydroxide is neutralised by 15.00 cm\({}^{3}\) of a solution of hydrochloric acid of concentration 0.250 mol dm\({}^{-3}\). Determine the concentration of sodium hydroxide in the aqueous solution.

Step \(\mathbb{Q}\): _Construct balanced equation for the reaction._

NaOH(aq) + HCl(aq) \(\rightarrow\) NaC_I_(aq) + H\({}_{2}\)O(\(\dagger\))

Step \(\mathbb{Q}\): _Calculate amount of reagents used for the reaction._

amount of HCl reacted = \(0.250\times\frac{15.00}{1000}=3.750\times 10^{-3}\) mol

Step \(\mathbb{Q}\): _Complete calculations required using mole ratio between the species concerned._

Since NaOH = HCl,

amount of NaOH in 25.0 cm\({}^{3}\) of solution = \(\frac{1}{1000}=3.750\times 10^{-3}\) mol

concentration of NaOH = \(\left(3.750\times 10^{-3}\right)+\frac{25.0}{1000}=0.150\) mol dm\({}^{-3}\)

Wocked Example A2.

A solution is made by dissolving 5.00 g of an **impure** sample of sodium hydroxide in water and making it up to 1.00 dm\({}^{3}\) of solution. 25.0 cm\({}^{3}\) of this solution is neutralised by 15.15 cm\({}^{3}\) of sulfuric acid, of concentration 0.102 mol dm\({}^{-3}\). Calculate the percentage purity of the sample of sodium hydroxide.

Step \(\mathbb{Q}\): **2**NaOH(aq) + H\({}_{2}\)SO\({}_{4}\)(aq) \(\rightarrow\) Na\({}_{2}\)SO\({}_{4}\)(aq) + 2H\({}_{2}\)O(\(\dagger\))

Step \(\mathbb{Q}\): amount of H\({}_{2}\)SO\({}_{4}\) reacted = \(0.102\times\frac{15.15}{1000}=1.545\times 10^{-3}\) mol

Step \(\mathbb{Q}\): Since 2NaOH = H\({}_{2}\)SO\({}_{4}\),

amount of NaOH in 25.0 cm\({}^{3}\) of solution = \(\frac{2}{1000}=3.091\times 10^{-3}\) mol

amount of NaOH in 1 dm\({}^{3}\) of solution = \(\left(3.091\times 10^{-3}\right)\times\frac{1000}{25.0}=0.1236\) mol

**mass** of NaOH in **1 dm\({}^{3}\)** of solution = \(0.1236\times\left(23.0+16.0+1.0\right)=4.945\) g

% purity of NaOH = \(\frac{\text{mass of NaOH in sample}}{\text{mass of sample}}\times 100 \%=\frac{4.945}{5.00}\times 100\%=98.9\%\)

8.65 g of solid Na\({}_{2}\)CO\({}_{3}\cdot\)_m_H\({}_{2}\)O was dissolved in water and made up to 250 cm\({}^{3}\) in a volumetric flask. 25.0 cm\({}^{3}\) of the solution required 24.00 cm\({}^{3}\) of 0.125 mol dm\({}^{-3}\) sulfuric acid for complete reaction.

**(a)**: Calculate the amount of sulfuric acid reacted.
**(b)**: Calculate the amount of Na\({}_{2}\)CO\({}_{3}\) in the volumetric flask.
**(c)**: Hence, determine the value of \(n\) in Na\({}_{2}\)CO\({}_{3}\cdot\)_m_H\({}_{2}\)O.

**(a)**: amount of H\({}_{2}\)SO\({}_{4}\) reacted = 0.125 \(\times\)\(\dfrac{24.00}{1000}\) = 3.00 \(\times\)10\({}^{-3}\) mol
**(b)**: Since Na\({}_{2}\)CO\({}_{3}\) = H\({}_{2}\)SO\({}_{4}\),

amount of Na\({}_{2}\)CO\({}_{3}\) in **25.0 cm\({}^{3}\)** of solution = \(\dfrac{1}{10}\times\left(3.000\times 10^{-3}\right)\) = 3.000 \(\times\)10\({}^{-3}\) mol
**(c)**: amount of Na\({}_{2}\)CO\({}_{3}\) in **250 cm\({}^{3}\)** of solution = \(\dfrac{3.000}{100}\times\dfrac{10^{-3}}{25.0}\) = 0.0300 mol
**(c)**: Since Na\({}_{2}\)CO\({}_{3}\cdot\)_m_H\({}_{2}\)O = Na\({}_{2}\)CO\({}_{3}\),

amount of Na\({}_{2}\)CO\({}_{3}\cdot\)_m_H\({}_{2}\)O in 8.65g solid = amount of Na\({}_{2}\)CO\({}_{3}\) in 250 cm\({}^{3}\) soln

8.65 = amt of Na\({}_{2}\)CO\({}_{3}\cdot\)_m_H\({}_{2}\)O\(\times M_{t}\left(\text{Na}_{2}\text{CO}_{3}\cdot\text{n}\text{H}_{2}\text{O}\right)\)

* **Oxidation** involves a:

* gain of oxygen or; loss of oxygen or;
* loss of hydrogen or; gain of hydrogen or;
* loss of electrons gain of electrons results in an increase in oxidation no.

* **Oxidising agent** (oxidant) **oxidises others** while **itself is reduced** in a redox reaction.

* In a covalent bond containing 2 atoms, the **more electronegative atom will be assigned the negative oxidation number**. _e.g.:_ In HF, O.N of F = \(-1\) and O.N of H = +1 since F is more electronegative than H. In BrF\({}_{3}\), O.N of F = \(-1\) and O.N of Br = +3 since F is more electronegative than Br. _Recall:_
* _Electronegativity_ is the the ability of an atom to **attract the shared pair(s) of electrons** in a covalent bond. The more electronegative an atom, the greater is its tendency to attract electrons to itself.
* Electronegativity _increases across the Period from left to right_ and _decreases down a Group_. F is the most electronegative atom. (This will be explained in the topic Atomic Structure)
* In more complicated molecules or ions, it is helpful to deduce the oxidation states of the atoms from their structural formula. e.g. Assign oxidation numbers to all the atoms present in an ethanal molecule, C\({}_{2}\)H\({}_{4}\)O. If we were to use **steps (a-e)** to deduce the oxidation number, we will end up with the following: 

However, after examining the structural formula of ethanal, the two C atoms in the molecule are **bonded to different atoms**. This calculated value of \(-1\) actually represents the **average O.N** of the 2 C atoms present in this molecule.

Given the structural formula, oxidation numbers of atoms can be assigned by:

* Picking a bond between 2 atoms.
* The more electronegative atom will "gain" both the shared electrons in the bond, while the less electronegative atom "loses" its shared electron. For the two atoms, X and Y, in a bond, where X is more electronegative than Y, for
* a single bond, assign an O.N of \(-1\) to X and assign an O.N of +1 to Y
* a double bond, assign an O.N \(-2\) to X and assign an O.N of +2 to Y
* a triple bond, assign an O.N \(-3\) to X and assign an O.N of +3 to Y
* If the 2 atoms are identical, each atom will be assigned 0.
* The sum of the assigned O.N will be the actual oxidation number of the atom.
* If the particle carries a charge, the overall charge must be considered in the calculation of O.N.

**Common Redox Titrations**

Three types of redox titrations are commonly done in the laboratory. They are:

* manganate(VII) titrations
* dichromate(VI) titrations
* iodine-thiosulfate titrations
* manganate(VII) titrations
* Manganate(VII) ion, MnO\({}_{4}\), is a powerful oxidising agent and can be used with a wide range of reducing agents (e.g. Fe\({}^{2+}\), H\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{2}\), etc)
* In acidic medium, MnO\({}_{4}\), is reduced to manganese(II) ion, Mn\({}^{2+}\): 
 (but appears colourless in dilute soft)
* H\({}_{2}\)SO\({}_{4}\)(aq) is used to **provide the acidic medium** for manganate(VII) titrations.
* HNO\({}_{3}\)(aq) and HCI(aq) are not used**, as HNO\({}_{3}\) is an oxidising agent, and C\(\mathit{I}\) in HC\(\mathit{I}\) can be oxidised by MnO\({}_{4}\)- to C\(\mathit{I}\).
* Since KMnO\({}_{4}\) is purple in colour and its reduced product, Mn\({}^{2+}\), is pale pink (appears colourless in dilute solutions), **no indicator** is necessary for manganate(VII) titrations.
* The end-point (if the other reducing agent and its product are also colourless) occurs when **one excess drop of purple KMnO\({}_{4}\)(aq)** turns the solution in the conical flask **from colourless to permanent pale pink**.
* In the titration of Fe\({}^{2+}\)(aq) with acidified KMnO\({}_{4}\)(aq) in the burette, the colour change in the conical flask will be _yellow to orange_.

The Molec Concept & Stoichiometry

* (c) iodine-thiosulfate titrations
* Thiosulfate ions, S\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{3}\)\({}^{2-}\), is a **common reducing agent for titration with iodine**: \[\begin{array}{c}\text{I}_{2}+\text{ }2\text{S}_{2}\text{O}_{3}\text{${}^{2-}$ }\rightarrow\underbrace{2\text{I}^{-}+\text{ S}_{4}\text{O}_{6}\text{${}^{2-}$}}_{ colourless}\end{array}\] \[\begin{array}{c}\text{lodine-thiosulfate titrations can be used to determine the amount of (i) **iodine directly*
* or (ii) **oxidising agent that will liberate iodine with potassium iodide**. In this case, the iodometric titration (where we titrate the iodine that is formed) usually involves two steps: 1. The oxidising agent is added to excess KI(aq) to liberate I\({}_{2}\)(aq). 2. The liberated I\({}_{2}\)(aq) is then titrated against standard S\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{3}\)\({}^{2-}\) solution.

Why is **excess** KI needed in step 1 of the iodometric titration on point **(c)**(ii)? It is to ensure that the oxidising agent is completely reacted. In addition, I\({}_{2}\) is not very soluble in water and would dissolve in water by reacting with excess I\({}^{\text{-}}\) to form soluble I\({}_{3}\) (_i.e._ I\({}_{2}\)(aq)).

Why should iodine solution be titrated as soon as possible once it is prepared? I\({}_{2}\) is volatile. If not titrated as soon as possible, the amount of I\({}_{2}\) will decrease over time.

In the **absence of starch**, the colour change at the **end-point is pale yellow to colourless**. When **starch** is used as an **indicator**, it is usually **added near the end-point of the titration** (when the solution is pale yellow). The unreacted I\({}_{2}\) forms a **dark blue complex** with starch, and the solution will **turn colourless** when all the iodine has been used up (_i.e._ end-point is reached).

Why is the starch indicator added only near the end-point of the titration?

Starch solution cannot be added at the beginning of titration as starch-iodine complex can precipitate out at high concentration of I\({}_{2}\). Therefore, the starch solution should be added near the end-point to **avoid precipitation of starch-iodine complex**.

After complete titration, I\({}^{\text{-}}\) formed may be slowly oxidised by O\({}_{2}\) in air to give I\({}_{2}\). Hence, a slow reappearance of blue coloration is observed. There is no need to re-titrate/continue with the titration.

Hydrogencarbonate ions (HCO3-) react with acid

The reaction of CO3- with acids **occurs in 2 steps**: \\

If the pH is monitored during an acid-carbonate titration, 2 sharp changes in pH (_i.e._ 2 equivalence points) **will be observed when _reaction (1)_ and _(2)_ are completed respectively.

The Mode Concept & Stoichiometry

Weaked Example 1.

A solution contains **both** sodium carbonate and sodium hydrogencarbonate.

25.0 cm\({}^{3}\) of the solution was titrated against 0.300 mol dm\({}^{-3}\) hydrochloric acid until phenolphthalein turned colourless. A few drops of methyl orange was added and the titration continued until methyl orange changed colour.

The titration curve is on the right.

Determine

**(a)** amount of CO\({}_{3}\)\({}^{2-}\) in 25.0 cm\({}^{3}\) of the solution

**(b)** concentration, in mol dm\({}^{-3}\), of sodium carbonate;

**(c)** volume of HCl required to completely react with

HCO\({}_{3}\)\({}^{-}\) in the **original** solution

**(d)** concentration, in mol dm\({}^{-3}\), of sodium hydrogencarbonate in the **original** solution.

**(a)** **1st** end-point: CO\({}_{3}\)\({}^{2-}\)(aq) + H\({}^{+}\)(aq) \(\rightarrow\) HCO\({}_{3}\)\({}^{-}\)(aq)

-- reaction **(1)**

**2nd** end-point: HCO\({}_{3}\)\({}^{-}\)(aq) + H\({}^{+}\)(aq) \(\rightarrow\) CO\({}_{2}\)(g) + H\({}_{2}\)O(l)

-- reaction **(2)**

Volume of HCl required **for reaction (1)** = **15.00 cm\({}^{3}\)**

For reaction **(1)**, since CO\({}_{3}\)\({}^{2-}\) = H\({}^{+}\),

**(b)** concentration of Na\({}_{2}\)CO\({}_{3}=\left(4.50\times 10^{-3}\right)+\frac{25.0}{1000}=\underline{0.180}\) mol dm\({}^{-3}\)

**(c)** Vol. of acid required to **react with HCO\({}_{3}\)\({}^{-}\) in original** mixture

= (total vol. of acid - 2x) = \(\underline{35.00}\) - 2(\(\underline{15.00}\)) = \(\underline{5.00}\) cm\({}^{3}\)

**(d)** Since H\({}^{+}\) = HCO\({}_{3}\)\({}^{-}\)(original),

amount of HCO\({}_{3}\) in 25.0 cm\({}^{3}\) of original solution = \(1\times\left(0.300\times\frac{5.00}{1000}\right)=\underline{1.500\times 10^{-3} }\) mol

concentration of HCO\({}_{3}\)\({}^{-}\) in original solution = \(1.500\times 10^{-3}+\frac{25.0}{1000}=\underline{0.0600}\) mol dm\({}^{-3}\)
