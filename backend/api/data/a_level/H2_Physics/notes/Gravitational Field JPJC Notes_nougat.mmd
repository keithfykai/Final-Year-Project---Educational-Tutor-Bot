## Introduction

* Isaac Newton (1642 -1726), published _Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica ("Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy")_ in 1687. In it, he formulated the Newton's laws of motion (Dynamics), and the Newton's law of gravitation (Gravitational Field).
* Newton's studies in gravitation started when he observed an apple falling to the ground and he began to ask himself questions. Why does a falling apple always descend perpendicularly to the ground? Did the force that pulled an apple to the Earth also extend further and pull bodies like the Moon towards the Earth? Would this force affect the orbit of the moon? We will answer these questions and more in this chapter.

## 1 Gravitational Force

### Newton's law of gravitation

* Mathematically, it is written as \(F_{g}=G\frac{m_{t}m_{2}}{r^{2}}\) where \(G\) is the gravitational constant with a value of \(6.67\times 10^{-11}\) N m\({}^{2}\) kg\({}^{-2}\), \(m_{1}\) and \(m_{2}\) are the masses of the two bodies respectively, \(r\) is the distance between their centres of masses, and \(F_{g}\) is the magnitude of the gravitational force acting between them.
* This is known as an inverse square law, as the magnitude of the force varies with the inverse square of the separation of the particles.
* The gravitational forces of attraction between two bodies form an action-reaction pair, consistent with Newton's third law.
* For spherical masses, the distance \(r\) is measured between their respective centres of mass (assume mass concentrated at centre).

Figure 1: Gravitational force between two bodiesIn vector form, the equation is written as \(\bar{F}=-G\frac{m_{t}m_{2}}{\bar{r}^{2}}\) to indicate the attractive nature of the force. The negative sign is normally ignored when only magnitude is required.

**Example 1** \\ A man of mass 85.0 kg is standing on the surface of the Earth. Given that the mass of the Earth is 5.98 x 10\({}^{24}\) kg with a radius of 6.37 x 10\({}^{6}\) m, calculate the gravitational force the Earth exerts on the man. \\ \end{tabular}

Hence, state the gravitational force the man exerts on the Earth.

Solution:

\[F_{g} =\frac{Gm_{t}m_{2}}{r^{2}}\] \[=\frac{(6.67\times 10^{11})(5.98\times 10^{24})(85.0)}{(6.37\times 1 0^{6})^{2}}\] \[=835.539...\text{ N}\] \[\approx 840\text{ N}\]

The gravitational force that the Earth exerts on the man is 840 N towards Earth.

The gravitational force that the man exerts on the Earth is 840 N towards the man.

* _Candidates should be able to derive, from Newton's law of gravitation and the definition of gravitational field strength, the equation \(g=\frac{GM}{r^{2}}\) for the gravitational field strength of a point mass_

### Gravitational field strength

**Gravitational field strength at a point is defined as the gravitational force per unit mass acting at that point.**

**Fig. 3 Gravitational field strength at point X due to an object of mass \(M\) is \(g_{X}=\frac{GM}{r^{2}}\)**

**It is a vector having both direction and magnitude, therefore addition of gravitational field strengths must be done by vector addition. The direction is the same as the gravitational force. Units for \(g\) is \(\mathrm{N\,kg^{-1}}\).**

**Note that the gravitational field at point X in Fig. 3 is independent of mass \(m\). The value of \(g\) only depends on the distance \(r\) from the object causing the gravitational field.**

**Example: Using Newton's law of gravitation and the definition of gravitational field strength, derive the equation \(g=\frac{GM}{r^{2}}\).**

**Solution: Consider a mass \(M\) and another mass \(m\) placed at point X, which is at a distance \(r\) away from mass \(M\).**

**By Newton's law of gravitation, the force \(F_{g}\) experienced by mass \(m\) is \(\frac{GMm}{r^{2}}\).**

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:6]

**Examples**

The distance between an object A of mass 8000 kg and another object B of mass 8000 kg is 0.25 m. Calculate the resultant gravitational field strength due to both the objects at a point P 0.20 m away from both A and B.

Solution:

Let the gravitational field strengths due to objects A and B at P be \(g_{A}\) and \(g_{B}\) respectively.

Since masses A and B are the same and P is equidistant from A and B,

\(g_{A}=g_{B}=G\frac{M_{A}}{r_{A}^{2}}\)

\(=6.67\times 10^{-11}\times\frac{8000}{0.20^{2}}\)

\(\approx 1.33\times 10^{-5}\)   N kg\({}^{-1}\)

Using cosine rule,

\(g_{R}^{2}=g_{A}^{2}+g_{B}^{2}-2g_{A}g_{B}\cos 103^{\circ}\)

\(g_{R}^{2}=\left(1.33\times 10^{5}\right)^{2}+\left(1.33\times 10^{5}\right)^{2}-2 \left(1.33\times 10^{2}\right)^{2}\cos 103^{\circ}\)

\(g_{R}\approx 2.09\times 10^{-5}\)   N kg\({}^{-1}\)

Therefore, the resultant gravitational field strength is 2.09\(\times 10^{-5}\)   N kg\({}^{-1}\) and its direction is towards the mid point of AB.

* _Cenfelas should be able to show an appreciation that an the surface of the Earth, gravitational field strength is approximately constant and is equal to the acceleration of free fall._

### Variation of Earth's gravitational field strength

* From the surface of the Earth upwards, the value of \(g\) follows an inverse square law (\(\propto\frac{1}{r^{2}}\) ).
* Within the Earth (assuming that the Earth is uniform in density), \(g\) decreases uniformly (\(\propto r\) ) with the radius \(r\) until it is zero at the centre of the Earth.
* The value of \(g\) can vary at some places due to the fact that the Earth is not a perfect sphere. Also, the rotation of the Earth causes deviations from the standard value.

### Earth's gravitational field strength at the surface

* The gravitational field strength \(g\) near the surface of the Earth is approximately constant at 9.81 N kg\({}^{-1}\), also known as acceleration of free fall, with the value of 9.81 m s\({}^{-2}\).
* The approximate constancy should be appreciated by considering the value of \(g\) at height \(h\) above the surface, where h is small compared to the radius \(R\) of the Earth of mass \(M\).

\[g=\frac{GM}{(h+R)^{2}}\approx\frac{GM}{R^{2}}\quad\mbox{since $h<<R$}\]
* Near the surface of the Earth, the gravitational field lines are nearly uniform.

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:9]

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:10]

Solution:

Let the gravitational potential at point P due to object A be \(\phi_{A}\) and that due to object B be \(\phi_{B}\). Since gravitational potential is a scalar quantity, we can simply add the potentials due to objects A and B.

\[\phi_{P} =\phi_{A}+\phi_{B}\] \[\phi_{P} =-\frac{GM_{A}}{r}+\left(-\frac{GM_{B}}{r}\right)\] \[\phi_{P} =-\frac{6.67\times 10^{-11}\times 8000}{0.20}+\left(-\frac{6.67 \times 10^{-11}\times 8000}{0.20}\right)\] \[\phi_{P} \approx-5.3\times 10^{-6}\ \ \mathrm{J\,kg^{-1}}\]

Example A:

Calculate the energy required to move a 3000 kg satellite to a height of 200 km above the Earth's surface.

(Given that radius of the Earth \(R_{E}=6.4\times 10^{6}\)m; mass of the Earth \(M_{E}=6.0\times 10^{24}\)kg.)

Solution:

Energy required = change in G.P.E.

\[=-\frac{GMm}{R+h}-\left(-\frac{GMm}{R}\right)\] \[=-GMm\left(\frac{1}{R+h}-\frac{1}{R}\right)\] \[=-\left(6.67\times 10^{-11}\right)\left(6.0\times 10^{24}\right) \times 3000\times\left[\frac{1}{\left[6.4\times 10^{6}\right)+\left(200\times 10^{3} \right]}-\frac{1}{6.4\times 10^{6}}\right]\] \[\approx 5.7\times 10^{9}\ \ \mathrm{J}\]

Exercise: Can you prove that the gain in gravitational potential energy by an object of mass \(m\) moving a distance \(h\) from the Earth's surface is mgh?

### Escape velocity

* **Escape velocity (\(\nu_{esc}\))** from a point on the surface of a planet is the minimum velocity required to project a mass \(m\) to infinity
* To escape from the Earth's surface, an object needs to have sufficient kinetic energy in order to overcome the gravitational pull of the Earth.
* The minimum kinetic energy required is equivalent to the gain in gravitational potential energy by the object of mass \(m\) in leaving Earth to escape to infinity. loss in _K.E._ = gain in _G.P.E._ \[\frac{1}{2}{m_{esc}}^{2}-0=U_{\infty}-U_{Earth's surface}\] (assuming that _K.E._ at infinity is zero) \[\frac{1}{2}{m_{esc}}^{2}=\left[0-\left(-\frac{GM_{E}m}{R_{E}}\right)\right] \text{since }U_{\infty}=0\,.\] \[\nu_{esc}=\sqrt{\frac{2GM_{E}}{R_{E}}}\] Since \(g=\frac{GM_{E}}{R_{E}}^{2}\), \(\nu_{esc}\) can also be written as \(\left|\nu_{esc}=\sqrt{2gR_{E}}\right|\), where \(g\) is the gravitational field strength at the Earth's surface.
* Therefore, from the Earth's surface, the escape velocity is \[\nu=\sqrt{2\times 9.81\times 6.4\times 10^{6}}\approx 11200\,\text{m}\, \text{s}^{-1}\] This is equivalent to travelling at about 34 times the speed of sound! Note: If the launch of the satellite is not from the surface of the Earth, we cannot use \(g=9.81\)\(\text{N}\,\text{kg}^{-1}\).

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:13]

(b) \(T=\frac{2\pi}{\omega}=\frac{2\pi\pi}{\nu}=\frac{2\pi\times\left[6.4\times 10^{6} \right]+\left(850\times 10^{3}\right)}{7430}\approx 6131\) s \(\approx 1.7\) hours

\(\bullet\)Contactacts should be able to show an understanding of geostationary grids and their application.

### Geostationary satellite

The term geostationary implies a satellite is fixed about a position above the Earth.

This is possible because

- the satellite has the same period as the Earth's rotation (\(T=24\) hours),

- the satellite revolves from West to East, in the same direction as the Earth's rotation,

- the plane of revolution of the satellite is in the plane of the Equator.

Examples of geostationary satellites are GMS1, GEOS, METEOSAT, etc. Most of these satellites are used for commercial and military purposes.

\(\bullet\)Extending

For a geostationary satellite, determine the radius of its orbit and its height above the Earth's surface.

Solution:

By Newton's second law,

\(F_{g}=F_{e}\)

\(\frac{GM_{E}m}{r^{2}}=m\epsilon^{2}\)

\(\frac{GM_{E}}{r^{2}}=f\left(\frac{2\pi}{T}\right)^{2}\)

\(T^{2}=\frac{4\pi^{2}r^{3}}{GM_{E}}\) (Kepler's 3\({}^{\text{rd}}\) law, where \(T^{2}\propto r^{3}\))

For geostationary satellite, \(T=24\) hours, hence

\(\left(24\times 3600\right)^{2}=\frac{4\pi^{2}r^{3}}{6.67\times 10^{-11}\times \left(6.0\times 10^{24}\right)}\)

\(r\approx 4.2\times 10^{7}\)m

Hence, the radius of the satellite's orbit is \(4.2\times 10^{7}\)m.

Height of satellite above the Earth's surface

\(=\left(4.2\times 10^{7}\right)-\left(6.4\times 10^{6}\right)\)

\(\approx 3.6\times 10^{7}\)m
For a satellite of mass \(m\) in a circular orbit of radius \(r\) about a large mass \(M\), the gravitational potential energy \(E_{P}\) it possesses is given by

\[\boxed{E_{P}=-\frac{GMm}{r}}\]

The kinetic energy \(E_{K}\) of an orbiting satellite can be found by applying Newton's second law on the satellite.

\[F_{g} =F_{c}\] \[\frac{GMm}{r^{2}} =\frac{mv^{2}}{r}\] \[\boxed{E_{K}=\frac{GMm}{2r}}\]

The total energy \(E_{T}\) is the sum of the gravitational potential and kinetic energies.

\[E_{T} =E_{P}+E_{K}\] \[E_{T} =-\frac{GMm}{r}+\frac{GMm}{2r}\] \[\boxed{E_{T}=-\frac{GMm}{2r}}\]

Figure 9: Variation of energies for a satellite in orbit

1. Show that the speed of the satellite in the new orbit is 7620 m s\({}^{-1}\). 2. Calculate the change in 1. kinetic energy, 2. gravitational potential energy, 3. total energy. 3. State whether this change in total energy is an increase or decrease. Solution: 1. \(F_{g}=F_{e}\Rightarrow\frac{GM_{e}m}{r^{2}}=\frac{mv^{2}}{r}\Rightarrow\nu= \sqrt{\frac{GM_{e}}{r}}\) \[7780=\sqrt{\frac{GM_{E}}{6610\times 10^{3}}}\] \[GM_{E}=4.001\times 10^{14}\] Therefore, speed of satellite in new orbit, \[\nu^{\prime}=\sqrt{\frac{GM_{E}}{r^{\prime}}}\] \[=\sqrt{\frac{4.001\times 10^{14}}{6890\times 10^{3}}}\] \[\approx 7620\text{ \, ms}^{-1}\] 2. 1. \(\Delta K.E.=\frac{1}{2}m\text{ \, }\nu_{2}\text{ }^{2}-\frac{1}{2}m\text{ \, }\nu_{1}\text{ }^{2}\) \[=\frac{1}{2}(120)\left(7620^{2}-7780^{2}\right)\] \[\approx-1.48\times 10^{8}\text{ J}\] 2. \(\Delta G.P.E.=U_{2}-U_{1}=\left(\frac{-GM_{e}m}{R_{2}}\right)-\left(\frac{- GM_{e}m}{R_{1}}\right)=GM_{e}m\left[\frac{1}{R_{1}}-\frac{1}{R_{2}}\right]\) \[=\left(4.001\times 10^{14}\right)\times 120\times\left[\frac{1}{6610 \times 10^{3}}-\frac{1}{6890\times 10^{3}}\right]\] \[\approx 2.95\times 10^{8}\text{ J}\] 3. Total change in energy \(=\Delta K.E.+\Delta G.P.E.\) \(=\left(-1.48\times 10^{8}\right)+\left(2.95\times 10^{8}\right)\) \(=1.47\times 10^{8}\text{ J}\) 3. The total energy has increased by \(1.47\times 10^{8}\text{ J}\).
