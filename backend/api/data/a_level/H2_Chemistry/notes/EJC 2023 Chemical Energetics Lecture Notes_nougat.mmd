## 1 Introduction

In our everyday lives, we observe some changes occurring by themselves (spontaneous), while others require a continuous input of energy to make them happen (non-spontaneous). For example, calcium carbonate reacts readily with hydrochloric acid to form calcium chloride, carbon dioxide, and water. However, if we were to mix calcium chloride, carbon dioxide, and water together, they do not react to form the calcium carbonate and hydrochloric acid.

In the topic of Chemical Energetics, we are trying to understand why chemical reactions and physical changes happen. We will examine both the heat change of a reaction, as well as the change in the degree of disorder in the reaction system.

The following questions will be answered when we complete this topic:

* What are the energy changes in a chemical or physical process?
* How can we measure or find out the energy change in a chemical or physical process?
* Why do some chemical or physical processes take place spontaneously?
* How can we predict if a process is spontaneous?

### _Enthalpy and enthalpy changes_

Learning Outcome:

* explain that most chemical reactions are accompanied by energy changes, principally in the form of heat usually associated with the breaking and forming of chemical bonds; the reaction can be exothermic (\(\Delta H\) negative) or endothermic (\(\Delta H\) positive)
* construct and interpret an energy profile diagram, in terms of the enthalpy change of the reaction and of the activation energy

The total chemical energy of a substance is called its **enthalpy** (or heat content), _H._ Chemical energy consists of kinetic energy and potential energy. The potential energy, due to the electrostatic forces of attraction between particles, is usually the main component of the total chemical energy. The absolute enthalpy of a substance cannot be measured, but we can measure the changes in enthalpy accompanying a process.

During a chemical reaction at constant pressure, bonds are broken and new bonds are formed. The breaking of bonds requires energy while the formation of bonds releases energy. The energy change (the flow of thermal energy) that occurs is called the **enthalpy change**, \(\Delta H\). The units for \(\Delta H\) are **kJ mol-4** or **J mol-4**.

Generally, exothermic reactions are more **energetically feasible** than endothermic reactions, and are thus **more likely to occur**.

### Thermochemical equation

A thermochemical equation is a balanced equation that includes the enthalpy change of the reaction. The **state symbols** are included for **all** formulae given in a thermochemical equation since a change in state is accompanied by a change in energy.

#### E.g.

\(\mathrm{H_{2}(g)+\gamma O_{2}(g)\to H_{2}O(\gamma)}\)\(\Delta H_{t}=-285.9\) kJ mol-1

The equation above indicates that 285.9 kJ of heat is released when 1 mole of \(\mathrm{H_{2}}\) gas reacts with 0.5 mole of \(\mathrm{O_{2}}\) gas to give 1 mole of liquid \(\mathrm{H_{2}O}\).

The magnitude of \(\Delta H\) is directly proportional to the amount of reactant consumed in the process.

If we multiply both sides of a thermochemical equation by a factor \(n\), then \(\Delta H\) must change by the same factor. For example, if we double the above equation, then \(\Delta H_{t}=2(-285.9)\) kJ mol-1.

## 2 Definitions of Enthalpy Changes of Reactions (Part I)

Learning Outcome:

explain and use the terms:

_enthalpy change of reaction_ and _standard conditions_, with particular reference to: formation; combustion; neutralisation;

_bond energy_ (_AH_ positive, i.e. bond breaking)

### Standard enthalpy change of formation, \(\Delta H_{\mathrm{t}}^{\mathrm{\varphi}}\)

The standard enthalpy change of formation, \(\Delta H_{\mathrm{t}}^{\mathrm{\varphi}}\), is the **energy change** when **1 mole of a substance in its standard state** is formed from its **constituent elements in their standard states**, at a specified temperature, usually 298 K.

e.g. \(\gamma_{\mathrm{z}}\mathrm{H_{2}(g)}+\gamma_{\mathrm{z}}\mathrm{I_{2}(s)} \rightarrow\) HI(g) \(\Delta H_{\mathrm{t}}^{\mathrm{\varphi}}\)= +26.5 kJ mol-1

2C(s) + 3H_2(g) + \(\gamma_{\mathrm{z}}\mathrm{O_{2}(g)}\rightarrow\) C_2H_5OH(0) \(\Delta H_{\mathrm{t}}^{\mathrm{\varphi}}\)= -298 kJ mol-1

The standard enthalpy change of formation of **elements** in their standard state (at 1 bar) is **zero**.

e.g. \(Cl_{\mathrm{z}}\mathrm{(g)}\rightarrow Cl_{\mathrm{z}}\mathrm{(g)}\)\(\Delta H_{\mathrm{t}}^{\mathrm{\varphi}}\)= 0

\(\Delta H_{\mathrm{t}}^{\mathrm{\varphi}}\) is a measure of the energetic stability of a substance relative to its constituent elements.

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|} \hline If \(\Delta H_{\mathrm{t}}^{\mathrm{\varphi}}\) is **positive**, & If \(\Delta H_{\mathrm{t}}^{\mathrm{\varphi}}\) is **negative**, \\ \hline Compound is **less stable** than its constituent elements. & Compound is **more stable** than its constituent elements. \\ \hline \end{tabular}

#### e.g. \(\Delta H_{\mathrm{t}}^{\mathrm{\varphi}}\)

Write an equation to represent the standard enthalpy change of formation of CaSO\({}_{4}\)(s).

#### Standard enthalpy change of combustion, \(\Delta H_{\mathrm{c}}^{\mathrm{\varphi}}\)

The standard enthalpy change of combustion, \(\Delta H_{\mathrm{c}}^{\mathrm{\varphi}}\), is the **energy released** when **1 mole of a substance** is **completely burnt in excess oxygen**, with all reactants and products in their **standard states**, at a specified temperature, usually 298 K.

e.g. \(\mathrm{CH_{4}(g)}+2\mathrm{O_{2}(g)}\rightarrow\mathrm{CO_{2}(g)}+2\mathrm{H_{2 }O(\mathit{l})}\)\(\Delta H_{\mathrm{c}}^{\mathrm{\varphi}}\)= -866 kJ mol-1

**Mg(s)**+ \(\gamma_{\mathrm{z}}\mathrm{O_{2}(g)}\rightarrow\mathrm{MgO(s)}\)\(\Delta H_{\mathrm{c}}^{\mathrm{\varphi}}\)= -601 kJ mol-1

The enthalpy change of combustion is **always exothermic**_i.e._ heat is always evolved in combustion. \(\Delta H_{\mathrm{c}}^{\mathrm{\varphi}}\) can be used to compare the energy values of fuels and food. The more exothermic the \(\Delta H_{\mathrm{c}}^{\mathrm{\varphi}}\), the higher the energy value of the fuel or food.

Sample 25

State the type of enthalpy change(s) represented by the equation H\({}_{2}\)(g) + \(\gamma\)\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{2}\)(g) \(\rightarrow\) H\({}_{2}\)O(\(\dagger\)).

In some cases, \(\Delta H^{\phi}_{t}\) and \(\Delta H^{\phi}_{c}\) are equivalent. They have the same value and are represented by the same chemical equation.

### Standard enthalpy change of neutralisation, \(\Delta H^{\phi}_{\rm neu}\)

The standard enthalpy change of neutralisation, \(\Delta H^{\phi}_{\rm neu}\), is the **energy released** when **1 mole of water** is formed in the **neutralisation reaction between an acid and a base**, all in their **standard states**, at a specified temperature, usually 298 K.

Neutralisation is an **exothermic** reaction since it involves the **attraction** of H\({}^{+}\) and OH\({}^{-}\) ions to form an O-H bond.

H\({}^{+}\)(aq) + OH\({}^{-}\)(aq) \(\rightarrow\) H\({}_{2}\)O(\(\dagger\))\(\Delta H^{\phi}_{\rm neu}\) = -57.0 kJ mol\({}^{-1}\)

The enthalpy change of neutralisation of a strong acid with a strong base is **almost the same for all strong acids and bases** (-57.0 kJ mol\({}^{-1}\)). This is because strong acids and strong bases **dissociate completely** in dilute aqueous solution. The reactions between them are effectively the reactions between aqueous H\({}^{+}\) ions and OH\({}^{-}\) ions.

_E.g._ KOH(aq) + HNO\({}_{3}\)(aq) \(\rightarrow\) KNO\({}_{3}\)(aq) + H\({}_{2}\)O(\(\dagger\)\(\Delta H^{\phi}_{\rm neu}\) = -57.0 kJ mol\({}^{-1}\)

NaOH(aq) + \(\gamma\)\({}_{2}\)H\({}_{2}\)SO\({}_{4}\) (aq) \(\rightarrow\)\(\gamma\)Na\({}_{2}\)SO\({}_{4}\)(aq) + H\({}_{2}\)O(\(\dagger\)\(\Delta H^{\phi}_{\rm neu}\) = -57.0 kJ mol\({}^{-1}\)

K\({}^{+}\), NO\({}_{3}\)-, Na\({}^{+}\) and C\(\dagger\) ions are essentially spectator ions in the above neutralisation reactions. Hence, the reactions are effectively the same: H\({}^{+}\)(aq) + OH\({}^{-}\)(aq) \(\rightarrow\) H\({}_{2}\)O(\(\dagger\)).

The enthalpy change of neutralisation involving a **weak acid or weak base** may be **slightly less exothermic** than -57.0 kJ mol\({}^{-1}\). This is because weak acids and weak bases do not dissociate completely in dilute aqueous solution. During neutralisation, **energy is absorbed to dissociate the undissociated weak acid or weak base** to form H\({}^{+}\) or OH\({}^{-}\) respectively. Thus, less energy is released and the resulting \(\Delta H^{\phi}_{\rm neu}\) is less exothermic.

_E.g._ OH\({}^{-}\)(aq) + CH\({}_{3}\)CO\({}_{2}\)H(aq) \(\rightarrow\) CH\({}_{3}\)CO\({}_{2}\)(aq) + H\({}_{2}\)O(\(\dagger\))\(\Delta H^{\phi}_{\rm neu}\) = -55.2 kJ mol\({}^{-1}\)

The difference of +1.8 kJ mol\({}^{-1}\) compared to the enthalpy change of neutralisation of a strong acid with a strong base is due to the absorption of energy during the dissociation of the undissociated weak acid, CH\({}_{3}\)CO\({}_{2}\)H(aq).

CH\({}_{3}\)CO\({}_{2}\)H(aq) \(\rightleftharpoons\) CH\({}_{3}\)CO\({}_{2}\)(aq) + H\({}^{+}\)(aq)\(\Delta H^{\phi}\) = +1.8 kJ mol\({}^{-1}\)

#### Calculations using experimental results

Learning Outcome:

(d) calculate enthalpy changes from appropriate experimental results, including the use of the relationship:

heat change = -\(mc\Delta T\)

The heat change, \(q\), can be calculated using the following formula:

\begin{tabular}{|l|} \hline \(q\) = heat change (unit: J) \\ positive (+) if heat is gained from the surroundings by the system \\ negative (-) if heat is lost to the surroundings from the system \\ \(q=-mc\Delta T\) & \(m\) = mass of solution (unit: g) \\ \(c\) = specific heat capacity of water (unit: J g\({}^{-1}\) K\({}^{-1}\)) \\ \(\Delta T\) = temperature change of solution (unit: K or \({}^{0}\)C) \\ = final temperature of solution - **initial** temperature of solution \\ \hline \end{tabular}

The **specific heat capacity**, \(c\), is defined as the amount of heat required to raise the temperature of 1 g of the substance by 1 K. The SI unit of specific heat capacity is J g\({}^{-1}\) K\({}^{-1}\).

Sometimes, the heat capacity of the substance is given instead. The **heat capacity**, \(C\), is defined as the amount of heat required to raise the temperature of a certain mass of the substance by 1 K (or 1 \({}^{0}\)C). The SI unit for heat capacity is J K\({}^{-1}\). To calculate the heat change, we use the following equation:

\begin{tabular}{|l|} \hline \(q\) = heat change (unit: J) \\ positive (+) if heat is gained from the surroundings by the system \\ negative (-) if heat is lost to the surroundings from the system \\ \(q=-C\Delta T\) & C = heat capacity of solution (unit: J K\({}^{-1}\)) \\ \(\Delta T\) = temperature change of solution (unit: K or \({}^{0}\)C) \\ = final temperature of solution - **initial** temperature of solution \\ \hline \end{tabular}

Since we define enthalpy change of reaction (\(\Delta H\)) for every one mole of the _limiting reagent or a specific substance_ identified in the definition, we can calculate the **enthalpy change of reaction (\(\Delta H\))** by using the following equation:

\[\text{enthalpy change of reaction},\ \Delta H_{t}=\frac{q}{n}=\frac{-mc\Delta T}{ \text{amount of limiting reagent / specified substance}}\]

The sign of \(\Delta H\) denotes whether the reaction is exothermic (_i.e._ energy lost to surroundings) or endothermic (_i.e._ energy gained from surroundings). If the reaction is exothermic, \(\Delta H_{t}\) will be negative. If the reaction is endothermic, \(\Delta H_{t}\) will be positive.

Equible Ag- Reaction between a self and aqueous solution

50.0 cm\({}^{3}\) of 0.10 mol dm\({}^{-3}\) silver nitrate solution was placed in a polystyrene cup. A known mass of zinc powder was added and the following results were obtained.

\begin{tabular}{|l|c|} \hline mass of weighing bottle & 4.310 \\ and Zn powder / g & \\ \hline mass of weighing bottle & 3.510 \\ and residual Zn / g & \\ \hline mass of Zn added / g & 0.800 \\ \hline \end{tabular}

Calculate the enthalpy change for the reaction

\begin{tabular}{|l|c|} \hline Heat change = \(-mc\lambda T\) & \\ = & \\ Amount of Zn added = 0.8 \(\div\) 65.4 = 0.0122 mol & \\ Amount of Ag\({}^{+}\) reacted = 0.10 x 50.0 \(\div\) 1000 = 0.00500 mol \(\Rightarrow\) Ag\({}^{+}\) is the limiting reactant \\ \(\Delta H\) (for one mole of Ag\({}^{+}\)) = & \\ \(\therefore\Delta H\) (for two moles of Ag\({}^{+}\)) = & \\ \(\therefore\Delta H\) (for one mole of Ag\({}^{+}\)) = & \\ \(\therefore\Delta H\) (for two moles of Ag\({}^{+}\)) = & \\ \(\hline \end{tabular}

Note:

According to the written equation, you need to determine the enthalpy change when 1 mole of Zn reacts with **2 moles of Ag\({}^{+}\)**, hence the 'x2' in the calculations.

### Temperature correction

In many experiments, the temperature may not immediately reach a maximum (or minimum), especially when the **reaction is slow**. In such reactions, heat loss to (or gain from) the surroundings becomes significant. To account for heat loss to (or gain from) the surroundings, a series of temperatures can be recorded before and after the mixing to give a **temperature-time graph**. Extrapolation is done to the point of mixing to obtain a more accurate maximum (or minimum) temperature.

### Example 3B

The experiment in **Example 3B** was repeated with the temperature being monitored continuously. Zinc powder was added when \(t\) = 3 min and the following results were obtained.

### Calorimetry to determine enthalpy change of combustion

The following experimental set-up can be used to determine the \(\Delta H_{\mathrm{c}}^{\mathrm{e}}\) for a fuel such as ethanol. A known volume of water is placed in the metal (usually copper) calorimeter, and its initial temperature measured. The fuel is placed in the spirit burner and weighed. The spirit burner is then lit under the calorimeter, and the heat released during combustion heats up the water in the calorimeter. After some time, the combustion is stopped. The final temperature of the water is measured and the spirit burner is weighed again.

When highly accurate values of \(\Delta H_{\mathrm{c}}^{\mathrm{e}}\) such as the energy value of fuels and food is required, a **bomb calorimeter** can be used.

The bomb calorimeter works in a similar way as the set-up described above. A known mass of the substance whose \(\Delta H_{\mathrm{c}}^{\mathrm{e}}\) is to be determined is ignited in excess oxygen by heated ignition wires in a bomb calorimeter. The heat released from the combustion is transferred to a known mass of water in the calorimeter. The rise in temperature of the water is then measured, and the necessary calculations can be done. The bomb calorimeter is more accurate as the heat capacity of the bomb calorimeter and the heat evolved in burning the iron ignition wires used to ignite the substance can be taken into account.

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|} \hline \multicolumn{1}{|c|}{Chemical Energetics: Thermochemistry \& Thermodynamics} \\ \hline \multicolumn{1}{|c|}{E.ample-60} \\ \hline \multicolumn{1}{|c|}{In an experiment to determine \(\Delta H_{\mathrm{c}}^{\odot}\) for ethanol, C\({}_{2}\)H\({}_{5}\)OH the following results were obtained.} \\ \hline mass of water in calorimeter / g & 250.000 \\ \hline mass of burner and ethanol before combustion / g & 16.200 \\ \hline mass of burner and ethanol after combustion / g & 15.670 \\ \hline temperature of water before combustion / \({}^{\circ}\)C & 29.6 \\ \hline temperature of water after combustion / \({}^{\circ}\)C & 40.0 \\ \hline \end{tabular}

Calculate \(\Delta H_{\mathrm{c}}^{\odot}\) for ethanol. Compare the experimental value with the literature value of \(-1368\) kJ mol-1 and account for any difference.

\begin{tabular}{l l} Heat change = \(-mc\Delta T\) = \(-250.00\) x 4.18 x (40.0 - 29.6) = \(-10870\) J = \(-10.87\) kJ \\ Mass of ethanol burnt & = \(16.20-15.67\) = 0.530 g \\ Amount of ethanol burnt & = \(\frac{0.53}{2\times 12.0+6\times 1.0+16.0}\) = 0.01152 mol \\ \(\Delta H_{\mathrm{c}}^{\odot}\) = \(\frac{-10.87}{0.01152}\) = **-943 kJ mol-1** \\ \end{tabular}

The value is **less exothermic** than the literature value as the **heat absorbed by the calorimeter is not accounted for / there is heat loss to surroundings / there is incomplete combustion**.

In Example 3D, the enthalpy change of combustion of ethanol determined experimentally is less exothermic than the theoretical value obtained from literature. This is because not all the heat evolved from the reaction has been transferred to the calorimeter and its contents - in this case, heating up the water and the container itself. In other words, the heat transfer is **not 100% efficient**.

To determine the efficiency of a combustion reaction, we can make use of the following equation:

\begin{tabular}{|l|} \hline \multicolumn{1}{|c|}{\(q^{\prime}=\frac{x}{100}\,q\)} \\ \hline \multicolumn{1}{|c|}{where \(q^{\prime}\) is the heat absorbed by the calorimeter (including its contents)} \\ \multicolumn{1}{|c|}{\(q\) is the total heat released from combustion} \\ \multicolumn{1}{|c|}{\(x\) is the efficiency of the combustion reaction} \\ \hline \end{tabular}

## Chapter 4 Theoretical Calculation of Enthalpy Change (Hess' Law)

Learning Outcome:

apply Hess' Law to construct simple energy cycles, e.g. Born-Haber cycle, and carry out calculations involving such cycles and relevant energy terms (including ionisation energy and electron affinity), with particular reference to:

determining enthalpy changes that cannot be found by direct experiment, e.g. an enthalpy change of formation from enthalpy changes of combustion

average bond energies

Some enthalpy changes can be easily calculated based on the necessary measurements obtained by conducting a calorimetry experiment.

However, some enthalpy changes of reaction are theoretical and cannot be determined directly by experiment. For example, C\({}_{2}\)H\({}_{5}\)OH cannot be formed by just reacting C, H\({}_{2}\) and O\({}_{2}\) together. For such reactions, we can find the enthalpy change indirectly by making use of Hess' Law to calculate the enthalpy changes of these reactions from other data such as enthalpy changes of combustion.

Hess' Law states that the enthalpy change (\(\Delta H\)) of a reaction is determined only by the **initial and final states** and is **independent of the reaction pathway taken**.

In the figure below, the reactant **A** directly goes to form **D**. This is the direct route. In the indirect route, **A** is converted to **B**, followed by **C**, which then goes on to form **D**. The enthalpy change is the same for both the direct and indirect routes as both routes start with reactant **A** and end with product **D**.

By Hess' Law,

enthalpy change for direct route (pathway 1) = enthalpy change for indirect route (pathway 2)

\(\Delta H_{1}=\Delta H_{2}+\Delta H_{3}+\Delta H_{4}\)

Generally, for a given reaction, if we know the **formation data** of all the reactants and products, we can find the enthalpy change of the reaction using the following formula:

\begin{tabular}{|c|} \hline
**\(\Delta H_{\mathrm{r}}^{\circ}\) = \(\sum m\Delta H_{\mathrm{r}}^{\circ}\) (products) - \(\sum n\Delta H_{\mathrm{r}}^{\circ}\) (reactants)** \\ \hline where \(m\), \(n\) = stoichiometric coefficients of the reactants and products in the given reaction. \\ \hline \end{tabular}

Generally, for reactions involving **covalent molecules**, if we know the **bond energies** of all the covalent bonds in the reactants and products, we can find the enthalpy change of the reaction using the following formula:

When using bond energy data to calculate the enthalpy change of reaction, we need to keep in mind that **bond energies in the _Data Booklet are average values_**, and not the actual amounts of energy required to break/form the specific bonds in the reaction. Hence, using them in calculations can result in **discrepancies** when compared to values obtained by other means e.g. from experiments or calculated from other enthalpy changes using Hess' Law.

* The \(\Delta H\) of this reaction was calculated to be -2514 kJ mol\({}^{-1}\) from enthalpy change of formation data. Suggest a reason for the difference in the values of \(\Delta H\), obtained from **(a)** and the value above. The bond energies given in the _Data Booklet_ are the bond energies of that particular covalent bond in different types of molecules. These values may not apply to the specific molecules in this reaction.

### Chemical Energetics: Thermochemistry & Thermodynamics

### Lattice Energy, LE

Lattice energy of an ionic compound is the **energy released** when **1 mole of solid ionic compound** is formed from its **constituent gaseous ions**.

_E.g._ Na*(g) + Br*(g) \(\rightarrow\) NaBr(s) LE = -742 kJ mol-1 Mg2*(g) + 2C_l_-(g) \(\rightarrow\) MgC_l_**(s) LE = -2375 kJ mol-1 Lattice energy is **always negative** as energy is released in **forming electrostatic forces of attraction** between oppositely charged ions (_i.e._ ionic bonds). The reverse of the above process, the breaking down of the solid crystal lattice to its gaseous ions is lattice dissociation energy and is always positive.

Lattice energy is a measure of the strength of ionic bonding and the stability of the ionic compounds. The **more exothermic** the lattice energy, the **stronger** the ionic bonding and the **more stable** the ionic compound.

#### _5.2.1 Factors affecting lattice energy_

The magnitude of lattice energy depends on:

* the **charges** on the ions
* the **sizes** of ions or inter-ionic distance These two factors can be combined into the following expression.

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|} \hline compound & \(q_{*}\) & \(q_{*}\) & \(r_{*}\)/ nm & \(r_{*}\)/ nm & LE / kJ mol-1 \\ \hline NaC_l_ & +1 & \(-\)1 & 0.095 & 0.181 & \(-\)776 \\ \hline NaBr & +1 & \(-\)1 & 0.095 & 0.196 & \(-\)742 \\ \hline MgC_l_ & +2 & \(-\)1 & 0.065 & 0.181 & \(-\)2375 \\ \hline \end{tabular}

NaC_l_ and NaBr have the **same cation**. The Br- ion has the **same charge** but **larger ionic radius** than _C_l_ ion. Since \(\left|\textbf{LE}\right|\boldsymbol{\alpha}\)\(\left|\begin{array}{c}\textbf{$q_{*}\times q_{*}$}\\ \textbf{$r_{*}+r_{*}$}\end{array}\right|\), LE of NaBr is **less exothermic** than that of NaC_l_.

MgC_l_ and NaC_l_ have the **same anion**. Mg2* has a **higher charge** and **smaller ionic radius** than Na*. Since \(\left|\textbf{LE}\right|\boldsymbol{\alpha}\)\(\left|\begin{array}{c}\textbf{$q_{*}\times q_{*}$}\\ \textbf{$r_{*}+r_{*}$}\end{array}\right|\), LE of MgC_l_ is **more exothermic** than that of NaC_l_.

#### Experimental versus theoretical lattice energies

Lattice energies can be either determined from **experimental data** using the Born-Haber cycle (See Section 6) or calculated based on a **model** which assumes that the compound is **completely ionic**.

There is always a difference between the experimental and theoretical lattice energies, which suggests that no compound is completely ionic. A small difference shows that the compound is predominantly ionic, while a large difference shows that there is **covalent character in the ionic compound** (Refer to Section 6 of Chemical Bonding). This is most apparent when a cation with a high charge density (high polarising power) distorts an anion with a large electron cloud (high polarisability).

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|} \hline compound & theoretical LE / kJ mol\({}^{-1}\) & experimental LE / kJ mol\({}^{-1}\) \\ \hline CsCl & \(-\)657 & \(-\)659 \\ \hline MgCl\({}_{2}\) & \(-\)2326 & \(-\)2375 \\ \hline AgF & \(-\)953 & \(-\)967 \\ \hline AgI & \(-\)808 & \(-\)889 \\ \hline \end{tabular}

There is good agreement between the theoretical and experimental lattice energy for CsCl but the discrepancy is greater for MgCl\({}_{2}\). Mg\({}^{2+}\) has a **higher charge** and **smaller ionic radius** than Cs\({}^{+}\). Mg\({}^{2+}\) thus has **higher charge density** and **greater polarising power** than Cs\({}^{+}\). Hence, Mg\({}^{2+}\) distorts the electron cloud of Cl\({}^{+}\) to a larger extent, resulting in **greater covalent character** in MgCl\({}_{2}\).

There is also close agreement between the theoretical and experimental lattice energy for AgF but not for AgI. This is because I\({}^{-}\) has a **larger ionic radius** than F\({}^{-}\) and is hence **more polarisable**. Thus Ag\({}^{+}\) polarises the electron cloud of I\({}^{-}\) to a larger extent, resulting in **greater covalent character** in AgI.

In both cases of MgCl\({}_{2}\) and AgI, bonds are **strengthened** due to the covalent character in the ionic bond, hence the experimental lattice energy is **more exothermic** than the theoretical lattice energy.

### Ionisation Energy, IE

The **first** ionisation energy is the **energy required** to remove **1 mole of electrons** from **1 mole of gaseous atoms** to form **1 mole of singly charged gaseous cations**.

### First ionisation energy of magnesium:

Mg(g) \(\rightarrow\) Mg\({}^{+}\)(g) + \(e^{-}\) 1\({}^{\pi}\) IE (Mg) = +736 kJ mol\({}^{-1}\)

The **second** ionisation energy is the **energy required** to remove **1 mole of electrons** from **1 mole of singly charged gaseous cations** to form **1 mole of doubly charged gaseous cations**.

### Second ionisation energy of magnesium:

Mg\({}^{+}\)(g) \(\rightarrow\) Mg\({}^{2+}\)(g) + \(e^{-}\) 2\({}^{\pi}\) IE (Mg) = +1450 kJ mol\({}^{-1}\)

IE is **always positive** since energy is required to remove an electron (endothermic process) which is being attracted by the nucleus.

the formation of a simple ionic solid

Lattice energy cannot be determined directly as solid ionic compounds cannot be formed by reacting the constituent gaseous ions together. It can be obtained by calculation using other known enthalpy changes of reactions by the **Born-Haber cycle**. The cycle gives the relationship between the standard enthalpy change of formation of the ionic solid and the various enthalpy changes leading to its formation.

### A Born-Haber cycle

involves the following stages:

### E.g.

Formation of NaCl(s)

By Hess' Law, \(\Delta H_{t}^{\omega}=\Delta H_{t}^{\omega}+\Delta H_{2}^{\omega}+\Delta H_{3}^ {\omega}+\Delta H_{4}^{\omega}+\Delta H_{5}^{\omega}\)

where \(\Delta H_{t}^{\omega}\) = enthalpy change of atomisation of Na

\(\Delta H_{2}^{\omega}\) = enthalpy change of atomisation of \(C\)_l_

\(\Delta H_{3}^{\omega}\) = first ionisation energy of Na

\(\Delta H_{4}^{\omega}\) = first electron affinity of \(C\)_l_

\(\Delta H_{5}^{\omega}\) = lattice energyChemical Energetics: Thermochemistry & Thermodynamics

* **the formation of a simple ionic solid and of its aqueous solution**

### Standard enthalpy change of hydration, \(\Delta H_{\text{hyd}}^{\phi}\)

The standard enthalpy change of hydration, \(\Delta H_{\text{hyd}}^{\phi}\), of an ion is the **energy released** when **1 mole of free gaseous ions in its standard state is dissolved in water** to give a solution of **infinite dilution**, at a specified temperature, usually 298 K.

* **Na*(g) + aq \(\rightarrow\) Na*(aq)** \(\Delta H_{\text{hyd}}^{\phi}\) = -405 kJ mol-1
* **Br**^(g) + aq \(\rightarrow\) Br**^(aq)** \(\Delta H_{\text{hyd}}^{\phi}\) = -337 kJ mol-1

An infinitely dilute solution is one where there is a sufficiently large excess of water that adding any more does not cause any further heat to be absorbed or evolved.

\(\Delta H_{\text{hyd}}^{\phi}\) is always exothermic (regardless of anion or cation) as heat is evolved in forming ion-dipole interactions between the ions and the polar water molecules.

* **The magnitude of \(\Delta H_{\text{hyd}}^{\phi}\) of an ion depends on its charge density:**

* **where _q_: ionic charge and _r_: ionic radius**

The **higher the charge density** of the ion, the **stronger the ion-dipole interaction** and \(\Delta H_{\text{hyd}}^{\phi}\) will be **more exothermic**.

* **Na*(g) + aq \(\rightarrow\) Na*(aq)** \(\Delta H_{\text{hyd}}^{\phi}\) = -405 kJ mol-1
* **Mg**^2*(g) + aq \(\rightarrow\) Mg**^2*(aq)** \(\Delta H_{\text{hyd}}^{\phi}\) = -1920 kJ mol-1

### Standard enthalpy change of solution, \(\Delta H^{\phi}_{\rm sol}\)

The standard enthalpy change of solution, \(\Delta H^{\phi}_{\rm sol}\), of a substance is the **energy change** when **1 mole of substance in its standard state** is **completely dissolved in a solvent** to give a solution of **infinite dilution**, at a specified temperature, usually 298 K.

E.g. **NaC**_l_**(s)**\(\rightarrow\) Na*(aq) + _C_T_(aq) \(\Delta H^{\phi}_{\rm sol}\) = +3.9 kJ mol-1

**MgC**_l_**(s)**\(\rightarrow\) Mg**\({}^{2*}\)**(aq) + 2_C_T_(aq) \(\Delta H^{\phi}_{\rm sol}\) = -160 kJ mol-1

The solute is usually an **ionic compound** while the solvent is usually **water**.

\(\Delta H^{\phi}_{\rm sol}\) can be **either positive or negative**.

If \(\Delta H^{\phi}_{\rm sol}\) is highly positive, the salt is relatively insoluble in water.

_E.g._ AgC_l_ \(\Delta H^{\phi}_{\rm sol}\) = +65.7kJ mol-1

If \(\Delta H^{\phi}_{\rm sol}\) is negative, the salt is likely to be soluble in water

_E.g._ NaBr \(\Delta H^{\phi}_{\rm sol}\)= -0.6 kJ mol-1

However, there are salts with positive \(\Delta H^{\phi}_{\rm sol}\) that are soluble e.g. NaCl_l_, KCl_l_, NH4NO3 due to positive entropy change (Refer to Section 9).

### Relationship between lattice energy, enthalpy change of hydration and enthalpy change of solution

The dissolution of an ionic solid (e.g. NaCl_l_) happens in two stages.

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:36]

The enthalpy change of hydration of iodide ion was found to be -308 kJ mol-1. Comment on the difference between this value and the value found in **(a)**.

\(\left|\Delta H_{\text{hyd}}^{\circ}\right|\propto\left|\frac{q}{r}\right|\)

\(\Gamma\)- has the **same charge** but a **larger ionic radius** than \(C\Gamma\) so the **ion-dipole attractions** between \(\Gamma\)- ion and the water molecules are **weaker**. Hence, enthalpy change of hydration of \(\Gamma\)- is **less exothermic** than that of \(C\Gamma\).

The strengths for Section 7.

* To construct energy cycle that involves enthalpy change of solution, hydration energy and lattice energy to derive the equation: \(\Delta H_{\text{sd}}^{\circ}=-\text{LE}+\Delta H_{\text{hyd}}^{\circ}\left( \text{cation}\right)+\Delta H_{\text{hyd}}^{\circ}\left(\text{anion}\right).\)
* To explain qualitatively the effect of charges and ionic radii on the numerical magnitude of hydration energy \(\left(\left|\Delta H_{\text{hyd}}^{\circ}\right|\propto\left|\frac{q}{r} \right|\right)\).

### Spontaneous processes

From our experience, there are chemical reactions that take place on their own. For example, an iron nail rusts slowly when left to stand. Some physical processes also take place on their own, such as the diffusion of a drop of dye in a beaker of water to form a uniformly coloured solution. Such processes can be described as **spontaneous**. **A spontaneous process is one that takes place naturally in the direction stated**. The change occurs **without a need for continuous input of energy from outside the system**.

It is useful to predict if a reaction will occur spontaneously when reactants are brought together under a certain set of conditions. When we think of spontaneous process, many of the examples we have seen, such as combustion, are exothermic processes. However, there are endothermic reactions which are also spontaneous. For example, crystalline N\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{5}\) is unstable and will explode spontaneously:

\[\text{N}_{2}\text{O}_{5}(\text{s})\to 2\text{NO}_{2}(\text{g})+\gamma_{2} \text{O}_{2}(\text{g})\qquad\qquad\Delta H=+109.5\text{ kJ mol}^{-1}\]

Many soluble salts (e.g. NaCl, KCl, NH\({}_{4}\)NO\({}_{3}\)) dissolve endothermically and spontaneously.

\[\text{KCl}(\text{s})\to\text{KCl}(\text{aq})\qquad\qquad\qquad\Delta H=+25.7 \text{ kJ mol}^{-1}\]

The tendency of systems to move towards lower energy is not sufficient to predict whether a chemical change is spontaneous or not. Hence, **the sign of \(\Delta H\) by itself does not predict if a reaction is spontaneous**.

If we examine the two examples above, they have one major feature in common: the chemical species (atoms, molecules, or ions) have more freedom of motion after the change. The particles have a **wider range of energy of motion** (kinetic energy) which means the **energy has become more dispersed or distributed**.

When solid N\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{5}\) changes to gaseous NO\({}_{2}\) and O\({}_{2}\), the motion of the molecules in the solid state is restricted while the gaseous particles have more freedom of motion. Thus the energy of motion is more distributed after the change. Similarly, dissolving a salt separates the ions in the crystalline solid. The ions in the aqueous state have greater freedom of motion (or are more disordered) and their energy of motion is more distributed.

Hence, a change in the freedom of motion of particles in a system, that is, the distribution of their energy of motion, is one key factor affecting the direction of a spontaneous process. This factor is known as **entropy change**.

### Chemical Energetics: Thermochemistry & Thermodynamics

#### Entropy and entropy changes

**Entropy**, S, is a measure of the **randomness or disorder** in a system, reflected in the number of ways that the **energy** of a system can be distributed (or dispersed) through the motion of its particles. The unit for entropy is \(\mathbf{J}\)**mol-1 K-1**.

Many chemical reactions or physical processes are accompanied by a **change in entropy**, AS.

## Chemical Energetics: Thermochemistry & Thermodynamics

### Change in phase

For the same amount of a substance, entropy of solid < liquid << gas

In a solid, the particles vibrate about their fixed positions. The energy is thus the least dispersed and the solid has the lowest entropy.

In a gas, the particles are the most randomly arranged and are able to move freely and possess a wide range of kinetic energy. There are many ways that the energy of the particles is distributed, thus it has the highest entropy.

When a solid melts or sublimes, or when a liquid vaporises, the particles in the final state **move more freely** and are **more disordered** than in the initial state. This **increases the number of ways that the particles and the energy can be distributed**. Hence, there is an **increase in entropy** (\(\Delta\)S > 0).

### Change in the number of particles (especially for gaseous systems)

When a chemical reaction results in an increase in the number of gas particles, **the number of ways that the particles and the energy can be distributed increases**. Hence, there is an **increase in entropy** (\(\Delta\)S > 0).

For example, many decomposition reactions result in an increase in the number of gas particles, hence an increase in entropy.

\(\rm N_{2}O(g)\to N_{2}(g)+\gamma_{2}O_{2}(g)\)

\(\rm N_{2}NaN_{2}(s)\to 2Na(s)+3N_{2}(g)\)

\(\rm n_{o}\). of **gas** particles increase hence \(\Delta\)S > 0

If there is **no change** in the number of gas particles, entropy may increase or decrease but the magnitude of \(\Delta\)S will be relatively **small**. For example,

\(\rm N_{2}(g)+O_{2}(g)\to 2NO(g)\)\(\Delta\)S = 0

## Chemical Energetics: Thermochemistry & Thermodynamics

### Mixing of particles

#### Mixing of gas particles (assuming ideal gas behaviour)

Consider the mixing of equimolar H\({}_{2}\) gas and N\({}_{2}\) gas at **constant pressure** as shown below. Before mixing, each gas has the same volume and pressure. After the barrier is removed, each gas expands to occupy the whole container and hence the volume of each gas doubles. The partial pressure of each gas is reduced by half but total pressure remains constant.

As the **volume available for each gas** (H\({}_{2}\) and N\({}_{2}\)) **is increased**, there are **more ways to distribute the particles and their energy**. Thus, **entropy increases** (\(\Delta\)S \(>\) 0).

Similarly, when a gas **expands at constant pressure**, the **volume available for distribution of the particles increases**. **Entropy increases** as there are **more ways that the particles and the energy can be distributed**.

When gases are mixed at **constant volume**, the volume available to distribute the particles of each gas is the same. Hence the **entropy does not change** (\(\Delta\)S = 0).

#### Mixing of liquid particles

When liquids with **similar polarities** (e.g. benzene and hexane) are mixed together, **entropy increases**. This is because **total volume increases** and hence there are **more ways to distribute the particles and their energy**.

In thermodynamics, a **spontaneous** process is one that, _once started_, continues on its own _without_ input of energy. A **non-spontaneous** process on the other hand, needs a _continual input_ of energy.

This is somewhat different from the everyday usage of the term, in that a spontaneous process does not necessary _starts_ on its own. For example, the combustion of petrol is a spontaneous process. However, in general, petrol does not catches fire and burn on its own in the presence of oxygen. This has to do with the **kinetics** aspect, _i.e._ the rate of a reaction, which you will learn under the topic of Chemical Kinetics later. A spark is required to ignite the petrol. However, once the petrol is ignited, it will carry on burning without the need for further input of energy.

We have seen earlier that both enthalpy and entropy changes have a part to play in determining whether a reaction will be spontaneous. To this end, the **Gibbs free energy**, \(G\), is a useful concept that includes both enthalpy, \(H\), and entropy, \(S\), defined as \(G=H-TS\).

A spontaneous process is one which results in a decrease, while a non-spontaneous process results in an increase, in the Gibbs free energy, \(G\). In other words, the **Gibbs free energy change**, \(\Delta G\), is negative, for a spontaneous process, and _vice versa_. Therefore, one can use \(\Delta G\) to determine the **spontaneity** of a process.

\begin{tabular}{|p{142.3pt}|p{142.3pt}|p{142.3pt}|} \hline \(\Delta G\) = \(\Delta H-T\)S \\ \hline \hline The reaction is **thermodynamically feasible** and said to be **spontaneous** or **exergonic**. & The system is at **equilibrium**. There is no net reaction in the forward or backward direction. **the reaction is **thermodynamically not feasible** and said to be **non-spontaneous** or **endergonic**. \\ \hline \end{tabular}

As a spontaneous process proceeds, the Gibbs free energy, \(G\), decreases while the Gibbs free energy change, \(\Delta G\), becomes less negative, until equilibrium is established (_i.e._\(\Delta G\) becomes 0).

\begin{tabular}{|p{142.3pt}|p{142.3pt}|p{142.3pt}|} \hline \(\Delta G\) = \(\Delta G-T\Delta S^{\oplus}\) \\ \hline \hline The reaction is **thermodynamically feasible** and said to be **spontaneous** or **exergonic**. & The reaction is **thermodynamically not** forward or backward direction. **the reaction is **thermodynamically not feasible** and said to be **non-spontaneous** or **endergonic**. \\ \hline \end{tabular}

Chemical Energetics: Thermochemistry & Thermodynamics

Similar to enthalpy and entropy changes, Gibbs free energy changes are frequently reported for substances under standard state (refer to section 1.3, page 5). The **standard Gibbs free energy change of reaction**, \(\Delta G^{\phi}\), is the change in Gibbs free energy involved in a reaction, with all reactants and products in their **standard states**, at a specified temperature, usually at 298 K.

\(\Delta G^{\phi}\) can be used to predict the spontaneity of a reaction under **standard condition** (refer to section 9.1 below for a discussion on the limitations of the use of \(\Delta G^{\phi}_{i}\) to predict the spontaneity of a reaction).

More importantly, the **standard** Gibbs free energy change of reaction, \(\Delta G^{\phi}_{i}\), provides information on the **position of equilibrium** for the reaction, which you will learn under _Chemical Equilibria_ later.

\(\Delta G^{\phi}_{i}\) <0

The position of equilibrium lies to the side of the product, giving an equilibrium constant, \(K\)\(>\) 1.

The position of equilibrium lies does not favour either side, giving an equilibrium constant, \(K\)\(>\) 1.

The position of equilibrium lies to the side of the reactant, giving an equilibrium constant, \(K\)\(<\) 1.

### Limitations in the use of \(\Delta G^{\phi}\) to predict spontaneity of a reaction

#### 9.1.1 Standard states

Prediction on spontaneity using \(\Delta G^{\phi}\) is only valid assuming the reactants and products are in standard states. Although the _standard_ Gibbs free energy change, \(\Delta G^{\phi}\), of a reaction may be positive, the Gibbs free energy change, \(\Delta G\), for the same reaction may become negative under non-standard conditions, and vice versa.

For example, consider the boiling of water : H\({}_{2}\)O(\(\beta\)) \(\rightarrow\) H\({}_{2}\)O(g)

\(\Delta H^{\phi}\) = +44.0 kJ mol\({}^{-1}\) and \(\Delta S^{\phi}\) = +118 J K\({}^{-1}\) mol\({}^{-1}\)

At 298 K, \(\Delta G^{\phi}\) = \(\Delta H^{\phi}\) - \(T\Delta S^{\phi}\) = +44.0 \(\times\)10\({}^{3}\) - 298 (+118) = +8.84 kJ mol\({}^{-1}\)

Hence water does not boil spontaneously under a pressure of 1 bar at 298 K. However, water can be made to boil at 298 K if the pressure is reduced sufficiently, such that \(\Delta G\) becomes negative.

#### 9.1.2 Temperature

From \(\Delta G^{\phi}\) = \(\Delta H^{\phi}\) - \(T\Delta S^{\phi}\), it can seen that the value of \(\Delta G^{\phi}\) changes with temperature, \(T\). Using the same example of boiling water above, suppose we wish to boil water under standard condition,

\(\Delta G^{\phi}\) = \(\Delta H^{\phi}\) - \(T\Delta S^{\phi}\) < 0

\(T\) > \(\Delta H^{\phi}\) = +44.0 \(\times\)10\({}^{3}\) +118 = 373 K

Hence water can be made to boil under standard condition by heating it above 373 K (100 \({}^{\circ}\)C).

Refer to section 9.4 on page 48 for more discussion on the effect of temperature on \(\Delta G^{\phi}\).

\(\Delta G^{\phi}\) = \(\Delta H^{\phi}\) - \(T\Delta S^{\phi}\) < 0

\(\Delta G^{\phi}\) = \(\Delta H^{\phi}\) - \(T\Delta S^{\phi}\) = +44.0 \(\times\)10\({}^{3}\) + 118 = 373 K

Hence water can be made to boil under standard condition by heating it above 373 K (100 \({}^{\circ}\)C).

Refer to section 9.4 on page 48 for more discussion on the effect of temperature on \(\Delta G^{\phi}\).

#### Kinetics considerations

The term **spontaneous** does **not** mean **instantaneous**. It is important to keep in mind that just because a reaction is spontaneous does not mean that it will occur at an observable rate.

While the Gibbs free energy change can be used to determine the spontaneity of a reaction, it does not take into account the **kinetics** of the reaction, that is, the **rate** at which the reaction takes place. The reacting species may have to overcome a large energy barrier (activation energy, \(E_{\mathrm{s}}\)) before reaction can occur.

Some reactions are spontaneous (**thermodynamically favourable**, \(\Delta G\) is negative) but happen very slowly (**kinetically unfavourable**). Examples of such reactions include rusting, and the conversion of diamond into graphite as shown below.

C(diamond) \(\rightarrow\) C(graphite)

Diamond is thermodynamically less stable (\(\Delta G<0\)) with respect to graphite. Hence, diamond can change to graphite without any need for extra energy to be supplied. However, due to the high activation energy for the reaction, diamond does not turn into graphite overnight. We say that diamond is kinetically stable.

### Calculations involving standard Gibbs free energy change of reaction

[FIGURE:ChCh1.F1][ENChemical Energetics: Thermochemistry & Thermodynamics

Example 35

Calculate the standard free energy change for the decomposition of **one mole** of sodium hydrogen carbonate.

**chemical reaction**\(\Delta H^{\circ}/\)**kJ mol\({}^{-1}\)**\(\Delta S^{\circ}/\)**J mol\({}^{-1}\) K\({}^{-1}\)**

2NaHCO\({}_{3}\)(s) \(\rightarrow\) Na\({}_{2}\)CO\({}_{3}\)(s) + H\({}_{2}\)O(g) + CO\({}_{2}\)(g) +130 +335

\(\Delta G^{\circ}\) = \(\Delta H^{\circ}-T\Delta S^{\circ}\)

=

For 1 mole of NaHCO\({}_{3}\), \(\Delta G^{\circ}\) =

Since \(\Delta G^{\circ}\) = 0, the decomposition of sodium hydrogencarbonate is **non-spontaneous** at 298 K (25 \({}^{\circ}\)C). Based on our observation, we know that the decomposition will take place at **higher temperature**. At **higher temperatures** (in this case, \(T\) > 388 K such that \(\Delta H^{\circ}<T\Delta S^{\circ}\) ), the magnitude of \(T\Delta S^{\circ}\)**increases**, making \(\Delta G^{\circ}\)**negative** and the reaction **spontaneous**.

Example 56 - Calculation of **k** for these change.

Given the standard enthalpy change of fusion of ice (conversion of solid ice to liquid water) is +6.0 kJ mol\({}^{-1}\), calculate the standard entropy change which accompanies the melting of ice.

\[\text{H}_{2}\text{O}(\text{s})\rightleftharpoons H_{2}\text{O}(\text{$\hbar$})\]

Since the freezing of water happens at equilibrium, \(\Delta G^{\circ}=0\)

\[\Delta H^{\circ}-T\Delta S^{\circ}=0\Rightarrow\ \ \ \ \ \Delta S^{\circ}_{\text{ns}}= \frac{\Delta H^{\circ}_{\text{ns}}}{T_{\text{ns}}}\]

\[\Delta S^{\circ}_{\text{ns}}=\frac{+6.0\times 10^{3}}{273}=\frac{+22.0\ J\ mol^{-1}\ K^{-1}}{2 73}\]

\(\Delta S^{\circ}_{\text{ns}}\) is **positive**, which is expected when a solid melts to form a liquid since the particles is more disordered in the liquid state.

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:47]

### Temperature dependence of \(\Delta G^{\phi}\)

The term " -\(T\Delta S^{\phi}\) " in the equation \(\Delta G^{\phi}=\Delta H^{\phi}-T\Delta S^{\phi}\) indicates that \(\Delta G^{\phi}\) is temperature-dependent. However, we can assume that \(\Delta H^{\phi}\) **and \(\Delta S^{\phi}\) remain roughly constant** regardless of temperature and use them to calculate \(\Delta G^{\phi}\) at other temperatures.

This assumption is valid as shown in the following example involving reaction between hydrogen gas and chlorine gas at 298 K and 500 K.

\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|c|c|c|} \hline  & \(T\)/ K & \(\Delta H^{\phi}\)/ kJ mol-1 & \(\Delta S^{\phi}\)/ J mol-1 & \(T\Delta S^{\phi}\)/ kJ mol-1 & \(\Delta G^{\phi}\)/ kJ mol-1 \\ \hline H\({}_{2}\)(g) + C\({}_{b}\)(g) \(\rightarrow\) 2HC\({}_{l}\)(g) & 298 & \(-\)184.6 & +20.0 & +6.0 & \(-\)190.6 \\ \hline H\({}_{2}\)(g) + C\({}_{b}\)(g) \(\rightarrow\) 2HC\({}_{l}\)(g) & 500 & \(-\)185.6 & +17.5 & +8.8 & \(-\)194.4 \\ \hline \end{tabular}

If we were to assume that \(\Delta H^{\phi}\)  and \(\Delta S^{\phi}\)  do not change with temperature, we can use the values of \(\Delta H^{\phi}\)  and \(\Delta S^{\phi}\)  at 298 K to calculate a value for \(\Delta G^{\phi}\)  at 500 K as shown:

\[\Delta G^{\phi}_{500\;\mathrm{K}} \approx \Delta H^{\phi}_{298\;\mathrm{K}}-500\times\Delta S^{\phi}_{298\; \mathrm{K}}\] \[= -184.6-500\times\frac{20.0}{1000}=-194.6\;\mathrm{kJ mol^{-1}}\]

This approximate value of \(\Delta G^{\phi}\) (\(-\)194.6 kJ mol-1) is close to the actual value (\(-\)194.4 kJ mol-1) obtained by using values of \(\Delta H^{\phi}\)  and \(\Delta S^{\phi}\)  at 500 K.

The assumption that \(\Delta H^{\phi}\)  and \(\Delta S^{\phi}\)  remain roughly constant is **not valid** if there is a **change in phase** of one of the reactants or products as the temperature is increased. Under these conditions, both \(\Delta H^{\phi}\)  and \(\Delta S^{\phi}\) change significantly. For example, consider the synthesis of hydrogen iodide at 298 K and 500 K.

\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|c|c|c|} \hline  & \(T\)/ K & \(\Delta H^{\phi}\)/ kJ mol-1 & \(\Delta S^{\phi}\)/ J mol-1 & \(T\Delta S^{\phi}\)/ kJ mol-1 & \(\Delta G^{\phi}\)/ kJ mol-1 \\ \hline H\({}_{2}\)(g) + I\({}_{2}\)(g) \(\rightarrow\) 2HI(g) & 298 & +53.0 & +166 & +49.5 & +3.5 \\ \hline H\({}_{2}\)(g) + I\({}_{2}\)(g) \(\rightarrow\) 2HI(g) & 500 & \(-\)11.0 & +18 & +9.0 & \(-\)**20.0** \\ \hline \end{tabular}

As a result of the phase change in I\({}_{2}\) (from solid to gaseous), \(\Delta G^{\phi}\)  changes from being slightly positive at 298 K to being very negative at 500 K. This means that the synthesis of HI is not spontaneous at room temperature but it becomes spontaneous if the temperature is raised above the boiling point of I\({}_{2}\).

### Effect of Temperature on spontaneity of a reaction

For a reaction to be **spontaneous**, \(\Delta G\) should be **negative**. We can use the equation \(\Delta G\) = \(\Delta H\) - T\(\Delta S\) to predict the sign of \(\Delta G\) (or \(\Delta G^{\circ}\), if under standard conditions) when temperature is varied (assuming \(\Delta H\)and \(\Delta S\) do not change with temperature)

There are four possibilities:

### \(\Delta H\) negative and \(\Delta S\) positive

These reactions are **spontaneous** (_i.e._ thermodynamically feasible) at **all temperatures** since \(\Delta G\) < 0 for all temperatures. A continuous input of energy from outside the system is not needed for such reactions.

[-9.50 J mol-1] 

### \(\Delta S\) positive

These reactions are **spontaneous** (_i.e._ thermodynamically feasible) at **all temperatures** since \(\Delta G\) < 0 for all temperatures. A continuous input of energy from outside the system is not needed for such reactions.

## Chemical Energetics: Thermochemistry & Thermodynamics

### (2) \(\Delta H\) positive and \(\Delta S\) negative

Reactions of this type are **non-spontaneous** (_i.e._ thermodynamically not feasible) and have to be driven as \(\Delta G>0\) for **all temperatures**. For example, energy (from the sun) must be continuously supplied for photosynthesis to take place.

Likewise, we observe that the decomposition of metal carbonate is non-spontaneous at room temperature but occurs at high temperatures. The decomposition of MgCO\({}_{3}\) is spontaneous above 576 K while the decomposition of BaCO\({}_{3}\) is spontaneous above 1566 K (Try to work out these temperatures using the data above). The difference in temperature at which decomposition occurs is due to MgCO\({}_{3}\) having less positive \(\Delta H^{\phi}\) than BaCO\({}_{3}\) while \(\Delta S^{\phi}\) is almost similar for both carbonates. Since decomposition becomes spontaneous when \(\Delta G^{\phi}<0\) (_i.e._\(T>\frac{\Delta H}{\Delta S}\)), MgCO\({}_{3}\) has a lower decomposition temperature than BaCO\({}_{3}\).

By considering the bonding in the two compounds and the size of the cation, can you suggest a reason why \(\Delta H\) of MgCO\({}_{3}\) is less positive than that of BaCO\({}_{3}\)? _Hint: During decomposition, the covalent bond in the anion is weakened._

9A & Since the boiling of water happens at equilibrium, \(\Delta\)G\({}^{\circ}\) = 0 \\  & \(\Delta H^{\circ}-T\Delta S^{\circ}=0\) \(\Rightarrow\) & \(\Delta S^{\circ}{}_{\mathrm{vap}}=\frac{\Delta H^{\circ}{}_{\mathrm{vap}}}{T^{ \circ}{}_{\mathrm{vap}}}\) \\  & & \\  & \(\Delta S^{\circ}{}_{\mathrm{vap}}=\frac{+44.0\times 10^{3}}{373}=\pm 118\) kJ mol\({}^{-1}\) K\({}^{-1}\) \\  & \(\Delta S^{\circ}{}_{\mathrm{vap}}\) = which more **positive** than \(\Delta S^{\circ}{}_{\mathrm{fusion}}\) as the particles in the gaseous state is in a much more disordered state than in the liquid state. Hence there is a larger increase in the number of ways to distribute the particles and their energy when liquid water converts to steam. \\ \hline
