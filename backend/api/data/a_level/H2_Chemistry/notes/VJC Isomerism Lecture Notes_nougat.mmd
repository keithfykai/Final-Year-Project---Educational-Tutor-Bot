Isomerism

Isomerism is the occurrence of two or more compounds with the same molecular formula but having different structures or spatial orientation. There are two main types of isomerism.

Firstly, constitutional (structural) isomerism, which is further divided into chain isomerism, positional isomerism and functional group isomerism. Secondly, stereoisomerism, which is further divided into _cis-trans_ isomerism and enantiomerism.

## 1 Constitutional (Structural) isomerism

Candidates should be able to:

(a) describe constitutional (structural) isomerism

It refers to isomers containing the same number of each kind of atom but differing in regard to how the atoms are linked to one another, i.e. they have the **same molecular formula** but **different structural formula**. There are three types: chain, positional and functional group isomerism.

* **Chain isomerism** The isomers differ in the way **carbon** atoms are linked together. They possess the same functional group or homologous series.

E.g. CsH\({}_{12}\)

CH\({}_{3}\)-CH\({}_{2}\)-CH\({}_{2}\)-CH\({}_{3}\)CH\({}_{3}\)-CH\({}_{2}\)-CH\({}_{3}\)CH\({}_{3}\)-CH\({}_{2}\)-CH\({}_{3}\)CH\({}_{3}\)-CH\({}_{3}\)

H

**Positional isomerism** The isomers have the **same functional group** but differ in its position along the **same carbon chain length**.

E.g. CsH\({}_{3}\)O

CH\({}_{3}\)-CH\({}_{2}\)-CH\({}_{2}\)-OH

CH\({}_{3}\)-CH\({}_{3}\)-CH\({}_{3}\)CH\({}_{3}\)

E.g. C\({}_{H}\)_C\(I\)_ (contains benzene ring)

**Exercise** Draw all possible positional isomers for a six-carbon chain alkene with molecular formula C\({}_{6}\)H\({}_{12}\).

* **Functional group isomerism** The isomers have different functional groups.

E.g. C\({}_{2}\)H\({}_{6}\)O

CH\({}_{3}\)-CH\({}_{2}\)-OH

alcohol

ether* **Determination of constitutional isomers from given molecular formula** [(ii)]

Candidates should be able to:

(i) deduce the possible isomers for an organic molecule of known molecular formula

**Step 1: arrangement of carbon atoms**

Consider the longest possible carbon chain followed by subsequent removal of one C atom from the chain and re-attach it to any C atom **except an end carbon** (as this will restore the original chain length).

**Step 2: possible functional groups**

For example, the presence of **one oxygen atom** indicates that alcohol, ether, aldehyde or ketone could be present. If the compound is **saturated with C\({}_{n}\)H\({}_{2n+2}\) ratio**, alcohol or ether could be present. For each arrangement of carbon atoms in step 1, attach the functional group to all possible positions that give rise to a **different** structure.

Note:

(i) The greater the number of atoms in a molecule, the greater the number of isomers.

(ii) Isomers with the **same functional groups** (i.e. they belong to the same homologous series) have **similar chemical properties but different physical properties**.

(iii) Isomers with **different functional groups** (i.e. they belong to different homologous series) have **different physical and chemical properties**.

E.g. C\({}_{4}\)H\({}_{10}\)O (alcohol or ether)

Alcohols:

Ethers:

CH\({}_{3}\)-O-CH\({}_{2}\)-CH\({}_{3}\)CH\({}_{3}\)-O-CH\({}_{4}\)CH\({}_{3}\)CH\({}_{3}\)-CH\({}_{2}\)-O-CH\({}_{2}\)-CH\({}_{3}\)

**Exercise**

Draw the skeletal formulae of all the possible constitutional isomers with one functional group with the molecular formula C\({}_{4}\)H\({}_{8}\)O\({}_{2}\).

**Exercise**

Determine all the possible constitutional isomers for a compound with molecular formula C\({}_{3}\)H\({}_{8}\)Br.

## 2 Stereoisomerism

It refers to isomers having the **same molecular and constitutional (structural) formulae** but **differs** in the way the atoms are **arranged in 3-dimensional space**.

There are two types of stereoisomerism: _cis-trans_ isomerism and enantiomerism.

### _Cis-trans_ isomersim

Candidates should be able to:

(b) describe _cis-trans_ isomerism in alkenes, and explain its origin in terms of restricted rotation due to the presence of \(\pi\) bonds [use of \(E\), \(Z\) nomenclature is **not** required]

* _Cis-trans_ isomerism occurs in compounds in which **free rotation is prevented by the presence of double bonds, a ring structure or steric factors**.

A single bond can be easily rotated but not a double bond as rotation reduces the extent of lateral overlap of p orbitals. If a multiple bond is rotated through 90\({}^{\circ}\), p orbital overlap will be reduced to zero which implies the non-existence of the pi bond.

In alkenes, _cis-trans_ isomerism arises from the **restricted rotation about the C=C bond due to the presence of \(\pi\) bond**. Each carbon atom of the C=C bond is bonded to **two different atoms / groups**.

_cis_ isomer: same atoms / groups are on the same side of the C=C bond _trans_ isomer: same atoms / groups are on opposite sides of the C=C bond

E.g.

For above molecules with four different atoms / groups, the isomers are designated using the \(E\), \(Z\) nomenclature (**not in H2 syllibus**) instead of _cis_ and _trans_.

* _Cis-trans_ isomerism **cannot*
* exist if either carbon of the C=C bond is bonded to **two identical groups**.
* Cyclic alkenes with 3 to 7 carbon atoms are fixed in the _cis_ structure. A _trans_ structure for a double bond can exist in cyclic compounds only when a large ring is present, otherwise the ring strain in the compound is very high. Hence, **C=C bond in a ring*
* does **not*
* show _cis-trans_ isomerism due to **ring strain*
* in the _trans_ isomer.
* For a given structure which exhibits only _cis-trans_ isomerism, no. of _cis-trans_ isomers = **2\({}^{\text{n}}\)**, where n = no. of C=C bond with _cis-trans_ isomerism
* **Cyclic compounds*
* can also exhibit _cis-trans_ isomerism due to restricted rotation about the **single bonds*
* in cyclic systems. The substituents of the _cis_ isomer are on the **same side*
* of the ring while the substituents of the _trans_ isomer are on **opposite sides*
* of the ring.
* **Restricted rotation*
* about C=C bond **prevents spontaneous inter-conversion*
* of _cis_ isomer into _trans_ isomer, i.e. they can be isolated as two different compounds.
* _Cis-trans_ isomers contain the same functional groups and hence show **similar chemical properties**. However, chemical properties are **not identical*
* as the structures are neither identical nor mirror images. They react with the same reagents but perhaps at different rates.
* _Cis-trans_ isomers have **different physical properties**. Generally, the _cis isomer_ has a **higher boiling point*
* than the _trans_ isomer as it has higher dipole moment but it has a **lower melting point*
* as _cis_ isomers pack less closely together.
* **Making Thinking Visible*
* Why is a single bond easily rotated?
* A single bond is a sigma bond in which two orbitals overlap head-on. The rotation about the bond does not reduce the extent of orbital overlap. *
* Does'restricted rotation' mean the C=C bond cannot be rotated at all? No. The C=C bond needs more energy to be rotated than a single bond. This does not mean it cannot be rotated at all. The rotation of the C=C bond will cause the pi bond to break only.

**Exercise**

Indicate whether _cis-trans_ isomerism occurs in the following. If yes, draw the stereoisomers.

### Chirality and Enantiomerism

* A molecule that does not have an internal plane of symmetry cannot be superimposed on its mirror image. Such a molecule is said to be a **chiral molecule**. The chiral molecule and its non-superimposable mirror image form a pair of **enantiomers**.

Candidates should be able to:

(c) explain what is meant by a chiral centre

(d) deduce whether a given molecule is chiral based on the presence or absence of chiral centres and/or a plane of symmetry

* A carbon atom with **four different atoms or groups of atoms** attached to it is known as **a chiral carbon atom** or **chiral centre**. Molecules with chiral carbon atoms are usually (but not always) chiral.

E.g. HO2CCH(CH3)NH2 has a chiral centre (marked with *) and hence exists as two non-superimposable mirror images called enantiomers.

E.g. CH3CH2 has **no** chiral centre. Mirror images are superimposable and hence enantiomerism does **not** exist.

* For a given structure which exhibits only enantiomerism, no. of enantiomers = **2**\({}^{n}\), where n = no. of chiral centres
* A molecule with **only one** chiral carbon atom will not have an internal plane of symmetry and it has a non-superimposable mirror image of itself. Hence, it is chiral. However, the presence of chiral centres is not a sufficient condition for a molecule to be chiral.

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:7]

**Exercise**

Draw the two enantiomers of CH\({}_{3}\)CH\({}_{2}\)CH(OH)CH\({}_{3}\).

**Making Thinking Visible**

Question: Can a molecule without any chiral carbon atom still be chiral?

Answer: Yes. At A-Level, we are **only** concern with a chiral carbon atom which is bonded to four different atoms / groups of atoms. **Note:** A molecule may contain chiral carbon atoms but overall the molecule may not be chiral.

## 3 Molecules Exhibiting Multiple Isomerism

In general, total number of stereoisomers = 2\({}^{\text{n}}\), where n = no. of chiral centres + no. of C=C bond or C-C bond (part of a ring structure) with _cis-trans_ isomerism.

Candidates should be able to:

 identify chiral centres and/or _cis-trans_ isomerism in a molecule of given structural formula

E.g. How many stereoisomers does the following molecule have?

E.g. What is the total number of possible stereoisomers for this molecule below?

Draw the mirror images of the structures of the stereoisomers of the above compound, consisting of a chiral centre and a C=C bond exhibiting both enantiomerism and _cis-trans_ isomerism.

E.g. Draw all the possible stereoisomers of the molecule shown and state the isomeric relationship between these stereoisomers.

* Both structural isomerism and stereoisomerism could be present in a molecule. Step 1: Determine all possible **structural** isomers. Step 2: For each structure, determine the number of **stereoisomers**. E.g. How many isomers are possible for the formula CH\({}_{3}\)CH\({}_{2}\)CH=CHCH(OH)**C\({}_{3}\)H\({}_{7}\)**? As there are two ways to arrange -C\({}_{3}\)H\({}_{7}\), there are 2 constitutional (chain) isomers **(I)** and **(II)** as shown below.

## 4 Differences between Properties of Enantiomers

* Difference in physical properties

* Candidates should be able to: (e) recognise that an optically active sample rotates plane-polarised light and contains chiral molecules (f) recognise that enantiomers have identical physical properties except in the direction in which they rotate plane-polarised light [usage of the term diastereomers is **not** required]

* Enantiomers have **identical physical properties** except for the **direction** of rotation of plane of polarised light. Both enantiomers rotate the plane-polarised light by **an equal angle but in opposite directions**.

A ray of normal light has waves which vibrate in many directions (label 2) at right angles to the direction of travel of the ray. Some materials (called the 'polarisers') have the ability to remove from normal light all waves except those vibrating in a single plane. The light is said to be plane-polarised (label 4) after it passes through the polariser. Compounds that are optically active have the ability to rotate plane-polarised light (label 6) in either a clockwise or counter-clockwise direction, and to different extents. The direction and extent of rotation can be measured using an analyser (label 7). The rotation of plane-polarised light is the result of interactions between light and the individual molecules in the sample that the light passes through.

Certain substances have the ability to rotate the plane of polarised light. Such substances are said to be **optically active**. **Chiral molecules are optically active** while non-chiral molecules are not.

Optically active substances that rotate the plane of polarised light to the right, that is clockwise as viewed through the analyser are said to be dextro-rotatory and the rotation is designated (+). If rotation of plane is to the left, that is, anti-clockwise, substance is said to be leavo-rotatory and the rotation is designated (-).

**Optically pure** samples contain either (+) or (-) enantiomer only. Thus, for two optically pure samples, each containing the same concentration of either the (+) or (-) enantiomer, the observed rotation of plane-polarised light for the two samples will be of the **same extent but in opposite directions**.

**Racemic mixture** is a sample containing a 50:50 mixture (i.e. equal amounts) of the (+) and (-) enantiomers. The clockwise rotation caused by one enantiomer is exactly cancelled by the anti-clockwise rotation of the other enantiomer as the pair of equal amounts of enantiomers will rotate the plane of polarised light by the same extent but in opposite directions. Thus, there is no net effect on the passage of plane-polarised light and the sample is **optically inactive**. A racemic mixture has the same chemical properties as the single enantiomers but differs in physical properties that depend on the packing of molecules in the solid, e.g. melting points and solubilities.

**Exercise**

Which of the following sample(s) are optically active? [You can choose more than one answer.]

**A**: A sample containing equal amounts of (+)-lactic acid and (-)-lactic acid

**B**: A sample containing (+)-lactic acid

**C**: A sample containing (-)-lactic acid

**D**: A sample containing 70% of (+)-lactic acid and 30% of (-)-lactic acid

**A**: \(\text{CH}_{3}\text{CH}_{2}\text{CH}_{2}\text{CH}_{3}\) and \(\text{CH}_{3}\text{CH}_{2}\text{CH}_{3}\) and \(\text{CH}_{3}\text{CH}_{2}\text{CH}_{3}\)
