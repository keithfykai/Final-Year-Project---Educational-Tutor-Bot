**Key Concept**

**brain, spinal cord and nerves**

**neuromes**

**reflex action**human nervous system

Human Nervous System consists of

1. **Central Nervous System (CNS)** consists of the brain and the spinal cord
2. **Peripheral nervous system (PNS)** consists of the nerves connecting the central nervous system and the rest of the body

The role of nervous system:

* Help the body to **adjust rapidly to any changes** in the environment
* Enable the various parts of the body to **coordinate with one another quickly**
* Control **involuntary actions**, actions that cannot be consciously controlled, such as heartbeat, peristalsis, vasoconstriction and reflex actions
* Control **voluntary actions**, actions that are consciously controlled, such as picking up the cookie on the table

structure of neurones

**brain and spinal cord*** **Reflex actions** are involuntary responses to a specific stimulus
* **Reflex are** is the pathway which nerve impulses travel during reflex actions

* **Reflex actions** are involuntary responses to a specific stimulus
* **Reflex are** is the pathway which nerve impulses travel during reflex actions

* **Receptors** in the skin detect the stimulus such as pricked by a needle or touching a hot object
* **Nerve impulses** are produced which are **transmitted by the sensory neurone to the spinal cord.**
* **In the spinal cord, the nerve impulses are **transmitted across a synapse to a relay neurone** and then **across another synapse to the motor neurone. *
* **Nerve impulses travel along the motor neurone to the motor endplate, then the effector**
* **The effector muscles contract causing the hand to withdraw**

* **When nerve impulses arrive at the spinal cord from sensory neurone, nerve impulses are also sent to the brain. The brain will interprets the impulses, and the cold sensation or pain will be felt**
