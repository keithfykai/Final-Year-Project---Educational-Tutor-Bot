## 1 Introduction

All chemical bonds are **electrostatic** in nature which involve **attractions** between a positive charge and a negative charge.

**Strong** forces of attraction

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|} \hline \hline Type of chemical bond & Electrostatic attraction between... \\ \hline (i) & metallic bond & metal ions and'sea' of delocalised electrons \\ \hline (ii) & ionic bond & cations and anions \\ \hline (iii) & covalent bond & shared pair of electrons and positively charged nuclei \\ \hline \end{tabular}

The type of chemical bond in a substance is primarily determined by the outer-shell electronic structure of its atoms where atoms **lose, gain or share valence electrons** to achieve the **stable noble gas configuration**.

**Weak** forces of attraction

Some atoms are bonded together as a group by covalent bonds to form discrete molecules. Weak forces of attraction exist _between_ these molecules. These are called _intermolecular forces_ of attraction which include:

1. Instantaneous dipole-induced dipole attraction
2. Permanent dipole-permanent dipole attraction
3. Hydrogen bonding

All these strong and weak electrostatic forces of attraction between particles bind them together to form matter.

Lattice structures

There are two major types of solid: **crystalline** and **non-crystalline solids**. In non-crystalline (or amorphous) solids, the particles are not arranged in any order (i.e. fixed in random positions). In crystalline solids, the particles are arranged in a regular three-dimensional pattern. This regular arrangement of points in space, occupied by the particles such as atoms, ions or molecules, is called a **lattice**.

The different types of structures include:

1. **giant** metallic
2. **giant** ionic
3. **simple** molecular
4. **giant** molecular

The different types of structure and bonding present in substances largely determine the properties of the substances.

## 2 Giant Metallic Lattice

### Metallic Bond

Metallic bonds are **strong electrostatic attractions** that exist between the metal ions and the'sea' of delocalised electrons in a giant metallic structure.

* Metallic bonds are formed when each metal atom (e.g. Mg) contributes its valence electrons to form a'sea' of electrons that are _delocalised_ throughout the lattice of metal ions (Mg\({}^{2*}\)).

### Physical properties of metallic elements

* Generally high melting points Strong electrostatic forces of attraction exist between the metal ions and'sea' of delocalised electrons. Large amount of energy is required to break the strong metallic bonds.
* High electrical conductivity Presence of **delocalised valence electrons** that are small and move fast gives rise to its high electrical conductivity.
* Malleable and ductile These properties are related to the ability of the cations to move over one another without breaking of metallic bonds.

Diagram showing how the structure in metal changes when pressure is applied When stress is applied to the metal, the metal structure can change its shape without fracturing. The layers of metal ions are still held together by the negative sea of electrons without breaking the metallic lattice.

The metal ions between the layers are not pushed apart by the repulsion as they are shielded by the delocalised electron cloud between them.

* [leftmargin=*]
* No. of valence electrons available for (metallic) bonding
* Greater the number of such electrons, the stronger the metallic bonds.
* Ionic radius of the metal cation
* Smaller the ionic radius of the cation, the stronger the metallic bonds.

Note: When you are asked to compare 2 metals with contradicting effects from the two factors above (e.g. one metal has more valence electrons but also larger ionic radius than the other metal), see melting point data given by the question to decide which factor is more predominant.

_Checkpoint 1_

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|} \hline _metal_ & _Na_ & _Mg_ & _Al_ \\ \hline _melting point/_ \({}^{\circ}\)C & 98 & 650 & 660 \\ \hline _no. of delocalised valence electrons_ & 1 & 2 & 3 \\  & (Group 1) & (Group 2) & (Group 13) \\ \hline _cationic charge, q\({}^{+}\)_ & +1 & +2 & +3 \\ \hline _cationic radius, r\({}^{+}\) / nm_ & 0.095 & 0.065 & 0.050 \\ _(data can be found in Data Booklet)_ & & & \\ \hline _metallic bond strength_ & & Na \(<\) Mg \(<\) _Al_ \\ \hline \end{tabular}

_(a) Why is the melting point of K (64 \({}^{\circ}\)C) lower than that of Na (98 \({}^{\circ}\)C)?_

* K\({}^{+}\) has a larger ionic radius than Na\({}^{+}\) due to an additional quantum shell.
* Weaker electrostatic forces of attraction exist between the K\({}^{+}\) ions and its sea of delocalised electrons.
* Less energy required to break weaker metallic bond, resulting in lower melting point.

_(b) Why is the melting point of AI (660 \({}^{\circ}\)C) higher than that of Na (98 \({}^{\circ}\)C)?_

* Each AI atom can delocalise 3 electrons while each Na atom can delocalise 1 electron, to the sea of electron cloud.
* At the same time, Al\({}^{3*}\) ion has smaller ionic radius compared to Na\({}^{+}\).
* Both factors contribute to stronger electrostatic forces of attraction between Al\({}^{3*}\) ions and its sea of delocalised electrons.
* More energy required to break stronger metallic bond, resulting in higher melting point.

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:5]

### Physical properties of ionic compounds

* High melting point and high boiling point Strong electrostatic forces of attraction exist between the oppositely charged ions. Large amount of energy is required to break these ionic bonds.
* Soluble in water and other polar solvents strong ion-dipole interactions are formed between the ions and water/polar solvent molecules.

For full answer in terms of energy changes during the process of dissolving ionic salts: formation of ion-dipole interactions between the ions and water molecules releases sufficient energy to overcome the electrostatic forces of attraction between the oppositely charged ions in the ionic salt and the hydrogen bonds between water molecules.

(Note that the concept of "hydrogen bonds" will be covered later in this topic.)

* Good electrical conductors when in molten state or when dissolved in aqueous solutions due to the presence of mobile ions.
* electrical conductivity increases with increasing concentration of the ions in the solution
* **Non-electrical conductors in solid** state as ions can only vibrate about fixed positions and hence are not mobile to conduct electricity.
* Brittle and fractures under stress

Ionic compound comprises a lattice of alternating positive and negative ions. When stress is applied, the ions will be displaced and this leads to contact between the like charges. The repulsion between the like charges causes the (crystal) lattice to break apart.

head-on overlap of two p atomic orbitals**

What is a \(\pi\) (pi) bond?

* **After** a \(\sigma\) bond is formed between two atoms, it is possible to have the valence p orbitals of these atoms overlap in a side-on manner.
* The side-on overlap of p orbitals will result in two regions of overlap; above and below the plane of the inter-nuclear axis. These two regions of overlap result in a \(\pi\) bond.
* **Only 1** way to form a pi bond: **two p** orbitals overlap

2024/ASRJC/Chemistry2. When two oxygen atoms approach each other, the 2p\({}_{\gamma}\) orbitals of each O atom will overlap head-on and a \(\alpha\) bond is formed. 3. The \(\alpha\) overlap brings the two atoms close enough for the 2p\({}_{z}\) orbitals of each O atom to overlap side-on. This is a fully labelled diagram that shows the orbitals used to form a double bond. This (NOT the molecular orbitals below) should be drawn to show how \(\pi\) bonds are formed.

* **Lewis Acid-Base Theory*
* Gilbert N. Lewis in 1938 expanded the definition of acids and bases to the following.
* An acid-base reaction involves **the transfer of an electron pair from a Lewis base to a Lewis acid, forming a covalent bond**.

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|} \hline
**Lewis acid:** & **electron pair acceptor** & contains an atom with vacant low-lying orbital to \\  & & & accept a lone pair of electrons. \\ \hline
**Lewis base:** & **electron pair donor** & contains an atom with a lone pair of electrons \\  & & that it can donate. \\ \hline \end{tabular}
* The reaction between ammonia (NH3) and boron trifluoride (BF3) on page 13 is an example of **Lewis acid-base reaction**, in which NH3 and BF3 act as a Lewis base and a Lewis acid, respectively.

### Electronegativity and Bond Polarity

Electronegativity
* The electronegativity of an atom is a measure of its ability to attract the shared pair of electrons in a covalent bond to itself.
* The diagram below shows the trends in the electronegativity of elements in the Periodic Table.

General Trend of Electronegativity
* **increases across the period**, e.g. F is more electronegative than N

Recall: Atomic Structure Lecture

Across the period, nuclear charge increases. Since increase in shielding effect is negligible, valence electrons will be more strongly attracted towards the nucleus.

decreases down the group, e.g. Br is less electronegative than C_I_

Down the group, as the no. of electron shells increases, valence electrons will be further away and more shielded form the nucleus. Hence, the valence electrons are less strongly attracted towards the nucleus.

### Bond Polarity

* Br * C
- H * P
- H * S
- H * _the difference in electronegativity is very small, hence the bond is normally taken to be non-polar_

- C I \(\text{O}-\text{H}\) C
- O C

By convention, \(\text{S}+\text{S}\) is used to represent a dipole, with the arrow pointing to the more electronegative atom.
* The **greater the difference in electronegativity** between the bonding atoms, the **more polar the bond** is.

### Strength of a Covalent Bond

Bond energy and bond length are two **indicators** of the strength of a covalent bond.

### Bond Energy

* **Bond energy (BE)** is the amount of energy absorbed/required to break one mole of covalent bond between 2 atoms in the gaseous state. Example: Bond energy for C/C/I is +242 kJ mol-1

C\(l_{2}\) (g) Bond (dissociation) energy = + 242 kJ mol-1

* The stronger the covalent bond, the greater is its bond energy.

* For covalent bonds present in polyatomic molecules, such as CH\({}_{4}\), the _average bond energy_ is used. _Example:_ There are four C-H bonds in CH\({}_{4}\). The average bond energy for each C-H bond is 410 kJ mol-1.
* Covalent molecules with _higher bond energies generally have lower tendency to undergo reaction_.

**Bond Length**

* Covalent **bond length** is defined as the distance between the nuclei of the two atoms in the bond. It is also the sum of the covalent radius of the two atoms.

* A shorter bond length indicates the presence of a stronger covalent bond.

* Note: Both bond length and bond energy is a result of bond strength, we **cannot** use bond length to explain the differences in bond energy.

**Factors affecting covalent bond strength**

**(a) Effectiveness of orbital overlap**

_Example:_ _[Comparing atoms that belong to the same group]_

**Account for the trend of bond energies of chlorine to iodine:** BE(Cl-Cl) = 244 kJ mol-1, BE(Br-Br) = 193 kJ mol-1, BE (I-I)= 151 kJ mol-1

* As atoms from Cl to Br to I become larger, the size of valence orbitals increases.
* These larger orbitals become more diffused and when they overlap, the accumulation of electron density within the inter-nuclei region is lower.
* Orbital overlap is less effective, resulting in weaker bond strength.

**(b) Difference in electronegativity between bonding atoms (Bond Polarity)**

_Example:_ [Comparing bonds of similar number of bonding electrons but different polarity]_

* Since the electronegativity increases in the order N < O < F, bond polarity increases in the order N-H < O-H < F-H.
* In addition to the existing covalent bond, there is _increase_ in the electrostatic attraction between the two partial charges (\(\delta\)+ / \(\delta\)-). Therefore, an increase in bond strength.

**(c) Number of bonding electrons**

As the number of bonding electrons increases within the inter-nuclei region for multiple bonds, the attractive forces for these electrons increase. Thus, the covalent bond strength increases from single to double to triple.

_Example: [Comparing bonds with same atoms but different multiplicity]_

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|} \hline
**bond** & **bond energy / kJ mol\({}^{-1}\)** & **bond length / nm** \\ \hline C \(-\) C & 350 & 0.154 \\ \hline C \(=\) C & 610 & 0.134 \\ \hline C \(\equiv\) C & 840 & 0.120 \\ \hline \end{tabular}

_Why is BE (C=C) less than twice that of BE (C-C)?_

_Recall from page 10_

\(\pi\) bond is weaker than \(\sigma\) bond since side-on overlap of valence orbitals is less effective.

**(d) "Hybridisation state of bonding atom**

_(You will learn more about hybridisation in 'Intro to Organic Chemistry')_

### Dot-and-Cross diagram and Lewis Structure

**Drawing dot-and-cross diagrams of molecules / molecular ions**

Step 1: Identify the central atom - Usually the atom that can form the most number of bonds or the least electronegative (except H atom)

Step 2: For anions, as a rule-of-thumb, add electron(s) corresponding to the charge on the ion to the more electronegative atom(s). Draw a square bracket outside the molecule and place the charge as a superscript outside the bracket.

For cations, as a rule-of-thumb, subtract electron(s) corresponding to the charge on the ion from the less electronegative atom(s). Draw a square bracket outside the molecule and place the charge as a superscript outside the bracket.

For neutral molecules, you can ignore Step 2.

Step 3: Complete valence shell of each atom by deciding on the type of bond (single / double / triple) each surrounding atom needs to form with the central atom to achieve octet configuration.

Step 4: Check that for Period 2 elements should only have a maximum of 8 valence electrons.

Tip: Reduce the number of valence electrons (on the central atom) by shifting a pair of these electrons to one of the surrounding atoms.

Exceptions to the octet rule (see page 21)

\(\Rightarrow\) electron deficient species (BeC\({}_{k}\), BF\({}_{3}\) and AC\({}_{k}\))

\(\Rightarrow\) odd number of (or unpaired) electrons (CO\({}_{2}\), NO, NO\({}_{2}\)\(\rightarrow\) radicals)_Example:_

\begin{tabular}{|p{113.8pt}|p{113.8pt}|p{113.8pt}|p{113.8pt}|} \hline
**particles** & **dot-and-cross diagram** & **Lewis structure** \\ \hline \(\text{F}_{2}\text{O}\) & & & \\ \hline \(\text{NO}_{2^{+}}\) & & & \\ \hline \end{tabular}

**Exceptions to the Octet Rule**

* Many atoms undergoing reactions often gain, lose or share electrons to achieve eight valence electrons (noble gas configuration).
* This rule is simple and useful in understanding the basic concepts of bonding. However, it does not apply in transition metal complexes and some covalent molecules.
* The following are examples of exceptions to the octet rule in covalent molecules.

**(a) Species in which the central atom has expanded octet**

\(\succ\) **Central atoms** in these molecules are from **Period 3 or higher**.

\begin{tabular}{|p{113.8pt}|p{113.8pt}|p{113.8pt}|p{113.8pt}|} \hline
**No. of electrons in valence shell of **central** atom: & 10 & 12 & 12 & 12 \\ \hline \end{tabular}

The central atoms in these molecules have 'expanded' their octet configuration; i.e. have more than 8 valence electrons (including both bonding electrons and lone pairs) around the central atom.
* Elements of Period 2 have only one 2s and three 2p valence orbitals available for bonding. These orbitals together (2s\({}^{2}\)2p\({}^{6}\)) can hold a maximum of eight electrons only. Thus, a Period 2 element cannot expand its octet configuration.
* For non-metal elements from Period 3 and higher, in addition to the outer-shell \(s\) and \(p\) orbitals, there are _vacant_, _low-lying_ d orbitals that can accommodate extra electrons.

_Example_: valence shell of phosphorus, P

3s 3p vacant 3d orbitals
* Size of the atom partly determines whether the atom can accommodate more than eight electrons. The larger the central atom, the larger the number of atoms that can surround it in a molecule.
* The size of the surrounding atoms is also important. Expanded valence shells occur most often when the central atom is bonded to small and highly electronegative atoms, such as F, _Cl_, and O.

_Why NCIs does not exist?_

N atom cannot expand its octet to accommodate all the bonding electrons as it does not have vacant, low-lying d orbitals. (Its next available vacant orbital is 3s, which is energetically unfavourable to utilise for bonding.)

**(b) Species in which the central atom has _less than an octet_**

(Also called _electron-deficient_ molecules)

Often encountered in covalent compounds containing beryllium (Be), boron (B) and aluminium (_AI_) as central atoms.

No. of electrons in valence shell of central atom:

### Species with an _odd number of (or unpaired) electrons_

* In most molecules, the total number of electrons is even, and complete pairing of valence electrons occurs.
* However, in some molecules the total number of electrons is an odd number. Hence complete pairing of the valence electrons is impossible.

Examples of molecules with odd number of electrons

Particles with unpaired or odd number of electrons (e.g. C/O\({}_{2}\), NO, NO\({}_{2}\)) are called radicals. These particles are **very reactive**. They tend to react in such a way that pairing of electrons occur.

Example:2NO\({}_{2}\)\(\rightarrow\)N\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{4}\)

### Checkpoint 4

Which of the following dot-and-cross diagram(s) best represent(s) the following molecules?

* VSEPR stands for Valence Shell Electron Pair Repulsion. This theory allows one to predict the shapes of molecules and their bond angles.
* Covalent bonds are directional. Covalently bonded atoms have a preferred specific orientation in space relative to one another.
* This gives rise to covalent molecules having definite geometrical shapes characterised by their bond angles.

**Key principle 1**

Electron pairs (bond pairs and lone pairs) around the central atom of a molecule arrange themselves as far apart as possible to minimise inter-electronic repulsion.

* All **electron pairs** around the **central atom** are taken into account when determining the molecular shape. _Each double bond or triple bond is also counted as one region of electron density (or one bond pair)_
* The table below shows the basic molecular shapes that occur **when all the electron pairs around the central atom are bond pairs** (no lone pairs). Bond angle refers to the angle between two bond pairs.

* In the experimental determination of shapes of molecules which contain lone pairs, only the relative positions of the nuclei of atoms can be detected. Lone pairs of electrons cannot be'seen' although they are present and exerting repulsion on the bond pairs and on one another.
* Thus, the molecular shape is described by the positions of bond pairs, as fixed by the arrangement of all the electron pairs with minimum repulsion.

**Key principle 2**

A lone pair exerts a stronger repulsion than a bond pair as a lone pair is non-bonding and thus the electron density is closer to the nucleus of the atom.

Hence, the strength of electrostatic repulsion between electron pairs decreases in the order: **lone pair-lone pair > lone pair-bond pair > bond pair-bond pair**

* The difference in the strength of repulsions affects the bond angles in the molecules.

Example:

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|} \hline
**Molecule** & **No. of bond pairs** & **No. of lone pairs** & **Bond angle** \\ \hline CH\({}_{4}\) & 4 & 0 & 109.5\({}^{\circ}\) \\ \hline NH\({}_{3}\) & 3 & 1 & 107\({}^{\circ}\) \\ \hline H\({}_{2}\)O & 2 & 2 & 104.5\({}^{\circ}\) \\ \hline \end{tabular}

* The difference in the strength of repulsions also affects the position of lone pairs in the molecules, and hence the molecular shape.

How to determine the shape of a molecule

You have to first memorise the 5 basic shapes of molecules (linear, trigonal planar, tetrahedral, trigonal bipyramidal, octahedral) because all other shapes are derived from them.

**Effect of electronegativity on bond angle**

**(a) Molecules with same shape and same central atom but different surrounding atoms**

_Example:_

Both NF\({}_{3}\) and NH\({}_{3}\) have the same shape (trigonal pyramidal) but the bond angle of NF\({}_{3}\) (93\({}^{\circ}\)) is smaller than NH\({}_{3}\) (107\({}^{\circ}\)).

**F** is more electronegative than H. Hence,

bonding electrons in N-F bond are closer to the F atoms

less crowding of electron density around the N atom in NF\({}_{3}\)

less inter-electronic repulsion between the electron pairs around the N atom

smaller bond angle than expected

## 5 Intermediate Bond Types

Many covalent and ionic bonds have **intermediate bond character**:

* some covalent bonds have **ionic character**
* some ionic bonds have **covalent character**

* **Pure" ionic bond** & **covalent bond with** **ionic character** \\ \hline increasing \% ionic character increasing electronegativity difference e.g. NaC\(I\) e.g. Al\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{3}\) & **increasing \% covalent character decreasing electronegativity difference e.g. polar e.g. non-polar molecules like HC\(I\) molecules like C\(I_{2}\)**

Experimental data shows that even for some supposedly ionic substances, there is some degree of electron sharing between oppositely charged ions.

For example, we may expect aluminium chloride to be ionic. However, the extent of sharing of electrons is so great that aluminium chloride exhibits characteristics of a covalent compound.

This indicates that the notion'metals and non-metals combine to form ionic compounds' is **not completely true in all instances**.

### 5.1 Ionic bonds with covalent character

When there is a **distortion / polarisation of electron cloud** of the anion by the positively charged cation, electron density is drawn into the region between the 2 nuclei, resulting in partial sharing of electrons. Such an ionic bond exhibits some covalent character.

* The greater the polarisation of electron cloud, the higher the degree of covalency.

### 5.2 Factors affecting the extent of polarisation

* Polarising power of the cation

Polarising power of the cation is dependent on its charge density. Charge density is directly proportional to q\({}^{+}\) / r\({}^{+}\), where q\({}^{+}\) is the charge size and r\({}^{+}\) is the cationic radius.

The higher the charge density, the greater the polarising power in distorting the electron cloud of the anion, the greater the degree of covalency.

_Example:_

_Why is AIG\({}_{3}\) covalent while NaCl is ionic?_

_(IF we consider AIC\({}_{3}\) to be ionic, then...)_

AJ\({}^{3+}\) has a high charge size of +3 as compared to Na\({}^{+}\) with a charge of +1.

AJ\({}^{3+}\) also has a smaller ionic radius compared to Na\({}^{+}\), giving rise to higher charge density and hence higher polarising power.

AJ\({}^{3+}\) distorts the electron cloud of C\(l^{-}\) anion to a great extent. The extent of sharing of electrons between the two nuclei is so great that AIC\(l_{3}\) exhibits covalent character (and it is not an ionic compound).

* Polarisability of the anion

Polarisability of the anion is largely dependent on the size of the anion.

The greater the electron cloud size of anion, the less strongly the valence electrons are attracted to the nucleus, the greater the ease of electron cloud being distorted by the cation, the higher the degree of covalency.

_Example:_

_Why is AIF\({}_{3}\) ionic while AIC\(l_{3}\) is covalent?_

_(IF we consider AIC\(l_{3}\) to be ionic, then...)_

_C\(l^{-}\) has a larger ionic radius than F\({}^{-}\), resulting in a greater extent in the distortion of the electron cloud of C\(l^{-}\) anion by AJ\({}^{3+}\), leading to greater sharing of electrons between the two nuclei. AIC\(l_{3}\) is therefore covalent (and not ionic) while AIF\({}_{3}\) is ionic.

## 6 Physical properties of simple molecular structures

Solids that have simple molecular structures tend to have low melting points because **little energy** is required to overcome the **weak** intermolecular forces of attraction **between** the molecules in order for the crystal lattice to be broken down into discrete **molecules** (or atoms for the noble gases).

### 6.1 **Intermolecular forces of attraction** (Only for simple discrete molecules)

* Simple molecular structures consist of **molecules** held together by **intermolecular forces of attractions** (within molecules, **atoms** are joined by **intramolecular covalent bonds**).
* In a simple molecular structure, the lattice positions are occupied by discrete molecules (or by atoms (monoatomic molecules) in the case of noble gases).
* Three types of intermolecular attraction exist between molecules:
* Instantaneous dipole-induced dipole attraction
* Permanent dipole-permanent dipole attraction
* Hydrogen bonding _Example:_
* The physical properties of a simple molecular substance such as **melting point, boiling point and solubility depend on the type and strength of the intermolecular forces**, not on the strength of the covalent bond.
* These forces involve electrostatic attraction between partial charges (\(\delta+\), \(\delta-\)) to varying degrees. Since the attraction here only involves partial charges, intermolecular forces of attraction are much weaker compared to ionic / covalent / metallic bonds.

**Factor 2: Surface Area of Contact**

_Used when comparing molecules with similar no. of electrons but different extent of branching (You will learn more about branching in 'Intro to Organic Chemistry')_

* Attraction between **elongated** molecules is stronger than attraction between **spherical** molecules.
* Molecules that are elongated provide a surface area of contact (extensiveness of id-id interactions) which allows for stronger id-id attractions between molecules.

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|} \hline
**Compound** & **Structural formula** & \(M\) & **Boiling point/'C** \\ \hline pentane & CH3CH2CH2CH3 & 72.0 & 36 \\ \hline
2,2-dimethyl/propane & CH3\(-\)CH3 & 72.0 & 10 \\ CH3 & & & \\ \hline \end{tabular}

#### 6.1.2 Permanent dipole-permanent dipole (pd-pd) attractions

**(a) What is pd-pd attraction?**

* Permanent dipole-permanent dipole attraction occurs only between polar molecules. This attraction is in **addition** to the id-id forces present in the polar molecule. Examples of polar molecules: H2O, HCI, NH3, CH3CH3OCH3
* Due to the difference in electronegativity between 2 atoms in a polar bond, the bonding electrons will be drawn towards the more electronegative element, resulting in a **permanent uneven distribution of electronic charges** within the bond.
* The partial positive end of one polar molecule will **attract** the partial negative end of a nearby polar molecule. This weak electrostatic attraction between the polar molecules is known as **pd-pd attractions**.

**Compound** & **Formula** & \(M\), & **Polarity of molecule** & **Boiling point/'C** \\ \hline pentanal & CH3CH2CH2CH2CHO & 86.1 & more polar & **103** \\ \hline

**Factor 2: Electronegativity difference** between H and the atom bonded to H in the molecule

Electronegativity difference between the atoms increases in the order: \(\text{N-H}<\text{O-H}<\text{F-H}\)

Thus, the hydrogen bonding between lone pair of F atom in a molecule and H of another molecule is stronger than that between O and H, which is in turn stronger than between N and H.

\(\begin{array}{ccccc}\delta-&\delta+&\delta-&\delta+&\delta-&\delta+\\ -F_{\bullet}^{\text{a}}\cdots H\text{---O}^{\text{a}}\cdots H\text{---N}^{ \text{a}}_{\bullet}\cdots H\text{---}&\text{---N}^{\text{a}}_{\bullet}\cdots H \text{---}\end{array}\)

_Example:_

**The observed boiling points for H\({}_{2}\)O, HF and NH\({}_{3}\) are 100, 20, -33 \({}^{\text{o}}\)C respectively.**

* Based on the _extensiveness of H-bonding_, boiling point is predicted to be in the order: \(\text{H}_{2}\text{O}>\text{HF}=\text{NH}_{3}\)
* Based on the _electronegativity difference with H_, boiling point is predicted to be in the order: \(\text{HF}>\text{H}_{2}\text{O}>\text{NH}_{3}\)
* Extensiveness of hydrogen bonding precedes electronegativity difference with H, therefore boiling point is in the order: \(\text{H}_{2}\text{O}>\text{HF}>\text{NH}_{3}\)

**(c) Effects of hydrogen bonding on physical properties**

**(i) Abnormally high melting points and boiling points**

For molecules with _similar molecular size_ (or _similar number of electrons_), the strength of the intermolecular forces depend on the type of forces: \(\begin{array}{|ccccc|}\hline\text{hydrogen bonds > permanent dipole--permanent > instantaneous dipole--}\\ \text{dipole interactions}&\text{induced dipole interactions}\end{array}\)

Molecules with similar number of electrons held together by hydrogen bonds have higher melting points and boiling points than molecules held by pd-pd or id-id attractions only.

_Example:_

Melting points and boiling points of _HF, H\({}_{2}\)O and NH\({}_{3}\)_ are _higher than expected_ in the corresponding groups as illustrated in the following figures.

**Graph 1: Boiling points of hydrides of Group 16**

\(\begin{array}{ccccc}\text{h}_{2}\text{O}&\text{h}_{2}\text{Te}&\text{h}_{ 2}\text{Se}&\text{h}_{2}\text{Se}&\text{h}_{2}\text{Se}&\text{h}_{2}\text{Se }&\text{h}_{2}\text{Se}\\ \text{h}_{3}\text{S}&\text{h}_{4}\text{S}&\text{h}_{5}\text{h}_{6}\text{S}& \text{h}_{6}\text{S}&\text{h}_{7}\text{Se}&\text{h}_{Explanation for trend in Graph 1
* The number of electrons in the molecule increases from H\({}_{2}\)O to H\({}_{2}\)Te.
* This results in increasing strength of id-id attractions between molecules.
* Based on this trend, boiling point of H\({}_{2}\)O is expected to be lowest; but H\({}_{2}\)O actually has the highest boiling point as shown.
* The anomaly is due to the presence of hydrogen bonding between H\({}_{2}\)O molecules, which is stronger; thus requiring more energy to overcome, than pd-pd and id-id attractions between the other hydrides molecules.

Similar explanation can be used for trends observed in Graphs 2 and 3.

_Why is iodine a solid at room temperature and water is a liquid at room temperature?_

_Iodine is non-polar with intermolecular instantaneous dipole - induced dipole intreactions, and water is polar with intermolecular hydrogen bonding. For molecules with different M, id-id **may be the more significant** type of intermolecular forces of attraction. (refer to page 34)_

(ii) Solubility of some substances

Some molecular substances (e.g. HF, NH\({}_{3}\), ethanol, ethanolic acid) are miscible in water by forming hydrogen bonds with water molecules.

_Example_ Ethanol in water

The formation of hydrogen bonds between ethanol and water molecules releases energy to separate the ethanol molecules and the water molecules, so that ethanol and water molecules can mix.

Each O atom in water forms 2 covalent bonds with H atoms. The two lone pairs on the same O atom are bonded to the hydrogen atoms of 2 neighbouring molecules by hydrogen bonds. Hence, each water molecule is surrounded by 4 neighbouring molecules in a tetrahedral manner.

The open structure i.e. lots of empty space between molecules explains why the density of ice is lower than that of water. When ice melts, some of the hydrogen bonds are weakened and the volume contracts due to closer packing of the molecules.

(iv) Anomalous relative molecular mass. M. Example Ethanoic acid, CH\({}_{3}\)COOH, dissolved in non-aqueous solvents such as benzene, has an apparent \(M\) of 120 instead of the expected value of 60.

This is due to the hydrogen bonds between two CH\({}_{3}\)COOH molecules forming dimers.

_Note: In aqueous form, ethanoic acid will form H-bonds with the water molecules because water is in large excess. Example Hydrogen fluoride forms acid salt (e.g. KHF\({}_{2}\)) containing the anion, HF\({}_{2}\)-._

### (d) Intramolecular hydrogen bonding

Intramolecular hydrogen bonding occurs when the H atom in a molecule is in close proximity to the electronegative atom of the same molecule.

The difference in boiling points of some compounds can be explained by the presence of intramolecular hydrogen bonding.

Example

Observe the structures of 2-nitrophenol and its isomer 4-nitrophenol below. They have the same molecular formula but have different boiling points.

## 7 Giant Molecular Lattice

Many atoms can link up to form a giant covalent structure or lattice. The atoms are usually non-metals. This gives them significantly different properties from the small simple covalent molecules.

E.g. Diamond, graphite, silicon dioxide, silicon, boron nitride

### Diamond

* Each carbon is joined by **strong covalent bonds** to four other carbon atoms, in a tetrahedral arrangement. This results in a tightly, interlocking rigid structure which accounts for the great hardness of diamond and its consequent use as an abrasive.
* Because the carbons are held **extensively** by strong covalent bonds, diamond has a very **high melting point** (about 4000 \({}^{\circ}\)C).
* Diamond **does not conduct electricity** because no mobile ions or delocalised electrons exist in the structure.
* Diamond **does not dissolve in water** because the water molecules cannot break the strong covalent bonds.
* Diamond, silicon and silicon dioxide have similar structures.

_Account for the higher melting point of diamond (3350 \({}^{\circ}\)C) compared to silicon (1410 \({}^{\circ}\)C)._

The orbitals used for overlapping for diamond (2sp\({}^{3}\)) are smaller and less diffused than those used for forming Si-Si covalent bonds (3sp\({}^{3}\)). There is thus more effective overlap of orbitals of carbon and this accounts for the stronger C-C bond, which requires more energy to break.

- to be explained in 'Organic Chemistry')_
* Graphite is a **good electrical conductor along the layers** because the delocalised \(\pi\) electrons can move along the layers under the influence of an electric field.
* Graphite is a **poor conductor at right angles to the layers** because the delocalised electrons cannot move between the layers.
* The C-C bond length between C atoms within the same layer in graphite is shorter than the C-C bond length in diamond. This shows that C-C bonds in graphite are stronger.
* Since large amount of energy is required to break these **strong and extensive covalent bonds**, graphite has a very high melting point** and is insoluble in water.
* The C-C bonds between the layers in graphite are longer than the C-C bond length inside the layer. The forces of attraction holding these layers together are not covalent bonds. This shows that the attractions between the layers are very weak. These attractions are instantaneous dipole-induced dipole forces.
* The presence of **weak id-id attractions between the layers** enables the layers to glide over one another. Hence, the graphite is **soft and slippery** which makes it a good lubricant. _Question: Why are the C-C bonds in graphite stronger than those in diamond? (To be explained in 'Intro to Organic Chemistry'. Refer to the factors affecting bond strength)_ C-C bond in graphite results from overlapping of **sp\({}^{2}\)-sp\({}^{2}\)** hybrid orbitals whereas C-C bond in diamond results from overlapping of **sp\({}^{3}\)-sp\({}^{3}\)** hybrid orbitals. Overlapping of sp\({}^{2}\) hybrid orbitals is more effective since there is a greater s character (33%) and the bonding electrons are closer to the nuclei of two sp\({}^{2}\) carbon.

### Coordination number in an ionic compound

* Oppositely charged ions attract each other but ions of the same charge repel each other, therefore we do not find two cations, or two anions adjacent to each other.
* The number of nearest ions that surround another of the opposite charge in an ionic lattice is called the coordination number of that central ion.
* The coordination number of the ion depends on two factors:
* relative size of oppositely charged ions characterised by the ratio of 

* If an ion is very small, there will not be room for many oppositely charged ions around it. In this case, the maximum coordination number is usually four.
* If the cations and anions are nearly equal in size, each ion can be surrounded by eight others.
* The intermediate case of six surrounding ions occurs when one ion is bigger than the other, but not by very much. (In such a case, you have to use information given in the question to infer.)
* relative charges of oppositely charged ions To gain electrical neutrality, a cation of charge of 2+ needs twice as many anions of charge 1- as does a cation of charge 1+. We therefore find that Ca\({}^{2+}\) ion in calcium chloride is surrounded by twice as many Cl\({}^{\prime}\) ions as the Li\({}^{+}\) ion in lithium chloride.

These 2 factors are illustrated in the table below.

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|} \hline Compound & \begin{tabular}{c} cation radius / \\ nm \\ \end{tabular} & \begin{tabular}{c} anion radius / \\ nm \\ \end{tabular} & \begin{tabular}{c} anion radius \\ cation radius \\ \end{tabular} & \begin{tabular}{c} coordination \\ number of \\ the cation \\ \end{tabular} & 
\begin{tabular}{c} coordination \\ number of \\ the anion \\ \end{tabular} \\ \hline NaCl\(I\) & 0.10 & 0.18 & 1.8 & 6 & 6 \\ \hline MgO & 0.07 & 0.14 & 2.0 & 6 & 6 \\ \hline CsCl & 0.17 & 0.18 & 1.1 & 8 & 8 \\ \hline CaF\({}_{2}\) & 0.10 & 0.13 & 1.3 & 8 & 4 \\ \hline ZnS & 0.08 & 0.19 & 2.4 & 4 & 4 \\ \hline \end{tabular}

_Example: Model of the lattice of NaCl_

In a unit cell of NaCl, each Na+ is surrounded by 6 \(C\)_I-_ ions and each C_I-_ surrounded by 6 Na+ ions. The coordination number of both Na+ and C_I-_ is 6.

_Ionic bonds are_ **non-directional**_. Each Na+ ion is equally attracted to the neighbouring C_I-_ ions without preference for any C_I-_ ion in particular._

_Example: Model of the lattice of CsCl_

In a unit cell of CsCl where there is more room for C_I-_ to surround the larger Cs+ ion, each Cs+ ion is surrounded by 8 \(C\)_I-_ ions and each C_I-_ is surrounded by 8 Cs+ ions. The coordination number of both Cs+ and C_I-_ is 8.

### Other methods to determine the shape of a molecule

Method 2 [Oxygen-containing compound]

\begin{tabular}{c} 
\begin{tabular}{c} Type of bonds O \\ commonly forms \\ \end{tabular} & =O & \(\neg\)O- & \(\neg\)O & \(\neg\)O \\ \hline Examples & CO\({}_{2}\), SO\({}_{2}\) & CO\({}_{3}\)2-, SO\({}_{4}\)2- & NO\({}_{2}\) & H\({}_{2}\)O, H\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{2}\) \\ \end{tabular} \\ \end{tabular}

* Always try with the =O bond first. Only when the central atom (e.g. from Period 2) cannot allow for the formation of =O, then you'll replace it with \(\neg\)O.
* For oxoanions, the charge of the anion will tell you how many of this bond (\(\neg\)O-) is present.
* For compounds where O is not the surrounding atom, then it is most likely to form 2 single bonds, acting like a 'bridge' linking its adjacent atoms.

Method 3 [Substitution]

Simplify the formula by substituting less familiar element with one of the same **covalency**1 to form compound commonly seen, especially for compounds with more than 1 central atom.

Table 3: [Substitution]In a trigonal bipyramidal shape, there will be less repulsion between the lone pairs if we place them all at the equatorial position rather than at the axial position. Thus sulfur tetrafluoride, SF\({}_{4}\) (with 4 bond pairs and 1 lone pair)

Similarly, CIF\({}_{3}\) (with 3 bond pairs and 2 lone pairs). There are 3 possible arrangements of the electron pairs around the the central I atom.

_According to the VSEPR theory, electron pairs (both bond pairs and lone pairs) around an atom of molecule arrange themselves as far apart as possible in space to minimise inter-electronic repulsion, allowing the molecule to be low in energy and hence stable._

_The strength of repulsion between electron pairs decreases in the order: \(\text{lp}\text{--lp}\text{ }>\text{lp}\text{--bp}>\text{bp}\text{--bp}\)_

_As illustrated in the table previously, all 3 arrangements have 6 pairs of 90\({}^{\circ}\) repulsion but the strength of the 90\({}^{\circ}\) repulsion between the different types of electron pairs is the least for arrangement **A**, followed by **C** and then **B**. Hence arrangement **A** will be the most stable while arrangement **B** will be the least stable._

Note:

In an **octahedral arrangement of 4 bond pairs and two lone pairs**, repulsion is minimised when lone pairs are on opposite sides of central atom.
