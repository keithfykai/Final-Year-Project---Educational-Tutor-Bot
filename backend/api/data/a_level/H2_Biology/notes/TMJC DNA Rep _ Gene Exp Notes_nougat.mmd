## Topic synopsis

An understanding of _Genetics and Inheritance_ that would help make sense of the transition from molecular to organismal level. _Genetics and Inheritance_ provides the molecular basis to the understanding of how variations in populations arise and this is important in the study of biological evolution. At the cellular level, expression of genes involves cellular structures such as the nucleus, endoplasmic reticulum and ribosome. Many essential products of gene expression are enzymes involved in biochemical pathways which control physiological functions. As such, mutation of genes may give rise to dysfunctional proteins which in turn could result in diseases. Sickle cell anemia and cancer are some examples of genetic diseases.

The following questions should help you frame your learning:

* How does the genetic make-up of an organism and the environment influence the organism's appearance, behavior and survival?
* How does the inheritance of genetic information ensure the continuity of humans as a species?

_Heritable information, in the form of DNA (and in some cases RNA), provides for continuity of life_

Genomes contain heritable information necessary for continuity of life at all levels: cell, organism and system. This information is stored and passed on to subsequent generations via DNA. Reproduction can occur at the cellular or organismal level; each progeny needs to receive heritable genetic information from its parent(s). The process of replication is thus vital to ensure that such genetic information is passed from the parents to the offspring.

Genetic information is stored in an organism's DNA; expression of genes results in the synthesis of functional products, such as rRNA, tRNA and proteins. These products play a role in intra- and extracellular biochemical pathways and influence the physiological processes in organisms.

But how does a gene, which consists of a string of DNA hidden in a cell's nucleus, know when it should express itself? How does this gene lead to the production of a string of amino acids called a protein? How do different types of cells know which types of proteins they must manufacture? The answers to such questions lie in the study of gene expression. This topic begins by showing how a quiet, well-quarded string of DNA is expressed to make RNA and how the messenger RNA is translated to form a protein. Along the way, the article set also examines the nature of the genetic code, how the elements of code were predicted, and how the actual codons were determined.

**Learning Outcomes**

**Core Idea 2A: The Structure of Nucleic Acids and Gene Expression**

_The structure of DNA was proposed by Watson and Crick in 1953. With an understanding of DNA structure, experimental evidence supported the proposal that DNA replicates in a semi-conservative manner. The central dogma states that genetic information is encoded in the DNA and transferred to the mRNA during transcription. In addition to mRNA transcription, tRNA and rRNA are transcribed; tRNA is needed during translation while rRNA is a component of ribosomes. In eukaryotic transcription, pre-mRNA is synthesised and then processed to produce mature mRNA. Subsequently, through translation, the information on the mRNA is used to synthesise polypeptides, which are folded into functional proteins._

**b)**: Describe how the information on DNA is used to synthesise polypeptides in prokaryotes and eukaryotes. (Description of the processes of transcription, formation of mRNA from pre-mRNA and translation is required)

## Pre-lecture Exercise:

### How much do you remember about Deoxvribonucleic Acid (DNA)?

1. Nucleic acids are made up of (monomers).
2. A nucleotide is made up of a, a and a.
3. DNA nucleotides are called.
4. Many free nucleotides join together to form a chain via condensation reactions which occur between the **5'** **group** of one free nucleotide and the **group** of the **3' carbon** of the previous nucleotide, **forming a bond.**
5. A DNA double helix structure consists of 2.
6. The two polynucleotide chains are, i.e. their 5' to 3' orientations run in opposite directions.
7. occurs between purine and pyrimidine bases in DNA.
8. Stability and integrity of the double helix is maintained by **bonds** between the complementary bases and **interactions** between the stacked bases.

## 1 The Central Dogma of Molecular Biology

* When Watson and Crick suggested that DNA exists in the form of a double helix, they also suggested that the genetic information, which controls the activities of the cell, might be passed from generation to generation.
* This **genetic information** is **stored** in the form of the **sequence of nucleotides** in **DNA molecule.**
* The **sequence of nucleotides in the DNA** is a **code for the sequence of nucleotides in RNA** and **subsequently**, the **sequence of amino acids in protein molecules.**
* This **flow of genetic information** has since been known as the **central dogma of molecular biology** (a term coined by Crick).
* The Central Dogma refers to (Refer to Fig. 1):
* **The genetic information*
* that is **stored as DNA*
* in all organisms (including viruses).
* of the genetic information **involves DNA-directed DNA synthesis*
* using DNA as a template to synthesize DNA.
* When the **genetic information*
* is **expressed in a cell**, it flows _uni-directionally_
* from **DNA to RNA*
* (by a process called **transcription**)
* and then from **mRNA to protein*
* (by a process called **translation**)
* However, there are cases when the Central Dogma **does not*
* hold true:
* In cases when a gene codes for a type of RNA and the flow of information stops at RNA (e.g. rRNA, tRNA, etc).
* A reverse flow of information from RNA to DNA (by a process called reverse transcription) (Refer to Topic 9: Organization & Inheritance of Viral Genomes).
* RNA, instead of DNA is the form of the genetic information of the organism (e.g. some viruses).

## 2 DNA Replication

In 1953, James Watson and Francis Crick shook the scientific world with an elegant double-helical model for the structure of DNA. Over the past 60 years, their model has evolved from a novel proposition to an icon of modern biology. DNA, the substance of inheritance, is the most celebrated molecule of our time.

Of all nature's molecules, nucleic acids are unique in their ability to direct their own replication from monomers. Hereditary information is encoded in the chemical language of DNA and reproduced in all cells in your body. It is this DNA programme that directs the development of your biochemical, anatomical, physiological and, to some extent, behavioral traits.

Key roles of DNA:

\(\bullet\)**Long-term storage of genetic information** for development and function of organisms.

\(\bullet\)**Each strand acts as a template to make more copies of DNA in DNA replication**.

\(\bullet\)**Acts as a template for transcription** (Section 3).

Most important structural features of DNA to note for DNA replication:

\(\circ\)**Double stranded**

\(\circ\)**Antiparallel** (one strand runs from 5' to 3' direction, the other strand runs from 3' to 5' direction)

\(\circ\)**Complementary base pairing** between Adenine with Thymine, Cytosine with Guanine

Some key questions:

**(a) What** is DNA replication?

\(\circ\)**The _process_ of doubling the amount DNA in a cell / making copies of DNA is known as DNA replication.

**(b) When** does DNA replication occur?

\(\circ\)**For **eukaryotes** - Occurs during the **S-phase of interphase** during the cell cycle, when a cell prepares for mitosis or meiosis.

\(\circ\)**For **prokaryotes** - Occurs at the start of binary fission (Topic 10).

**(c) Where** does DNA replication occur?

\(\circ\)**Nucleus, mitochondria and chloroplasts of eukaryotes**

\(\circ\)**Cytoplasm of prokaryotes**

**(d) Why** does DNA replication occur?

\(\circ\)**In mitosis - Nucleus **divides once**. DNA replication doubles the amount of DNA in the nucleus such that when chromatids separate into the **two resulting daughter cells**, each will have exactly the **same amount** of DNA as the parental cell (**to ensure genetic stability**).

\(\circ\)**In meiosis - Nucleus **divides twice**. DNA replication doubles the amount of DNA so that meiosis results in **four daughter cells**, each having **half the amount** of DNA compared with the parental cell. (Reduction in ploidy for fertilization)

**(e) How** does DNA replication occur? (Section 2.2)

### Experimental evidence for the mechanism of DNA replication:

**The Meselson-Stahl experiment**

* Before the mechanism of DNA replication was known, there were **three proposed models** (Fig. 1a).

**(a) Semi-conservative Model**

* The **two strands** of the DNA molecule **separate** by breaking the hydrogen bonds between base pairs of the two strands.
* **Each strand** then acts as a **template** for the formation of one new strand.
* **New hydrogen bonds** form between bases of one old and one new strand to form a complete molecule.
* Each daughter cell **inherits a resulting DNA molecule** that consists of **one new** and **one old strand**.

**(b) Conservative Model**

* The **entire double-stranded DNA molecule** acts as a **template** for an entirely new DNA molecule to be formed.
* The **parent DNA molecule is intact** and goes into one daughter cell. The new molecule goes into the other daughter cell.

**(c) Dispersive Model**

* Parental DNA breaks up into **short segments**.
* These segments are used as **templates** for the synthesis of a new double helix.
* The segments are then somehow **joined together**.

**Figure 1a: Possible models of DNA replication.**

**(a) Semi-conservative model (b) Conservative model (c) Dispersive model*** The three models were tested by Mathew Meselson and Franklin Stahl in 1958 in an experiment now known as the **Meselson-Stahl Experiment**.
* Materials used:
* _E. coli_ bacteria culture
* Culture medium containing \({}^{16}\)N (**heavy*
* Culture medium containing \({}^{14}\)N (**lighter*
* Kit to extract bacterial DNA from all culture medium
* Centrifuge for separation of bacterial DNA in band(s) according to their densities in a solution of caesium chloride (a very dense solution)
* Experimental details: (Fig 1b)

* Parental _E. coli_ was grown in \({}^{15}\)N medium as the only source of nitrogen for **many generations** until \({}^{15}\)**N** was incorporated into the **nucleotide bases** in **all bacterial DNA**.
* The _E. coli_ containing \({}^{16}\)N was then **transferred into a medium containing only \({}^{14}\)N**.
* To distinguish between 'old' and 'new' DNA, two different isotopes of nitrogen were used: \({}^{14}\)N (more common isotope) and \({}^{15}\)N (less common, **heavier*
* The transferred _E. coli_ was then allowed to **divide for one generation*
* and some cells were then collected.
* These collected cells were called the '**first generation cells'**.
* **DNA was then extracted*
* from these cells, and the relative mass determined by **ultracentrifugation*
* (60000 revolutions per min) in **caesium chloride solution**. (Fig 1c)
* The **remaining cells** were allowed to **divide once more** to obtain '**second generation cells'**. DNA was extracted again and centrifuged.

Figure 1b: Meselson-Stahl Experiment

_Note:_

* Centrifugation separates DNA molecules of different densities.
* Double helix DNA molecule containing only \({}^{15}\)**N\({}^{15}\)N** is **denser** than double helix DNA molecules containing only \({}^{14}\)**N\({}^{14}\)N**.
* Thus, \({}^{15}\)**N\({}^{15}\)N** -DNA would form a band below that of the \({}^{14}\)**N\({}^{14}\)N** -DNA in the caesium chloride solution.
* **Hybrid DNA \({}^{14}\)N \({}^{15}\)N** which is made up of one \({}^{14}\)**N** strand and one \({}^{15}\)**N** strand would form a band between the \({}^{14}\)**N\({}^{14}\)N** and \({}^{15}\)**N\({}^{15}\)N** bands.

Observations (Fig. 1d) and explanation of results that illustrate semi-conservative DNA replication.

Figure 1d: Experimental procedure to prove that DNA replication is semi-conservative.

Figure 2: 1d: Experimental procedure to prove that DNA replication is semi-conservative.

### Mechanism of semi-conservative DNA replication

* DNA replication occurs during the **S phase of interphase** of the cell cycle (Fig. 2.2a), in the **nucleus** of eukaryotic cells.
* However, because prokaryotic cells do not contain a nucleus, this process occurs in the **nucleoid region** in the cytoplasm.
* Mechanism of DNA replication is largely similar in eukaryotes and prokaryotes. DNA replication will be illustrated here using the prokaryotic model.
* Before DNA replication occurs, **molecules required** for DNA replication are **manufactured in the cytoplasm** and **imported into the nucleus** via the nuclear pores.
* These molecules include: **deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates (deoxyribonucleotides)**, **ATP** and various _subunits_ of enzymes and proteins**.
* The enzymes and proteins required for DNA replication are summarized below:

\begin{tabular}{|p{142.3pt}|p{142.3pt}|} \hline
**Proteins involved** & **Function** \\ \hline DNA helicase & Unwinds and unzips the DNA double helix by breaking the hydrogen bonds between complementary bases. \\ \hline Single-stranded DNA binding proteins & Prevent reannealing of the double strands by stabilising the single-stranded DNA formed by the action of helicase. \\ \hline Primase & Synthesises RNA primer which provides a free 3'OH group for DNA polymerase III to add new deoxyribonucleotides. \\ \hline DNA polymerase III & \(\bullet\) Elongates DNA by adding deoxyribonucleotides to the free 3' OH group of the primer by complementary base pairing. \\ \(\bullet\) Catalyses the formation of phosphodiester bonds between adjacent deoxyribonucleotides. \\ \hline DNA polymerase I & \(\bullet\) Proofreads the newly synthesized strand. \\ \(\bullet\) Replaces RNA primer with deoxyribonucleotides via complementary base pairing and formation of phosphodiester bonds. \\ \hline DNA ligase & Seals the gaps between Okazaki fragments by forming phosphodiester bonds between the Okazaki fragments. \\ \hline \end{tabular}

Fig. 2.2a: DNA replication occurs in the S phase of the cell cycle. The preceding G\({}_{1}\) phase is a time for the cell to prepare for DNA replication.

## 1 Start of DNA replication

* DNA replication is **bi-directional**, meaning that the synthesis of each new DNA strand occurs in opposite directions.
* The process **begins at** particular sites called **origins of replication _(ori)_, which are **short stretches of DNA with specific sequence** of nucleotides.
* **Eukaryvotic DNA** has **many** origins of replication on **each DNA molecule** (Fig. 2.2b).

* Unlike eukaryotic DNA, **prokaryotic DNA** has only **one** origin of replication on its circular DNA (Fig. 2.2c).

* Various proteins (including enzymes) first bind near the origin of replication to form a protein complex, which will initiate DNA replication (Fig. 2.2d).

Figure 2.2c: One origin of replication in the _E.coli_ chromosome

Figure 2.2b: Multiple origins of replication in Eukaryotic DNA

#### (i) DNA Helicase

\(\circ\) DNA Helicase is an enzyme that _unwinds and unzips_ the double stranded DNA **into single strands**, allowing each strand to be copied.

\(\circ\) **Unzipping of DNA** involves **breaking the hydrogen bonds between base pairs** in double stranded DNA. This **requires energy** in the form of **ATP**.

\(\circ\) The _initial_ **unzipping** of the DNA molecule leads to the **formation of a replication bubble**. **At each end** of the replication bubble is a **replication fork**, where the unzipping of the DNA molecule will continue. Hence, there are 2 replication forks for each replication bubble.

\(\circ\) Each single DNA strand is known as a **parental strand** and acts as a **template** for the synthesis of a new complementary daughter strand.

#### (ii) Single-stranded Binding Proteins (SSBPs)

\(\circ\) After separation, **single-stranded binding proteins bind** to the **unzipped parental strands** and **prevent** them from **reannealing**, until new deoxyribonucleotides form complementary base pairs with the parental strand via hydrogen bonds.

#### (iii) Topoisomerase

\(\circ\) The separation of the double helix causes tighter strain _ahead_ of the replication fork. Topoisomerase helps to relieve this strain by breaking, swivelling and re-joining each DNA strand.

Figure 2.2d: Shows the proteins involved in the initiation of DNA replication. Note that there are two replication forks proceeding in opposite direction.

**2. Priming of DNA by Primase**

* **Before the elongation of the new daughter DNA strand can proceed by DNA polymerase**

**III, the enzyme primase is needed to initiate the elongation process (Fig. 2.2e).**

**(iv) Primase**

* **Primase catalyses the addition of a short sequence of RNA primer (note: not DNA) to the start of the new strand.**
* **Primers are short sequences (5 to 10 nucleotides long) of RNA that are complementary to the DNA parental strands (template).**
* **Primers provide the free 3' OH group for DNA polymerase III to add new deoxyribonucleotides.**
* **The RNA primers are later replaced with deoxyribonucleotides by another DNA polymerase, called DNA polymerase I.**

**Figure 2.2e: Priming of DNA replication and removal of RNA primers.**

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:16]

As DNA polymerase III elongates the daughter strand, it proofreads the deoxy ribonucleotide added to ensure that the correct one was added. When an **incorrect deoxy ribonucleucleotide** is added, the **DNA polymerase III** will excise and **replace it with the correct deoxy ribonucleotide** (Fig. 2.2g).

As the parental DNA strands run in **antiparallel** direction, elongation proceeds in **two directions** - towards and away from replication fork (Fig. 2.2h).

Note that elongation of new DNA strands occur in the 5' to 3' direction for both leading and lagging strands.

Figure 2.2h shows an overview of how DNA replication occurs bi-directionally.

Note that elongation of new DNA strands occur in the 5' to 3' direction for both leading and lagging strands.

Figure 2.2: Summary of DNA replication and the components involved at one replication fork. Note that each Okazaki fragment on the lagging strand is synthesized away from the replication fork, but the overall direction of synthesis of both strands is towards the replication fork.

### The end-replication problem in Eukaryotic cells

* The ends of linear chromosomes pose a problem for the usual DNA replication machinery.
* For the leading strand, synthesis can continue to the end of its template. However, for the lagging strand, replacing the final RNA primer with DNA at the **5' end** of the daughter DNA strand would **not** be possible. This is because DNA polymerase can only add deoxyribonucleotides to the free 3'-OH end of a pre-existing polynucleotide but not to the 5' end.
* As a result, a dividing cell that undergoes repeated rounds of replication will produce shorter and shorter DNA molecules (Fig. 2.3a).

Figure 2.3a: The end replication problem results in shorter molecules of DNA after each round of DNA replication.

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:23]

## 3 Gene Expression - Transcription and Translation

* Most important **structural features of RNA*
* to note for _transcription_:
* RNA is usually _single stranded_.
* Adenine complementary base pairs with **Uracil**, while Cytosine complementary base pairs with Guanine.
* There are 3 main types of RNA, each with different functions; (1) **Messenger RNA (mRNA)*
* **Conveys genetic information from nucleus to ribosome*
* as DNA is too large to leave the nucleus.
* **Acts as a template*
* for ribosome to carry out **translation.*
* Each mRNA molecule has a sequence of ribonucleotides. **Each triplet of bases on the mRNA is known as a codon. Each codon codes for one amino acid**. (2) **Transfer RNA (tRNA)*
* **Carries specific amino acids to mRNA on ribosome*
* for protein synthesis
* Has an **anti-codon*
* to complementary base pair with a codon on mRNA
* (3) **Ribosomal RNA (rRNA)*
* Associates with ribosomal proteins to form ribosome for translation.
* During translation, rRNA acts as a ribozyme providing peptidyl transferase activity, catalyzing the formation of peptide bonds between the amino acids. (More details on roles of rRNA > Refer to Topic 2)

### The concept of a gene

* Each type of living organism must have distinct genetic messages that define various aspects of that organism.
* The sequence of nucleotides in the DNA molecule is used as a code for this purpose. This code determines which amino acids are joined together to form polypeptides.
* The DNA molecule is a very large molecule. Along this molecule, there are many distinct segments of deoxyribonucleotides each coding for a specific protein (Refer to Fig. 3.1). Each distinct segment of deoxyribonucleotides which codes for a protein is called a gene.
* Definition of a gene: A **gene** is a **discrete unit of hereditary information** consisting of **specific nucleotide sequence in DNA** (or RNA in some viruses).

Figure 3.1: There are many genes along a DNA molecule, each gene having a unique sequence of deoxyribonucleotides. Each chromosome under the microscope is one DNA molecule.

### The genetic code

* Based on the Central Dogma, the genetic code is stored in the **sequence of deoxyribonucleotides in DNA**, which is transcribed into a specific sequence of nucleotides in mRNA during the process of transcription. The mRNA is then translated into an amino acid sequence (Fig. 3.2a).
* In nature, there are only **4 types of nucleotides** in DNA and RNA respectively. However, there are a total of **20 types of amino acids** that can be found in proteins.
* Thus, the **number of bases/nucleotides required to code for each of the 20 amino acids** can be found by the following formula: **Nc** where by N = Types of Bases/Nucleotides Available (i.e. A, T, C, G, etc.) c = length of code (i.e. singlet, duplet, triplet, etc.)
* If 1 nucleotide codes for 1 amino acid in the primary structure of a protein (a singlet code, i.e. 1 nucleotide long), the polypeptide can contain only 4\({}^{1}\) = 4 types of amino acids. This is insufficient.
* If 2 nucleotides code for 1 amino acid in the primary structure of a protein (a duplet code, i.e. 2 nucleotides long), the polypeptide can contain 4\({}^{2}\) = 4 x 4 = 16 types of amino acids. This is still insufficient.
* If 3 nucleotides code for 1 amino acid in the primary structure of a protein (a **triplet** code, i.e. 3 nucleotides long), the polypeptide can contain 4\({}^{3}\) = 4 x 4 x 4 = 64 types of amino acids. This is more than sufficient to code for 20 different amino acids. (Refer to Fig. 3.2b)
* Hence, a **sequence of three nucleotides** (triplets) is the smallest unit that can sufficiently **code for all (20) amino acids**.

Figure 3.2a: The flow of genetic information from DNA to protein (the Central Dogma)* **Features of the genetic code*
* (Fig. 3.2b) 1. The genetic code is a **triplet code. Each triplet*
* is **transcribed*
* into **one mRNA codon.*
* The **DNA triplet code*
* is first transcribed into mRNA before a protein is made.
* **mRNA codons*
* (3 nucleotides per codon) are **complementary*
* to that of the **DNA triplets*
* on the template strand.
* Each amino acid to be incorporated into the polypeptide chain is determined by the sequence of an mRNA codon, which is in turn coded for by a sequence of a DNA triplet.
2. The genetic code is **degenerate.** * **More than one mRNA codon** can code for the **same** amino acid. * For example, glycine (Gly) can be coded for by 4 mRNA codons : GGG, GGA, GGC and GGU. * The **first two** of the three **nucleotides** in the **codon** are usually the same.
3. The genetic code is **punctuated.** * There are **start and stop codons** for the start and end of **translation** * Presence of a **start codon AUG** (which codes for amino acid methionine) signals the start of the translation of mRNA into a sequence amino acids. * The **stop codons UAA**, **UGA**, **UAG** act as'stop signals' for the termination of polypeptide chain synthesis during translation. * The stop codon does **not** code for any amino acid.
4. The genetic code is **non-overlapping** - the **reading frame** for each triplet is **fixed**. * The codons do not overlap i.e. each nucleotide in a codon is only used once. * A - A - U - C - G - C - is non-overlapping * A - A - U - C - G - C - is overlapping * The genetic code is **universal** i.e. it is **used in all organisms**. * With some minor exceptions, in all organisms (both prokaryotes and eukaryotes), the same codon codes for the same amino acid.

Figure 3.2b: The genetic code – Different forms of representations of codon tables for mRNA to amino acid

### Gene expression

* The trait of an organism (phenotype) is determined mostly by the **types** and/or the **amounts** of **proteins** produced. Proteins produced can be enzymes, hormones or other proteins.
* The type and the amount of proteins produced are in turn determined by the genes (genotype).
* Therefore, **gene expression** refers to the **synthesis of proteins** based on the information **encoded in gene sequences**.
* The **synthesis of mRNA** using DNA as template. 2. **Translation**
- The **synthesis of polypeptides** using mRNA as template.
* Expression of some genes does not involve translation. i.e. transcription of tRNA genes and rRNA genes form tRNA and rRNA respectively, which are then **not** translated.
* Only protein-coding genes are transcribed into mRNA, which is then translated into polypeptides containing a specific sequence of amino acids determined by the gene sequence.

Figure 3.3a: Overview of gene expression in (a) prokaryotes and (b) eukaryotes. In bacteria, due to the lack of nucleus, transcription and translation occur simultaneously. As soon as mRNA is produced during transcription, translation of the mRNA takes place. In contrast, in eukaryotic cells, transcription occurs in the nucleus to produce mRNA which is then transported out into the cytoplasm for translation.

#### Transcription

* **Transcription** is the **synthesis of RNA (mRNA**, tRNA and rRNA) by using the DNA template stand** (Fig. 3.3b).
* The synthesis of RNA begins in a living **cell that is not undergoing cell division**.
* Transcription takes place in the **nucleus** of **eukaryotic cells** but in the **cytoplasm** of **prokaryotes**.
* The segment of DNA where transcription occurs is known as a **transcription unit*
* and comprises 3 main regions: (Fig. 3.3b)
* RNA-coding region, which includes the
* _Is there a difference between a gene and a transcription unit?_
* Not really. The term "gene" is more commonly used and generally associated with the concept of heredity.
* The term "transcription unit" is more technical and generally used when describing the process of transcription.

### Promoter

* Promoter is the region of **DNA upstream** of the RNA-coding region, where **RNA polymerase** and a collection of proteins called **transcription factors** attach to and initiate transcription.
* In **eukaryotes**, there is a DNA sequence **within the promoter** known as the **TATA box**.
* The TATA box is recognized by **transcription factors** and **RNA polymerase**.
* The TATA box is named as such because it is rich in adenine (A) and thymine (T).
* In **prokaryotes**, the DNA sequence within the promoter recognized by only **RNA polymerase** is known as the **Pribnow box**.

## 2 Elongation (Fig. 3.3e)

In both Eukaryotes and Prokaryotes:

* RNA polymerase moves along the DNA template strand in the 3' to 5' direction and takes up free ribonucleotides which are complementary to the bases on the DNA template strand and matches them by complementary base pairing:
* Adenine in DNA with Uracil in RNA
* Thymine in DNA with Adenine in RNA
* Cytosine in DNA with Guanine in RNA
* Guanine in DNA with Cytosine in RNA
* RNA polymerase then catalyses the formation of the phosphodieser bonds between adjacent ribonucleotides.
* Unlike DNA polymerase, RNA polymerases does not require an existing free 3'OH group to add ribonucleotides. Hence, no primer is needed.
* Since the nucleotide sequence on the DNA template strand is read in the 3' to 5' direction, messenger RNA is synthesised in the 5' to 3' direction (due to the antiparallel nature of the 2 polynucleotide strands).
* 5' to 3' elongation of the mRNA strand proceeds until RNA polymerase reaches the terminator region.

#### Post-Transcriptional Modification (In Eukaryotes only)

In Eukaryotes
* In eukaryotes, there are other processes that occur _after transcription_ and _before translation_.
* These regulatory processes are collectively termed **post-transcriptional modifications**.
* An mRNA molecule that has **not completed** post-transcriptional modification is termed **pre-mRNA** / primary mRNA transcript.
* An mRNA molecule that has **completed** its post-transcriptional modification is termed **mRNA**.
* In **eukaryotic cells**, after **transcription** occurs in the **nucleus**, the **mRNA** has to be **transported out** of the nucleus through the **nuclear pore** for translation to occur in the cytoplasm.
* **To facilitate the transport of mRNA** and **regulation of gene expression**, post-transcriptional modification must first occur in the **nucleus**. The **pre-mRNA undergoes** the following post-transcriptional modifications (Fig.3.3h; more details will be covered in Topic 8):

1. **Addition of 5' modified GTP Cap**

* A **modified guanosine triphosphate (GTP)** is added to the 5' end of the pre-mRNA.
* The addition of the 5' GTP Cap (i) facilitates the export of mature mRNA, (ii) protects the mRNA from degradation and (iii) helps ribosomes attach to the 5' end of the mRNA during translation.

2. **RNA Splicing**

* **Introns** (segments of the RNA-coding region that will not be translated) are **excised** (i.e., removed)
* **Exons** (segments of the RNA-coding region that will be translated) are **spliced** (i.e., joined together)

3. **Addition of 3' Poly (A) Tail**

* A chain of **adenine** nucleotides is added to the 3' end of the pre-mRNA.
* Like the modified 5' GTP cap, the 3' Poly (A) tail (i) facilitates the export of mature mRNA, (ii) protects the mRNA from degradation and (iii) helps ribosomes attach to the 5' end of the mRNA during translation.

* At the **end of post-transcriptional modification**, the mRNA transcript is termed **mRNA** and it consists of (Fig. 3.3h):

* 5' GTP Cap
* 5' untranslated region (5UTR)

#### Translation

* Translation is the **synthesis of a specific sequence of amino acids** (which forms the polypeptide chain) using the **base sequence on an mRNA template**. (Fig. 3.3j).
* Besides mRNA, **tRNA** and **ribosomes** (comprising **rRNA** and **ribosomal proteins**) also take part in translation. (Recall Topic 2 on details of their structures)
* The process of translation is similar for both eukaryotes and prokaryotes.
* However, in **eukaryotes**, it is the **mature mRNA** that is translated.

## 1 Initiation of Translation

(Fig. 3.3n)

When translation begins, the **small subunit of the ribosome** binds to the **5' end** of the mRNA molecule and moves in the direction of the 3' end to scan for the start codon (AUG).

An **initiator tRNA** with an **anticodon UAC** undergoes **complementary base pairing** with the **start codon AUG on mRNA** via hydrogen bonds.

This **initiator tRNA** also **carries** the amino acid **methionine** at its 3' CCA end.

The **arrival of a large ribosomal subunit** then completes the **translation initiation complex**. The initiator tRNA is now also bound to the **P site of the ribosome.**

The **large ribosomal subunit** has three binding sites:

\(\circ\) **Aminoacyl-tRNA binding site (A),**

\(\circ\) **Peptidyl-tRNA binding site (P),**

\(\circ\) **Exit site (E)**.

\(\bullet\) **GTP** provides the **energy** for the assembly.

Since the _initiator tRNA always carries methionine, does it mean that methionine is always the first amino acid in all proteins?_

Is there only one AUG codon in every mRNA?

## 3 Termination (Fig. 3.3p)

* When the A site of the ribosome reaches a **stop codon** (**UAA UGA** or **UAG**) on the mRNA, a protein known as the **release factor** binds to the stop codon.
* The **release factor** recruits **a water molecule**, instead of an amino acid, to the polypeptide chain.
* This **hydrolyses the bond between the completed polypeptide and the last tRNA**, which frees the polypeptide chain and causes the translation complex to dissociate.

#### 3.3.4 Post-Translational Modification

* The newly synthesized **polypeptide coils** and **folds** into its **three-dimensional shape** spontaneously, from primary structure to the secondary and/or tertiary structure, to become a **functional protein**.
* Some proteins may require further **post-translational modifications** before becoming functional.
* Addition of carbohydrates, lipids, or phosphate groups to the polypeptide are among the many post-translational modifications that may take place in the rough endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi apparatus in eukaryotes, and in the cytoplasm in prokaryotes.
