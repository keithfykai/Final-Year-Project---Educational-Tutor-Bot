**ultra filtration**

**Ultra filtration**

1. Blood flows from renal artery and enters the glomerulus through afferent arteriole.
2. **Afferent arterioles** have a **larger diameter** than the **efferent arteriole**, where blood leaves glomerulus, creating high blood pressure or **high hydrostatic pressure**
3. This forces **water, urea, salts** and other small solutes such as **glucose, amino acids** into the **Bowman's capsule**, while **blood cells** and large molecules such as **protein remain in the capillaries**.
4. The **glomerular filtrate** passes from the Bowman's capsule into the proximal convoluted tubule.
5. The endothelium of the glomerular capillaries and the basement membrane of the Bowman's capsule that wraps around the glomerular capillaries are **partially permeable**\(\rightarrow\) only small soluble substances are able to pass through.

**kidney dialysis**

* The kidneys function to **remove waste products, excess water and excess mineral salts.**
* When kidneys fail to fulfil the function, a **dialysis machine** is needed to perform the functions of a kidney.

1. Blood is **drawn from the vein** in patient's arm and is passed through in dialysis machine.
2. The tubing is bathed in **dialysis fluid** which contains the **same concentration of essential substances as the blood** plasma and with **no waste products**.
3. The tubing is **partially permeable** thus small molecules such as **urea and other metabolic waste products diffuse out** of the tubing into the dialysis fluid. **Blood cells, platelets and other large molecules remain** in the tubing.
4. Blood is then returned to the vein in the patient's arm.

adaptation of dialysis machine

1. Tubing is **narrow, long and coiled**. This **increases surface area to volume ratio** for the **diffusion** of waste material into the dialysis fluid
2. There is **countercurrent flow** which is the **direction of blood flow is opposite to the flow of dialysis machine**. This **maintains the same concentration gradient** along the entire exchange.
3. Dialysis fluid contains the **same concentration of essential substances as blood**. This ensures no essential substances will diffuse out of the blood to the dialysis fluid.
4. Dialysis fluid **does not contain metabolic waste products**. This maintains the steep concentration gradient for waste products to diffuse out of the tubing into the dialysis fluid.
