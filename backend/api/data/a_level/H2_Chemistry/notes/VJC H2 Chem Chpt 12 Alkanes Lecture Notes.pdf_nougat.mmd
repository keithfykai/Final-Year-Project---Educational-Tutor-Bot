**Making Thinking Visible**

**Question:** Why is it not necessary to name methylcyclopentane as 1-methylcyclopentane?

**Answer:** Only one substituent on cyclopentane. Hence, position number is not required as there is no distinction between the carbon atoms.

**Question:** Why is 1,2-dimethylcyclohexane not named as 3,4-dimethylcyclohexane or 5,6-dimethylcyclohexane?

**Answer:** The position numbers are chosen to be as low as possible.

## 3 Physical Properties

* **Solubility, Density and Viscosity**
* Alkanes are **non-polar**. They are **insoluble in polar solvents** such as **water** but **soluble in non-polar solvents**, such as benzene, ether (e.g. dimethyl ether, CH3-O-CH3) and CCl4.

**Reason:** Alkanes do not dissolve in water since the energy released from the weaker permanent dipole-induced dipole interactions between the polar water molecules and non-polar alkane molecules is insufficient to overcome the stronger hydrogen bonding between the water molecules.
* Alkanes float on top of water and thus are **less dense than water**.
* Viscosity (more viscous, less fluid) of liquid alkanes increases with increasing molecular mass as long molecules have stronger instantaneous dipole-induced dipole interactions (due to greater number of electrons).
* **Boiling and Melting Points**
* **Straight chain alkanes**
* At room temperature and atmospheric pressure, first four alkanes (C**\(\intercal\)**-C**\(\intercal\)**) are gases; next thirteen alkanes (C**\({}_{5}\)**-C**\(\intercal\)**) are liquids; C**\({}_{18}\) **or more are solids.**

**Reason:** Boiling point increases with number of carbon atoms as more energy is required to overcome the increasing strength of instantaneous dipole-induced dipole interactions due to increasing number of electrons.
* Melting point increases in a zig-zag pattern as intermolecular forces in a crystal depend on the size of the molecules and how well they are packed into the solid lattice.
* **Branched chain isomers**
* It has **a lower boiling point** than the straight chain isomer.

**Reason:** Branched molecules are **more spherical**, hence **less surface area of contact between molecules**, resulting in a **decrease in strength of instantaneous dipole-induced dipole interactions**.
* Effect of branching on packing and on melting point is irregular.

### Unlimited supply / excess of oxygen

**Complete combustion** produces **CO\({}_{2}\) and H\({}_{2}\)O**.

E.g. \(\mathrm{CH_{3}CH_{3}+7/2~{}O_{2}\to 2CO_{2}+3H_{2}O}\)

**Note**:

* Reaction is **exothermic**. The greater the number of carbon atoms, the more energy produced but the greater the amount of oxygen needed for complete combustion.
* Ease of burning accounts for the use of many alkanes as **fuels**.
* Methane (natural gas or cooking gas) burns with a clean blue flame tinged with a little yellow. Very little'soot' (carbon) is formed. **Burning of higher alkanes** gives rise to **sooty flames**.
* The complete combustion of hydrocarbons can be expressed with a general equation:

**Making Thinking Visible**

**Question**: Why is it the combustion of alkanes exothermic?

**Answer**: Stronger bonds in CO\({}_{2}\) and H\({}_{2}\)O are formed and weaker C-H bonds in alkanes are broken.

**Question**: Why does the burning of higher alkanes give rise to sooty flames?

**Answer**: Higher alkanes contain more carbon atoms which need more oxygen to burn. However, oxygen is limited and incomplete combustion is more likely to take place leading to formation of soot which is carbon.

### Formation of Halogenoalkanes

Candidates should be able to:

(b) describe the chemistry of alkanes as exemplified by the following reactions of ethane:

(i) free-radical substitution by chlorine and by bromine

Alkanes react with halogens (C\(l_{2}\) or Br\({}_{2}\)) to produce halogenoalkanes via **free-radical substitution** under **UV light** or under **high temperature** or **heat**. One or more of the hydrogen atoms in the alkane can be substituted by the halogen atoms.

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:9]

**Note:**

**(i)**: A single free radical (once formed) can produce a large number of product molecules by **chain reaction** sequence.
**(ii)**: **Reaction does not stop at monosubstitution.** More than one hydrogen atom in an alkane can be replaced by chlorine with the formation of HC_I_.

E.g. Chlorination of CH\({}_{4}\) via free-radical substitution mechanism.

\begin{tabular}{l l} CH\({}_{4}\) + \(Cl_{2}\) \(\rightarrow\) CH\({}_{3}\)Cl + HC/ & (monosubstitution) \\ CH\({}_{3}\)Cl + Cl\({}_{2}\) \(\rightarrow\) CH\({}_{2}\)Cl\({}_{2}\) + HC/ & (disubstitution) \\ CH\({}_{2}\)Cl\({}_{2}\) + Cl\({}_{2}\) \(\rightarrow\) CH\({}_{2}\)Cl\({}_{3}\) + HC/ & (trisubstitution) \\ CHIC\({}_{3}\) + Cl\({}_{2}\) \(\rightarrow\) CCl\({}_{4}\) + HC/ & (tetrasubstitution) \\ \end{tabular} Hence, the reaction is not 'clean', meaning it does not give a single organic product but a mixture of products.
**(iii)**: **Ethane and higher alkanes give rise to isomeric halogen derivatives when more than one hydrogen atom is substituted**.

E.g. There are **two dichloroethanes**, CH\({}_{2}\)**C/CH\({}_{2}\)C/ and CH\({}_{3}\)CHC/\({}_{2}\), formed from the substitution of ethane with Cl\({}_{2}\). This is typical of reactions of alkanes as there is **little difference between the strengths of the differently situated C-H bonds**.

**Making Thinking Visible**

**Question:**: Why does **monosubstituted** ethane, CH\({}_{3}\)CH\({}_{2}\)C/, predominate if **excess of ethane** is used?

**Answer:**: In the propagation step, there is a higher probability for the C/* radical to collide with a CH\({}_{3}\)CH\({}_{3}\) molecule rather than with a CH\({}_{3}\)CH\({}_{2}\)C/ molecule. Thus, considerable amount of CH\({}_{3}\)CH\({}_{2}\)C/ will be formed first.

**Question:**: Why does **more highly substituted** ethane, such as CC_I_3CC_I_3, predominate if **excess of C_I_2 is used?

**Answer:**: All the hydrogen atoms in ethane can be substituted by chlorine atoms when excess C\({}_{2}\) is used.

CH\({}_{3}\)CH\({}_{3}\) + 6Cl\({}_{2}\) \(\rightarrow\) CC\({}_{3}\)CC/\({}_{3}\) + 6HC/

**Self-practice 2** (Check your answers on SLS Alkanes Lesson 2)

Write equations to show the mechanism of

CH\({}_{3}\)CH\({}_{2}\)CH\({}_{3}\) + 2Br\({}_{2}\)\(\rightarrow\) CH\({}_{3}\)CHBrCH\({}_{2}\)Br + 2HBr

**5.22 Reactivity of halogens**

Reactivity of halogens with alkanes to form halogenoalkanes (RX) decreases down Group 17: F\({}_{2}\) > Cl\({}_{2}\) > Br\({}_{2}\) > I\({}_{2}\)

\begin{tabular}{l l} F\({}_{2}\): & Reaction proceeds with explosive violence, hence cannot be used in laboratory. \\ Cl\({}_{2}\) and Br\({}_{2}\): & Reaction occurs under UV light, high temperature or heat \\ I\({}_{2}\): & Least reactive as iodine does not react with alkanes to any extent. \\ \end{tabular}

\(2^{\rm nd}\) propagation step: \(\rm CH_{3}+Br_{2}\rightarrow\rm CH_{3}Br+Br*\)\(\Delta H_{2(2nd)}\)

\(\Delta H_{2(2nd)}\) = BE(Br-Br)\(]-[\)BE(C-Br)

\(=193-280\)

\(=-87\) kJ mol\({}^{-1}\)

\(\Delta H_{\rmrm rem}\) = \(\Delta H_{2(1st)}\) + \(\Delta H_{2(2nd)}\)

\(=44-87\)

\(=-43\) kJ mol\({}^{-1}\)

**Reasons:**

As shown by the above examples, as the **atomic radius of halogen X increases** down the group, the energy released in the formation of H-X bond in the first propagation step is **less** than the energy needed to break **C-H bond**. Hence, the **first propagation step** is **increasingly endothermic** and there is **decreasing ease of substitution** since \(\Delta H_{\rm rem}\) **becomes less exothermic** down the group.

**You can now attempt Tutorial Questions: Q4 - Q5**

### Rate of substitution at 1\({}^{\circ}\), 2\({}^{\circ}\) and 3\({}^{\circ}\) carbon atoms

In **higher alkanes**, the substitution of hydrogen atoms at different carbon atoms leads to different products.

E.g. When butane undergoes **monochlorination**, there are two possibilities for the substitution to take place as shown below.

**Note: Classification of carbon atoms**

Carbon atoms are classified as being 1\({}^{\circ}\), 2\({}^{\circ}\) or 3\({}^{\circ}\) carbon, by the number of carbon atoms directly bonded to it.

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|} \hline
**1\({}^{\circ}\) carbon** & **2\({}^{\circ}\) carbon** & **3\({}^{\circ}\) carbon** & **4\({}^{\circ}\) carbon** \\ \hline \(\rm C-C\) & \(\rm C-C\) & \(\rm C-C\) & \(\rm C-C\) & \(\rm C-C\) \\ \hline Bonded to & Bonded to & Bonded to & Bonded to \\ one other & two other & three other & four other \\ C atom & C atoms & C atoms & C atoms \\ \hline \end{tabular}

**Making Thinking Visible**

**Question:**: How is the expected yield of 1-chlorobutane and 2-chlorobutane in the monochlorination of butane obtained?
**Answer:**: Butane has 10 hydrogen atoms. Based on probability factor, hydrogen atoms at any **6 positions around primary (1\({}^{\circ}\)) carbon atoms** and any **4 positions around secondary (2\({}^{\circ}\)) carbon atoms** can be substituted by halogen atoms. The **expected ratio of 1-chlorobutane to 2-chlorobutane formed** is **60% : 40%**.

**Question:**: Why is there is a discrepancy between the expected ratio and the ratio of the monochlorinated products obtained experimentally?
**Answer:**: The **2\({}^{\circ}\) alkyl radical**, which is **more stable than the 1\({}^{\circ}\) alkyl radical**, is formed **preferentially**. Hence, the **rate of substitution of hydrogen atom at 2\({}^{\circ}\) carbon atom is higher** than that at 1\({}^{\circ}\) carbon atom. With larger amount of 2\({}^{\circ}\) radicals **formed**, they will react with C\(l_{2}\) to form **2-chlorobutane (CH\({}_{3}\)CH\({}_{2}\)CHC/CH\({}_{3}\))** as the major product**.

**Note: Relative stability of radicals**

### Environmental Pollutants

To achieve maximum power, the internal combustion engine is normally run on an air-fuel mixture which is 10-20% richer in fuel than the stoichiometric mixture. Hence, car exhausts emissions contain the following pollutants.

* Carbon monoxide due to incomplete combustion of fuel. CO combines with haemoglobin in blood and reduces the oxygen-carrying ability of the haemoglobin. This can lead to oxygen starvation and eventual death.
* Oxides of nitrogen, NO and NO\({}_{2}\), formed from the reaction of nitrogen and oxygen in the car's engine. These oxides cause smog and acid rain. High levels of NO and NO\({}_{2}\) damage plant life. NO\({}_{2}\) also contributes to the formation of acid rain which damages vegetation, buildings and water bodies.
* Unburnt hydrocarbons due to incomplete combustion of fuel. In strong sunlight it becomes smog and can cause lung damage.

### Use of Catalytic Converter

In many countries, pollution from motor cars is being reduced by fitting a platinum catalyst converter onto the motor car exhausts. It catalyses the oxidation of CO and unburnt hydrocarbons to CO\({}_{2}\) and H\({}_{2}\)O by oxides of nitrogen, NO and NO\({}_{2}\) which are reduced to harmless N\({}_{2}\) and O\({}_{2}\). The catalytic converter can be 'poisoned' by lead deposits on the catalyst's surface which block the sites for reactions to take place. Thus, lead-free petrol should be used.

E.g. hydrocarbons + oxides of nitrogen \(\rightarrow\) carbon dioxide + water + nitrogen 2CO + 2NO \(\rightarrow\) 2CO\({}_{2}\) + N\({}_{2}\)

### Enhanced Greenhouse Effect

The enhanced greenhouse effect is the direct result of human activities. Processes such as the burning of fossil fuels, industrial operations and forest clearing increase the amount of carbon dioxide, methane and oxides of nitrogen in the atmosphere. Chlorofluocarbons, or CFCs, are also potent greenhouse gases, and as an added danger, they also destroy the ozone layer. In the upper atmosphere, CFCs produce C/- where it catalyses the conversion of ozone into O\({}_{2}\). Ozone absorbs uv radiation better than does O\({}_{2}\), so its depletion allows more of this high energy radiation to reach the Earth's surface.

Ultimately, more greenhouse gases means more infrared radiation trapped and held, which gradually increases the temperature of the Earth's surface and the air in the lower atmosphere. The atmosphere is now trapping more heat that would otherwise have escaped to space. This enhancement of the greenhouse effect is causing global warming. Of all the greenhouse gases released by man-made processes, carbon dioxide is the largest individual contributor to the enhanced greenhouse effect, accounting for about 60% of the increase in heat trapping.
