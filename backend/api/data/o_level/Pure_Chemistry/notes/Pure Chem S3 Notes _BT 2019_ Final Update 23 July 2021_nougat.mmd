## Naming of compounds with transition metals

The metals listed below can have more than one oxidation state (charge). Hence it is important to state which oxidation state is present in the compound during naming

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|} \hline
**Metal / Oxidation State** & **Formula of ion** \\ \hline Copper (I) & Cu\({}^{+}\) \\ \hline Copper (II) & Cu\({}^{2+}\) \\ \hline Iron (II) & Fe\({}^{2+}\) \\ \hline Iron (III) & Fe\({}^{3+}\) \\ \hline Lead (II) & Pb\({}^{2+}\) \\ \hline Lead (IV) & Pb\({}^{4+}\) \\ \hline \end{tabular}

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|} \hline
**Formula** & **Name of compound** \\ \hline Cu\({}_{2}\)S & Copper (I) sulfide \\ \hline CuCl\({}_{2}\) & Copper (II) chloride \\ \hline FeCl\({}_{2}\) & Iron (II) chloride \\ \hline Fe\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{3}\) & Iron (III) oxide \\ \hline PbI\({}_{2}\) & Lead (II) iodide \\ \hline PbO\({}_{2}\) & Lead (IV) oxide \\ \hline \end{tabular}

## Naming of covalent compounds (non metalic compounds)

The following prefixes are used:

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|} \hline

Accuracy of \(\pm\)**0.01s** for digital stopwatch.

2. **Measurement of Temperature**

Measured with a mercury-in-glass thermometer or alcohol-in-glass thermometer

Has the Sl unit of Kelvin (K)

Usually with an accuracy of \(\pm\)**0.5\({}^{\circ}\)C**.

This depends on the thermometer used. If the markings have more divisions between adjacent integers then it is more accurate.

3. **Measurement of Mass**

Measured with an electronic balance or the beam

balance
Has an accuracy of 0.01q

Sl Unit: kg

4. **Measurement of Volume**

Has an Sl unit of **m\({}^{3}\)**

**Conversion of units between dm\({}^{3}\) and cm\({}^{3}\)**

1 dm\({}^{3}\) = 1000 cm\({}^{3}\)For laboratory purposes, measured usually in **cm\({}^{3}\)** or for calculation purposes, in **dm\({}^{3}\)**.

**Apparatus**

**Accuracy**

**Bekker**

Used to measure an **approximate** volume of a liquid.

This is **NEVER** used for accurate measurement.

Example: **approximately** 100 cm\({}^{3}\)

**Measures up to the nearest whole number.**

**Cylinder**

E.g 13 cm\({}^{3}\)

**BureHe**

Accurately measures out the volume of a liquid to the nearest

**0.05 cm\({}^{3}\)**

Scaled marked (graduated) in 0.l0 cm\({}^{3}\) divisions

In the laboratory, it measures up to maximum of 50.00 cm\({}^{3}\) of liquid. ( Readings to 2 d.p)

**Pipette**

Accurately measures **fixed volumes** of liquid.

( Readings to 1 d.p)

Usually come in fixed volumes liked **20.0cm\({}^{3}\), 25.0cm\({}^{3}\)**

### Using a buret

* For a buret, the volume is **measured 'top-down'** so be careful when reading the value.
* For accurate reading, **align your eyes to the liquid level**. Then, read off the scale at the **bottom of the meniscus**.

**Dissolve and filter: when only one solid is soluble**

**Procedure**:

1. Choose \(\alpha\) suitable solvent such that only one solid is soluble.
2. Add the solvent to the mixture to **dissolve** the soluble solid.
3. The mixture is then poured through the filter funnel.
4. The **residue**, which is the insoluble solid, remains on the filter paper.
5. The **filterate** is collected in the beaker.
6. The **residue** is then washed with distilled water and pressed dry between the filter paper.

**Sublimation: when only one solid can sublime**

**Procedure**:

1. The mixture is placed in an **evaporating dish**
2. An inverted filter funnel is placed over the mixture.
3. Upon gentle heating, the solid, e.g. **ammonium chloride or iodine** will sublime and it will **deposil** on the cold filter funnel.

Substances that will sublime

a) Ammonium chloride, NH\({}_{\text{}}\)Cl

b) lodine, I\({}_{\text{}}\)

c) Nightholene (Moith balls)

d) Dry ice

**Fig. 7.1.** Sublimation

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:25]

3. The liquid collected in this way is known as the **distillate**.
4. The solute will be left in the distillation flask.

**Boiling chips are used:**

(a) To reduce/prevent "bumping" \(\sim\) vigorous vibrations caused when bubbles are formed during boiling. Boiling chips will break up bubbles into smaller ones.

(b) To ensure smooth boiling, - there is more surface area of contact for heat to be transmitted. Hence a greater volume of water will gradually heat up.

* [2] The more volatile (lower bp) liquid will boil off and come into contact with the cool surfaces of the beads in the fractionating column.
* [3] The vapour will condense and fall back into the flask. However it will have transferred some heat on the surfaces if has come into with.
* [4] Gradually the fractionating column gets warmed up, such that a point will occur when the more volatile liquid will now reach the top of the column as the temperature has reached the bp of the liquid.
* [5] The vapour will then enter the condenser and condense and be collected as a distillate.
* [6] The temperature will remain constant at the bp of this liquid until all of it has boiled off.
* [7] The temperature then increases until the next boiling point of the second liquid is reached.

**Applications**

This method is used in the separation of:

(a) Petroleum (crude oil) into smaller, useful fractions

(b) Air into useful gases like O\({}_{2}\), N\({}_{2}\)

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:28]

## Paper Chromatography

Paper chromatography is used to separate a mixture of solutes in a solution/_separate_ links into its dyes.

The dyes are separated due to differences in the same solvent used.

The dye that is more soluble will travel further up the filter paper.

E.g. links, food colourings, amino acids, etc.

The solvent front (distance travelled by solvent) must be near the top of the paper to allow a better separation and more accurate identification.

The baseline must always be _above the solvent_ used as the dots applied may dissolve into the solvent and be result in faints spots on the chromatogram.

The setup are sometimes **covered with a lid** to prevent the evaporation of the solvent especially if organic solvent like ethanol with is very volatile is used.

When **the spot applied is too large**, this will produce blotches, overlapping of neighbouring spots instead of small distinct dots on chromatography.

### Criteria of Purity

The purity of a substance cannot be determined by chemical tests, it is usually determined by physical means such as measuring the **melling or boiling point** of a substance or by **chromatoography**

If a substance is pure, it will melt/boil at **one fixed temperature**.

If impurities are present, impurities will **increase the boiling point** (boiling will only start at a higher temperature) and **decrease the melting point** (melting will occur at an even lower temperature) of a substance. Impure substances also melts and boils over a range of temperature.

### Temperature - Time graph of Pure Substance

This is the heating curve of a pure substance, notice that the stages of melting and boiling are occurring over a constant fixed temperature.

It is only after the melting/boiling that temperature increases.

When \(\alpha\) solid changes to \(\alpha\) liquid (heats up until melting point),

As the solid is heated, the solid particles gain **Kinetic Energy** and start to vibrate faster as the **temperature rises**.

As it reaches the **melling point**, the temperature remains **CONSTANTI**

During melting, the **heat energy supplied is absorbed** by the particles to overcome the attractive forces between the particles to change from solid to liquid.

When the solid has completely melted, the temperature rises again as the kinetic energy of the particles increases due to heating.

## Heating curve - the combined graph involving melting then boiling

Figure 1: The temperature rises again as the kinetic energy of the particles increases due to heating.

## Part VI: Evaporation without heating -

[the cooling effect of evaporation]

**Question**: It is observed that the beaker of alcohol experiences a drop in its temperature with time. Explain.

* The particles at the surface of the alcohol have higher kinetic energy as compared to the rest of the alcohol.
* The surface particles of alcohol have enough energy to break away from the liquid and leave as gas. This is the evaporation process and takes place at the surface of the liquid only.
* This evaporation process thus leaves behind particles with lower kinetic energy, leading to lower temperature.

_During evaporation, the more energetic particles escape from the surface leaving the less energetic ones behind._

## Chapter 2 Preliminaries

## Chapter 2 Online

An ionic compound is formed between a metal and non metal.

To achieve a stable noble gas structure, a metal atom will loose electrons to become a positive ion. The electron(s) lost will be taken by the non metal atom to form a negative ion. This will results in an electrostatic attraction (ionic bonding) between the positive and negative ions, resulting in the formation of an ionic compound.

### Example to describe how an ionic compound is formed.

Sodium chloride is formed when a sodium atom (2.8.1) loses 1 electron to for a sodium ion, Na+ (2.8) and achieve an octet structure. This electron is transferred to a chlorine atom (2.8.7) which becomes a chloride ion, Cl- (2.8.8). An ionic bonding is thus formed between the Na+ and Cl ion.

### Examples of "dot and cross" diagrams of ionic compounds

Sodium Chloride, NaCl Calcium Fluoride, CaF\({}_{2}\)

Lithium Oxide, LiO Aluminium Oxide, Al2O

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:41]

## Chapter 2 Overview

A Covalent **compound** is formed when two or more non-metals are bonded.

Eg. Hydrogen and Oxygen forms Water; Nitrogen and Hydrogen forms Ammonia

A Covalent **element** can be formed when two atoms of the elements are bonded.

Eg. Nitrogen gas, N\({}_{2}\), Oxygen gas O\({}_{2}\)

**Types of Covalent Bonding**

A **single** covalent bond is formed each non metal atom share an electron with the other. Thus a single covalent bond has a pair of electrons (2 electrons shared).

A **double** covalent bond has 2 pairs of electrons (4 electrons shared)

A **triple** covalent bond has 3 pairs of electrons (6 electrons shared)

Each of this can be shown below.

Bases are thus metal oxide and metal hydroxides.

Most bases are insoluble in water.

Bases that can dissolve in water form soluble hydroxides known as alkali.

**Physical Properties of Alkali**

* Colourless
* Bifter in taste

## 5 Insect Sings -

## Questions

**Question 1:**

Dry ammonia gas has no effect on pH paper/litmus paper but will turn damp litmus paper blue.

**Question 2:**

Why does aqueous ammonia smell strongly of ammonia gas?

**Question 3:**

Hydrogen chloride gas dissolved in water is acidic and turn red litmus paper blue, but when hydrogen chloride gas is dissolved in organic solvent such as methylbenzene, there is no acidic properties.

**Question 4:**

Hydrogen chloride gas dissolved in water conduct an electric current but when it is dissolved in an organic solvent it does not conduct electricity

**Answer 1:**

In the gaseous state, ammonia gas is a covalent compound. When it is dissolved in water, hydroxyl ions are produced. The presence of hydroxyl ions reacts with the pH indicators causing a change of colour to blue.

\[\text{NH}_{3}\left(\text{g}\right)+\text{H}_{2}\text{O}\left(\text{I}\right) \text{NH}_{4}\text{${}^{*}$}\left(\text{aq}\right)+\text{OH}\text{${}^{*}$} \left(\text{aq}\right)\]

When ammonia molecules dissolve in water only a few molecules react with water to form hydroxyl ions. Most of the ammonia molecules remain as neutral molecules. These molecules are responsible for the smell of the gas. The ions NH4\({}^{*}\) and OH ions have no smell. Ammonia is a weak alkali hence there is a reversible reaction between the reactants (ammonia gas and water) and ammonium hydroxide.

**Answer 3 & 4 (Similar)**

Hydrogen chloride gas dissolved in water to produce H3O\({}^{*}\), this ion is responsible for all properties of acids.

\[\text{HCl}\left(\text{g}\right)+\text{H}_{2}\text{O}\left(\text{I}\right) \text{H}_{3}\text{O}\text{${}^{*}$}\left(\text{aq}\right)+\text{CI}\left( \text{aq}\right)\]

In methylbenzene, Hydrogen chloride gas dissolved physically, remaining as neutral covalent molecules. This resultant mixture has does not contain H3O\({}^{*}\) ions for acidic properties/electrical conductivity.

**At A:** No acid is present. There is only alkali (OH) present. High conductivity as the Na\({}^{+}\) and OH concentration is high

**From A to B:** H\({}^{+}\) ions from acid are introduced and react with OH.

H- (aq) + OH (aq) + H\({}_{2}\)O (I)

The number of ions are reduced. Electrical conductivity decreases.

**At B:** All OH ions are neutralized. (Point of Neutralization) No H\({}^{+}\) or OH ions are present. Conductivity is not zero as Na\({}^{+}\) and Cl ions are present.

**From B - C:** Conductivity increase as more H\({}^{+}\) and Cl are added.

**Figure 1**: **A**: High conductivity as the H\({}^{+}\) and SO\({}_{4}\)\({}^{2}\) concentration is high

**From A to B: Conductivity decreases as the ions are loss due to:**

(a) H\({}^{+}\) neutralised by OH- ions to form covalent water molecules

H\({}^{+}\) (aq) + OH- (aq) H\({}_{2}\)O (I)

(b) SO\({}_{4}\)\({}^{2}\) and Ba\({}^{2+}\) are removed to for insoluble BaSO4 (s)

\(\mathrm{Ba^{2+}}\) (aq) + SO\({}_{4}\)\({}^{2}\) (aq) + BaSO\({}_{4}\) (s)

**At B: All H\({}^{+}\) ions are neutralized. (Point of Neutralization) No H\({}^{+}\) or OH- ions are present. Conductivity is zero as Ba\({}^{2+}\) and SO\({}^{4-}\)ions are present.**

**From B - C: Conductivity increase as more Ba\({}^{2+}\) and OH- are added.**

**Part III**

**Thermometric Titration**

Acid - Alkali reactions are **exothermic reaction**

An exothermic reaction is one where **energy is released in the form of heat**

causing the temperature of the reaction to increased.

**At A:** Temperature of the Alkali is at room temperature.

**From A to B:** Temperature is increasing as H+ react with OH ions

**At B:** Point of Neutralization is reached, no more OH is present for reaction. All OH- ions has reacted. No further neutralization can occur. Hence no more heat is evolved. The temperature gradually decreased to room temperature.

**Comparing Graph I and II**

Half the volume of acid is needed to neutralise the alkali for Graph I than Graph II, indicating that the acid used in Graph I is a dibasic acid, containing twice the number of H+ ions.

Graph I - Dibasic Acid (1 mol/dm\({}^{3}\)) contain twice the H+

Graph II - Monobasic Acid (1 mol/dm\({}^{3}\))

## Chapter 3 Summary

Method involves the following reaction:

(a) Aqueous salt + Acid -> Insoluble Salt + Acid

(b) Aqueous salt + Aqueous salt -> Insoluble Salt + Aqueous salt

When? - To obtain **insoluble salts** like

**AgCI** **CaSO4** **PbSO4**

**PbClz** **BaSO4** **Insoluble**

**Carbonates**

**Theory**

Insoluble salts above cannot be prepared by using a metal / metal oxide/ metal carbonates with acid. This is because when a solid is added to an acid, the insoluble salt formed will coat itself around the solid and prevent further reaction.

**Concept to Form Insoluble Salts**

* Both chemical used must be aqueous solution (free ions)
* One must contain the required cation (positive/metal ion)
* The other must contain the required anion (negative ion)

## Appendix A Online Excess Suli

Method involves the following reaction:

This method is not used when the following salts are prepared:

* Group I salts
* Ammonium salts
* Insoluble salts (AgCl, PbCl\({}_{2}\), CoSO\({}_{4}\), BoSO\({}_{4}\), PbSO\({}_{4}\) or any insoluble carbonates)

**No.** **Procedure** **Remark**

**1**: To a fixed volume of dilute acid (HCl) in a beaker, add

solid (CuO)

**2**: Warm the mixture

Warming increases the

solubility. More crystals

can be obtained giving

better yield.

**3**: Stir the mixture

Increase the rate of

dissolving

**4**: Add excess solid (CuO) until the solid is unable to

dissolve.

This ensures that all the

acid has reacted and will

not remain to

contaminate the salt

**5**: Filter to remove the excess solid (CuO)

**6**: Heat the filtrate to obtain a saturated solution. As the

solution reaches saturation point, gentle heating is

dehydrate the crystals

done.

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:79]

## Chemical properties of metals

* Metals have 1, 2 or 3 valence electrons and always lose electrons to form positive ions such as Na+, Ca2+, Al3+, depending on the number of electrons lost. Down a group, the distance between the positive nucleus and valence shell increases as shown for Group II metals.

As such, metals tend to loose electrons easier and form positive ions easier down the group. Thus the electropositivity (ease by which metal form positive ion) increases as the atomic size increases.

* **Reaction with air:*
* Most metals may react very slowly with components in air (O2, CO2, H2O etc) at room temperature. However, for reactive metals like K, Na and Ca, corrosion occurs readily. Hence these must be stored in oil to prevent contact with air and water. When Na reacts with air and water, Na2O and NaOH are formed respectively. These alkaline compounds are able to absorb the CO2 (acidic oxide) in the air to form sodium carbonate.

* **NQ** (react with O2/H2O) **N**a**O/Na**O**H** (react with CO2) **N**a**Z**CO3 **(ii)** **Burning (Heeding is required)** Metal such as K, Na (Group I) and Ca, Ba and Mg (Group II) burns to form oxide. When they are burn, a flame with the following characteristic colour is seen.

**Reaction with acids**

Metal + Acid - Salt + H2 (Metal below H in the reactivity series do not react with acid)

**Refer to the reactivity series for their reaction.**

Note: Certain metals like Ca, Pb may formed insoluble layer of salt when reacting to acids like HCl or H2SO4 (refer to notes on insoluble salts Pg57)

**(d)**: **Reaction with water/steam**

Reactive metals can react violently with both cold water and steam to form alkali and hydrogen gas. Metal + H2O (I) -Metal hydroxide + H2 (Less reactive metals can react only with steam and not with cold water, a metal oxide and hydrogen gas is formed. Metal + H2O (g) -Metal oxide + H2 **Refer to the reactivity series for their reaction.**

A more reactive metal can displace a less reactive metal from its salt or from its oxide.

Displacement reaction for metals can occur in 2 ways via:

\begin{tabular}{c|c|c|} \hline

A mixture of aluminium and iron (III) oxide powder can be pour into cracks in railway tracks, A piece of Magnesium is used as a fuse and the magnesium is lighted. The heated Magnesium will provide a high temperature needed to start the reaction.

This results in the more reactive AI displacing Fe from Fe\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{3}\). The reaction is strongly exothermic resulting in a lot of heat produced that can cause the iron displaced to melt. Molten iron then deposit and solidify in the crack.

## 1 Stability of Metal Hybrids

Upon heating, most metal hydroxides decompose to a metal oxide and steam as shown below (except NaOH, KOH and **Group I hydroxides which do not decompose as they are very stable**)

Metal Hydroxides + Heat Metal oxide + Steam

Ca(OH)\({}_{2}\) (s) + Heat CaO (s) + H\({}_{2}\)O (g)

Cu(OH)\({}_{2}\) (s) + Heat CuO (s) + H\({}_{2}\)O (g)

Blue ppt Block solid

For less reactive metal (below Copper), their hydroxides decomposes to pure metal, oxygen and steam as their oxides are unstable to heat.

AgOH + Heat Ag\({}_{2}\)O (Unstable) + H\({}_{2}\)O

Further decomposition: Ag\({}_{2}\)O (Unstable) + Heat Ag + O\({}_{2}\)

Hg(OH)\({}_{2}\) + Heat MgO (Unstable)+ H\({}_{2}\)O

Further decomposition: HgO (Unstable) + Heat Hg + O\({}_{2}\)

## 2 Stability of Metal Hybrids

Metal Hydroxides that are soluble in water are known as alkalis. Refer to notes on Alkolis for solubility.

## 3 Stability of Metal Carbonates

Upon heating, most metal carbonates decompose to form metal oxides and carbon dioxide gas. (Group I metal are very reactive and their metal carbonates are stable. Group I metal carbonates do not decompose on heating)

Metal carbonate + Heat -> Metal oxide + Carbon dioxide

ZnCO\({}_{3}\) + Heat -> ZnO + CO\({}_{2}\)

White (Hot - Yellow; Cool - White)

CuCO\({}_{3}\) + Heat -> CuO + CO\({}_{2}\)

Green Black

Metal that are below Copper in the reactivity series, will decompose further due to its unstability. It will decompose to the pure metal and oxygen.

Metal carbonate + Heat -> Metal Oxide (Unstable) + Carbon dioxide

**Further Decomposition:** Metal Oxide (Unstable) + Heat -> Metal + Oxygen

Ag\({}_{2}\)CO\({}_{3}\) + Heat -> Ag\({}_{2}\)O (Unstable) + CO\({}_{2}\)

Further decomposition: Ag\({}_{2}\)O (Unstable) + Heat -> Ag + O\({}_{2}\)

Ammonium carbonate does not leave a solid residue during thermal decomposition as all the products formed are gaseous.

## 6 Discussion

### 6.1 Corrosion of Iron

**Definition:**

(a) Corrosion: gradual destruction of metal due to the reaction with air, water or chemicals in the air.

(b) Rusting is the corrosion of iron in the presence of air and water.

**Fe + H\(\alpha\)O (I) + O\({}_{2}\) (g) Fe(OH)\({}_{3}\) or FezO\({}_{3}\).xH\(\alpha\)O**

(hydrated Iron (III) oxide \(\sim\) Rust)

### 6.2 Experiment to show the conditions required for rusting

\begin{tabular}{|c|p{142.3pt}|p{142.3pt}|} \hline
**Test Tube** & **Condition** & **Explanation** \\ \hline
**A** & Anhydroous calcium chloride (Drying agent) is present. & No water is present, rusting will not take place \\ \hline
**B** & Water is boiled to remove oxygen in it, and a layer of oil is placed over water to keep air out. & No oxygen/air is present, rusting will not take place \\ \hline
**C** & No drying agent or layer of oil. It functions as a control experiment. & Presence of both water and oxygen, rusting occurs. \\ \hline
**D** & Sodium chloride or seawater is used. & The iron rusts fastest as the ions, No\({}^{+}\) and Contains Na\({}^{+}\) and Cl ions. & Cl in the water catalyse (speed up) the rusting process. \\ \hline \end{tabular}

Note: Fe must be oxidized to Fe\({}^{2+}\), before rusting can take place. When this occur, the reaction cannot be stopped as long as Fe is in contact with air. The faster the Fe\({}^{2+}\) forms, the faster the rate of rusting.

\begin{tabular}{|c|p{142.3pt}|} \hline
2 electrons lost & \\
**Fe \({}^{10}\)O\({}_{2}\) in air** & **Fe \({}^{2+}\)** & **HoO Fe (OH)\({}_{2}\)** & **Air Fe(OH)\({}_{3}\)** & **FezO\({}_{3}\).xH\(\alpha\)O** \\ \hline \end{tabular}

## Application

In which experiment will Fe rust faster? Predict and explain the results in the following setups.

Fe will in Setup 2 will be rusting faster than Setup 1. This is because Fe (being more electropositive) will lose electrons readily to copper than to oxygen in the air. This results in Fe forming Fe\({}^{2+}\) faster, resulting in a faster rate of rusting.

## Prevention of RUSTING

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|l|} \hline

Zinc metal corrodes instead of iron. This is knowns as **sacrificial protection.**

## Applications

State the advantages and disadvantages of coating food cans with (a) fin and (b) zinc

**Advantage:** Tin (Sn) is less reactive than Zinc and does not react readily with acidic and alkaline substances in food. Zinc dissolves more readily forming Zn\({}^{2+}\) (which in large quantity can be poisonous)

**Disadvantage:** Tin is less electropositive than Iron. Electrons flow from Iron to Tin very readily. Therefore, Fe\({}^{2+}\) forms more readily than when there is no fin present. Fe rust readily if fin is scratched off.

**Advantage:** Zinc offers sacrificial protection and will corrode in place of iron even when scratched off.

**UNDERGround IRON PIPES**

To prevent such pipes from rusting, bags of magnesium are placed in holes in the ground (at ground level) and connected to the pipe with a wire. The magnesium which is more reactive ionises.

**Mg - 2e - Mg\({}^{2+}\)**

The electrons are transferred via the wire to the iron thus replacing the electrons lost by iron to the air. This reduces the formation of Fe\({}^{2+}\) and prevents rusting.

The magnesium which is slowly corroded can be replaced easily which a new block/bag easily (since it is at ground level).

## 1 Corrosion of ships

Ships are made of iron. To slow down rusting, blocks of zinc are attached to the sides of ships. These will act as sacrificial protection and corrode in place of iron.

## Appendix A Revolving

Metals are finite resources - there in only a limited amount of metal that can be mined from the earth. The only way to make metals lost longer is to recycle them.

### Recycling

Recycling is a process of collecting and processing materials that would be otherwise be thrown away as fresh and turning them into new products.

Metal objects that unwanted and discarded, are crushed and then melted to produce blocks of clean metal. Lead, iron and aluminium are mainly recovered by scrap metal recycling.

### Advantages of Recycling

* Better conservation of natural resources (reserves last longer)
* Higher savings of energy and financial resources. Recycling saves the cost of extracting new metals from ore.

Eg. Recycling aluminium saves 95% the cost of extracting pure aluminium from its oxide, bauxite as a lot of electricity is needed to electrolose aluminium oxide (bauxite).

Producing Al from scrap Al requires 70-80% less energy compared to obtaining Al from bauxite via electrolysis
* More effective waste disposal. Fewer landfills are required to dispose waste metals. Land can be save for other uses (housing, commercial), cost of building landfill sites is also reduced.

Litter accumulation and pollution

from abandoned metal objects

(slowly corroded by air and water) is solved. Metals leach into the soil and eventually into rivers water causing contamination.

Mining of metal destroys the natural environment. It produces a large amount of waste material and causes landslides due to soil erosion. Water pollution due to sediments washed into waterways may also occur.

Chapter 1 Relative Molecular Mass (M\({}_{r}\)) is defined as the number of times one molecules of an element or compound is heavier than \(\frac{1}{12}\) of an atom of \({}_{12}\)C.

To calculate M\({}_{r}\):

Step 1: Write the chemical formula of the compound

Step 2: Find the sum total of the mass (A\({}_{r}\)) of all the individual atoms in the molecule.

### Mass (of an element)

Calculation of the mass of an element, given the mass of a compound

### Examples

#### Calculate the mass of iron in 50g of iron (III) sulfate

\(M_{\mathrm{r}}\) of Fe\({}_{2}\)(SO4)3 = \(56\times 2+3\times\{32+16\times 4\}\) = 400

Since \(M_{\mathrm{r}}\) has no unit, any unit of mass can be assigned to it

400g of Fe\({}_{2}\)(SO4)3 : 112 g (2 x 56g) of Fe

Hence, 50g of Fe\({}_{2}\)(SO4)3 = \(\frac{112}{400}\) x 50g = 14.0 g of Fe (All answers to 3 sig fig)

#### Calculate the mass of copper in 1000 tonnes of copper (II) chloride

\(M_{\mathrm{r}}\) of CuCl\({}_{2}\) = \(64+2\times 35.5=135\)

Since \(M_{\mathrm{r}}\) has no unit, any unit of mass can be assigned to it

135 tonnes of CuCl\({}_{2}\) : 64 tonnes of Cu

Hence, 1000 tonnes of CuCl\({}_{2}\) = \(\frac{64}{135}\) x 1000 tonnes = 474.1 tonnes of Cu (All answers to 3 sig fig)

## AVOGADRO'S CONSTANT - MOLE - MASS

One mole of any substance contain 6.022x10\({}^{23}\) of particles.

**6.022x10\({}^{23}\) is known as the Avogadro's constant, N\({}_{\mathbf{A}}\)**

The mass of one mole of a substance is referred to as the **molar mass**. The molar mass of any element or compound is the sum total mass of the atom(s) in the element or compound in grams.

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|} \hline
**Substance** & **Mole** & **Number of particles** & **Mass** \\ \hline Mg & 1 & 6.022x10\({}^{23}\)Mg atoms & Mass of 1 mole Mg = 24 g \\ \hline H\({}_{2}\)O & 1 & **2 x** 6.022x10\({}^{23}\)H atoms & Mass of 1 mole H\({}_{2}\)O \\  & & 6.022x10\({}^{23}\)O atoms & = 1 + 1 + 16 = 18 g \\  & & Or & \\  & & 6.022x10\({}^{23}\)H\({}_{2}\)O molecules & \\ \hline Zn(NO\({}_{3}\))\({}_{2}\) & 1 & **2 x** 6.022x10\({}^{23}\)NO\({}_{3}\) ions & Mass of 1 mole Zn(NO\({}_{3}\))\({}_{2}\) \\  & & 6.022x10\({}^{23}\)Zn\({}^{2+}\) ions & = 65 + 2(14 + 3 x 16) = 189 g \\ \hline CO\({}_{2}\) & 2 & **2 x** 2 x** 6.022x10\({}^{23}\)O atoms & Mass of 1 mole CO\({}_{2}\) \\  & & **2 x** 6.022x10\({}^{23}\)C atoms & = 12 + 2 x 16 = 44 g \\  & & Or & Mass of 2 mole CO\({}_{2}\) \\  & & & = 2 x 44 = 88 g \\  & & **2 x** 6.022x10\({}^{23}\)CO\({}_{2}\) molecules & \\ \hline Fe\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{3}\) & 1.5 & **1.5 x** 2 x** 6.022x10\({}^{23}\)Fe\({}^{3+}\) ions & Mass of 1 mole Fe\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{3}\) \\  & & **1.5 x** 3 x** 6.022x10\({}^{23}\)O\({}^{2-}\) ions & = 56 x 2 + 3 x 16 = 160 g \\  & & & Mass of 1.5 mole Fe\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{3}\) \\  & & & = 1.5 x 160 = 240 g \\ \hline \end{tabular}

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|} \hline
**(a)**Relationship between no. of & (b)Relationship between no. of mole \\ particles and mole. & and mass of a substance. \\ \hline \end{tabular}

**Calculate the mass of nitrogen gas, N\({}_{2}\) that contains the same number of molecules as 35.5g of chlorine gas, Cl\({}_{2}\).** (Assume Avogadro's constant is 6.0 x 10\({}^{23}\))

Step 1: Find the no. of moles of Cl\({}_{2}\)

No. of moles of Cl\({}_{2}\) = \(\frac{mass}{\text{Mr of FeO}}=\frac{35.5}{35.5+35.5}=0.5\) moles Cl\({}_{2}\)

Step 2: 0.5 moles of Cl\({}_{2}\) will contain the same no. of molecules as 0.5 mol of N\({}_{2}\)

Find the no. of mole N\({}_{2}\) present.

No. of moles of N\({}_{2}\) = **0.5** moles

Step 3: Mass of N\({}_{2}\) = no. of moles x M\({}_{r}\) N\({}_{2}\) = 0.5 x (14 + 14) = 14g

**Calculate the mass of sulfur that contains the same number of atoms as 4.8g of oxygen gas, O\({}_{2}\).** (Assume Avogadro's constant is 6.0 x 10\({}^{23}\))

Step 1: Find the no. of moles of O\({}_{2}\)

No. of moles of Cl\({}_{2}\) = \(\frac{mass}{\text{Mr of O2}}=\frac{4.8}{16+16}=0.15\) moles O\({}_{2}\)

Step 2:

1 mole of O\({}_{2}\) contains = 6 x 10\({}^{23}\) O\({}_{2}\) molecules = 2 x 6 x 10\({}^{23}\) O\({}_{2}\) atoms

Step 3: Find the number of moles of sulfur

0.15 moles of Cl\({}_{2}\) will contain the same no. of molecules as 0.5 mol of N\({}_{2}\)

Find the no. of mole N\({}_{2}\) present.

No. of moles of N\({}_{2}\) = **0.5** moles

Step 3: Mass of N\({}_{2}\) = no. of moles x M\({}_{r}\) N\({}_{2}\) = 0.5 x (14 + 14) = 14g

## Volume of Gas

One mole of all gases occupy the same volume (molar volume) of 24dm\({}^{3}\) or 24 000cm\({}^{3}\) at room temperature and pressure (r.t.p).

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|} \hline
**Mass of gas** & **Mole of gas** & **Volume of gas** \\ \hline
44g CO\({}_{2}\) & 1 mole CO\({}_{2}\) & 24 dm\({}^{3}\) \\ \hline
71g Cl\({}_{2}\) & 1 mole Cl\({}_{2}\) & 24 dm\({}^{3}\) \\ \hline
17g NH\({}_{3}\) & 1 mole NH\({}_{3}\) & 24 dm\({}^{3}\) \\ \hline \end{tabular}

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|} \hline
**Mass of gas** & **Mole of gas** & **Volume of gas** \\ \hline
88g CO\({}_{2}\) & 2 mole CO\({}_{2}\) & 2 x 24 dm\({}^{3}\) \\ \hline
8g H\({}_{2}\) & 4 mole H\({}_{2}\) & 4 x 24 dm\({}^{3}\) \\ \hline
56g N\({}_{2}\) & 2 mole N\({}_{2}\) & 2 x 24 dm\({}^{3}\) \\ \hline \end{tabular}

Thus the relationship between mole and volume of \(\alpha\) gas can be summarized as follows:

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|} \hline
**Calculate the no. of moles of NH\({}_{3}\) in 600 cm\({}^{3}\) at r.t.p** \\ No.of moles of NH\({}_{3}\) & = volume of gas / 24 dm\({}^{3}\) \\ \(=\) 0.6 dm\({}^{3}\)/ 24 dm\({}^{3}\) \\ \(=\) 0.025 moles \\ \hline \end{tabular}

Note: The vol. 6f gas for calculation must both be the same units either cm\({}^{3}\) or dm\({}^{3}\).

**Calculate the mass of oxygen in 6 dm\({}^{3}\) of oxygen gas**

Step 1: Find the no. of moles of O\({}_{2}\)

No. of moles of O\({}_{2}\) = 6 dm\({}^{3}\) / 24 dm\({}^{3}\) = 0.25 mol

Step 2: Use the Mr of O\({}_{2}\) to find the mass

Mass of O\({}_{2}\) = No. of mol x Mr = 0.25 x (16+16) = 8 g O\({}_{2}\)

**Calculate the Mr of an unknown gas if 600cm3 of the**

**gas has a mass of 1.1 g**

Step 1: Find the no. of moles of gas

No. of moles of gas = \(\frac{0.6}{24}\) = 0.025 moles

Step 2: Find the Mr of the gas

Mr of gas = mass / no. of mole

= 1.1 / 0.025 = 44 (Mr has no units)

**Calculate the volume at r.f.p. occupied by 6.0 kg of ammonia gas**

Step 1: Find the no. of moles of NH\({}_{3}\)

No. of moles of NH\({}_{3}\) = \(\frac{mass}{\text{Mr of NH${}_{3}$}}\) = \(\frac{6000}{14+1+1+1}\) = 352.94 moles NH\({}_{3}\)

Step 2: Find the vol. of NH\({}_{3}\)

Vol. of NH\({}_{3}\) = mol x 24 dm\({}^{3}\) = 352.94 x 24 = 8470.59 dm\({}^{3}\)

## 3 Stoichiometry (MOLE RATIO)

In a chemical equation, a specific amount of reactants will react with each other to form a specific amount of product(s). This value is "fixed" for every balanced chemical equation.

From the "fixed" value of the chemical equation, we can obtain the mole ratio of the chemical reaction or stoichiometry.

\begin{tabular}{|p{113.8pt}|p{113.8pt}|} \hline
**Example 1:** & **Example 2:** \\ The chemical equation is & The chemical equation is \\ Fe + 2HCl & FeCl\({}_{2}\) + H\({}_{2}\) & Co(OH)\({}_{2}\) + 2HCl \\ The corresponding mole ratio is & The corresponding mole ratio is \\ 1 : 2 : 1 : 1 & 1 : 2 : 1 : 2 \\ Fe + 2HCl & FeCl\({}_{2}\) + H\({}_{2}\) & Co(OH)\({}_{2}\) + 2HCl \\ \hline
**Example 3:** & **Example 4:** \\ The chemical equation is & The chemical equation is \\ N\({}_{2}\) + 2H\({}_{2}\) & 2NH\({}_{3}\) & CH\({}_{4}\) + 2O\({}_{2}\) + CO\({}_{2}\) + 2H\({}_{2}\)O \\ The corresponding mole ratio is & The corresponding mole ratio is \\ 1 : 2 : 3 & 1 : 2 : 1 : 2 \\ N\({}_{2}\) + 2H\({}_{2}\) & 2NH\({}_{3}\) & CH\({}_{4}\) + 2O\({}_{2}\) + CO\({}_{2}\) + 2H\({}_{2}\)O \\ \hline \end{tabular}

Hence from the chemical equation, we can use the mole ratio (stoichiometry) to determine:

(a) No. of moles of products / reactants

(b) Mass of products / reactants

(c) Volume of gas formed / used

## Applications

Fe + 2HCl FeCl\({}_{2}\) + H\({}_{2}\)

Calculate:

(a) the no. of moles of HCl reacted

(b) vol of gas produced

(c) mass of salt formed

From the chemical equation, the mole ratio is

1 : 2 : 1 : 1

Fe + 2HCl FeCl\({}_{2}\) + H\({}_{2}\)

[1.5cm] (a) No. of moles of Fe = mass / Mr Fe = 1.4 / 56 = 0.025 mol Fe

Using mole ratio,

1 mole Fe : 2 mol of HCl

Hence,

0.025 mol Fe : 2 x 0.025 mol HCl

**No. of mol HCl reacted = 0.05 mol**

(b) No. of moles of Fe = 0.025 mol - From (a)

Using mole ratio,

1 mole Fe : 1 mol of H\({}_{2}\)

Hence,

0.025 mol Fe : 0.025 mol H\({}_{2}\)

**Vol H\({}_{2}\) = mol x 24 dm\({}^{3}\) = 0.025 x 24 = 0.6 dm\({}^{3}\)**

(c) No. of moles of Fe = 0.025 mol - From (a)

Using mole ratio,

1 mole Fe : 1 mol of FeCl\({}_{2}\)

Hence,

0.025 mol Fe : 0.025 mol FeCl\({}_{2}\)

**Mass of FeCl\({}_{2}\) = mol x Mr FeCl\({}_{2}\) = 0.025 x (56 + 35.5 + 35.5) = 3.175 q**

**Example 2:**

\(\text{SiII}\)

**No. of mol NaOH reacted = 0.6 mol**

(b) No. of moles of \(\text{CuSO}_{4}=0.3\) mol - From (a)

Using mole ratio,

\(1\) mole \(\text{CuSO}_{4}:1\) mol of \(\text{Cu(OH)}_{2}\)

Hence,

\(0.3\) mole \(\text{CuSO}_{4}:0.3\) mol of \(\text{Cu(OH)}_{2}\)

**Mass of \(\text{Cu(OH)}_{2}\) = mol x Mr \(\text{Cu(OH)}_{2}\) = 0.3 x (64 + 2(16+1)) = 29.4 q**

**Example 3:**

(a) No. of mol of O\({}_{2}\) produced = 0.6 / 24 = 0.025 mol O\({}_{2}\)

Using mole ratio,

\(1\) mole O\({}_{2}:1\) mol of Zn(NO\({}_{3})_{2}\)

Hence,

\(0.025\) mole O\({}_{2}:0.025\) mol of Zn(NO\({}_{3})_{2}\)

**Mass of Zn(NO\({}_{3})_{2}\)****reacted = mol x Mr Zn(NO\({}_{3})_{2}\)**

**= 0.025 x (65 + 14 +48) = 3.175q**

(b) No. of moles of O\({}_{2}\) = 0.025 mol - From (a)

Using mole ratio,

\(1\) mole O\({}_{2}:2\) mol of ZnO

Hence,

\(0.025\) mole O\({}_{2}:2\times 0.025\) mol of ZnO

**Mass of ZnO = mol x Mr ZnO = 0.05 x (65 + 16) = 4.0 q**

(c) No. of moles of O\({}_{2}\) = 0.025 mol - From (a)

Using mole ratio,

\(1\) mole O\({}_{2}:4\) mol of NO\({}_{2}\)

Hence,

\(0.025\) mole O\({}_{2}:4\times 0.025\) mol of NO\({}_{2}\)

**Vol of NO\({}_{2}\) = mol x 24 dm\({}^{3}\) = 0.1 x 24dm\({}^{3}\) = 2.4 q**

## 6 Concentration of Acids and Alkalis

A solution is a mixture which contain a solid (solute) dissolved in a liquid (solvent)

The concentration of a solution (usually acids/alkalis) is simply the amount of solute dissolved in the solvent.

Concentration can be expressed in 2 ways namely:

(a) **mol/dm\({}^{3}\)** or **mol** dm\({}^{3}\) (also known as molarity)

(b) **g/dm\({}^{3}\)** or **g** dm\({}^{3}\)

Note:

(a) represent the no. of moles of solute dissolve in a volume of solvent.

(b) represent the mass of solute dissolve in a volume of solvent.

**Example 1:**

Calculate the no. of mole of solute in

500 cm\({}^{3}\) of a 0.5 mol/dm\({}^{3}\) solution

From the concentration, 0.5 mol/dm\({}^{3}\)

1 dm\({}^{3}\) contains 0.5 mol solute

1 000 dm\({}^{3}\) contains 0.5 mol solute

Hence

1 cm\({}^{3}\) contains 0.5/1000 mol solute

0.25 dm dm\({}^{3}\) contains 2 x 0.25 mol solute

Hence,

= 0.5 mol solute

From the concentration, 0.5 mol/dm\({}^{3}\)

From the concentration, 1.25 mol/dm\({}^{3}\)

0.5 mol solute dissolved in 1 dm\({}^{3}\)

1.25 mol solute dissolved in 1000 cm\({}^{3}\)

1 mol solute dissolved in 1000/0.5 cm\({}^{3}\)

Hence,

0.2 mol solute dissolved in 1.5 mol solute dissolved in 1000/1.25 x 1.5

= 400 cm\({}^{3}\)

= 1.2 dm\({}^{3}\)

What is the concentration of hydrogen ions in 0.05 mol/dm\({}^{3}\) sulfuric acid, H\({}_{2}\)SO\({}_{4}\) in terms of:

(a) mol/dm\({}^{3}\)

(b) g/dm\({}^{3}\)

2 possible ways to solve:

[0.05 mol H\({}_{2}\)SO\({}_{4}\) contains] (b)Let the volume of sulfuric acid be 1 dm\({}^{3}\)

0.05 mol x 2 H\({}^{+}\) ions (dibasic acid) and

0.05 mol SO\({}_{4^{2}}\) ions] Thus,

Mool of H\({}_{2}\)SO\({}_{4}\) = 0.05 x 1dm = 0.05 mol

Thus,

0.05 mol H\({}_{2}\)SO\({}_{4}\) contains] Thus,

0.05 mol H\({}_{2}\)SO\({}_{4}\) contains] 0.05 mol SO\({}_{4^{2}}\) ions] 0.05 mol SO\({}_{4^{2}}\) ions] Hence,

Concentration of H\({}^{+}\) = mol/vol

= 0.05 mol/dm\({}^{3}\) Concentration of H\({}^{+}\) = mol/vol

= 0.05 mol/dm\({}^{3}\)

Since 0.05 mol H\({}_{2}\)SO\({}_{4}\) contains 0.05 mol x 2 H\({}^{+}\) ions (dibasic acid)

The mass of H\({}^{+}\) ions present = mol x Mr H+

= 0.1 x 1 [A\({}_{r}\) of H\({}^{+}\) is 1]

=0.1g

The concentration of H\({}^{+}\)(assuming volume of acid is 1dm\({}^{3}\)) = 0.1 /1 = 0.1 g/dm\({}^{3}\)
