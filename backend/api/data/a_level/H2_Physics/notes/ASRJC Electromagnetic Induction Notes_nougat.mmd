**Demonstrating Science Inquiry Skills**

In 1819, Hans Christian Oersted discovered that a magnetic compass experiences a force in the vicinity of an electric current. This was the first evidence of a relationship between electricity and magnetism. Because nature is often symmetric, it led scientists to suspect that magnetic fields could in turn produce electricity. Indeed, experiments conducted by Michael Faraday showed that a changing magnetic field could induce an electric current in a circuit. The results of the experiment led to what we know today as Faraday's law, the application of which led to the production of electrical energy in power generation plants throughout the world.

**Visualising Flux Linkage**

The amount of magnetic flux linkage can be visualised in terms of the number of \(B\) field lines passing through a coil.

For Fig. 17.4, coil moves from X to Y

Number of field lines _linking_ it increases from 3 to 5

Or the coil _cuts_ 2 lines in moving from X to Y.

supply. Which quantity is the same inside each coil?

A. Magnetic field B. Magnetic flux

C. Magnetic flux density D. Magnetic flux linkage

**B** **Laws of Electromagnetic Induction**

### **B.1 Faraday's Law**

Faraday determined through experiments that when the magnetic flux linking a circuit is changing, an induced e.m.f. is set up in the circuit.

Faraday's Law of Electromagnetic Induction states that the e.m.f. induced in a conductor is proportional to the rate of change of magnetic flux linkage (or rate of cutting of the flux).

For a coil of \(N\) turns, the induced e.m.f., \(E\propto\frac{d(N\phi)}{dt}\)

where the negative sign is a manifestation of _Lenz's Law_, which will be discussed in the following section.

The magnitude of \(E\) depends on how fast (the rate) the flux linkage changes.

Since \(E=-\frac{dN\phi}{dt}=-\frac{d}{dt}(NBA\cos\theta)\), \(E\) depends on

**Example 1**: The figure shows a rectangular conducting loop of resistance \(R\), width \(l\), and length \(b\) being pulled at constant speed \(\nu\) through a region of length \(d\) in which a uniform magnetic field \(B\) is produced by an electromagnet.

In this example, \(l\) = 40 mm, \(b\) = 10 cm, \(d\) = 15 cm, \(R\) = 1.6 \(\Omega\), \(B\) = 2.0 T, and \(\nu\) = 1.0 cm s\({}^{-1}\).

**(a)** Sketch the variation of magnetic flux \(\phi\) through the loop with time \(t\), where \(t\) = 0 is when the loop is about to enter the field.

**(b)** Sketch the variation of induced e.m.f. \(E\) with time \(t\).

## Appendix B.2 Lenz's Law

Lenz's Law states that the direction of the induced e.m.f. is such that it tends to produce effects to oppose the change causing it.

### B.2.1 Using Right Hand Grip Rule to determine Direction of Induced Current

In the figure below, a rectangular coil is pulled across a uniform magnetic field with the field lines perpendicular to the plane of the coil.

For this case, the induced current flowing in the coil can be determined using Right Hand Grip Rule.

As the coil experiences increasing amount of crosses (flux into page). By Lenz's Law, induced current in coil produces effects to try and maintain amount of crosses, i.e. produce dots (flux out of page) to cancel effect of increasing crosses. By Right Hand Grip Rule, the induced current flows anticlockwise.

### **Lenz's Law and the Principle of Conservation of Energy**

An e.m.f. is a source of electrical energy and that energy must have come from somewhere.

The e.m.f. produces effects which oppose the change.

Consequently, work has to be done to overcome this opposition and energy is conserved.

Consider the figure on the right.

When the magnet's North pole is moved towards the solenoid, a North pole is induced at end X of the coil

Positive work has to be done to move the magnet against the force of repulsion between the North pole of the magnet and the induced North pole at X.

The mechanical work done is converted to electrical energy of the current.

This is consistent with the principle of conservation of energy.

If Lenz's Law is not obeyed, i.e. if a pole is induced in the coil such that it reinforced the change causing it:

The moving magnet then experiences an attractive force.

No work needs to be done by the external agent in moving the magnet towards the coil.

The magnet accelerates and gains kinetic energy as it approaches the coil. This results in larger change in flux linkage and hence a larger induced current. The attractive force thus becomes stronger.

Energy of the system will continue to increase on its own accord - energy is created, violating the principle of conservation of energy.

Conclusion: the induced pole in the coil cannot reinforce the change causing it.

**Worked Example**

The metal ring is free to oscillate through the electromagnet when the switch is open. What happens when the switch is closed?

* As the ring approaches B, the magnetic flux linking the ring increases due to increases in magnetic flux density. By Faraday's Law, this increase in flux linkage causes e.m.f. to be induced in the ring giving rise to an induced current in the ring.
* By Lenz's Law, the induced current in the ring flows in a direction that will produce a flux to oppose the increase. This causes the ring to lose mechanical energy as it approaches B.
* As the ring passes from B to C, there is minimal change in the magnetic flux linkage (except at the ends). Hence, there is no significant loss in mechanical energy.
* As the ring leaves C, the decrease in flux linkage causes e.m.f. and current to be induced in the ring in the opposite direction from previously. This causes the ring to similarly lose mechanical energy as it leaves C.
* Since current is induced in the ring, it implies that part of the total mechanical energy of the ring is converted into electrical energy (and subsequently thermal energy) in the ring. The process continues until all the initial total mechanical energy of the ring decreases to zero, i.e. the ring comes to a rest.

Using Faraday's Law,

Area swept out by CD in 1 s, \(\Delta A=I\nu\)

Flux cut by CD in 1 s, \(\phi=B\Delta A=Bl\nu\)

Induced e.m.f. \(E\) across CD = rate of flux being cut = \(Bl\nu\)

Frip Rule has been introduced to determine

direction of induced current in a coil.

The direction of the induced e.m.f. can be determined by:

C.1 Fleming's Right Hand Rule (see Appendix 1 for microscopic explanation)

Fig. 17.6

The flux-cutting conductor CD shown in Fig. 17.5 acts like a source of e.m.f. which is capable of driving a current through an external circuit outside the field connected across its ends.

**ANDERSON SEARANGOON JUNIOR COLEGEG**

**PHYSICS 9749**

* Using Fleming's Right Hand Rule, a current will flow from C to D in the conductor.
* Important note: since the conductor CD functions like a source of e.m.f., D is at a higher potential than C.
* Note that the components of \(B\), \(l\) and \(\nu\) are perpendicular to one another, i.e. \(B\bot I\), \(B\bot\nu\) and \(I\bot\nu\).

**Check Your Understanding 4**

The figure shows four wire loops, with edge lengths of either \(L\) or \(2L\). All four loops will move through a region of uniform magnetic field \(B\) (directed out of the page) at the same constant velocity. Rank the four loops according to the maximum magnitude of the e.m.f. induced as they move through the field, greatest first.

**Worked Example**

**(Determination of current direction using both Right Hand Grip Rule and Fleming's Right Hand Rule)**

A rectangular coil PQRS is pulled with constant speed across a uniform magnetic field with the field lines perpendicular to the plane of the coil. In each of the positions (a) and (b), determine the direction of the induced current in the coil.

**Position (a)**

* Using Lenz's Law and Right Hand Grip Rule Since there is no change in flux through the coil as it moves to the right (same area exposed to constant \(B\) field), net e.m.f. is zero.
* Using Fleming's Right Hand Rule >> Sides PQ and RS do not cut the field lines, hence no e.m.f. is induced in them. >> Sides PS and QR cut across the field lines, so that equal and opposite e.m.f. is induced in them. (Q higher potential than R and P higher potential than S) The net e.m.f. in the coil is zero.

**Position (b)**

* Using Lenz's Law and Right Hand Grip Rule Since there is a decrease in flux through the coil as it moves to the right, the induced current flows clockwise to produce magnetic flux to prevent the decrease in flux into the page passing through the coil. (i.e. induced current produces magnetic field into the page)
* Using Fleming's Right Hand Rule >> Sides PQ and SR do not cut the field lines, hence no e.m.f. is induced in them. >> Side QR does not cut across any field line. Hence no e.m.f. is induced in it. >> Side PS cuts across the field lines. Hence an e.m.f. (such that induced current will flow from S to P with P at a higher potential) is induced in it. >> Since the coil is closed, a clockwise current flows in the loop.

* Consider a coil of \(N\) turns and area \(A\) rotating with uniform angular velocity \(o\) in a uniform magnetic field of flux density \(B\). At a certain instant, the normal to the plane of the coil make an angle \(o\) with the direction of the magnetic field as shown in Fig. 17.8(a).

An alternating current flows through a conducting coil which lies below the cooking surface.

The changing magnetic field produced in turn induces currents in the base of the conducting cooking pan.

The electrical energy dissipated due to these induced currents is converted into thermal energy to cook the food.

See Appendix 3 for further explanation.

**Fig. 17.10**

A conducting braking disc is fixed to the axle of the wheel.

Part of the braking disc is placed between the poles of an electromagnet.

As the disc rotates, every radial segment of the disc continuously cuts the magnetic flux, causing induced eddy currents within it.

These induced currents create a magnetic force which opposes the turning motion of the disc, and hence opposing the turning motion of the wheel too.

The extent of braking effect can be controlled by adjusting the magnitude of current via the brake pedal.

The pick-up on an electric guitar produces an electrical signal from the vibrations of the guitar strings. The pick-up consists of a small coil of insulated wire wound round a small cylindrical bar magnet as shown.

The strings of the guitar are made of steel. When a string vibrates, an electrical signal is generated between the terminals of the coil.

How it Works:The magnetic field of the magnet produces a north and south pole in the section of the steel string just above the magnet. That section then has its own magnetic field. When the string is plucked and thus made to oscillate, its motion relative to the coil changes the flux linkage through the coil, this would cause an emft to be induced in the coil.

Amplification of signal:The electrical signal which is generated must be amplified before connection to a loudspeaker. This is because the magnetic field due to the string is weak and the flux linking the coil is small. The rate of change of flux linkage is very small and so the magnitude of the induced e.m.f. will be very small. Hence the signal (the induced e.m.f.) must be amplified before connecting to a loudspeaker.

The movement of the electrons results in an accumulation of negative charges at one end (bottom) and positive charges at the other end (upper). This produces an electric field \(E\) along the rod, which resists the downward migration of the electrons.

The electrons will stop piling up when the forces on each electron due to the E-field and B-field are balanced (i.e. \(F_{B}=F_{E}\)). An e.m.f. \(E\) is eventually induced between the ends of the conductor. This can also be used to explain Hall effect.

**Example 2**: When the N-pole of the magnet is moved towards the coil, the magnetic flux density experienced by the coil increases, causing the magnetic flux linking the coil to increase.

\(\bullet\) By Faraday's Law, this increase in flux linkage causes e.m.f. to be induced in the coil giving rise to an induced current in the coil.

\(\bullet\) By Lenz's Law, the induced current flows from left to fight through galvanometer (i.e. a deflection) to produce a flux to oppose the effect of this increase in flux linkage.
