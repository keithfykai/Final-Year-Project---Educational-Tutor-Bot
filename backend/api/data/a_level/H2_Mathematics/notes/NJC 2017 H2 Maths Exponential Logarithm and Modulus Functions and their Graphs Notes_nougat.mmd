## 1 Exponential Functions

**Definition 1.0.1** (Exponential Function):

A function \(y=a^{x},\;\;a>0,\;a\neq 1\), is known as an **exponential function**. It is a function used to model a relationship for which a constant increase in the independent variable (here denoted by \(x\)) gives the same proportional change in the dependent variable (here denoted by \(y\)).

The most common exponential function is \(y=\mathrm{e}^{x}\).

**Definition 2.0.1** (Logarithmic Function): A function of the form \(y=\log_{a}x\), where \(a\in\mathbb{R}\), \(a>0\), \(a\neq 1\) and \(x>0\).

\(\log_{a}x\) is read as 'the logarithm of \(x\) to base \(a\)' or more simply, '\(\log\), base \(a\), \(x\)'.

**Of special importance will be those with base e, i.e. those of the form \(y=\log_{a}x=\ln x\).**

_WONDER_

What are some practical uses for logarithmic functions?

### Laws of Logarithms

\[\text{If }\ a,b,c,x,y\in\mathbb{R}^{+}\text{ and }\ r\in\mathbb{R},\] (i) \[\log_{a}xy=\log_{a}x+\log_{a}y\] (ii) \[\log_{a}\left(\frac{x}{y}\right)=\log_{a}x-\log_{a}y\] (iii) \[\log_{a}x^{\prime}=r\log_{a}x\] (iv) \[\log_{a}b=\frac{\log_{c}b}{\log_{c}a}\] (v) \[\log_{a}a=1\Leftrightarrow a^{1}=a\] (vi) \[\log_{a}1=0\Leftrightarrow a^{0}=1\]

Take note that (i) is _not_ equivalent to saying \(\log_{a}(x+y)=\log_{a}x+\log_{a}y\),

\[\text{In fact, }\log_{a}(x+y)\neq\log_{a}x+\log_{a}y\.\]

## Exercise 3

Simplify and express the each of the following as a single logarithm.

(a) \(2\log_{x}5-3\log_{x}2+\log_{x}4\) (b) \(2\lg\left(x+2\right)+\lg\left(x+1\right)-\lg\left(x^{2}+3x+2\right)\)(c) \(3-2\lg 5\) (d) \(3\log_{a}2-4+\log_{a}a^{3}\)

(a) \(2\log_{x}5-3\log_{x}2+\log_{x}4=\log_{x}\left(\frac{25}{8}\times 4\right)=\log_{x} \left(\frac{25}{2}\right)\)(b) \(3-2\lg 5=3\lg 10-\lg 25=\lg\frac{10^{3}}{25}=\lg\frac{1000}{25}=\lg 40\)(d)

**Exercise 4**: Identify the key features of the graphs of the following logarithmic functions and sketch them:

\begin{tabular}{c c c} (a) & \(y=\ln\left(2x+1\right)\) & (b) & \(y=2\ln\left(-x+1\right)\) \\ (c) & \(y=\log_{2}\left(x+1\right)\) & (d) & \(y=-\ln\left(2x+3\right)+1\) \\ \end{tabular}

**Definition 3.0.1** (Modulus Function): The **absolute value** or **modulus** of a real number \(x\) is denoted by \(\big{|}x\big{|}\). Formally,

\[\big{|}x\big{|}=\begin{cases}x,&x\geq 0\\ -x,&x<0\end{cases}\]

_UNDERSTAND_

What are some alternative interpretations of the modulus function?

_WONDER_

The modulus function is an example of a piece-wise function. Can you think of any other piece-wise functions?

### Properties of the Modulus Function

For all \(x,y\in\mathbb{R}\),

(i) \(\big{|}x\big{|}\geq 0\),

(ii) \(\big{|}xy\big{|}=\big{|}x\big{|}y\big{|}\). Hence,

(a) \(\big{|}-x\big{|}=-1\big{|}\big{|}x\big{|}=\big{|}x\big{|}\)

(b) \(\big{|}x^{n}\big{|}=\underbrace{\big{|}x\cdot x\cdot\cdot x\cdot\big{|}}_{n\text { times}}=\underbrace{\big{|}x\cdot\big{|}x\big{|}\cdots\big{|}x\big{|}=\big{|}x \big{|}^{n}}_{n\text{ times}}\) for any positive integer \(n\),

(iii) \(\big{|}x\big{|}=\big{|}y\big{|}\Leftrightarrow x=y\) or \(x=-y\)

(iv) For a general function \(\mathrm{f}(x)\), \(\big{|}\mathrm{f}(x)\big{|}=\begin{cases}\mathrm{f}(x)&\text{if}&\mathrm{f}(x )\geq 0\\ -\mathrm{f}(x)&\text{if}&\mathrm{f}(x)<0\end{cases}\)

_CHECK_

Is the following correct? \(\big{|}\mathrm{f}(x)\big{|}=\begin{cases}\mathrm{f}(x)&\text{if}&x\geq 0\\ -\mathrm{f}(x)&\text{if}&x<0\end{cases}\)

In general, \(\big{|}x\big{|}=k\Rightarrow x=k\), or \(x=-k\), where \(k\geq 0\), and \(\big{|}\big{|}a\big{|}=\big{|}b\big{|}\Rightarrow a=b\) or \(a=-b\).

_EXPLORE_

How can we apply the definition of the modulus function to solve inequalities involving the modulus function?

**Exercise 5**

Solve the following equations.

(a) \(|x-6|=7\) (b) \(|x^{2}-5x-1|=5\) (c) \(|x^{2}-5x+1|=-5\)

_Solution:_

(a) \(|x-6|=7\) \(\Rightarrow\) \(x-6=7\) or \(x-6=-7\)

\(\therefore\) \(x=13\) or \(x=-1\)
