Progressive Waves

Wave

* is a propagation of a disturbance which transfers energy from one point in space to another without the physical transfer of matter.
* the source of any wave is a vibration or an oscillation.

Progressive Wave

a.k.a. travelling wave

* a wave which results in a net transfer of energy from one place to another.
* energy is transferred from the source outwards, along the direction of propagation of the wave

Stationary Wave

a.k.a. standing wave

* has a waveform that does not move.
* it is formed from superposition of two similar progressive waves travelling in opposite directions.

## Types of Waves

Waves can be classified in different ways according to

1. Mechanical or Non-mechanical

2. Transverse or Longitudinal

**Mechanical**

* requires a medium for their propagation.

e.g., water or sound waves

**Non-mechanical**

* does not require a medium for their propagation.

e.g., electromagnetic, gravitational, and quantum mechanical waves

## Types of Waves

Waves can be classified in different ways according to

1. Mechanical or Non-mechanical

2. Transverse or Longitudinal

**Transverse**

**has a direction of oscillation perpendicular to its direction of propagation.**

**e.g., waves on a rope, electromagnetic waves**

**Longitudinal**

**has a direction of oscillation parallel to its direction of propagation.**

**e.g, slinky spring and sound waves**

**wave*** Position of an oscillating particle from its equilibrium position

* The maximum distance (magnitude of displacement) of an oscillating particle from its equilibrium position

* For a progressive wave, it is the distance between any two successive particles that are in phase. (e.g. the distance between 2 adjacent maximum displacements)* Time taken for a particle to undergo one complete cycle of oscillation
* Time for the wave to travel through one wavelength.

* Is the number of complete cycle performed by a particle per unit time
* Number of wavelengths that pass a given point per unit time.

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:8]

**Note**

1. In order to compare phase or finding phase difference, **amplitudes** of oscillating particles need not be the **same** but they must have the same **frequency** and **wavelength**
2. Two particles or two waves are said to be in phase when their \(\Delta\phi=0\). \(\bullet\)Waves that are \(\overline{\overline{\alpha}}\) apart (where \(n\) is a positive integer) are also **in phase**, e.g. \(\lambda\), \(2\lambda\), \(3\lambda\), etc.
3. Two particles or two waves are said to be in **anti-phase** when their \(\Delta\phi=\)\(\pi\) radian. \(\bullet\)Waves that are \(\left(n\equiv\frac{1}{2}\right)\overline{\pi}\) apart (where \(n\) is a positive integer) are also **exactly out of phase**, e.g. \(\lambda\)/2, \(3\lambda\)/2, \(5\lambda\)/2, etc.

* [leftmargin=*]
* **Longitudinal Waves**
* is a wave in which its particles oscillate **parallel** to its direction of propagation.
* **e.g, slinky spring and sound waves**
* **Compression occurs where the air molecules are closest together.**
* **Rarefaction occurs where the air molecules are furthest apart from each other.**
* **The distance between successive compressions or successive rarefactions is equal to the wavelength.**
* **The compressions and rarefactions occur at points of zero displacement.**Displacement-distance graph of transverse and longitudinal wave

The displacement-distance graph shows how the displacements of the particles (from their individual equilibrium position) vary with the distance from the source at **a particular instant in time.**

* For transverse waves, this is similar to a snapshot of the actual wave travelling through the medium.
* For longitudinal waves, however, unlike transverse waves, the displacement-distance graph is not a snapshot of the actual wave travelling through the medium and has to be found by finding the displacement of individual particles.

## Appendix A Energy and Intensity of Waves

### Spherical Waves

* waves coming from a point source have spherical wavefronts
* Surface area: \(=4\pi r^{2}\)* [15] A person is initially 5.0 m from a point source which emits energy uniformly in all directions at a constant rate. If the power of the source is to be doubled but the sound is to be as loud as before, at what distance should the person be from the source?
* [16] Preamble 7
* [17] Suppose a loudspeaker operating at 35 W is producing sound waves in all directions. Calculate the following:
* [18] a) the intensity of sound at a distance of 12 m away
* [19] b) the power received by a square microphone of length 4.0 cm placed at a distance 8.0 m away from the loudspeaker
* [20] c) the amplitude of the vibrations at 8.0 m, given that at 4.0 m, the amplitude of the vibrations is 3.0 cm.
* is a phenomenon whereby the oscillation of transverse waves are restricted to a single plane.
* does not apply to longitudinal waves

* is a phenomenon whereby the oscillation of transverse waves are restricted to a single plane.

* does not apply to longitudinal wavesthe transmitted wave through polarizer A is said to be **plane-polarised** or polarized in the vertical plane. This vertically polarized wave is able to pass through polariser B and the polarizer B has the same transmission (polarization axis) as polariser A.

* Polaroiod used in sunglasses to reduce glare
* 3D glasses used to watch 3D movies
* Reduction of haziness of pictures* states that the intensity of a beam of plane-polarised light after passing through a polariser varies with the square of the cosine of the angle through which the polariser is rotated from the position that gives maximum intensity.

When polarised visible light is now incident on a second polariser (usually called an analyser) placed with its polarising axis at an angle \(\theta\) to the polarising axis of the first polariser, only the electric field component parallel to the polarising axis of the analyser will be transmitted, while the component perpendicular to the polarising axis will be absorbed by analyser.

Determination of frequency and wavelength of sound waves

* As discussed earlier, soundwaves produce regions of compressions and rarefactions as they travel trough air. This gives rise to pressure variations as the wave travels.
* Hence, by placing a microphone in front of a loudspeaker connected to a signal generator, the microphone will detect a continuous series of compressions and rarefactions over time.
* If the microphone is connected to a cathode ray (CRO), the CRO will be able to display a variation of the pressure experienced by the microphone with respect to time.A

Figure 1: The microphone with respect to time.A

Determination of frequency and wavelength of sound waves

When a signal is viewed on the CRO display, the period of the signal can be measured by counting the number of horizontal divisions a complete waveform covers and multiplying it by the scale of each division. This is known as the **time base.**

An interpretation of a CRO signal is shown below

The horizontal distance from peak to peak (1 wave) is 8 divisions. As time-base is set to 50 ms/div, the period, \(T\), is therefore \(T=8\times 50=400\;ms\)

Using frequency, \(f=\frac{1}{T}\)

\[f=\frac{1}{400\times 10^{-3}}=2.5\;Hz\]Preatee Example to
