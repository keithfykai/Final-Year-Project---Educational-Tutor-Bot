RELATIONSHIP OF GAS

**Pressure.s-Temperature**

For a fixed mass of gas at constant volume, when temperature is higher, thermal energy is transferred to the molecules and gaseous particles move faster.

This increases both the frequency of collision against the wall and the force exerted by each gaseous particle.

Pressure will hence increase.

## RELATIONSHIP OF GAS

If pressure is constant, an increase in temperature would increase the volume of the container.

When temperature is higher, thermal energy is transferred to the molecules and gaseous particles move faster.

This increases both the frequency of collision against the wall and the force exerted by each gaseous particle.

### Pressure will hence increase.

In order to reduce the frequency of collision in order to maintain a constant pressure, volume will increase to reduce the number of particles per unit volume and hence reducing the number of collisions, which helps to maintain pressure at constant value.
