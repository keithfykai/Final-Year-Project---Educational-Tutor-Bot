## 1 Introduction

This chapter is about recognising the different kinds of forces at work in different situations and knowing the characteristics of the forces. This is important whenever one is interested in explaining the motion of objects, which is the focus of the chapter on Dynamics. Understanding the forces at work is also important in calculating work done for a given situation.

## 2 Elastic Force

Most objects, e.g. a spring or a rubber block, when stretched or compressed, will exert a force opposite in direction to that applied on the object.

The force exerted by the object on the external agent is an _elastic_ force. In Fig. 2.1, the elastic force is also sometimes called _tensile_ force or _tension_.

When the elastic force is proportional to the distance extended or compressed, the object is said to _obey Hooke's law_. Hooke's law states that

\[\boxed{\bar{F}=-k\ddot{\alpha}\;\;\;\text{or}\;\;\;F=k\alpha\;(\text{ magnitudes})}\]

where \(k\) is a positive constant and the negative sign indicates that the elastic force is opposite to the direction of displacement. Though called a 'law', Hooke's law is not universal or always obeyed. There are many objects or materials which do not obey Hooke's law at all or may obey it for a limited range of \(x\) only.

\(k\) is known as the _constant of proportionality_ or in the case of a spring, also called the _spring constant_. Note that \(k\) is constant only as long as the _dimensions_ and _material_ of the object are not changed. For a given \(x\), the larger the value of \(k\), the larger the elastic force and hence the larger the external force needed to cause the displacement \(x\). Therefore \(k\) is also called the _stiffness_.

Newton's Third Law

Note that in Fig. 2.1 the force exerted by _hand on spring_ is equal in magnitude but opposite in direction to the force exerted by _spring on hand_. This is reflected by the arrows of equal length but opposite directions. In fact, Newton's third law states:

\[\boxed{\text{When body A exerts a force on body B, body B must exert an equal but opposite force on body A. Newton's third law implies that forces always occur in pairs

All forces exist in such equal and opposite pairs or action-reaction pairs.

Figure 2.1: Fig. 2.2: Fig. 2.2: Fig. 2.3: Fig. 2.3: Fig. 2.4: Fig. 2.5: Fig. 2.6: Fig. 2.7: Fig. 2.8: Fig. 2.9: Fig. 2.1: Fig. 2.1: Fig. 2.1: Fig. 2.2: Fig. 2.2: Fig. 2.3: Fig. 2.4: Fig. 2.5: Fig. 2.6: Fig. 2.7: Fig. 2.8: Fig. 2.9: Fig. 2.1: Fig. 2.2: Fig. 2.1: Fig. 2.2: Fig. 2.2: Fig. 2.3: Fig. 2.4In Fig. 2.1, if we focus our attention on a middle segment of the spring as shown, would the elastic forces exerted by this segment on the neighbouring segments be the same or smaller than the elastic forces on the hands that pulled the spring? Unlike Hooke's law, Newton's third law is universal. As shown in Fig. 2.5, while the middle segment **B** exerts elastic forces on the neighbouring segments **A** and **C**, the neighbouring segments also exert equal but opposite elastic forces on the middle segment. Hence, the elastic forces(magnitude) exerted by the whole spring on the external agent and by any segment on neighbouring segments are the same. This situation is frequently described as 'the tension in a spring is the same at every point'. Strictly speaking, the tension is only the same everywhere in the spring if it is not accelerated or its mass is negligible. So, assuming massless springs, when different springs of different spring constants are connected together and pulled at both ends as shown, the tensions(magnitude 7) between the springs and inside them will be the same.

However their extensions will be different unless they are totally identical springs. In the same way, ropes which are pulled will have the same tension throughout. Potential Energy In general, potential energy (PE) can be stored in a system with (a) at least two bodies which (b) exert forces - on each other - that depend only on their positions. In the case of a stretched spring, energy is stored in the spring as can be seen when two masses are attached to the ends of the spring and released. The two masses will be accelerated towards one another gaining kinetic energy (KE) while the elastic PE (EPE) gets converted to KE. What if the stretched spring is released without any masses attached? In this case, the PE is converted to KE of the various spring segments and perhaps some sound energy when neighbouring coils knock into each other upon release. Another type of PE you already know is the gravitational PE. When a ball is lifted higher from the ground and thus further from the Earth, PE is stored between Earth and the ball. When the ball is released, the mutual attraction between the Earth and ball will accelerate them towards one another. However due to the large mass of the Earth, it hardly moves while the ball moves much more easily and gets practically all the KE that comes from the stored PE.

Figure 2.5:

Figure 2.6:

F-e & F-L graphs

For different forces \(F_{A}\) applied to pull a spring, it is found that the spring will settle at different final lengths. If the spring obeys Hooke's law, then the graph of applied force \(F_{A}\) versus _extension_\(e\) will look as shown in Fig. 2.8a while the graph of \(F_{A}\) versus _length_ of spring is as shown in Fig. 2.8b.

### How Does EPE Get Stored?

Since energy cannot be created but only transferred from one body to another or converted from one form to another, where does the elastic PE come from? It will be learnt that _work done_ by a force is equal to the energy transferred or converted from one form to another form. When a person exerts a force to extend a spring, the person uses chemical energy to do the work which gets stored inside the spring as elastic PE.

Work done is calculated by the product of force and the displacement in the direction of the force. In the case of a spring being stretched, the force needed to stretch the first mm and the force needed to stretch the second mm are different. As the extension increases, the force needed also increases, so how do we find the work done?

Consider the work done in increasing the length by \(s\). The applied force varies from \(F_{t}\) to \(F_{2}\). \(F_{t}\)s is the area of the shaded rectangle as shown in Fig.2.9a. This area represents the work done by \(F_{t}\) over a distance \(s\). Since the force is actually not constant, we can always line up a series of very narrow rectangles within the distance \(s\) such that the total area of the rectangles would effectively be the total work done over \(s\). Thus for any _F_-e plot; whether straight line or curve; the area under the plot represents the work done. This work done is equal to the _increase_ in EPE over \(s\).

Friction in Action

Friction is often thought of as impeding motion, but it is frequently needed for motion. Let's look at a'rear wheel drive' car that is initially at rest in Fig. 3.4. When the rear wheel is driven by the engine, '\(F_{R}\) on road' is exerted by the rear wheel on the road. In accordance with Newton's third law, an equal but opposite reaction force '\(F_{R}\) on car' acts on the wheel. The forward push of '\(F_{R}\) on car' causes the car and front wheel to move forward, but the static friction on the front wheel '\(F_{F}\) on car' prevents the wheel from sliding, causing it to rotate about its axle instead.

When there is no skidding or sliding, the friction forces shown in Fig. 3.4 are all static friction.

The net forward force enables the car to accelerate.

If the car is rolling along the road and the wheels are disengaged from the engine, then the situation is as shown in Fig. 3.5.

If the car is moving very fast when the brakes are used to jam all the wheels, thereby preventing them from rotating about their axles, the car will skid on the road surface as shown in Fig. 3.6.

Now, all the friction forces are sliding friction forces. The resultant backward force causes car to decelerate.

If the stationary car were on some icy surface with no friction and the rear wheels are driven, then the situation will be as shown in Fig. 3.7

### Viscous Force & Drag

_Viscous force_ is the resistive force between two fluid layers or between a fluid and a solid surface when they slide past each other. The higher the viscosity or relative speed of the layers, the greater the viscous force.

Figure 3.7:

Figure 3.4: car car car

Figure 3.5:

Figure 3.8:

_Drag_ is a force exerted by a fluid(liquid or gas) that opposes the motion of an object through the fluid. In air, the drag is also called _air resistance_. A number of components contribute to the drag force, including viscous force and the force due to turbulent fluid flow.

Drag is a force exerted by a fluid that opposes the motion of an object through the fluid. In air, the drag is also called _air resistance_. A number of components contribute to the drag force, including viscous force and the force due to turbulent fluid flow.

Drag is overall determined by factors such as fluid viscosity, shape and size of object and speed of object. In general at lower speeds, the drag force varies as \(\nu\) while at higher speeds it varies as \(\nu^{2}\).

## 4 Contact Force

Normal Contact Force

Here, 'normal' means perpendicular. Normal contact force arises from contact between two solid surfaces and it acts perpendicular to the surface.

For a ladder leaning against the wall, there will be friction forces and normal contact forces acting at its two ends. Friction \(F_{R}\) is also a contact force and it is sometimes combined with normal contact \(N\) force to give the overall contact force \(R\) as shown in Fig. 4.2. The direction of \(F_{R}\) is to the right because the tendency of the ladder is to slide to the left.

When an aerofoil shape wing cuts through a gas or liquid, it generates a lift force that is perpendicular to the wing's velocity. The wing forces the fluid downwards with the help of the aerofoil shape and the angle of the wings. The fluid in turn exerts an upward force on the wings in accordance with Newton's third law. The lift need not be vertically upwards if the aircraft is climbing or even upside down.

## 6 Upthrust

Pressure Difference due to Weight

Due to gravitational pull, a fluid column as shown in Fig. 6.1 exerts a force on the area \(A\).

Pressure = Force/Area

= weight/Area

= volume \(\times\) density \(\times\)\(g\)/_A_

= (_A_H_) \(\times\)\(\rho\)\(\times\)\(g\)/_A_

= \(\rho gh\)

Upthrust Due to Pressure Difference

When an object such as a rectangular box is immersed in water of density \(\rho_{m}\), the pressure on

top surface \(P_{T}\) = \(P_{am}\) + \(\rho_{n}gh_{T}\)

bottom surface \(P_{B}\) = \(P_{am}\) + \(\rho_{n}gh_{B}\)

Since \(P_{B}\) > \(P_{T}\), net upward force on the box \(=\)\((P_{B}\) - \(P_{T})\)_A_

= \(\rho_{n}g(P_{B}\) - \(\eta_{T})\)_A_

= \(\rho_{n}gV_{box}\)

where \(V_{box}\) is the volume of the box.

In both cases above, the upward force is called _upthrust_ and is equal to the weight of water displaced by box. The pressures on the four vertical surfaces can be ignored as they lead to forces which cancel. It can also be shown that for any _irregular_ body, the upthrust is still given by the weight of displaced fluid. This general result is called Archimedes' principle:

Upthrust is equal to the weight of the fluid displaced.

## 7 Electric Force (Will be covered under the chapter Electric Field)

For now, the focus will be on some basics. An _electric field_ is a human construct to demystify the fact that a charge can exert a force on another charge without touching.

An electric field is a region of space in which a charge

an electric force.

Electric _field lines_ are used to indicate the _direction_ and _strength_ of the field - the closer the lines, the stronger the field. Fig. 7.1 & 7.2 show the strength decreasing with distance from each charge.

Figure 7.1:

Figure 6.2:In Fig. 7.3 a larger amount of charge produces a stronger field around it compared to that in Fig. 7.1

With the field concept, we then say that a charge placed in an electric field experiences a force because it interacts with the field. When two charges are placed near to one another, each charge interacts with the field of the other charge and thus they exert forces on each other. This pair of forces is a Newton's 3\({}^{d}\) law pair.

Also, in Fig. 7.4, the larger the amount of charge found in a field, the stronger the electric force \(F_{E}\) experienced by it.

For a charge \(q\) experiencing an electric field strength of \(E\), the electric force \(F_{E}=qE\).

## 8 Magnetic Force (Will be covered under the chapter Electromagnetism)

A magnetic field is a region of space in which a magnetic pole or current experiences a magnetic force.

Magnetic field can be produced by a magnet or current. A straight wire carrying current would produce a magnetic field as shown in Fig. 8.2. A coil of wires carrying current as shown in Fig. 8.3 would produce a magnetic field similar to that of a magnet as shown in Fig. 8.1.

## 9 Gravitational Force (Will be covered under the chapter Gravitation)

A gravitational field is a region of space in which a mass experiences a field is a region of space in which a mass experiences a gravitational force.

A mass produces a field around it just like charges. However, there is only one type of mass and the field direction is always towards the mass.

When two masses are placed near to one another, each mass interacts with the field of the other mass and thus they exert gravitational forces on each other. This pair of forces is a Newton's 3\({}^{d}\) law or action-reaction pair.

## 12 Equilibrium

As mentioned in the Introduction, being able to recognise the forces acting on a system is of utmost importance. After all, it is the forces which determine the type of motion or the lack of motion and they also determine the energy transfers via work done. Much more about the relationship between forces, motion and energy will be covered in the chapters Dynamics, Work Energy Power, Circular Motion and Oscillation.

In this section, we are interested in objects that are in equilibrium. That means no _linear_ acceleration and _angular_ acceleration for the object. Linear acceleration is just \(\bar{\alpha}\!=\!\alpha\bar{V}/\alpha t\), the same acceleration encountered in Kinematics. Angular acceleration is the rate change of _angular velocity_. Angular velocity is the rate of change of _angular displacement_. Angular displacement is the angle in radians or degrees swept out by a body that is in circular motion.

Just as linear acceleration is caused by a net force, angular acceleration is caused by a net moment or torque. Therefore, the conditions for zero linear and angular acceleration are zero net force and net moment respectively.

Equilibrium

The two conditions/equations are useful when faced with a problem to find unknowns such as magnitude of a force, distance, angle or direction. Students who find it difficult to master the usage of the equations may refer to the following procedure which is adapted from a more general problem solving strategy:

1. Identify the system i.e. the object of focus or interest.
2. So that you can identify all the forces at work on the system.
3. Draw a diagram showing layout, known information, where the forces act and their directions.
4. Based on experience with the equations, decide which one you would use or perhaps you would use both. This decision can sometimes mean an easier path or much more tedious one to get the answer. Point is that you don't rush in but give some thought.
5. Execute the plan.

The examples below only show step 5.

Equitable - Using Net force =0

Given a block of weight \(W\) resting on a slope with angle \(\theta\). Find the normal contact force \(N\) and the friction \(F_{R}\).

Method 1 - Working with Components

(Step 1): Decide directions to resolve. Tip: resolve _one_ force \(W\) (\(\bot\) & _//_ to slope) instead of two forces \(N\) & \(F_{R}\) horizontally and vertically.

(Step 2): \(F_{net}\) = 0 **along slope** \(\therefore\)\(F_{R}\) = \(W\sin\theta\) (Ans) \(F_{net}\) = 0 **perpendicular to slope** \(\therefore\)\(N\) = \(W\cos\theta\) (Ans)

It is very important to be able to recognise forces on a system and their characteristics.

A system in equilibrium means it has no linear acceleration and angular acceleration.

A system is in equilibrium _if and only if_ both its net force and net moment are zero.
