Summary

### Structure and Properties of Materials

(A) Atoms and Molecules

* **Atoms** are the smallest particles of an element that have the chemical properties of that element.
* A molecule is a group of two or more atoms that are chemically combined (joined together).

(B) Elements

* An element is a pure substance that cannot be broken down into simpler substances by physical or chemical processes.

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|} \hline \multicolumn{3}{|c|}{metals} & \multicolumn{6}{|c|}{non-metals} \\ \hline
1 & 2 & 13 & 14 & 15 & 16 & 17 & 18 \\ \hline sodium & magnesium & aluminium & carbon & nitrogen & oxygen & fluorine & neon \\ \hline Na & Mg & AI & C & N\({}_{2}\) & O\({}_{2}\) & F\({}_{2}\) & Ne \\ \hline \end{tabular}

* Metals and some non-metals are _monoatomic._ e.g.: metals like sodium (Na), calcium (Ca), iron (Fe) non-metals like helium (He), neon (Ne), argon (Ar), xenon (Xe)
* However, most non-metals exist as molecules.
* _Diatomic_ molecules are molecules formed by the combination of two atoms. e.g.: hydrogen (H\({}_{2}\)), nitrogen (N\({}_{2}\)), oxygen (O\({}_{2}\)), fluorine (F\({}_{2}\)), chlorine (Cl\({}_{2}\)), bromine (Br\({}_{2}\)) and iodine (I\({}_{2}\))

(C) Compounds and Mixtures

* sodium chloride, NaCl; magnesium chloride, MgCl\({}_{2}\) e.g. covalent
- hydrogen chloride, HC\(I\); water, H\({}_{2}\)O; ammonia, NH\({}_{3}\); methane, CH\({}_{4}\), carbon dioxide, CO\({}_{2}\)
* A mixture is made up of two or more substances that are not chemically combined. e.g. seawater; air; crude oil; ink; alloy

#### How to construct ionic equations?

Steps:

Write a balanced chemical equation, including state symbols.

Re-write the equation in terms of ions for substances in the aqueous state.

[Leave substances in the solid / liquid / gaseous states alone.]

Cancel out the spectator ions.

Re-write the equation without the spectator ions.

For e.g.:

step 1 : Ba(NO\({}_{3}\))\({}_{2}\) (aq) + H\({}_{2}\)SO\({}_{4}\) (aq) \(\rightarrow\) BaSO\({}_{4}\) (s) + 2 HNO\({}_{3}\) (aq)

step 2 : Ba\({}^{2*}\)\(\bullet\) 2NO\({}_{3}\) (aq) + 2H\({}^{+}\)\(\bullet\) SO\({}_{4}\)\({}^{2}\) (aq) \(\rightarrow\) BaSO\({}_{4}\) (s) + 2H\({}^{+}\)\(\bullet\) 2NO\({}_{3}\)\({}^{*}\) (aq)

step 3 : Ba\({}^{2*}\)\(\bullet\) 2NO\({}_{3}\)\({}^{*}\) (aq) + 2H\({}^{+}\)\(\bullet\) SO\({}_{4}\)\({}^{2}\) (aq) \(\rightarrow\) BaSO\({}_{4}\) (s) + 2H\({}^{+}\)\(\bullet\) 2NO\({}_{3}\)\({}^{*}\) (aq)

step 4 : Ba\({}^{2*}\) (aq) + SO\({}_{4}\)\({}^{2}\) (aq) \(\rightarrow\) BaSO\({}_{4}\) (s)

### The Role Concept and stoichiometry

Some useful definitions to remember:

* The **relative atomic mass**, \(A_{\rm r}\) of an element is the average mass of one atom of the element compared to \(\frac{1}{12}\) the mass of a carbon-12 atom. Note: The \(A_{\rm r}\) of an element can be found in the Periodic Table. e.g.: \(A_{\rm r}\) of Mg = 24
* The **relative molecular mass**, \(M_{\rm r}\) of a substance (i.e. element, compound) is the average mass of one molecule of the substance compared to \(\frac{1}{12}\) the mass of a carbon-12 atom. Note: The relative molecular mass (and relative formula mass), \(M_{\rm r}\), can be calculated as the sum of relative atomic masses, \(A_{\rm r}\). e.g.: \(M_{\rm r}\) of fayalite, Fe\({}_{2}\)SiO\({}_{4}\) = 2(56) + 28 + 4(16) = 204
* One mole of any substance will always contain 6.02 x 10\({}^{23}\) particles (i.e. atoms, molecules, ions and even subatomic particles such as electrons) of that substance.

Some useful formulae to remember:

* Calculate the percentage mass of an element in a compound Percentage mass of an element X in a compound = (No. of atoms of element X)\(\times\)A\({}_{\rm r}\)\(\times\)100%
* Calculate the mass of an element in a compound No. of atoms of the element in the formula \(\times\)A\({}_{\rm r}\) of the element \(\times\)Mass of the sample \(M_{\rm r}\) of the compound Example 1: The relative atomic mass of nitrogen is 14 and the relative molecular mass of ammonium nitrate is 80. What is the percentage of nitrogen in ammonium nitrate? %N in NH\({}_{4}\)NO\({}_{3}\) = \(\frac{2(14)}{80}\) x 100 = \(\frac{35\%}{80}\) Example 2: What is the mass of iron that can be extracted from 116 g of Fe\({}_{3}\)O\({}_{4}\)? mass of iron = \(\frac{3(56)}{232}\) x 116 g = \(\frac{84.9}{80}\) 5

Department of SciencePARTERNS IN THE PERIODIC TABLE

### Periodic Trends

The elements are arranged in the Periodic Table in order of increasing proton (atomic) number.

A Period is the horizontal row of elements (i.e. Period 1, 2, 3, etc).

A Group is the vertical column of elements (i.e. Group 1, 2, 13, etc).

The position of an element in the Periodic Table is related to proton number and electronic structure.

The atoms of elements in the same period have the same number of electron shells.

The atoms of elements in the same group have the same number of outer (valence) electrons.

Be

Mg

Ca

The atoms of elements in Group 2 have two outer (valence) electrons.

The atoms of elements in the same group lose/gain the same number of outer (valence) electrons to form ions with the same ionic charge, achieving a stable electronic configuration.

The elements change from metals (left) to non-metals (right) across a period of the Periodic Table.

e.g.: metals - Groups 1, 2, 13 non-metals - Groups 14, 15, 16, 17, 18

### Group Properties

\begin{tabular}{|p{42.7pt}|p{142.3pt}|p{142.3pt}|} \hline  & \multicolumn{2}{|c|}{**Group 1 (the alkali metals)**} & \multicolumn{2}{|c|}{**Group 17 (the halogens)**} \\ \hline Physical & 1. The metals are shown: shiny solids. & 1. The elements exist as glatomic molecules. [simple covalent] \\ Properties & 2. The metals are soft and can be easily cut with a knife. & 2. The halogens have low melting and boiling points, which increases down the group. \\  & 3. The metals have a low density. & 3. The colour intensity of the halogens increases down the group. \\  & 5. The metals have a low melting point, which decreases down the group. & (i.e. the elements become darker down the group) \\  & \multicolGroup 18 (the noble gases)

The noble gases exist as monoatomic gases which have a stable electronic configuration.

Noble gases are chemically unreactive and hence are important in providing an inert atmosphere.

Except for helium, all members have eight electrons in their valence shell.

e.g.: He (2) Ne (2,8) Ar (2,8,8)

Uses: (a) helium : to fill balloons (b) neon : to fill light bulbs (c) argon : to fill light bulbs : used in the manufacture of steel

Examples:

1 How are the elements arranged in the Periodic Table?

Use the information in the table to give two pieces of evidence that suggest that the aldehydes are a homologous series.

All the aldehydes have the same general formula (i.e. C\_H\_H\_CHO) and the same functional group (i.e. CHO).

Example 2: Organic compounds are placed in an homologous series.

(a) Give two general properties of an homologous series.

Members of the same homologous series have the same general formula / same functional group and undergo similar chemical reactions.

(b) Write the general formula for the homologous series of alkanes. C\_H\_H\_2=2

(c) Name and write the chemical formula for the first member of the alkanes.

methane, CH.

Example 3: One characteristic of a homologous series is that properties show a trend.

Describe the trends you would expect for three properties of the alcohols as the molecules increase in size.

As the molecules increase in size, the melting point and boiling point increases. viscosity increases and flammability decreases.

Summary

### Polymers

* Methods of Recycling Plastics
* Method 1: Physical Method (Mechanical Recycling)
* Using this method, the chemical composition of the recycled plastic remains unchanged, i.e. if waste poly(ethene) bottles are collected, the recycled plastic products will still be made of poly(ethene).
* After pre-treatment, small pieces of plastics such as poly(ethene) are melted, cooled, pulled into long, thin strands, and cut into pellets. These pellets can then be made into new products.
* Method 2: Chemical Method
* The chemical method of recycling plastics converts plastic waste into different raw materials through chemical reactions such as cracking.
* Plastic waste, such as poly(ethene) waste, can undergo cracking to form short chains of alkanes and alkenes. The short-chain alkanes can be used as fuel, while the short-chain alkenes can be used to make other useful chemicals.
* Social, Economic and Environmental Issues of Recycling Plastics
* Different ways to minimise plastic waste: _reduce - reuse - recycle_
* Environmental issues of recycling plastics
* The recycling of plastics may cause environmental issues.
* For e.g.: If the wastewater containing harmful substances is not treated before it enters the oceans, lakes or rivers, it can cause water pollution.
* Economic issues of recycling plastics
* Recycling plastic waste can be expensive, costing much more than disposal in landfills or incineration.
* For e.g.: There is the cost of transporting the waste to the processing plant, cost of sorting and cleaning the waste, and carrying out either physical or chemical recycling processes, cost of manpower, machines and energy.
* It may not be worthwhile or economically viable to recycle plastics if the cost of recycling plastic waste is higher than the value of the recycled plastics.
* Social issues of recycling plastics
* In Singapore, many people find it more convenient to throw all their waste away. As a result, recyclable plastics are disposed of and are not recycled.
* Many people do not know the proper way to use the recycling bins. This will affect the recycling process of plastic waste.
* It is hard to get people to form new habits. Hence, time and effort are needed for communities to adopt recycling as a lifestyle.
