## 1 Introduction

**LOOKING BACK**

Topic 5 Chemical Energetics looked at energy changes of reactions, in terms of enthalpy, entropy and Gibbs' free energy. While the sign of \(\Delta\)G may indicate the direction of chemical change, it gives no information on how fast a reaction occurs. A thermodynamically spontaneous reaction (where \(\Delta\)G is negative) may be so slow that no significant reaction could be observed in our lifetime. The study of the rates of chemical reactions is called kinetics. The rate of reaction depends on a number of factors, each of which can be studied separately, and can only be determined by experiment.

**Kinetics, derived from the Greek word kivnuc (kinesi), means movement or the act of moving. Indeed, chemical reactions involve the movement, or rather, collisions between reactant particles.**

In the industry or everyday life, some reactions need to be fast, for example, those which goes inside your body when you take a pain reliever; while some reactions should be as slow as possible, like the crusting of iron in machinery and motor vehicles.

The study of kinetics may be divided into two areas:

(1) at the _macroscopic level_

- what reaction rate means

- how to determine the reaction rate and rate equation experimentally

- and how factors such as temperature, reactant concentration and the use of a catalyst influence rate

(2) at the _particulate level_

- which is **reaction mechanism** about

- the detailed pathway taken by atoms and/or molecules as a reaction proceeds

Studying kinetics helps chemists to select the best conditions to control the speed at which a reaction proceeds.

## 2 Collision theory and activation energy

### Collision theory

In order for a reaction to take place, reactant particles or molecules must:

**collide**,

**with sufficient energy to overcome the activation energy (E\({}_{a}\)),**

**in the correct orientation that can lead to rearrangement of the atoms.**

**effective collision.**

**Collisions which satisfy these conditions are said to be effective and they give the product particles. Otherwise, the colliding particles will simply "bounce off" each other without reaction.**

**At the molecular level, the rate of reaction depends on:**

**how often the reactant molecules collide with each another - the collision frequency, and**

**what proportion of the particles have sufficient energy to overcome the activation energy.**

### Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution curve

**For most chemical reactions, the activation energy is quite large and only a small fraction of colliding particles are well-oriented, and have that minimum energy to overcome the activation energy, The reactant particles in a gas of liquid undergo an enormous number of collisions per second with one another. If each collision were effective; all reactions would be over in an instantaneous explosion!**

**The particles in a sample have a range of energies. In order to estimate what fraction of collisions will have sufficient energy to overcome the activation energy barrier, we need to know how many particles in a sample have various different energies - in other words what their energy distribution is. This was first calculated by James Clerk Maxwell and Ludwig Boltzmann.**

**The Maxwell-Boltzmann energy distribution curve that results is shown below (refer to Topic 3 The "Gaseous State for explanation on the shape of the curve).**

**The total area under the graph represents the total number of particles present. The line E\({}_{a}\) is marked, showing an activation energy for a particular reaction. The shaded area represents the fraction of molecules that have kinetic energies greater than or equal to this E\({}_{a}\).**

Figure 1: The Maxwell-Boltzmann energy distribution curve.

### Molecular orientation

The figures below illustrate the importance of molecular orientation using the example:

\[\text{NO}_{2}Cl+Cl\to\text{NO}_{2}+Cl_{2}\]

where collision between a NO\({}_{2}\)Cl molecule and a Cl atom forms a NO\({}_{2}\) molecule and a Cl\({}_{2}\) molecule.

In a correctly oriented collision, contact occurs between the atoms that will become bonded in the product.

In a poorly oriented collision, the two colliding particles "bounce off" without any reaction.

### Activation energy and reaction profile diagrams

The concept of activation energy and reaction profile diagrams (or energy profile diagrams) have most likely been introduced to you in secondary school chemistry as they are part of the O-level syllabus. Note that the information presented here outlines the A-level treatment of these two concepts. Please read through to refresh your memory as your understanding of these concepts will be used in later sections.

Let's revisit the concept of activation energy, starting with a definition.

[style=]

_The activation energy of a reaction (E\({}_{d}\)) is the minimum energy which the reacting particles must possess in order to overcome the energy barrier before the formation of the products._

[style=]

Figure 20: A correctly oriented collision. The two reactant particles approach each other with sufficient energy and in the correct orientation such that the Cl-Cl bond can form while the N-Cl bond breaks.

Figure 20: A poorly oriented collision.

The following examples dramatically illustrate the presence of this energy barrier to a reaction:

* A mixture of methane and oxygen shows no sign of reaction at room temperature and pressure even though the reaction is highly exergonic (\(\Delta\)G,\({}^{\alpha}\) = -801 kJ mol\({}^{-1}\)). However, when a spark is introduced, the reaction occurs explosively.
* On the other hand, the reaction between hydrochloric acid and aqueous sodium hydroxide takes place practically instantaneously even though the reaction is only moderately exergonic (\(\Delta\)G,\({}^{\alpha}\) = -80 kJ mol\({}^{-1}\)).

Conclusion: \(\Delta\)G cannot be used to tell us about the rate of reaction because there is an activation energy barrier between the reactants and products that has to be overcome. The magnitude of the activation energy barrier does not depend on the magnitude of \(\Delta\)G. A thermodynamically spontaneous process will take place very slowly if the activation energy of the process is too high.

Some points to note:

* Reactions with low E\({}_{a}\) are fast because a large proportion of molecules have the necessary energy to overcome the energy barrier. (kinetically favourable)
* Reactions with high E\({}_{a}\) are slow because only a small proportion of molecules have the necessary energy to overcome the energy barrier. (kinetically unfavourable)
* Generally, reactions with high activation energy include:
* reactions between two neutral molecules or involve breaking strong covalent bonds
* reactions between ions of similar charge
* reactions where a bond breaks to form free radicals (which are usually highly unstable)
* Generally, reactions with low activation energy include:
* reactions between two free radicals
* reactions between ions of opposite charge
* acid-base (neutralisation) reactions

The changing energies of a reaction may be summed up in a reaction pathway diagram. This diagram traces the rise and fall of the total energies of the system as a reaction progresses. The enthalpy change of the reaction as well as the activation energy of a reaction is also reflected in such a diagram. For this reason, this diagram may also be referred to as an energy profile diagram or a reaction profile diagram or a reaction pathway diagram.

### The rate equation

Knowing _how_ the concentration of reactants affect the rate of a chemical reaction is a central part of kinetic study. We obtain this data experimentally and summarise it in the form of a rate equation, or rate law. The rate equation predicts how the concentration of reactants affect the rate of reaction.

Two key points to remember:

* The balancing coefficients \(a\), \(b\), etc... in the reaction equation are not necessarily related to the values of the orders \(m\), \(n\), etc...
* All the components of the rate equation (i.e. rate, \(k\), \(m\), \(n\), etc...) must be found experimentally.

### Understanding order of reaction

We first need to understand what is meant by _order of reaction_.

A reaction has both an _individual_ order with respect to each reactant in the chemical reaction, and an _overall_ order, which is the sum of each individual order.

Let's consider the simplest case - a reaction with only one reactant, **A**:

\[\alpha\textbf{A}\ \ \rightarrow\ \text{products}\]

In order to find the order with respect to **A**, we must carry out experiments to determine how the rate changes as the concentration of **A** is varied.

* _First order_. Suppose the rate doubles when **[A]** is doubled; This means that the rate depends on **[A]** raised to the first power, **[A]** or **[A]** (since we usually omit the power of 1). Thus, the reaction is first order with respect to **A**, and since **A** is the only reactant in the reaction, the overall order is also first order.

[FOOTNOTE:

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:13]

the rate equation is experimentally found to be:

\[\text{Rate}=k[\text{NO}]^{2}[\text{H}_{2}]\]

The reaction is thus second order with respect to NO and first order with respect to H\({}_{2}\), so it is third order overall (\(\because 2+1=3\)). Note that this example reinforces the fact that order of reaction cannot be deduced from the stoichiometry of the balanced equation, but must be determined from experimental data.

**Self-practice 4.1**

For the reaction between hydrogen peroxide and acidified iodide ions,

\[\text{H}_{2}\text{O}_{2}\left(\text{aq}\right)+3\text{I}^{-}\left(\text{aq} \right)+2\text{H}^{+}\left(\text{aq}\right)\text{ }\rightarrow\text{I}_{3}^{-}\left(\text{aq}\right)+2\text{H}_{2}\text{O} \left(I\right)\text{ }\]

the rate equation is experimentally found to be:

\[\text{Rate}=k[\text{H}_{2}\text{O}_{2}][\text{I}^{\text{T}}]\]

(a) State the order of reaction with respect to

\[\text{H}_{2}\text{O}_{2}\]

(b) State the overall order of reaction.

**Fractional or negative orders of reaction**

Although reaction orders are usually whole numbers or zero, they can also be fractional or negative.

For example, in the reaction

\[\text{CHC}\text{I}_{3}\left(\text{g}\right)+\text{C}\text{I}_{2}\left(\text{ g}\right)\text{ }\rightarrow\text{CC}\text{I}_{4}\left(\text{g}\right)+\text{HCI}\left(\text{ g}\right)\]

the rate equation is experimentally found to be:

\[\text{Rate}=k[\text{CHC}\text{I}_{3}][\text{C}\text{I}_{2}]^{1/2}\]

This would mean that if, for example,[\(\text{C}\text{I}_{2}\

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:15]

### Summary of definitions

_Question: What do you understand by the terms "rate equation", "order of reaction" and "rate constant"?_

Suggested answers

The **rate equation** is an experimentally determined equation that relates the rate of reaction to the concentrations of the reactants raised to appropriate powers.

The **order of reaction with respect to a reactant** is the power on its concentration term in the rate equation. The order of reaction must be determined experimentally.

The **overall (or total) order of reaction** is the sum of the individual orders.

The **rate constant**, \(k\), is the proportionality constant in the experimentally-determined rate equation. It is a constant at a given temperature.

The experimentally determined rate equation for this reaction is given by: rate =\(k\)[**A**]\({}^{n}\)[**B**]\({}^{n}\).

The powers, \(m\) and \(n\), are the **orders of reaction** with respect to reactants **A** and **B** respectively.

The order of reaction must be determined experimentally.

\(m+n\) gives the **overall (or total) order of reaction**

The proportionality constant, \(k\), is called the **rate constant**. It is a constant at a given temperature.

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:17]

Look again at the concentration-time plots for a first vs a second order reaction. The key distinguishing factor is the fact that an overall first order reaction has a constant half-life.

_The half-life, \(t_{v}\), of a reaction is the time taken for the concentration of a reactant to decrease to half its initial value._

Because no concentration term appears in this expression, the half-life of an overall first order reaction is **independent of reactant concentration**. Thus, its value is characteristic of a given first order reaction at a given temperature.

Half-life has units of time, To confirm that a reaction is first order, consecutive half-lives can be shown to be the same on a (reactant)-time graph or [product]-time graph as follows:

* [B]\({}_{i}\) is the final concentration of the product, **B**. This value may be calculated via **stoichiometric calculations** if it is not given in the question.
* The first half-life is the time needed to increase from 0 to [B]\({}_{i}\), while the second half-life is the time needed for [B]\({}_{i}\) to increase to \(\frac{3}{4}\)[B]\({}_{i}\).

### Studying the rates and orders of reactions

So far we have looked at the simple case of reactions with only one reactant, \(o\)**A**\(\rightarrow\) products. However, there are many reactions which involve more than one reactant. In these cases we need to "isolate" the reactant under study so that we can determine the order of reaction with respect to that reactant alone. There are two general methods that could be used to obtain rates and orders of reactions.

**Method 1: Keep all reactants in excess except the one being studied**

This is done by ensuring that all other reactants are present in _large excess_ (i.e. their concentrations should be around 10 times larger than that of the reactant being isolated for study) such that their concentrations don't appear to change significantly and may be regarded as constant during the course of the reaction. We are thus creating an artificial situation in which these other reactants do not seem to influence the rate of the reaction. We call this _pseudo-zero order_ with respect to the reactants that are in excess. (see Section 5.3)

Say we want to find out the order of reaction with respect to each reactant in the following reaction:

In order to find the order with respect to **A**, we would ensure that the concentrations of **B** and **C** are in large excess compared to [**A**]. Thus, the overall order of reaction obtained would _appear_ to reflect the order with respect to **A** as the orders with respect to both **B** and **C** would _appear_ to be zero. We can then monitor the **concentration of A vs time graph** to obtain the order with respect to **A**.

**Method 2: Initial rate method**

In this method, we measure the rate of several reaction mixtures, in which a different initial concentration of one reactant is used, while the initial concentrations of all other reactants are kept the same. Note that other variables (e.g. temperature) should be kept constant as well:

Using the same reaction,

To find the order with respect to reactant **A**, we measure the initial rate of several reaction mixtures using varying initial concentrations of **A** and constant concentrations of **B** and **C**.

If the initial rate is found to double when the initial concentration of **A** doubles, the order of reaction with respect to **A** will be 1. Alternatively, the graph of initial rate vs initial concentration of **A** can be plotted and the order with respect to **A** obtained according to the shape of the graph. Refer to previous section of rate-concentration graphs.

**Figure 11**: **A**

## 5 Experimental techniques for studying rate of reaction and order of reaction

Let's look at how to carry out actual experiments that aim to obtain the rate of a reaction.

Simple observation tells us that some reactions go faster than others, but to actually _measure_ the rate of a reaction, we must be able to monitor how fast the product is being produced or how fast the reactant is disappearing over time. A change in time can easily be measured with a stopwatch or other timing device, but how can a change in concentration of the reactants and/or products be measured during a chemical reaction?

### Measuring the concentration of reactant/product over time

There are two different ways in which we can follow the progress of a chemical reaction over time:

1. Physical methods By measuring some _physical_ property of the reaction which changes as the reaction continues (e.g. the volume of gas produced, intensity of colour of the reaction mixture, change in conductivity, etc.) and relating these to changes in concentration of a reactant or product.
2. Chemical methods By taking samples of the reaction mixture at specific time intervals and finding out _chemically_ how the concentration of one of the reagents or products is changing.

Note that the two methods do not directly give rate but _concentration data_ over time instead. The reaction rate itself still needs to be extracted from this data. We often do this by plotting the experimental data in the form of a _concentration-time graph_.

Note that in all methods of analysis, the _time must always be carefully monitored_.

#### 5.1.1 Physical methods of analysis

Recall that, even though we aim to measure the changes in _concentration_ of a reactant or product over time, in practice, it is often easier to measure a physical change that relates to these changes in concentration, such as volume or pressure of gas, colour intensity, etc., since physical methods of analysis do not interfere with the reaction being studied.

The following examples are some of the more common methods employed to measure rate of reaction via changes in a physical property.

#### 5.1.1.1 Measuring volume of gas produced

This method is useful for reactions which produce gaseous products.

For example, the reaction, 2H2O2(aq) > 2H2O(_1_) + O2(g), may be studied by measuring the volume of O2 gas produced using a gas syringe or via the water displacement method.

For diagrams and possible experimental set-ups on gas collection techniques, please refer to the Planning section in Topic 3 The Gaseous State.

The generic procedure is similar to the ones stated in the Planning section in Topic 3 The Gaseous State. In that section, two different set-ups were shown. We shall use set-up A as an example:

1. Using an electronic balance, weigh accurately about (mass) g of (solid reactant) in a weighting bottle.
2. Using a measuring cylinder, transfer (volume) cm\({}^{3}\) of (aqueous reactant) into a 250 cm\({}^{3}\) conical flask.
3. Carefully lower the weighing bottle containing (solid reactant) into the conical flask, ensuring the reactants do not mix. Insert the stopper to ensure a closed set-up.
4. **Set up** the apparatus as shown in the diagram (draw an appropriate diagram - refer to Planning section in Topic 3 The Gaseous State).
5. Record the **initial reading** (\(x\) cm\({}^{3}\)) on the gas syringe.
6. **Shake** the conical flask to mix the reactants and continue swirling the conical flask to thoroughly mix the reactants. **Start the stop-watch at the same time.**
7. **At** (each of your chosen times)**, record the reading on the gas syringe and **calculate the volume of the gas collected.

By recording the volume of gas at several time intervals, we can obtain the rate of reaction by plotting volume of gas produced against time. Because, in our example, the _volume_ of O\({}_{2}\) produced is proportional to the _concentration_ of O\({}_{2}\) at any time, \(t\), the gradient of the volume-time graph at time \(t\) is **proportional** to rate of reaction at time \(t\).

Figure 5: A typical graph of volume against time for \(\alpha\) reaction that gives off \(\alpha\) gas.

The order of reaction may also be found by plotting rate against (V\({}_{n}-\)V) or by plotting (V\({}_{n}-\)V) against **time**, and looking at the shape of the graph, where:

V\({}_{t}\) = volume of gas produced after time \(t\)

V\({}_{n}\) = volume of gas produced at the end of the reaction

(V\({}_{n}-\)V) \(\propto\) amount of unreacted reactant remaining at time \(t\).

This would be equivalent to plotting rate against [reactant] or [reactant] against time, respectively.

#### 5.1.1.2 Measuring the decrease in mass

An alternative method of monitoring reactions which produce gaseous products involves carrying out the reaction in an **open flask** placed on top of an electronic mass balance. As the gas is given off, the mass of the flask and its contents decreases. The total mass can thus be recorded throughout the experiment to plot a mass-time graph.

#### 5.1.1.3 Following a change in gas pressure

This method is suitable for reactions which involve a change in the number of moles of gases (hence total pressure). For example, each reaction below shows a reduction in number of moles of gases, hence total pressure decreases as the reaction proceeds.

Figure 6: _A typical graph of mass against time for a reaction that “loses” a gas to the atmosphere. The rate of reaction at any time is directly proportional to the negative gradient of the graph at that time._

Figure 7: _Setup to measure changes in gas pressure over time._

#### 5.1.1.4 Following a change in electrical conductivity

This method is applicable for a reaction in aqueous solution in which there is a change in the concentration of ions (hence electrical conductivity) as the reaction proceeds.

For example, in the redox reaction between bromate(V) and bromide ions, a decrease in concentration of ions is observed during the reaction.

On the other hand, in the nucleophilic substitution of _tert_-butyl bromide with water, the concentration of ions increases,

\[(\text{CH}_{3})_{3}\text{CBr}(l)+\text{H}_{2}\text{O}(l)\rightarrow(\text{CH}_{3 })_{3}\text{COH}(l)+\text{H}^{*}(\text{aq})+\text{Br}^{*}(\text{aq}),\]

The electrical conductivity of the aqueous solution can be measured at regular time intervals using a conductivity meter, and the rate of reaction is directly proportional to the rate of change in conductivity.

#### 5.1.1.5 Following a change in absorbance using a colorimeter

This method is suitable for a reaction in which one of the substances (reactant or product) is coloured or has a different colour from the others. For example, each of the reaction below involves a coloured substance,

\[\text{Br}\text{O}_{3}\text{(aq)}+\text{5Br}\text{(aq)}+\text{6H}^{*}(\text{aq} )\rightarrow\text{3Br}_{2}\text{(aq)}+\text{3H}_{2}\text{O}(l)\]

yellow-orange

A colorimeter measures the amount of light which is absorbed as it passes through a coloured solution - recorded as the absorbance of the solution. The more concentrated the coloured species is in the solution, the more light it will absorb and the greater the absorbance. The absorbance can be measured at regular time intervals using the colorimeter, and the rate of reaction is directly proportional to the rate of change in absorbance.

Figure 8: Following the change in electrical conductivity of a solution with time.

Figure 9: A simplified diagram of a colorimeter

#### 5.1.2 Chemical methods of analysis

Chemical methods of analysis typically interfere with the reaction being studied. Because of this, we must either extract small amounts of the reaction mixture, called samples, and carry out the analysis on them (Section 5.2.1), or alternatively we set up a new reaction mixture for each measurement we take (Section 5.2.2).

#### 5.1.2.1 Sampling and titrametric method

In this method, a large quantity of reactants is placed in a suitable reaction vessel and the reaction allowed to go to completion. The progress of the reaction is monitored by extracting a small fixed volume sample of the reaction mixture at various times, followed by quenching the reaction in the sample. Quenching refers to stopping the reaction.

Some methods of quenching include:

* adding a suitable base to neutralise an acidic reacting mixture and vice-versa;
* sudden, rapid dilution with large quantity of water or any suitable solvent;
* sudden, rapid cooling by plunging the mixture into ice.

The quenched sample is then titrated against a suitable reagent (of known concentration) to determine the amount of a reactant that remains or the amount of a product, at the time of quenching. The titration is then repeated for other samples withdrawn at further times. Since the titr volume is proportional to the concentration of the reactant (or product), we can be plot titr volume vs time, effectively giving us the concentration-time graph.

The sampling method is suitable for moderately slow reactions. (Why?)

1. To prepare the reaction mixture, measure (volume) cm\({}^{3}\) of (reactant.X) into a 250 cm\({}^{3}\), beaker (or conical flask) using a volume. cm\({}^{3}\) measuring cylinder.
2. Measure (volume) cm\({}^{3}\) of (last reactant) using a measuring cylinder, Add (last reactant) to the mixture and start the stop-watch at the same time. Swirl to ensure mixing.
3. Before (your chosen time, say 5 min from the start of the reaction), pipette 10.0 cm\({}^{3}\) of the reaction mixture into a conical flask.
4. At (your chosen time), quench the withdrawn sample by adding to it (volume) cm\({}^{3}\) of (suitable quenching reagent). Record the exact time of quenching (but don't stop the stop-watch!).
5. Carry out the titration of the quenched sample. (Details of titration steps needed. Refer to the Planning section in Topic 4 Reactions & Stoichiometry)
6. Before (each of your subsequent chosen times) repeat steps 3 and 4. Carry out the titration of each quenched sample. (At least 5 samples are collected to obtain data points to plot the graph.)

Note:

* Only one accurate titration is possible for each withdrawn sample.
* The reactant under study should be isolated, i.e. the other reactants should be in large excess (around 10 times more concentrated), so that the order of reaction with respect to that reactant alone can be determined.

For example, the acid-catalysed iodination of propanone

Ch\({}_{3}\)COCH\({}_{3}\)(aq) + I\({}_{2}\)(aq) + H\({}^{+}\)(aq) + T(aq) + propanone

can be followed this way:

[FIGURE:S4.F1][ENDFI

### Measuring initial rate via clock reaction

A'clock reaction' refers to a reaction set up to produce a _sudden change_ (usually visual) when a small, fixed amount of a product is formed: To study the rate of such reactions, the **time taken for the prescribed visual change to occur** is measured. This time taken **may be used as an approximation of the initial rate of the reaction.

#### 5.2.1 Reaction of S\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{8}\)\({}^{2}\) and T (iodine clock)

For example, the reaction between S\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{8}\)\({}^{2}\) and T can be followed using this method. The two reactants are mixed with a known amount of sodium thiosulfate, Na\({}_{2}\)S\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{3}\), and a little starch indicator.

The I - ions react with S\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{8}\)\({}^{2}\) to form T\({}_{2}\) as shown in the equation below.

As the reaction proceeds, the I\({}_{2}\) formed will in turn react with Na\({}_{2}\)S\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{3}\) to form I\({}^{-}\).

When all Na\({}_{2}\)S\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{3}\) has been used up, the iodine which is still being produced by Reaction I reacts with the starch to give a blue-black colour.

For a **fixed** amount of Na\({}_{2}\)S\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{3}\) added, the time taken for the blue-black colour to appear, (i.e. for a fixed amount of I\({}_{2}\) to be formed), \(t\), is an approximate measure of initial rate. The faster the rate of Reaction I, the smaller \(t\) is.

The approximation is only valid if y is **small**, i.e. the reaction is allowed to proceed to a _small extent_, such that we can assume that the concentration-time graph is a straight line, right up to the point when the blue-black colour appears (i.e point \(y\)).

Say we wish to first find the order of reaction with respect to \(\Gamma\), we will need to carry out a series of experiments in which the initial concentration of \(\Gamma\) is changed without varying the initial concentration of the other reagents (see Generic Procedure on the next page). For example, we can carry out the reaction twice - the first time with [\(\Gamma\)] = 0.1 mol dm\({}^{-3}\), then with [\(\Gamma\)] = 0.2 mol dm\({}^{-3}\). This is able to give us the timings \(t_{1}\) and \(t_{2}\), which help to _approximate_ the initial rate of each reaction.

#### 5.2.2 Reaction of S\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{3}\)\({}^{-}\) and H\({}^{+}\)

Another reaction whose rate may be studied by a clock reaction is the reaction of Na\({}_{2}\)S\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{3}\)with dilute HCl.

The rate of reaction can be determined by measuring the time taken for sufficient precipitate of sulfur to be formed to obscure a "cross" marked on a piece of paper below the reaction vessel.

Figure 11: Experimental setup for the reaction between Na\({}_{2}\)S\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{3}\)(aq) and HCl(aq).

Figure 10: Graph showing the difference in true initial rate and the average rate taken using a clock method.

To determine the order of reaction with respect to a reactant **A**, we measure the initial rates for a number of experiments in which the concentration of **A** is varied while keeping the concentrations of other reactants constant. Initial rates are often obtained by timing the appearance of a _small, fixed_ amount of product.

Generic procedure to obtain initial rates via clock reactions

1. To prepare the reaction mixture, measure (volume) cm\({}^{3}\) of (reactant **X**) into a 250 cm\({}^{3}\) beaker (or conical flask) using a measuring cylinder. Repeat for all other reactants except for the last reactant which kick-starts the reaction.
2. **Measure (volume) cm\({}^{3}\) of (last reactant) using a measuring cylinder. Add (last reactant) to the mixture and start the stop-watch at the same time.** Swirl to ensure mixing.
3. **Stop the stop-watch** when (state distinct visual change) is observed. Record the time taken, \(t\).
4. **Repeat steps 1 to 3 with different volumes of (reactant studied) and deionised water, keeping the total volume constant. (Use a table to show the list of different volumes to use in each experiment.)**

Note:

* The distinct visual change can be when sufficient precipitate is formed to just obscure a mark; or when a particular colour first appears.
* The total volume of the mixture is kept constant so that [**A**]\({}_{\text{instal}}\) is directly proportional to the volume of reactant **A**. E.g., when volume of **A** is doubled; [**A**]\({}_{\text{instal}}\) is doubled; when volume of **A** is unchanged, [**A**]\({}_{\text{instal}}\) is kept the same.
* \(\frac{1}{t}\) obtained in this way is a measure of the initial rate of reaction, hence comparing the values of \(\frac{1}{t}\) and volume of **A** can give us the order w.r.t. **A** e.g. when volume of **A** is doubled and \(\frac{1}{t}\) is also doubled, it shows that the reaction is first order w.r.t **A**. Alternatively, plotting the values of \(\frac{1}{t}\) vs volume of **A** will effectively give us the rate-concentration graph, the shape of which will allow us to determine the order w.r.t. **A** (see Section 4.5).
* Measuring cylinders are usually,used to measure the volumes of liquids (common capacities: 10 cm\({}^{3}\),25 cm\({}^{3}\), 50 cm\({}^{3}\), 100 cm\({}^{3}\)). A burette may be used if a chemical is to be added in a small quantity which has to be _exactly_ the same quantity for all experiments. However, a burette cannot be used to add the last reactant (Step 2) which has to be added _rapidly_.

### Case study on determination of order of reaction

Propanone and iodine react together in aqueous acidic solution according to the equation:

\[\text{CH}_{3}\text{COCH}_{3}\text{(aq)}+\text{I}_{2}\text{(aq)}\] \[\text{CH}_{3}\text{COCH}_{2}\text{(aq)}+\text{H}^{+}\text{(aq)}+ \text{T}\text{(aq)}\]

propanone

We use the stoichiometric equation to decide which substance to follow during a reaction in order to measure the rate. In this case, the concentration of \(\text{I}_{2}\) is most easily measured, either using a colorimeter (physical method of analysis, Section 5.1.4.5) or by titration with aqueous sodium thiosulfate (chemical method of analysis, Section 5.1.2.1). As we are investigating the effect of concentration on the rate of reaction, all other factors that might affect the rate should be kept constant e.g. the temperature during the reaction.

In this case study, a physical method of analysis is utilised. The absorbance is measured, at regular time intervals, using a colorimeter.

\[\text{[I}_{2}\text{]}\]

 remaining in the reaction mixture at time \[t\propto\text{absorbance at that time}\]

Rate of reaction \[\propto\text{ rate of decrease in absorbance}\]

From the equation (above), we have three chemical species whose concentration may affect the rate: \(\text{I}_{2}\), propanone and H+.

So the rate equation may be written as; fate = \(k\)[I2]" [propanone]" [H+]".

The objective of this exercise is to determine the order of reaction with respect to each species.

**Method 1.** Monitor the concentration of one reactant (or product) present in one reaction mixture over time, while keeping all other reactants in excess.

This method is used in Experiment 1 to determine the order of reaction w.r.t. \(\mathrm{I_{2}}\), and its significance or underlying principle has been explained previously. The reaction is carried out only once and the experimental results are usually given as follows:

The concentration-time data is usually plotted and its shape is used to deduce order (Section 4.5). In this case, a straight line graph of [\(\mathrm{I_{2}}\)] against time is obtained and the conclusion of zero order with respect to \(\mathrm{I_{2}}\) is made. What should you do if a curve is obtained?

**Method 2.** The initial rate method.

This method is used in experiments 2 and 3 to determine the order of reaction for propanone and that for \(\mathrm{H^{+}}\). The reaction is carried out a few times (total of 3 times in the case study) and the experimental results are usually presented in the generic format shown below. The initial rate may be found from the gradient of the concentration-time graph for each experiment.

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|} \hline  & \multicolumn{3}{c|}{Initial concentration /mol dm\({}^{-3}\)} & \multicolumn{3}{c|}{Initial rate of reaction} \\ \cline{2-5} Experiment & [A] & [B] & [C] & /mol dm\({}^{-3}\) min\({}^{-1}\) \\ \hline

By studying how the initial rate changes when the concentration of this one reactant is changed, we can deduce the order with respect to that reactant (Lecture Exercise 4.2).

## 6 Reaction Mechanisms

### Important terminology

A chemical equation only tells us about the identities and ratios of each particle involved in the reaction. It does not tell us exactly how the reactant particles interact with each other at the molecular level. Chemists are interested to know exactly how the various bonds are broken and made in a chemical reaction.

The reaction mechanism details how the atoms in the reactants rearrange to form the products and thus gives us some information about the order in which bonds are broken and formed. In other words, reaction mechanisms show how the reaction occurs at the _particulate_ level.

A reaction does not always occur in a single step where all the reactants collide at one go and form the products. Instead, we can think of a reaction as occurring in a series of simple steps, called **elementary steps**. These steps **cannot be broken down into simpler steps.** It is the sequence of these elementary steps that we refer to when we use the term _'reaction mechanism'_.

One of these steps has a higher activation energy that determines the overall rate of the reaction. This particular step is called the **rate-determining step (r.d.s.)**. It is the **slowest step** in a multi-step reaction mechanism. (In a single-step mechanism, the only step must be the rate-determining step.)

Example:

The reaction mechanism for the nucleophilic substitution of 2-bromo-2-methyl/propane' with hydroxide ions. (Do not worry if this reaction is unfamiliar to you. We will learn the mechanism in detail in Topic 13 Halogen Derivatives).

\begin{tabular}{l l l l l l} Step 1: & (CH\({}_{3}\))\({}_{3}\)CBr & \(\rightarrow\) & (CH\({}_{3}\))\({}_{3}\)C\({}^{+}\) & \(+\) & Br\({}^{-}\) \\ Step 2: & (CH\({}_{3}\))\({}_{3}\)C\({}^{+}\) & OH\({}^{-}\) & \(\rightarrow\) & (CH\({}_{3}\))\({}_{3}\)COH & (fast) \\ Overall equation: & (CH\({}_{3}\))\({}_{3}\)CBr & \(+\) & OH\({}^{-}\) & \(\rightarrow\) & (CH\({}_{3}\))\({}_{3}\)COH & (fast) \\ \end{tabular}

The **overall reaction** between 2-bromo-2-methyl/propane\({}_{r}\)(CH\({}_{3}\))\({}_{3}\)CBr, and hydroxide ion, OH\({}^{-}\), to form 2-methyl/propane-2-oil, (CH\({}_{3}\))\({}_{3}\)COH, and bromide ion, Br\({}^{-}\), is postulated to occur via a sequence of two reaction steps as shown above. The two elementary steps, "Step 1" and "Step 2", constitute the mechanism of this reaction. As shown in the example, the **elementary steps** in the mechanism **"add up" to give the overall equation**.

Notice that elementary steps usually involve one or two (or very occasionally, three) reactant molecules. The **molecularity** of a step counts the number of particles (molecules or ions or atoms) that must collide to produce the reaction indicated in **an elementary step**.

* Unimolecular reactions involve only 1 reactant particle (E.g. Step 1)
* Bimolecular reactions involve the collision of 2 reactant particles (E,g Step 2)
* Termolecular reactions are extremely rare since it requires a collision of three particles at the same time with sufficient energy and with the correct orientation to form the products.

Note: molecularity **only** applies to elementary steps, and **cannot** be assigned to an _overall reaction_.

In the example above, the (CH\({}_{3}\))\({}_{3}\)C\({}^{+}\) ion is an **intermediate** in the reaction, An intermediate is a chemical species produced in an early step of a mechanism and consumed in a later step. It is neither a reactant nor an ultimate product of the overall reaction, It may be stable enough to be detected or isolated. **Intermediates** do not appear in the overall balanced equation, nor in the overall rate equation.

### The relationship between reaction mechanism and the rate equation

Possible mechanisms for a given reaction must always relate to experimental data. We can hypothesise the elementary steps of a reaction, and then test the hypothesis against evidence from rate experiments. If the evidence supports the suggested mechanism, we can accept it; if not, we have to propose a different mechanism. In other words, we can never really prove that an accepted mechanism is the actual mechanism, but we can show that it is consistent with the data.

When proposing a reaction mechanism for a reaction, the following three criteria must be met:

1. The elementary steps must add up to the overall balanced equation.
2. The elementary steps must be physically reasonable. For example, it typically does not involve a collision between 3 particles (very rare) or a collision between ions of the same charge (possible but rare).
3. The mechanism must be consistent with the experimentally-determined rate equation.

#### 6.2.1 Constructing a rate equation from a given reaction mechanism

If the reaction mechanism is given in a question, the overall order of reaction can simply be deduced from the molecularity of the rate-determining step (r.d.s.). We can then easily write the rate equation for the overall reaction: the coefficients of the reactants in the r.d.s. are used as the order w.r.t. each reactant. Thus, molecularity of the r.d.s. is equal to the overall order of the reaction.

* **Single-step reaction mechanisms** For a single-step reaction, there is only one elementary step. This step will therefore determine the rate of the reaction.

* Reactant species that react _before_ or _in_ the r.d.s. will appear in the rate equation.
- Reactant species that react _after_ the r.d.s. will **not** appear in the rate equation.

* **Cases when the rate-determining step is the first step:**

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:45]

#### Verifying that a suggested reaction mechanism is consistent with the observed kinetics

In the hypothetical reaction between X and Y,

the experimental rate equation is found to be:

\[\text{rate}=k[\text{Y}]^{2}.\]

Which of the following possible mechanisms is/are consistent with the experimental results?

### Depicting reaction profiles of multi-step reactions

A two-step reaction could have the reaction profiles depicted in Figure 15. Note that both examples show an overall exothermic reaction, so the products are lower in energy than the reactants.

Figure 15: Reaction pathway diagrams for a two-step reaction. There is one intermediate and two transition states. In **(a)**, the first step is rate-determining. In **(b)**, the second step is rate-determining.

## 7 FACTORs Affecting Rates of Reaction

Recall that, according to the collision theory, a reaction occurs only if the particles collide with the correct energy and orientation. At the molecular level, the rate of a reaction depends on two things:

* the **collision frequency** (i.e. how often the reactant molecules collide with each another); and
* the **proportion of the particles that have sufficient energy to overcome the activation energy**.

By changing the physical parameters of a reaction (such as concentration, temperature, etc.), we can effectively modify these two factors, leading to a change in the rate of reaction.

For most chemical reactions, only a tiny fraction of the collisions that take place have enough energy to overcome the activation energy barrier: These collisions are called **effective collisions**. A typical fraction might be one in ten thousand million (1 in 10\({}^{10}\)). This is why many reactions are slow at room temperature. In general, any change that increases the collision rate will inevitably lead to an increase in effective collisions.

### Effect of concentration or pressure

Usually, rate of reaction increases when the reactant concentration is increased.

At a higher concentration, there are more reactant particles per unit volume, therefore,

reactant particles are closer together

reactant particles collide more frequently

thus, frequency of effective collisions increases

rate of reaction increases

_(Note: All the-above points are necessary in explaining the effect of concentration on reaction rate)_

_(Note: All the-above points are necessary in explaining the effect of concentration on reaction rate)_

_(Note: All the-above points are necessary in explaining the effect of concentration, after collision, afterThe rate of reaction will increase only if the concentration of reactants that appear in the rate equation is increased.

The rate of the above reaction will increase if [**A**] is increased. However, the rate of reaction will not increase if [**B**] is increased as the reaction is zero order with respect to **B**.

The same effect is observed if we increase the pressure for a gaseous reaction. The molecules are closer together, leading to an increase in collision frequency as well.

However, changing the pressure has virtually no effect on the rate for solid or liquid phase reactions because the volume of a solid or liquid changes very little when put under pressure, so their particles do not move closer together.

### Effect of surface area (solids)

For a chemical reaction involving a solid, only the particles on its surface are available for reaction. If the solid reactant is in a more finely divided state, the surface area over which the solid can come into contact with liquid or gaseous reactants is larger. Hence, collision frequency increases, reaction rate increases.

Figure 17: Illustration showing the effect of smaller particle size on surface area, surface area, ovalibole for reaction.

Reactions can be made to go faster by increasing the fraction of reacting particles with enough energy to overcome the activation energy barrier. This is a more important factor than simply increasing frequency of collision. There are two ways in which we can increase this fraction:

* increase the energy of the collisions;
* find another route with a lower activation energy.

### Effect of Temperature

The usual way of increasing the energy of the collisions is to increase the temperature.

A minor effect of increasing the temperature is that the reactant particles move faster as they now have higher kinetic energies, so they collide more frequently.

However, the main effect is that a higher proportion of the particles now have enough energy to overcome the activation energy barrier, thus the **frequency of _effective_ collisions increases.

A good gauge of the effect of temperature increase is the following:

a 10 "C increase in temperature roughly doubles the rate of reaction

Effect of changing temperature on the rate constant

The increase in rate of reaction with an increase in temperature can also be predicted by the Arrhenius equation. According to the Arrhenius equation (Section 4.3), the rate constant increases exponentially with temperature.

\[k=\text{Ae}^{-\text{E}A/\text{RT}}\]

Even without knowing the Arrhenius equation, knowing that an increase in temperature alone can increase the rate of a reaction (all other factors remaining identical), we can easily see that an increase in temperature must have effected an increase in the value of the rate constant, \(k\).

To help remember this relationship (between temperature and the rate constant), you can follow the following line of thought.

Recall a general rate equation,

\[\text{rate}=k\text{[A]}^{m}\text{[B]}^{n}\]

If [A] and [B] are kept the same for two identical experiments in which only temperature is changed, then rate \(\propto k\).

Our reasoning can follow these lines:

increasing the temperature increases rate

and rate \(\propto k\)

(\(\cdot\) [A] and [B] are kept the same)

Increasing the temperature must have increased \(k\)

Conversely, decreasing the temperature would decrease the value of the rate constant.

Qualitatively, the explanation is better understood with the help of the Boltzmann distribution curve, as outlined in the next self-practice.

**Self-practice 7.2**

With the aid of a sketch of the Boltzmann distribution, explain how an increase in temperature affects the rate of a chemical reaction.

**Self-practice 7.3**

It is often said that the rate of a typical reaction is roughly doubled by raising the temperature by 10oC.

What explains this observation?

**A**: Raising the temperature by 10oC doubles the average energy of each molecule.

**B**: Raising the temperature by 10oC doubles the velocity of each molecule.

**C**: Raising the temperature by 10oC doubles the number of molecular collisions in a given time.

**D**: Raising the temperature by 10oC doubles the number of molecules having more than a certain minimum energy.

## 8 Catalysis

Catalysis is especially important to industrial chemists. It allows them to increase the rate of reactions without resorting to increasing temperature which may involve higher cost and possibility of decomposition of reactants or products.

Generally, there are two main types of catalyst: **homogeneous** and **heterogeneous** catalysts. The **type of catalyst** is determined by the **phase** in which the **catalyst** and the **reactants are in.

The term **phase** as used in chemistry refers to a **physically distinctive form of matter**, such as a **solid**, **liquid**, **gas or plasma**. A phase of matter is characterised by having relatively uniform chemical and physical properties. Phases are _different_ from states of matter. The states of matter (e.g., liquid, solid, gas) are phases, but matter can exist in different phases yet possess the same state of matter. For example, water and oil are in the same liquid state but when added together exist in different phases (oil phase and aqueous phase) as they do not mix.

### Homogeneous catalysis

A **homogeneous catalyst** acts in the **same phase as the reactants** and is uniformly mixed with them.

Homogeneous catalysis usually involves the formation of an **intermediate** between the catalyst and one of the reactants. The catalyst is then regenerated in a later step of the reaction.

The catalysed reaction may involve two or more steps, each of which must has a lower activation energy than the uncatalysed reaction.

Figure 19: A possible set of energy profiles for a reaction with and without a homogeneous catalyst. In the presence of a catalyst, the reaction has a different reaction pathway which involves lower activation energy. Notice that the catalyst does not alter the final products and the enthalpy change of reaction.

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:59]

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:60]

### Heterogeneous catalysis

A heterogeneous catalyst acts in a different physical phase from the reactants.

This type of catalysis most often involves a solid interacting with gaseous or liquid reactants.

Since solids do not have a 'concentration', heterogeneous catalysts _do not_ appear in the rate equation in this form, instead, their effect is included in the value of the rate constant, \(\hat{K}\).

Catalytic action occurs **on the surface** of the solid catalyst at what is called 'active sites'. Thus a larger surface area is more advantageous in increasing the rate of reaction since it exposes more active sites. The catalyst is usually made into pellets, wire gauze or finely-powdered form spread on ceramic, silica or asbestos support.

Many heterogeneous catalysts are transitions metals or their compounds:

Figure 20: Catalytic hydrogenation of alkenes is used in the conversion of inedible vegetable oils to edible margarine. A solid catalyst usually functions by promoting a reaction on its surface.

#### 8.2.1 Mode of action of heterogeneous catalysts

The mode of action of heterogeneous catalysts is explained below with reference to the reaction in the Haber process: N\({}_{2}\)(g) + 3H\({}_{2}\)(g) \(\rightleftharpoons\) 2NH\({}_{3}\)(g), which is normally catalysed by iron metal.

The figures below illustrate the three stages involved:

_Description_. Product molecule, NH\({}_{3}\), _desorbs_ and diffuses away from the catalyst surface. The active sites become free to adsorb "new" reactant molecules.

The rate of reaction is controlled by how fast the gaseous reactants are adsorbed and how fast the products are desorbed. When the active sites are fully occupied (i.e. when the catalyst is _saturated_), there is no increase in reaction rate even if the pressure of the system is increased.

Qn: What is the order of reaction (with respect to the reactant molecules) when the catalyst is saturated?

Catalyst is saturated, reactants can no longer be adsorbed onto catalyst active sites, rate no longer be affected by [reactant], zero order with respect to reactant.

Figure 21: Mode of action of heterogeneous catalysts, explained with reference to the reaction in the Haber process.

2.2 Application of heterogeneous catalysis: Catalytic converters in vehicles to convert harmful emissions to less harmful products

Ideally, the hydrocarbons in petrol would be completely converted into carbon dioxide and water when burned in a car engine. These are non-polluting products, though the CO\({}_{2}\) added into the atmosphere does have an effect on the earth's climate. In practice, however, complete conversion does not occur and three other products are formed which are immediately harmful:

* unburnt hydrocarbons,
* carbon and carbon monoxide from incomplete combustion of the fuel,
* oxides of nitrogen from the reaction between N\({}_{2}\) and O\({}_{2}\) from the air, under the high temperatures in the car engine,

To reduce the amounts of these pollutants, car engines are fitted with catalytic converters. The exhaust gases are passed through a ceramic honeycomb or bed of small beads made from alumina (A\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{3}\)), coated with platinum (Pt), palladium (Pd), and rhodium (Rh) catalysts. These help to catalyse the following reactions:

* Reduction of NO to N\({}_{2}\)CO(g) + NO(g) \(\rightarrow\) CO\({}_{2}\)(g) + X\({}_{2}\)N(g)
* Oxidation of CO to CO\({}_{2}\)CO(g) + X\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{2}\)(g) \(\rightarrow\) CO\({}_{2}\)(g)
* Oxidation of unburnt hydrocarbons to CO\({}_{2}\) and H\({}_{2}\)O
* unburnt hydrocarbon + O\({}_{2}\)(g) \(\rightarrow\) CO\({}_{2}\)(g) + H\({}_{2}\)O(g)

Because lead poisons the catalysts (therefore rendering them ineffective), it is essential to use unleaded petrol in a car fitted with a catalytic converter.

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:65]

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:66]

#### 8.4.1 Mechanism of enzyme action

The mechanism may be simplified as the following two steps:

enzyme + substrate \(\rightleftharpoons\)enzyme-substrate complex enzyme-substrate complex enzyme + products (slow, rate-determining)

The substrate binds to the active site of the enzyme to form the **enzyme-substrate complex**.

Within the complex, the substrate molecule then undergoes chemical change that may involve bond reorganisation and/or reaction with other molecules. Once the products are formed, they will be released from the enzyme and diffuse away. The enzyme's active site is empty/again and ready to take in another substrate.

There are two models of enzyme action:

(a) lock-and-key model (b) induced-fit model

Figure 23: Two models of enzyme action. **(a)** In the lock-and-key model, the active site is thought to be an exact fit for the substrate. **(b)** In the induced-fit model, the active site is thought to change shape to fit the substrate.

Figure 24: Graph of rate of an enzyme-catalysed reaction against substrate concentration.

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:68]

### Substances affecting catalyst activity

Catalysts with active sites, whether biological or not, are vulnerable to poisons which may preferentially bind to the active site. Once bound, these poisons have an inhibitive effect on the action of the catalyst, even when present in small amounts. For example, enzymes are easily poisoned by molecules similar to the substrate, while metal catalyst such as platinum can be poisoned by lead additives in petrol, which are preferentially adsorbed onto the catalyst surface.

The graph shows the results of an investigation of the initial rate of hydrolysis of maltose by the enzyme amylase. In the experiments, the initial concentration of maltose was varied but that of amylase was kept constant.

Which conclusions can be deduced from these results?
