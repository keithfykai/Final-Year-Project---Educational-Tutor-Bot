### 5.1 Solving Equations Using GC (Independent Learning)

#### 5.1.1 Roots of Polynomials

When solving equations, one should take note of the type of equations given and the type of solutions required. For polynomials that do not require exact solutions, one may use the pre-installed app "PlySmlt2" to acquire the roots.

Keep in mind that a polynomial of degree \(n\) will have a maximum of \(n\) real roots.

**Example 1:** Find the real root(s) of the equation \(x^{3}-2x^{2}+3x=1\).

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|} \hline
**Solution:** & **GC Screenshots** & **ThinkZone** \\ \hline Rewrite equation in the form \(\mathsf{f}(x)=0\) & & \\ where \(\mathsf{f}(x)\) is a polynomial, i.e. \(x^{3}-2x^{2}+3x-1=0\). & & \\ \hline \end{tabular}

### Introduction to Inequalities (Independent Reading)

Basic Concepts and Rules for Manipulating Inequalities

Let \(a,\,b,\,c,\,d\,\in\,\mathbb{R}\).

**Property**

\begin{tabular}{|l l|l|l|} \hline  & **Property** & & **Example** \\ \hline (i) & If \(a>b\) and \(b>c\), then \(a>c\). & (Transitive Property) & If \(5>3\) and \(3>2\), then \(5>2\). \\ \hline (ii) & If \(a>b\) and \(c>0\), then \(ac>bc\). & If \(6>3\), then \\  & If \(a>b\) and \(c>0\), then \(\left(\frac{a}{c}>\frac{b}{c}\right)\). & - \\  & Multiplying/dividing both sides of an inequality by a & \\  & **positive** real number preserves the inequality sign. & \\ \hline (iii) & If \(a>b\) and \(c<0\), then \(ac<bc\). & If \(6>3\), then \\  & If \(a>b\) and \(c<0\), then \(\left(\frac{a}{c}<\frac{b}{c}\right)\). & \(6\times\left(-2\right)<3\times\left(-2\right)\) and \(\frac{6}{-2}<\frac{3}{-2}\). \\  & Multiplying/dividing both sides of an inequality by a & \\  & **negative** real number changes the inequality sign. & \\ \hline (iv) & If \(a>b\) and \(c>d\), then \(a+c>b+d\). & If \(6>3\) and \(5>4\), then \\  & **Warning:** But \(a-c>b-d\) is not necessary true. & \(6+5>3+4\). \\  & e.g. \(3>2\) and \(7>1\) but \(3-7\nmid 2-1\) & \\ \hline (v) & If \(a>b>0\) and \(n>0\), & If \(6>3\), then \\  & \(a^{2}>b^{2}\), \(a^{3}>b^{3}\),..., \(a^{n}>b^{n}\) and & \(6^{2}>3^{2}\), \(6^{2}>3^{2}\), \(6^{2}>3^{2}\),... and \\  & \(\frac{1}{a}<\frac{1}{b}\), \(\frac{1}{a^{2}}<\frac{1}{b^{2}}\),..., \(\frac{1}{a^{n}}<\frac{1}{b^{n}}\) & \(\frac{1}{6}<\frac{1}{3}\), \(\frac{1}{6^{2}}<\frac{1}{3^{2}}\), \(\frac{1}{6^{2}}<\frac{1}{3^{2}}\),... \\  & **Warning:** In general, \(a>b\Rightarrow a^{2}>b^{2}\) is not true if \(a\), \(b\) & \\  & are not both positive. & \\  & e.g. \(-3>-4\) but \(\left(-3\right)^{2}<\left(-4\right)^{2}\) ; \(2>-3\) but \(\left(2\right)^{2}<\left(-3\right)^{2}\) & \\ \hline (vi) & If \(a>b\), & \\  & \(\text{f}\left(a\right)>\text{f}\left(b\right)\) if f is a strictly increasing function & \\  & and & \\  & \(\text{f}\left(a\right)<\text{f}\left(b\right)\) if f is a strictly decreasing function. & \\ \hline \end{tabular}

### 5.3 Solving Polynomial Inequalities in One Variable

To solve any inequality, we need to manipulate it to any of the form \(\mathrm{f}(x)>0\), \(\mathrm{f}(x)<0\), \(\mathrm{f}(x)\leq 0\), or \(\mathrm{f}(x)\geq 0\) where \(\mathrm{f}(x)\) is a polynomial.

**General steps in solving polynomial inequalities**

1) **Express** the inequality in the form \(\mathrm{f}(x)>0\), \(\mathrm{f}(x)<0\), \(\mathrm{f}(x)\leq 0\) or \(\mathrm{f}(x)\geq 0\). To facilitate the ease of solving, one should manipulate the inequality such that the coefficient of the term with the highest power is positive.

2) **Factorise \(\mathrm{f}(x)\)** completely or by completing the square.

3) **Find the roots** of the equation \(\mathrm{f}(x)=0\).

4) **Identify the required interval** by using the test point method.

#### 5.3.1 Solving quadratic inequalities

**Example 4:** Solve the inequality \(x^{2}-3x\geq-2\).

**Solution:**

1) Rearrange into \(x^{2}-3x+2\geq 0\). Note that the coefficient of \(x^{2}\) is 1 which is positive.

2) Factorise \(\mathrm{f}(x)\) completely: \(\big{(}x-1\big{)}\big{(}x-2\big{)}\geq 0\)

3) The roots are \(x=1\) or \(2\).

4) Identifying the required interval:

1. Mark the roots on the number line. The use of solid dots or circles on the number line is used to include or exclude the end points of an interval respectively.

2. \(x\)

3) Text the signs in each interval (hence the name test point method) by suitable values in each region. For example:

* Substitute \(x=0\) into the expression \(\big{(}x-1\big{)}\big{(}x-2\big{)}\) to determine the sign for the leftmost interval. We will get a positive sign when it is substituted in.
* Substitute \(x=1.5\) into the expression \(\big{(}x-1\big{)}\big{(}x-2\big{)}\) to determine the sign for the middle interval. We will get a negative sign when it is substituted in.
* Substitute \(x=3\) into the expression \(\big{(}x-1\big{)}\big{(}x-2\big{)}\) to determine the sign for the rightmost interval. We will get a positive sign when it is substituted in. Note that by ensuring that the coefficient of \(x^{2}\) to be positive, the rightmost region in the number line will be positive.

Thus we have the following diagram.

For \(x^{2}-3x\geq-2\), we need \(x\leq 1\) or \(x\geq 2\).

This is similar and consistent when we draw the graph of \(y=x^{2}-3x+2\).

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:8]

#### 5.3.2 Solving inequalities involving higher power polynomials

**Example 7:** Without the use of GC, solve the following inequalities:

(i) \((x+3)(2x-1)(2-x)<0\) (ii) \((x+3)^{2}(2x-1)(2-x)<0\) (iii) \((x+3)^{3}(2x-1)(2-x)<0\)

**Solution:**

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|} \hline
**Solution:** & **ThinkZone** \\ \hline (i) & \((x+3)(2x-1)(2-x)<0\) & Notice that if we draw the curve \\  & \((x+3)(2x-1)(x-2)>0\) & \(y=(x+3)(2x-1)(x-2)\), the polarity is positive for \\  & \(-3<x<\frac{1}{2}\) or \(x>2\) \\ \hline (ii) & \((x+3)^{2}(2x-1)(2-x)<0\) & (ii) Does the sign always change? \\  & \((x+3)^{2}(2x-1)(x-2)>0\) & \\  & \(+\) & \(+\) \\ \hline (iii) & \((x+3)^{2}(2x-1)(2-x)<0\) & \\  & \((x+3)^{3}(2x-1)(x-2)>0\) & \\  & \(+\) & \(+\) \\ \hline (iii) & \((x+3)^{2}(2x-1)(2-x)<0\) & \\  & \((x+3)^{3}(2x-1)(x-2)>0\) & \\  & \(+\) & \(+\) \\ \hline \end{tabular}

**Example 8:** (Independent learning) Solve the inequality \(-2x^{3}+5x^{2}+21x-36<0\).

**Solution:**

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|} \hline
**Solution:** & **ThinkZone** \\ \hline \(-2x^{3}+5x^{2}+21x-36<0\) & GC can be used directly to solve the inequality as the question did not specify the method to be used. \\ \(2x^{3}-5x^{2}-21x+36>0\) & Use _poly root finder_ to get the roots. \\  & \(+\) & \\ \hline -3 & \(\frac{2}{4}\) & If asked to solve algebraically: \\  & \(1\). Factorise the expression \(y=2x^{3}-5x^{2}-21x+36\) completely. \\  & \(2\). Find the roots of \(y=0\) and determine the range of values of \(x\) that make \(y>0\) using the test point method. \\ \end{tabular}

### 5.7 Solving Systems of Linear Equations

The equation \(a_{i}x+a_{2}y=b\) is a linear equation with 2 unknowns, \(x\) and \(y\). A linear **equation in \(n\) unknowns \(x_{1},x_{2},....,x_{n}\) is an equation of the form**

\(a_{1}x_{1}+a_{2}x_{2}+....+a_{n}x_{n}=b\) where \(a_{1},a_{2}......,a_{n},b\) are real constants.

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|} \hline Examples of **linear** equations & Examples of **non-linear** equations \\ \hline \(\bullet\)\(x-2y+3z=120\), & \(\bullet\)\(xy=1\) \\ \(\bullet\)\(2x_{1}+3x_{2}-44x_{3}=1\) & \(\bullet\)\(x^{2}z-3y=10\) \\ \hline \end{tabular} Considering a system of two linear equations in two variables, \(x\) and \(y\), which has the general form:

\(ax+by=r\)

\(cx+dy=s\)

Graphing the equations results in one of the three possible solutions:

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|} \hline
1. & The two lines in the linear system intersect at a single \\  & point i.e. the system of linear equations has exactly one \\  & solution (or a unique solution). \\ \hline
2. & The two lines coincide i.e. the system of linear equations \\  & has infinitely many solutions. \\ \hline
3. & The lines are parallel i.e. the system of linear equations \\  & has no solution. \\ \hline \end{tabular}

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:23]

\(x\)\(+8z=4\)

Just as in the previous example, under

**PlySmIt2 and 2:SIMULTANEOUS EQN SOLVER**, but now we have 3 EQUATIONS and 3 UNKNOWNS.

Key in the SYSTEM MATRIX accordingly and

press [SOLVE].

Thus, \(x=4,y=-1\) and \(z=0\).

Not all systems of linear equations in 3 variables have unique solutions. They may have infinite solutions or no solution.

**Example 24: (Independent Learning)**

Solve the system of equations:

\((i)\)\(x+2y+3z=4\)

\(-5x-6y-7z=-8\)

\(-5x-6y-7z=-8\)

\(-5x-6y-7z=-9\)

**Solution:**

(i) If we key into the GC as in the previous examples, we have the following screen shots:

Thus, we say the system is inconsistent and has no solution.

(ii) If we key into the GC as in the previous examples, we have the following screen shots:

This is equivalent to:

\(x=-2+z\)

\(y=3-2z\)

\(z=z\)

This means that the variable '\(z\)' is a 'free' variable which we can assign any real value.

By letting \(z=k\), \(k\in\mathbb{R}\), we have

\(x=k-2\)

\(y=-2k+3\)

\(z=k\)

The system of equations has infinitely many solutions.

### 5.9 Solving Practical Problems Using Systems of Linear Equations

In life, some problems can be modelled by mathematics. By converting the problem into a mathematical one, we may get linear equations that can be solved easily. After which, we then contextualise the solution back into the problems we were concerned with.

**Example 25:** A company specializes in making toy cars. It makes three types of toy cars, Toy Car A, Toy Car B and Toy Car C. The amount of materials required (in units) to make a car of each type is given below:

\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|c|} \hline  & Plastic & Rubber & Metal \\ \hline Toy Car A & 2 & 1 & 1 \\ \hline Toy Car B & 3 & 4 & 5 \\ \hline Toy Car C & 1 & 3 & 2 \\ \hline Amount of material available & 100 & 150 & 130 \\ \hline \end{tabular}

If all the materials available are used, how many cars of each type does the company make?

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|} \hline
**Solution:** & **ThinkZone** \\ \hline Let \(x\) be the number of toy cars of  type A. & 1) You must define the variables to the context of the questions. Use the phrase "_how many cars of each type_" to define the variables. \\ \hline \end{tabular}

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|} \hline
**Algorithm 26**: A company that rents small moving trucks wants to purchase 25 trucks with a combined capacity of exactly 28000 cubic feet. Three different types of trucks are available for purchase: a 10-feet truck with a capacity of 350 cubic feet, a 14-feet truck with a capacity of 700 cubic feet, and a 24-feet truck with a capacity of 1400 cubic feet. What are the possible combinations trucks the company could buy?

Suppose a client wants to rent all 25 trucks from the rental company.

If the rental company charges $115 per day for a 10-feet truck, $150 per day for a 14-feet truck and $200 per day for a 24-feet truck, how many of each type of trucks should the company now purchase in order to charge the highest price?

**Solution:** & Let \(x_{1},x_{2},x_{3}\) represent the number of 10-feet, 14-feet and 24-feet truck purchased respectively.

We can set up a pair of equations,

\[x_{1}+x_{2}+x_{3} =25\] \[350x_{1}+700x_{2}+1400x_{3} =28000\Rightarrow x_{1}+2x_{2}+4x_{3}=80\]

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:26]

**Chapter 5: Inequalities and Equations**

At \(x=13.3333\), \(y=8.296\) (to 3 d.p.) (maximum \(y\)-value)

At \(x=20,y=8.000\) (minimum \(y\)-value)

Hence, the range of values of \(k\) for the line \(y=k\) to intersect

the graph of \(y=\operatorname{f}(x)\) at three distinct points is \(8.000<k<8.296\).

### 1 Sequences

**Definition:** A **sequence** is defined as an ordered set of objects. In most cases, these objects are numbers. Sequences occur in nature, such as the patterns on snail shells and seed heads in flowers and in man-made application such as the world of finance.

Consider these sequences:

1. J, A, S, O, N, D, J,...

2. M, W, F, S, T, T, S,...

3. 2, 4, 6, 8, 10,...

4. 1, 3, 7, 15, 31,...

How can these sequences be described?

1. Initial letter of each month (in English) beginning with July.

2. Initial letter of days, starting with Monday, going forward each time by two days.

3. Beginning with 2, each subsequent term is 2 more than the previous term.

4. Beginning with 1, each subsequent term is double the previous term plus 1.

In our syllabus, we are only studying the sequences of numbers.

In order to describe sequences mathematically, some notation is required.

\begin{tabular}{|c|l|} \hline Notation & Description \\ \hline \(u_{*}\) & \(n^{\mathrm{th}}\) term of a sequence (the subscript refers to the position of the term in the entire sequence). \\ \hline \(S_{n}\) & the sum of the first \(n\) terms \(=u_{1}+u_{2}+u_{3}+...+u_{n}\) \\  & Note: If the question is asking for the sum of first \(n\) even (odd) terms, we cannot use the notation \(S_{n}\). \\ \hline \(a\) & Initial or first term of a sequence. \\ \hline \end{tabular}

## Chapter 6 Sequences & Series

### 6.1.1 Generating Sequences from the given formula

A sequence is defined by \(u_{n}=1+\frac{1}{2^{n}}\) for \(n\in\mathbb{Z}^{+}\). We can obtain the terms by substituting suitable values of \(n\).

For example, \(u_{3}=1+\frac{1}{2^{3}}=1.125\), \(u_{5}=1+\frac{1}{2^{5}}=1.03125\)

**Chapter 6 Sequences & Series**

#### 1.2.2 Use of the graphing calculator to generate sequences

Please refer to page 26-27 of "My First Step in Using TI-84 Plus CE for H1 and H2 Math" for the keystrokes to generate a sequence.

**Remark:** We will use \(u_{s}\) to denote the general term of a sequence in this chapter. Another notation \(\mathrm{u}(n)\) is used mainly for GC calculation.

### Series

A **series** is the sum of a finite or infinite sequence of terms.

Examples of series

**(a)**: \(1+2+3+...+100\) (finite series)
**(b)**: \(1+4+9+16+...\) (infinite series)

### Convergence of Sequences & Series

A sequence of real numbers \(u_{1}\), \(u_{2}\), \(u_{3}\),... is said to **converge** to a real number \(a\) if \(u_{s}\to a\) as \(n\to\infty\).

For example, the sequence \(u_{s}=1+\frac{1}{2^{s}}\) for \(n\in\mathbb{Z}^{+}\) converges to \(1\) as \(n\to\infty\). Thus, we say that \(1\) is the limit of the sequence \(u_{s}=1+\frac{1}{2^{s}}\) for \(n\in\mathbb{Z}^{+}\).

Mathematically, we can write \(\lim_{n\to\infty}u_{s}=\lim_{n\to\infty}\left(1+\frac{1}{2^{s}}\right)=1\).

However, the sequence \(u_{s}=2^{s}\) for \(n\in\mathbb{Z}^{+}\) does not have a limit, i.e. the sequence \(u_{s}=2^{s}\) for \(n\in\mathbb{Z}^{+}\)**diverges**.

Exercise

Do the following sequences converge?

**(a)**: \(u_{s}=\frac{1}{2^{s-1}}\) _q_e_ (b)_\(u_{s}=1+(-1)^{s}\) \(q\) (c)_\(u_{s}=n^{2}\) _q_e_

where \(n\in\mathbb{Z}^{+}\).

A finite series always has a finite value. For example, \(1+2+3+...+100=5050\).

An infinite series, however, may or may not have a finite value. For example, the infinite series \(1+2+3+...\) does not have a finite value. The infinite series \(-1+1-1+1-1+\cdots\) whose terms alternate between \(-1\) and \(1\) does not have a value. However, the infinite series \(\frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{2^{2}}+\frac{1}{2^{3}}+\cdots\) converges to \(1\).

**SECTION A: Arithmetic and Geometric Progression**

**1. Arithmetic Progression (AP)**

An **arithmetic progression** is a sequence in which each term (other than the first term) differs from the previous one by the same fixed number (positive or negative or zero) known as **common difference**, \(d\).

Examples of AP:

(a) 2, 5, 8, 11,... is an AP with first term, \(a=2\) and common difference, \(d=3\)

(b) 6, \(-4\), \(-14\), \(-24\),... is an AP with first term, \(a=6\) and common difference, \(d=-10\)

(c) \(-1\), \(-\dfrac{2}{3}\), \(-\dfrac{1}{3}\), \(0\), \(\dfrac{1}{3}\),... is an AP with first term, \(a=-1\) and common difference, \(d=\dfrac{1}{3}\).

**Question:** Is the sequence 1, 1, 1, 1,... an AP?

**Note:** An AP is completely defined by the first term \(a\) and the common difference \(d\).

In general, if an AP has first term \(a\) and common difference \(d\), then the AP can be written as

\[a,\qquad a+d,\qquad a+2d,\qquad a+3d,\qquad a+4d,\,...\]

\(u_{1}=a\)

\(u_{2}=a+d\)

\(u_{3}=a+2d\)

\(u_{4}=a\,+3d\)

\(\vdots\)

In general, the \(n^{\text{th}}\) term of an AP can be written as

\[\boxed{\mathbf{u_{n}=a+(n-1)d,\ n\in\mathbb{Z}^{+}}}\]

**Example 1**

Consider the arithmetic sequence 4, 11, 18, 25, 32,...

(i) Find an expression for \(u_{n}\), the \(n^{\text{th}}\) term of the sequence.

(ii) Find \(u_{12}\), the \(12^{\text{th}}\) term of the sequence.

(iii) Is (a) 602 (b) 711 a member of this sequence?

**Solution:**

**Think Zone:**

Why must \(n\) be an integer?

Does \(n=86.4\) make sense?

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:32]

**Chapter 6 Sequences & Series**

An **arithmetic series** is the sum of the terms of an arithmetic progression.

Recall that \(S_{n}\) is the sum of the first \(n\) terms in a sequence.

For an AP, the formula of \(S_{n}\) is given by

\[S_{n} = \frac{n}{2}\Big{[}2a\ +\ \big{(}n-1\big{)}d\Big{]}\] \[= \frac{n}{2}\big{(}a+\ l\big{)},\,\text{where}\ l\ \text{is the last term}\]

**Proof (Independent Reading):**

\[S_{n}=\ a+(a+d)+(a+2d)+(a+3d)+(a+4d)+\cdots+[a+(n-2)d]+[a+(n-1)d]\]

We can write the series in two different manner:

\[S_{n}= a+\quad(a+d)+\cdots+[a+(n-2)d]+[a+(n-1)d]\] \[S_{n}= [a+(n-1)d]+[a+(n-2)d]+\cdots+\quad\quad a+d+\quad\quad a\]

Adding these two equations, we have

\[2S_{n}=\underbrace{[2a+(n-1)d]+[2a+(n-1)d]+\cdots+[2a+(n-1)d+[2a+(n-1)d]}_{n \text{ of such terms}}\]

Thus, \(2S_{n}=n[2a+(n-1)d]\)

\[\Rightarrow\quad S_{n}= \frac{n}{2}[2a+(n-1)d]\] \[= \frac{n}{2}[a+a+(n-1)d]\] \[= \frac{n}{2}[a+l]\quad\text{ where}\ l=a+\big{(}n-1\big{)}d\ \ \text{is the}\ n^{\text{th}}\ \text{(or last) term of the sequence}\]

This method of finding \(S_{n}\) of an AP is known as the Gaussian method.

Interesting history behind this method: [https://nrich.maths.org/2478](https://nrich.maths.org/2478)

**Example 4**

The \(8^{\text{th}}\) term of an arithmetic progression is 11 and the \(15^{\text{th}}\) term is 21. Find the sum of the first 20 terms. Find the least number of terms in the progression that must be taken for the sum to exceed 2020.

**Solution:**

\[u_{8}=a+(8-1)d\] **Think Zone:**

## 2 Geometric Progression (GP)

A **geometric progression** (GP) is a sequence in which each term (other than the first term) is obtained from the previous one by multiplying by the same **non-zero** constant (positive or negative) known as **common ratio**, \(r\).

Examples of GP:

(a) 1, 2, 4, 8, 16,... is a GP with first term, \(a=1\) and common ratio, \(r=2\).

(b) 64, \(-16\), 4, \(-1\),... is a GP with first term, \(a=64\) and common ratio, \(r=-\dfrac{1}{4}\).

**Question:** Is 1, 1, 1, 1,... a GP? Can a sequence be both an AP or GP?

In general, if a GP has **first term**\(a\) and **common ratio**\(r\), then the GP can be written as

\(a\), \(ar\), \(ar^{2}\), \(ar^{3}\),...

\(u_{1}=a\)

\(u_{2}=ar\)

\(u_{3}=ar^{2}\)

\(u_{4}=ar^{3}\)

\(\vdots\)

In general, the \(n^{\text{th}}\) term of a GP can be written as

A **geometric series** is the sum of the terms of a geometric progression.

Recall that \(S_{n}\) is the sum of the first \(n\) terms in a sequence.

For a GP, the formula of \(S_{n}\) is given by

\(S_{n}=\dfrac{a\left(1-r^{n}\right)}{1-r}=\dfrac{a\left(r^{n}-1\right)}{r-1}\), \(r\neq 1\)

**Remark:** We will use \(S_{n}=\dfrac{a\left(r^{n}-1\right)}{r-1}\) if \(r>1\) and \(S_{n}=\dfrac{a\left(1-r^{n}\right)}{1-r}\) if \(r<1\).

**Question:** How do we find \(S_{n}\) when \(r=1\)?

**Proof (Independent Reading):**

\(S_{n}=a+ar+ar^{2}+ar^{3}+ar^{4}+...+ar^{n-1}\)................. (1)

\(r\,S_{n}=ar+ar^{2}+ar^{3}+ar^{\prime}+...+ar^{n-1}+ar^{n}\)................. (2)

\((1)-(2)\), \(S_{n}-rS_{n}=a-ar^{n}\)

\((1-r)\,S_{n}=a\left(1-r^{n}\right)\)

\(\therefore S_{n}=\dfrac{a\left(1-r^{n}\right)}{1-r}\)

**Example 6**

The \(3^{\text{rd}}\) term of a geometric progression is 36 and the \(6^{\text{th}}\) term is \(\dfrac{243}{2}\).

Find the smallest value of \(n\) such that the sum to first \(n\) terms of the progression exceeds 1000. [\(a=4\), \(r=3\), smallest \(n=6\)]

**Example 9**

An arithmetic progression has first term \(a\) and non-zero common difference \(d\). The \(n^{\text{th}}\) term, denoted by \(u_{*}\), is such that \(u_{1}\), \(u_{4}\) and \(u_{8}\) are consecutive terms in a geometric progression. Show that \(d=\dfrac{a}{9}\).

**Solution:**

\begin{tabular}{|c|} \hline \(\dfrac{u_{4}}{u_{1}}=\dfrac{u_{8}}{u_{4}}\) \\ \(\dfrac{a+3d}{a}=\dfrac{a+7d}{a+3d}\) \\ \(\left(a+3d\right)^{2}=a\left(a+7d\right)\) \\ \(a^{2}+6ad+9d^{2}=a^{2}+7ad\) \\ \(ad=9d^{2}\) \\ Since \(d\neq 0\), \(a=9d\) \(\Rightarrow\)\(d=\dfrac{a}{9}\) (shown) \\ \hline \end{tabular}

### Sum of an Infinite Geometric Series

Consider the geometric series \(1+\dfrac{1}{2}+\dfrac{1}{4}+\dfrac{1}{8}+\cdots\). The common ratio is \(\dfrac{1}{2}\) and this infinite series converges.

This means that \(S_{n}=\dfrac{a\left(1-r^{n}\right)}{1-r}\) will approach the value of \(\dfrac{a}{1-r}\) when \(n\rightarrow\infty\) if \(\left|r\right|<1\) (since \(r^{n}\to 0\) when \(n\rightarrow\infty\)). Thus, the infinite series converges to \(S_{\infty}=\dfrac{a}{1-r}\) which is known as the sum to infinity.

## 3 Test for Sequences

### Test for an Arithmetic Progression

The sequence \(u_{1},u_{2},u_{3}\),... \(u_{s}\),... is an AP **if and only if**

\[\boxed{u_{s+1}-u_{s}=\mbox{constant (i.e. independent of $n$) for all positive integers $n$.}}\]

This constant is the **common difference**\(d\).

**Note**:

In general, the \(n^{\mbox{\scriptsize th}}\) term of \(\underline{\mbox{ANY}}\) sequence can be written as \(u_{n}=S_{n}-S_{n-1}\), \(n\in\mathbb{Z}^{+}\), \(n\geq 2\)

**Example 13**:

The sum of the first \(n\) terms of a progression is \(n^{2}+3n\). Find an expression for the \(n^{\mbox{\scriptsize th}}\) term and show that the progression is arithmetic.

**Solution:**

\(S_{n}=n^{2}+3n\)

\(S_{n-1}=(n-1)^{2}+3(n-1)\)

\(n^{2}+n-2\)

\(\therefore\)\(u_{n}=S_{n}-S_{n-1}\)

\(\therefore\)\(u_{n}=S_{n}-S_{n-1}\)

\(\therefore\)\(u_{n}=2+3n-(n^{2}+n-2)\)

\(\therefore\)\(u_{s+1}-u_{s}=\left[2(n+1)+2\right]-\left[2n+2\right]\)

\(\therefore\)\(u_{s+1}-u_{s}\)

\(\therefore\)\(u_{s+1}-u_{s}\)

\(\therefore\)\(u_{s+1}-u_{s}\)

\(\therefore\)\(u_{s}=2\)

Is the progression also arithmetic when the sum of the first \(n\) terms is equal to any quadratic expression?

### Test for a Geometric Progression

The sequence \(u_{1},u_{2},u_{3}\),... \(u_{s}\),... is a GP **if and only if**

\[\boxed{u_{n+1}=\mbox{constant (independent of $n$) for all positive integers $n$.}}\]

This constant is the **common ratio**, \(r\).

**Note**:

In general, the \(n^{\mbox{\scriptsize th}}\) term of \(\underline{\mbox{ANY}}\) sequence can be written as \(u_{n}=S_{n}-S_{n-1}\), \(n\in\mathbb{Z}^{+}\), \(n\geq 2\)

**Example 14**:

The sum of the first \(n\) terms of a progression is \(3^{n}-1\). Show that it is geometric. State the common ratio and the first term. Find the value of \(n\) for which the difference between the sum of the first \(2n\) terms and the sum of the first \(n\) terms is \(6480\).

**Solution:**

Given \(S_{n}=3^{n}-1\)

**Think Zone**

It is insufficient to conclude that the progression is geometric by only showing \(\frac{u_{3}}{u_{2}}=\frac{u_{2}}{u_{1}}=\text{constant}\,.\)

You **MUST** work with the general term to show.

\(u_{1}=S_{1}=3^{1}-1=2\)

Common ratio, \(r=3\)

Why is there a modulus sign? _difference_

Why is the modulus sign removed? _\(\frac{S_{2n}}{S_{1n}}\)_

Algebraic way of solving:

\((3^{n})^{2}-3^{n}-6480=0\)

Let \(y=3^{n}\,,\) then \(y^{2}-y-6480=0\)

Using GC (use APPS - PlySmlt2),

\(y=3^{n}=-80\) (rejected) or \(y=3^{n}=81=3^{4}\)

\(:\). \(n=4\)

(a) The sum of the first \(n\) terms of a progression is \(21n-3n^{2}\). Show that it is arithmetic.

(b) The sum of the first \(n\) terms of a progression is \(\frac{3^{n+1}-3}{2}\,.\) Show that it is geometric.

**SECTION B: \(\Sigma\) - The Summation Notation**

**1. Introduction and Terminologies**

The sum of a series can be written using the '\(\Sigma\)' (read as 'Sigma") notation. The notation '\(\Sigma\)' is the capital letter of the Greek alphabet \(\sigma\) which corresponds to the word'sum'. We will study some standard results associated with the sigma notation and use them in summing some standard series.

Suppose we want to express the sum of all positive **integers** from 1 to 100 (inclusive). We may write it as '\(1+2+3+...+100\)'without listing all the 100 integers. Using the sigma notation, this sum can be written even more concisely as \(\sum_{r=1}^{100}r\), i.e. \(\sum_{r=1}^{100}r=1+2+3+...+100\).

We read this as "the sum of terms of the form \(r\), where \(r\) takes all integer values from 1 to 100".

Consider another example: \(\sum_{r=4}^{10}\frac{1}{2^{r}}=\frac{1}{2^{4}}+\frac{1}{2^{5}}+\cdots+\frac{1} {2^{10}}\). From this example, it is worth to note the following:

1. The first integer value that \(r\) takes need not necessarily be 1.
2. The series can be written in another way using the sigma notation. For example, we may write the series as \(\sum_{r=3}^{5}\frac{1}{2^{r+1}}=\frac{1}{2^{4}}+\frac{1}{2^{5}}+\cdots+\frac{1 }{2^{10}}\). Check to see for yourself that the new representation give the same series. In fact, there are many different ways of writing the same series using the sigma notation. In other words, there is no unique way of expressing a series using the sigma notation.

In general, let \(u_{m},u_{m+1},u_{m+2},\ldots,u_{n}\) be a sequence of numbers where \(m\leq n\). Then the sum \(u_{m}+u_{m+1}+u_{m+2}+\cdots+u_{n}\) can be expressed as \(\sum_{r=m}^{n}u_{r}\).

**Note:**

1. '\(u_{r}\)' is called the **general term** of the summation. It is used to denote an expression written in terms of \(r\) only. In other words, we say that \(u_{r}\) is a **function** of \(r\). However, it is possible for \(u_{r}\) to be a **constant**.
2. The letter '\(r\)' is called the **index** of the summation which takes **only integer** values. It is a **dummy variable** used to denote the integer values that must be 'fed into' \(u_{r}\) to generate the entire series. The variable '\(r\)' can thus be replaced by another variable say '\(i\)'. For example, \(\sum_{r=m}^{n}u_{r}=\sum_{i=n}^{n}u_{i}\) as both represent the same series.
3. The first integer value '\(m\)' and the last integer value '\(n\)' that \(r\) takes are called the **lower limit** and the **upper limit** of the summation respectively. The lower limit is never larger than the upper limit. That is, \(m\leq n\).
4. The number of terms of the series is given by \(n-m+1\).

Note: Recall in the chapter of AP/GP, you have learnt that \(S_{n}\) represents the sum of the first \(n\) terms of a series, so in summation notation, we will write \(S_{n}=\sum_{r=1}^{n}u_{r}\) where \(u_{r}\) represents the \(r^{\rm th}\) term of the AP/GP sequence.

## Chapter 3 Properties and Standard Results of Summation

### 3.1 Properties of Summation

For any two integers \(m\) and \(n\) such that \(m\leq n\), and for any constant \(a\),

\[1. \sum_{r=m}^{n}\bigl{[}\mathrm{f}(r)\pm\mathrm{g}(r)\bigr{]}=\sum_{r =m}^{n}\mathrm{f}(r)\pm\sum_{r=m}^{n}\mathrm{g}(r)\] \[2. \sum_{r=m}^{n}\bigl{[}a\mathrm{f}(r)\bigr{]}=a\biggl{[}\sum_{r=m} ^{n}\mathrm{f}(r)\biggr{]}\] \[3. \sum_{r=m}^{n}\mathrm{f}(r)=\sum_{r=1}^{n}\mathrm{f}(r)-\sum_{r=1 }^{n-1}\mathrm{f}(r)\quad(\text{for $m>1$})\] where \(\mathrm{f}(r)\) and \(\mathrm{g}(r)\) are denoted as some functions of \(r\).

**Proof:**

Proof of Property 1 [Independent Reading]:

\[\sum_{r=m}^{n}\bigl{[}\mathrm{f}(r)\pm\mathrm{g}(r)\bigr{]} =\bigl{[}\mathrm{f}(m)\pm\mathrm{g}(m)\bigr{]}+\bigl{[}\mathrm{f} \bigl{(}m+1\bigr{)}\pm\mathrm{g}(m+1)\bigr{]}+\cdots+\bigl{[}\mathrm{f}(n)\pm \mathrm{g}(n)\bigr{]}\] \[=\bigl{[}\mathrm{f}(m)+\mathrm{f}(m+1)+\cdots+\mathrm{f}(n) \bigr{]}\pm\bigl{[}\mathrm{g}(m)+\mathrm{g}(m+1)+\cdots+\mathrm{g}(n)\bigr{]} \bigr{]}\] (regrouping) \[=\sum_{r=m}^{n}\mathrm{f}(r)\pm\sum_{r=m}^{n}\mathrm{g}(r).\]

Proof of Property 2 [Independent Reading]:

\[\sum_{r=m}^{n}\bigl{[}a\mathrm{f}(r)\bigr{]} =a\mathrm{f}\bigl{(}m\bigr{)}+a\mathrm{f}\bigl{(}m+1\bigr{)}+ \cdots+a\mathrm{f}\bigl{(}n\bigr{)}\] \[=a\Bigl{[}\mathrm{f}\bigl{(}m\bigr{)}+\mathrm{f}\bigl{(}m+1 \bigr{)}+\cdots+\mathrm{f}\bigl{(}n\bigr{)}\bigr{]}=a\biggl{[}\sum_{r=m}^{n} \mathrm{f}(r)\biggr{]}\] Proof of Property 3:

\[\sum_{r=m}^{n}\mathrm{f}(r) =\mathrm{f}\bigl{(}m\bigr{)}+\mathrm{f}\bigl{(}m+1\bigr{)}+\cdots +\mathrm{f}\bigl{(}n\bigr{)}\] \[=\bigl{[}\mathrm{f}(1)+\mathrm{f}(2)+\cdots+\mathrm{f}\bigl{(}m-1 \bigr{)}+\mathrm{f}\bigl{(}m\bigr{)}+\mathrm{f}\bigl{(}m+1\bigr{)}+\cdots+ \mathrm{f}\bigl{(}n\bigr{)}\bigr{]}\] \[\quad-\bigl{[}\mathrm{f}(1)+\mathrm{f}(2)+\cdots+\mathrm{f} \bigl{(}m-1\bigr{)}\bigr{]}\] \[=\sum_{r=1}^{n}\mathrm{f}(r)-\sum_{r=1}^{n-1}\mathrm{f}(r).\]

### 3.2 Standard Results of Summation

\[1. \sum_{r=m}^{n}a=\bigl{(}n-m+1\bigr{)}a\quad\text{where $a$ is a constant, }\ n\geq 1\text{ and $m\leq n$.}\] In particular, when \(m=1\), \(\sum_{r=1}^{n}a=na\). E.g. \(\sum_{r=3}^{10}7=7+7+7+7+7+7+7=\bigl{(}10-3+1\bigr{)}(7)=8(7)=56\)

**Solution**

(a) \(\sum_{r=0}^{n}\bigl{(}2n+1-2r\bigr{)}=\sum_{r=0}^{n}(2n+1)-2\sum_{r=0}^{n}r\)

Note that \(r\) is the _dummy variable_ which is changing and \(n\) is a _constant_ which remains unchanged as \(r\) changes.

\(=\bigl{(}n-0+1\bigr{)}(2n+1)-2\bigl{(}0+1+2+...+n\bigr{)}\)

\(=\bigl{(}n+1\bigr{)}(2n+1)-2\Bigl{[}\frac{n}{2}\bigl{(}1+n\bigr{)}\Bigr{]}\)

**Solution**

(a) \(\sum_{r=1}^{2n}\bigl{(}2r-1\bigr{)}^{2}\)

To simplify \(\sum_{r=n+1}^{2n}r^{2}\), we use the property \(\sum_{r=n}^{n}\mathrm{f}(r)=\sum_{r=1}^{n}\mathrm{f}(r)-\sum_{r=1}^{n-1} \mathrm{f}(r)\) to rewrite the sum as a difference of two sums both of which start from \(r=1\). This would then allow us to use the result \(\sum_{r=1}^{n}r^{2}=\frac{n}{6}(n+1)(2n+1)\).

However, this procedure is not used for \(\sum_{r=n+1}^{2n}r\) as it is an arithmetic series. The sum can be obtained by applying the result:

\(=\frac{2n}{3}\bigl{(}2n+1\bigr{)}\bigl{(}7n+1\bigr{)}-n\bigl{(}6n+1\bigr{)}\)

However, this procedure is not used for \(\sum_{r=n+1}^{2n}r\) as it is an arithmetic series.

The sum can be obtained by applying the result:

\(=\frac{n}{3}\bigl{(}28n^{2}-1\bigr{)}\) (shown)

(b) Find, in terms of \(n\), the sum \(4\times 3\,+\,7\times 5\,+\,10\times 7\,+\,\cdots\,+\,\) to \(n\) terms.

**Solution**: (a) \(\sum_{r=1}^{n}r(r+1)(r+2)\)

\(=\sum_{r=1}^{n}\big{(}r^{3}+3r^{2}+2r\big{)}\)

\(=\frac{n^{2}\left(n+1\right)^{2}}{4}+3\bigg{[}\frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6}\bigg{]}+2 \bigg{[}\frac{n(n+1)}{2}\bigg{]}\)

\(=\frac{n(n+1)}{4}\big{[}n(n+1)+2(2n+1)+4\big{]}\)

**Factorise!**: \(=\frac{n(n+1)(n^{2}+5n+6)}{4}\)
