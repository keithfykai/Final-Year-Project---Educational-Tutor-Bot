## Preamble

This preamble sets out the approach, objectives, directions and philosophy of the H1 Biology syllabus.

In Singapore, Biology education from Primary to A-Level has been organised as a continuum in the following manner:

* from Primary 3 to Primary 6, students learn about how life works at the systems level
* from Lower Secondary Science to O-Level Biology, students learn about how life works at the physiological level
* at A-Level, students learn about how life works at the cellular and molecular levels while understanding the implications of these at the macro level.

At A-Level, students have the choice of offering Biology at H1 or H2 levels. While H2 Science develops in our students the disciplinary understanding, skills and attitudes necessary for further studies in the subject and related fields, H1 Science is designed to broaden students' learning in a way that will support the development of scientific literacy. The H1 Biology syllabus is distilled from the H2 Biology syllabus and key changes to the H1 Science curriculum are in tandem with the changes in the H2 Science curriculum.

The Biology syllabus is developed as a seamless continuum from O-Level to A-Level, without the need for topics to be revisited at A-Level. The O-Level syllabus is foundational and thus should provide the necessary background for study at A-Level. Students who intend to offer H1 Biology will therefore be assumed to have knowledge and understanding of O-Level Biology, either as a single subject or as part of a balanced science course.

Many new and important fields of biology have emerged through recent advancements in life sciences. Vast amounts of knowledge have been generated, as evident from the sprouting of scientific journals catering to niche areas of research. As such, this syllabus refines and updates the content knowledge of the previous syllabus (8875) so that students can keep up to date with knowledge that is relevant for their participation in a technology-driven economy.

## Introduction

Candidates will be assumed to have knowledge and understanding of O-Level Biology, as a single subject or as part of a balanced science course.

The syllabus has been arranged in the form of Core and Extension content to be studied by all candidates. The syllabus places emphasis on the applications of biology and the impact of recent developments on the needs of contemporary society.

Experimental work is an important component and should underpin the teaching and learning of biology.

The value of learning H1 Biology ultimately hinges on the development of a scientific mind and disposition while addressing the broader questions of what life is and how life is sustained. The Science Curriculum Framework developed by the Ministry of Education elaborates on the development of the scientific mind and disposition.

Through the study of the H1 Biology course, students should become scientifically literate citizens who are well prepared for the challenges of the 21st century.

## Aims

The syllabus aims to:

1. provide students with an experience that develops their interest in biology and builds the knowledge, skills and attitudes necessary for them to become scientifically literate citizens who are well prepared for the challenges of the 21st century
2. develop in students the understanding, skills, ethics and attitudes relevant to the _Practices of Science_, including the following: 1. understanding the nature of scientific knowledge 2.2 demonstrating science inquiry skills 2.3 relating science and society
3. address the broader questions of what life is and how life is sustained, including: 1. understanding life at the cellular and molecular levels, and making connections to how these micro-systems interact at the physiological and organismal levels 3.2 recognising the evolving nature of biological knowledge 3.3 stimulating interest in and demonstrating care for the local and global environment.

## Practices of Science

Science as a discipline is more than the acquisition of a _body of knowledge_ (e.g. scientific facts, concepts, laws and theories); it is a way of knowing and doing. It includes an understanding of the nature of scientific knowledge and how this knowledge is generated, established and communicated. Scientists rely on a set of established procedures and practices associated with scientific inquiry to gather evidence and test their ideas on how the natural world works. However, there is no single method and the real process of science is often complex and iterative, following many different paths. While science is powerful, generating knowledge that forms the basis for many technological feats and innovations, it has limitations.

The _Practices of Science_ are explicitly articulated in the syllabus to allow teachers to embed them as learning objectives in their lessons. Students' understanding of the nature and limitations of science and scientific inquiry are developed effectively when the practices are taught in the context of relevant science content. Attitudes relevant to science such as _inquistiveness_, _concern for accuracy_ and _precision_, _objectivity_, _integrity_ and _pers_ever_ance should be emphasised in the teaching of these practices where appropriate. For example, students learning science should be introduced to the use of technology as an aid in practical work or as a tool for the interpretation of experimental and theoretical results.

The _Practices of Science_ comprise three components:

1. **Understanding the Nature of Scientific Knowledge** 1.1 Understand that science is an evidence-based, model-building enterprise concerned with the natural world 1.2 Understand that the use of both logic and creativity is required in the generation of scientific knowledge 1.3 Recognise that scientific knowledge is generated from consensus within the community of scientists through a process of critical debate and peer review 1.4 Understand that scientific knowledge is reliable and durable, yet subject to revision in the light of new evidence

## 2 Demonstrating Science Inquiry Skills

### 2.1 Identify scientific problems, observe phenomena and pose scientific questions/hypotheses

2 Plan and conduct investigations by selecting the appropriate experimental procedures, apparatus and materials, with due regard for accuracy, precision and safety

### 2.3 Obtain, organise and represent data in an appropriate manner

### 2.4 Analyse and interpret data

5 Construct explanations based on evidence and justify these explanations through sound reasoning and logical argument

### 2.6 Use appropriate models1 to explain concepts, solve problems and make predictions

Footnote 1: A model is a representation of an idea, an object, a process or a system that is used to describe and explain phenomena that cannot be experienced directly. Models exist in different forms, from the concrete, such as physical scale models, to the abstract, such as diagrams or mathematical expressions. The use of models involves the understanding that all models contain approximations and assumptions limiting their validity and predictive power.

### 2.7 Make decisions based on evaluation of evidence, processes, claims and conclusions

### 2.8 Communicate scientific findings and information using appropriate language and terminology

#### 3.8.1 Relating Science and Society

8.2 Recognise that the application of scientific knowledge to problem solving could be influenced by other considerations such as economic, social, environmental and ethical factors

8.3 Demonstrate an understanding of the benefits and risks associated with the application of science to society

8.4 Use scientific principles and reasoning to understand, analyse and evaluate real-world systems, as well as to generate solutions for problem solving

## 4 CURLICULUM FRAMEWORK

The rapid progress in the field of life sciences poses a challenge for Biology education, especially in terms of designing a framework that integrates fundamental knowledge, skills and attitudes. With this in mind, this syllabus has adopted a framework that will chart a new direction for Biology education. An overview of this framework is depicted in Fig. 1: H1 Biology Curriculum Framework.

The _Practices of Science_ are common to the natural sciences of Physics, Chemistry and Biology. These practices highlight the ways of thinking and doing that are inherent in the scientific approach, with the aim of equipping students with the understanding, skills, and attitudes shared by the scientific disciplines, including an appropriate approach to ethical issues.

The content in this H1 Biology syllabus is organised around four _Core Ideas_ of Biology and an _Extension Topic_. The _Learning Experiences2_ refer to a range of learning opportunities selected by teachers to link the biology content of the _Core Ideas_ and _Extension Topic_ with the _Practices of Science_, to enhance students' learning of the concepts. Rather than being mandatory, teachers are encouraged to incorporate _Learning Experiences_ that match the interests and abilities of their students and provide opportunities to illustrate and exemplify the _Practices of Science_, where appropriate. Real-world contexts can help illustrate the biology concepts and their applications. Experimental activities and ICT tools can also be used to build students' understanding.

Footnote 2: _Learning Experiences_ can be found in the Teaching and Learning Syllabus.

The _Extension Topic_ is based on important emerging biological issues impacting both the local and global contexts. It requires students to demonstrate assimilation of the _Core Ideas_ and extend their knowledge and understanding to real-world challenges. Furthermore, the _Extension Topic_ will equip students with the necessary knowledge and process skills to make informed decisions about scientific issues. In line with this, the _Extension Topic_ chosen is _Impact of Climate Change_. The _Extension Topic_ takes up about 10% of the total H1 Biology curriculum.

Students are expected to study all four _Core Ideas_ and the _Extension Topic_.

Figure 1: H1 Biology Curriculum Framework

## Assessment Objectives

The _Assessment Objectives_ listed below reflect those parts of the _Aims and Practices of Science_ that will be assessed.

### Knowledge with understanding

Candidates should be able to demonstrate knowledge with understanding in relation to:

1. scientific phenomena, facts, laws, definitions, concepts and theories
2. scientific vocabulary, terminology and conventions (including symbols, quantities and units)
3. scientific instruments and apparatus, including techniques of operation and aspects of safety
4. scientific quantities and their determination
5. scientific and technological applications with their social, economic and environmental implications.

The syllabus content defines the factual materials that candidates need to recall and explain. Questions testing the objectives above will often begin with one of the following words: _define, state, name, describe, explain or outline_ (see the _Glossary of Terms_).

### Handling, applying and evaluating information

Candidates should be able (in words or by using symbolic, graphical and numerical forms of presentation) to:

1. locate, select, organise, interpret and present information from a variety of sources
2. handle information, distinguishing the relevant from the extraneous
3. manipulate numerical and other data and translate information from one form to another
4. present reasoned explanations for phenomena, patterns, trends and relationships
5. make comparisons that may include the identification of similarities and differences
6. analyse and evaluate information to identify patterns, report trends, draw inferences, report conclusions and construct arguments
7. justify decisions, make predictions and propose hypotheses
8. apply knowledge, including principles, to novel situations
9. use skills, knowledge and understanding from different areas of Biology to solve problems
10. organise and present information, ideas and arguments clearly and coherently, using appropriate language.

These _Assessment Objectives_ above cannot be precisely specified in the syllabus content because questions testing such skills are often based on information which is unfamiliar to the candidate. In answering such questions, candidates are required to use principles and concepts that are within the syllabus and apply them in a logical, reasoned or deductive manner to a novel situation. Questions testing these objectives may begin with one of the following words: _discuss, predict, suggest, calculate_ or _determine_ (see the _Glossary of Terms_).

## 6 SCHEME OF ASSESSMENT

All candidates are required to enter for Papers 1 and 2.

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|} \hline
**Paper** & **Type of Paper** & **Duration** & **Weighting (\%)** & **Marks** \\ \hline
**1** & **Multiple Choice** & 1 h & 33 & 30 \\ \hline
**2** & **Structured and Free-response Questions** & 2 h & 67 & 60 \\ \hline \end{tabular}

_Paper 1_ (1 h, 30 marks)

This paper will consist of 30 compulsory multiple choice questions. All questions will be of the direct choice type with 4 options.

_Paper 2_ (2 h, 60 marks)

This paper will comprise two sections. Paper 2 will include questions that assess the higher-order skills of analysing, making conclusions and evaluating information and require candidates to integrate knowledge and understanding from different areas of the syllabus.

_Section A_ (45 marks) will consist of a variable number of structured questions, all compulsory, including at least one data-based or comprehension-type question. The data-based question(s) will constitute 10-15 marks of the paper.

_Section B_ (15 marks) will consist of two free-response questions, from which candidates will choose **one**. The quality of scientific argumentation and written communication will be given a percentage of the marks available.

**Weighting of Assessment Objectives**

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|} \hline
**A** & **Knowledge with understanding** & **40** & **Papers 1 and 2** \\ \hline
**B** & **Handling, applying and evaluating information** & **60** & **Papers 1 and 2** \\ \hline \end{tabular}

## Additional Information

Modern biological sciences draw extensively on concepts from the physical sciences. It is desirable therefore that, by the end of the course, students should have knowledge of the following topics, sufficient to aid understanding of biological systems. No questions will be set directly on them except where relevant to the assessment of a Learning Outcome.

* The electromagnetic spectrum
* Energy changes (potential energy, activation energy, chemical bond energy)
* Molecules, atoms, ions, electrons
* Acids, bases, pH, buffers
* Isotopes, including radioactive isotopes
* Oxidation and reduction
* Hydrolysis, condensation

### Nomenclature

Candidates will be expected to be familiar with the nomenclature used in the syllabus. The proposals in "_Signs_, _Symbols and Systematics_" (The Association for Science Education Companion to 16-19 Science, 2000) and the recommendations on terms, units and symbols in "_Biological Nomenclature_" (2009) published by the Institute of Biology, in conjunction with the ASE, will generally be adopted although the traditional names sulfate, sulfite, nitrate, nitrite, sulfurous acid and nitrous acid will be used in question papers. Sulfur (and all compounds of sulfur) will be spelt with f (not with ph) in question papers. However, candidates can use either spelling in their answers.

### Disallowed Subject Combinations

Candidates may not simultaneously offer Biology at H1 and H2 levels.

### Mathematical Requirements

Questions set in the examination may involve the basic processes of mathematics for the calculation and use of decimals, means, ratios and percentages.

Candidates may be required to (i) construct graphs or present data in other suitable graphical forms, and (ii) calculate rates of processes. Candidates should be aware of the problems of drawing conclusions from limited data.

### Calculators

Any calculator used must be on the Singapore Examinations and Assessment Board list of approved calculators.

### Units and Significant Figures

Candidates should be aware that misuse of units and/or significant figures, e.g. failure to quote units where necessary, the inclusion of units in quantities defined as ratios or quoting answers to an inappropriate number of significant figures, is liable to be penalised.

## Glossary of Terms

It is hoped that the glossary (which is relevant only to science subjects) will prove helpful to candidates as a guide; it is neither exhaustive nor definitive. The glossary has been deliberately kept brief not only with respect to the number of terms included but also to the descriptions of their meanings. Candidates should appreciate that the meaning of a term must depend in part on its context.

1. _Analyse_ is a context-specific term involving the identification of the constituent parts of a complex situation or result, an assessment of their individual implications and a consideration of how these relate to one another and to scientific knowledge and understanding. Analysis may require further processing of mathematical data to reveal underlying trends and patterns.
2. _Calculate_ is used when a numerical answer is required. In general, working should be shown, especially where two or more steps are involved.
3. _Classify_ requires candidates to group things based on common characteristics.
4. _Comment_ is intended as an open-ended instruction, inviting candidates to recall or infer points of interest relevant to the context of the question, taking account of the number of marks available.
5. _Compare_ requires candidates to provide both the similarities and differences between things or concepts.
6. _Deduce_ is used in a similar way as predict except that some supporting statement is required, e.g. reference to a law/principle, or the necessary reasoning is to be included in the answer.
7. _Define_ (the term(s)...) is intended literally. Only a formal statement or equivalent paraphrase is required.
8. _Describe_ requires candidates to state in words (using diagrams where appropriate) the main points of the topic. It is often used with reference either to particular phenomena or to particular experiments. In the former instance, the term usually implies that the answer should include reference to (visual) observations associated with the phenomena. In other contexts, describe and give an account of should be interpreted more generally, i.e. the candidate has greater discretion about the nature and the organisation of the material to be included in the answer. Describe and explain may be coupled in a similar way to state and explain.
9. _Determine_ often implies that the quantity concerned cannot be measured directly but is obtained by calculation, substituting measured or known values of other quantities into a standard formula, e.g. relative molecular mass.
10. _Discuss_ requires candidates to give a critical account of the points involved in the topic.
11. _Draw_ is often used in the context of drawing biological specimens. This is an instruction to make a freehand diagram to show the structures observed, as accurately as possible with respect to shape and proportion. Lines delimiting distinct regions should be continuous. In other contexts, this will require an accurate representation of the required subject according to the applicable conventions and criteria, e.g. draw the structure of a molecule of glucose
12. _Estimate_ implies a reasoned order of magnitude statement or calculation of the quantity concerned, making such simplifying assumptions as may be necessary about points of principle and about the values of quantities not otherwise included in the question.
13. _Evaluate_ is a context-specific term requiring a critical use of information to make a judgement or determination of a particular value or quality (e.g. accuracy). Evaluation of the validity of an experimental procedure, a set of results or a conclusion involves an assessment of the extent to which the procedures, results or conclusions are likely to obtain or represent a 'true' outcome. This will require consideration of the advantages and disadvantages, strengths and weaknesses, and limitations of the underlying approach, as well as other relevant criteria as applicable, and their relative importance.
14. _Explain_ may imply reasoning or some reference to theory, depending on the context.

15. _Find_ is a general term that may variously be interpreted as calculate, measure, determine, etc.
16. _Justify_ requires candidates to give reasoning in support of an answer (for example, a decision, conclusion, explanation or claim), based on a consideration of available evidence, including experimental data, together with relevant scientific knowledge and understanding.
17. _Label_ requires candidates to use an appropriate label (and labelling line, where necessary) to accurately show the position of a structure, region or point within a diagram or graph, according to the requirements of the assessment.
18. _List_ requires a number of points, generally each of one word, with no elaboration. Where a given number of points is specified, this should not be exceeded.
19. _Measure_ implies that the quantity concerned can be directly obtained from a suitable measuring instrument, e.g. length, using a rule, or angle, using a protractor.
20. _Outline_ implies brevity, i.e. restricting the answer to giving essentials.
21. _Predict_ implies that the candidate is not expected to produce the required answer by recall but by making a logical connection between other pieces of information. Such information may be wholly given in the question or may depend on answers extracted in an early part of the question.
22. _Recognise_ is often used to identify facts, characteristics or concepts that are critical (relevant/ appropriate) to the understanding of a situation, event, process or phenomenon.
23. _Sketch_, when applied to graph work, implies that the shape and/or position of the curve need only be qualitatively correct, but candidates should be aware that, depending on the context, some quantitative aspects may be looked for, e.g. passing through the origin, having an intercept, asymptote or discontinuity at a particular value. In diagrams, sketch implies that a simple, freehand drawing is acceptable; nevertheless, care should be taken over proportions and the clear exposition of important details.
24. _State_ implies a concise answer with little or no supporting argument, e.g. a numerical answer that can be obtained 'by inspection'.
25. _Suggest_ is used in two main contexts, i.e. either to imply that there is no unique answer (e.g. in chemistry, two or more substances may satisfy the given conditions describing an 'unknown'), or to imply that candidates are expected to apply their general knowledge to a 'novel' situation, one that may be formally not in the syllabus'.
26. _What is meant by (the term(s)...)_ normally implies that a definition should be given, together with some relevant comment on the significance or context of the term(s) concerned, especially where two or more terms are included in the question. The amount of supplementary comment intended should be interpreted in the light of the indicated mark value.
