## 1 Introduction

* General formula: **Cn**H**2n+1X
* Halogenoalkanes are also known as alkyl halides.
* They can be classified as **primary**, **secondary or tertiary** halogenoalkanes depending on the number of alkyl or aryl groups attached to the C atom of the C-X bond.

\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|c|} \hline Type of & Primary & Secondary & Tertiary \\ halogenoalkane & & & \\ \hline Structure & & & \\  & & & \\  & & & \\  & & & \\  & & & \\ \hline Carbon bonded & & & \\ to halogen X is & 1 alkyl or aryl group & 2 alkyl or aryl groups & 3 alkyl or aryl groups \\ bonded to & & & \\ \hline \end{tabular} Note: R groups **may or may not** be the same.
* Nomenclature Halogenoalkanes are named in a similar manner to alkanes where the suffix ends in -ane and the halogens are treated as substituents and named as prefixes such as chloro-, homo-, iodo-. Examples: (i) CH3CH2Br (ii) CH3CH2Br (iii) CH3CH3CH3

Physical Properties

### Boiling Point

* Halogenoalkanes have a **higher boiling point** than alkanes with the same number of carbon atoms as there are **permanent dipole-permanent dipole** attractions between polar RX molecules and also **stronger instantaneous dipole-induced dipole interactions** due to the **greater number of electrons** present.
* For a given alkyl group, boiling point increases with increasing A\({}_{r}\) of the halogen. i.e. boiling point of RC/ < RBr < RI

### Solubility

* In spite of the C-X bond being polar, halogenoalkanes are **insoluble in water** due to their **inability to form hydrogen bonds with water**.
* They are **soluble** in **organic solvents** whereby the energy released from solute-solvent interactions is sufficient to overcome the solute-solute and the solvent-solvent interactions.

## 3 Preparation of halogenoalkanes

### Nucleophilic substitution of alcohols (using ethanol as an example)

* CH\({}_{3}\)CH\({}_{2}\)**OH** + PC\(I_{5}\)\(\rightarrow\) CH\({}_{3}\)CH\({}_{2}\)**CI** + HC\(I\) + POC\(I_{3}\)\(\rightarrow\) _Remember the by-products HCl (steamy white fumes) and POC\(I_{3}\)_ Reagents and conditions: PC\(I_{5}\)

Note: PC\(I_{5}\) provides the nucleophilic, C\(I^{-}\)
* 3CH\({}_{3}\)CH\({}_{2}\)**OH** + PX\({}_{3}\)\(\rightarrow\) 3CH\({}_{3}\)CH\({}_{2}\)**X** + H\({}_{3}\)PO\({}_{3}\)\(\rightarrow\) _Remember the by-product H\({}_{3}\)PO\({}_{3}\)_ Reagents and conditions: PC\(I_{3}\) or PB\({}_{3}\), heat

PX\({}_{3}\) provides the nucleophilic, X\({}^{-}\)

Note:

* Phosphorus triiodide, PI\({}_{3}\) is very **unstable** and so it is prepared _in situ_ (at site of reaction). The alcohol is heated with red P and I\({}_{2}\) to produce PI\({}_{3}\) in situ which then reacts with the alcohol to form the iodoalkane.

2P + 3I\({}_{2}\)\(\rightarrow\) 2PI\({}_{3}\)
* CH\({}_{3}\)CH\({}_{2}\)**OH** + SOC\(I_{2}\)\(\rightarrow\) CH\({}_{3}\)CH\({}_{2}\)**CI** + HC\(I\) + SO\({}_{2}\)\(\rightarrow\) _Remember the by-products HC\(I\) (steamy white fumes) and SO\({}_{2}\)_Reagents and conditions: SOC\(l_{2}\), heat Note: SOC\(l_{2}\) provides the nucleophile, C\(l\)-
* CH\({}_{3}\)CH\({}_{2}\)**OH** + HX \(\rightarrow\) CH\({}_{3}\)CH\({}_{2}\)**_X_ + H\({}_{2}\)O (where X=C\(l\), Br, I) _Remember the by-product H\({}_{2}\)O_ Reagents and conditions: HX(g), heat Note: For HC\(l\)(g), ZnC\(l_{2}\) catalyst is needed.

### Electrophilic addition of hydrogen halides (HX) to alkenes

Note: Markovnikov's rule is followed.

## 4 Reactions of halogenalkanes

* C-X bond is **polar** due to the presence of the **electronegative** halogen atom. Hence, halogenalkanes are chemically very reactive.
* Halogenoalkanes undergo **nucleophilic substitution** as the electron-deficient C atom in the C-X bond carries a partial positive charge which enabled it to attract a nucleophile, leading to substitution of the halogen.
* Halogenoalkanes also undergo **elimination** (using alcoholic OH\({}^{-}\)).

### Nucleophilic substitution _Learning objective: (a)(i)_

* **Formation of alcohol** CH\({}_{3}\)CH\({}_{2}\)**Br** + OH\({}^{-}\)\(\rightarrow\) CH\({}_{3}\)CH\({}_{2}\)**OH** + Br\({}^{-}\) _Remember the by-product Br\({}^{-}\)_ Nucleophile: OH\({}^{-}\)
* Reagents and conditions: NaOH(aq) or KOH(aq), heat _MUST specify the state symbol (aq)_ This reaction is also known as alkaline hydrolysis.

**RCN + 2H\({}_{2}\)O + H\({}^{+}\)\(\rightarrow\) RCO\({}_{2}\)H + NH\({}_{4}\)**: _Know how to write the balanced equation_

Reagents and conditions: H\({}_{2}\)SO\({}_{4}\)(aq), heat _MUST include the state symbol (aq)_
* Nitrules can also be **reduced to primary amines**.

**RCN + 4[H] \(\rightarrow\) RCH\({}_{2}\)NH\({}_{2}\)**: _Know how to write the balanced equation_

Reagents and conditions: LiAlH\({}_{4}\) in dry ether

: H\({}_{2}\), Ni catalyst, heat

: H\({}_{2}\), Pt or Pd catalyst
**(c) Formation of amine**

CH\({}_{3}\)CH\({}_{2}\)Br + NH\({}_{3}\)\(\rightarrow\) CH\({}_{3}\)CH\({}_{2}\)NH\({}_{2}\) + HBr _Remember the by-product HBr_
* Nucleophile: NH\({}_{3}\)
* Reagents and conditions: _MUST specify "excess", the Excess NH\({}_{3}\) in ethanol or **excess** ethanolic NH\({}_{3}\), heat in sealed tube _solvent eg ethanol and "heat in sealed tube"_
* If **limited NH\({}_{3}\) in ethanol which means excess CH\({}_{3}\)CH\({}_{2}\)Br is used**, the primary amine that is formed initially would get a chance to react with another halogenoalkane, resulting in the formation of more highly substituted amines in a series of reactions as shown below.

CH\({}_{3}\)CH\({}_{2}\)Br + NH\({}_{3}\)\(\rightarrow\) CH\({}_{3}\)CH\({}_{2}\)NH\({}_{2}\) + HBr

* _Mechanism for primary halogenalkanes_ Bimolecular Nucleophilic Substitution (S\({}_{N}\)2) e.g. CH\({}_{3}\)CH\({}_{2}\)Br + NaOH \(\rightarrow\) CH\({}_{3}\)CH\({}_{2}\)OH + NaBr _Learning objective: (b)(ii) and (c)(i)_
* _Nucleophile OH- approaches the electron deficient carbon atom from the side opposite to the bromine atom, leading to the spatial configuration of the product being inverted from that of the starting organic molecule._
* _The OH- supplies the lone pair of electrons, which forms the new bond and the pair of electrons in the C-Br bond is gradually acquired completely by the bromine atom._
* _The transition state cannot be isolated (i.e. it does not exist as a stable intermediate)._
* _The mechanism consists of only one step in which two reactant particles, i.e. the single step is the rate determining step, which consists of one CH\({}_{3}\)CH\({}_{2}\)Br molecule and one OH- ion. Hence it is described as bimolecular._
* _What is the rate equation of an S\({}_{N}\)2 reaction?_ Checklist for drawing S\({}_{N}\)2 mechanism \(\surd\)mechanism name (S\({}_{N}\)2) \(\surd\) lone pair on nucleophilic \(\surd\) two FULL arrows occurring in ONE step: from lone pair to electron deficient carbon AND showing C-X bond breaks \(\surd\) dipole on C-X bond (partial charges) \(\surd\) structure of transition state (dotted bonds means about to break and about to form) \(\surd\) show the spatial configuration of product inverted from starting organic molecule \(\surd\) must remember to include by-product the X- ion _
* The carbonation formed in step 1 is **trigonal planar** with respect to the positively charged carbon. As a result, the OH- nucleophilic can attack this positively charged carbon in step 2 from **either side of the trigonal plane with equal chance**. The product will thus be a **racemic mixture** which contains a 50:50 mixture of enantiomers if the starting halogenoalkane is chiral and optically pure.
* The mechanism consists of **two steps**. Since only one reactant particle (i.e. CR\({}_{3}\)X) participates in the slow step (rate determining step), it is described as _unimolecular_.
* What is the rate equation of an Sn1 reaction?

_Checklist for drawing S\({}_{N}\)1 mechanism \(\surd\) mechanism name (S\({}_{N}\)1) \(\surd\) lone pair on nucleophile \(\surd\) TWO steps: first step showing C-X bond breaks draw FULL arrow, second step showing from lone pair to carbon with positive charge in carbocation \(\surd\) dipole on C-X bond (partial charges) \(\surd\) write "slow" and "fast" step \(\surd\) must remember to include by-product the X- ion__Factors that favour S\({}_{N}\)1 and S\({}_{N}\)2 mechanisms_

_Learning objective: (b)(i) and (b)(ii)_

_Differences in the mechanism undergone by the various classes of halogenalkanes are due to the following factors:_

**(1)**: **Stability of the carbocation intermediate**

_The more stable the carbocation intermediate, the more favoured the S\({}_{N}\)1 mechanism. Stability of carbocations decreases in the order:_

_Hence, tertiary halogenoalkanes, which will form a highly stable tertiary carbocation intermediate, undergo the S\({}_{N}\)1 mechanism more readily than primary and secondary halogenoalkanes._

_Summary of why tertiary RX favours S\({}_{N}\)1 mechanism:_

_Tertiary carbocation most stable as 3 alkyl groups exert electron donating inductive_
**(2)**: **Steric factors**: _effect, disperse the positive charge on carbocation_

_As alkyl groups are_ **bulkier** _than H atoms, their presence will hinder the approach of the nucleophilic to the halogenoalkane in an S\({}_{N}\)2 mechanism (steric hindrance)._

_A primary halogenoalkane has the least number of alkyl groups attached to the reactive carbon, hence posing the least amount of steric hindrance to an approaching nucleophilic. As a result, primary halogenoalkanes undergo the S\({}_{N}\)2 mechanism most readily._

_Summary of why primary RX favours S\({}_{N}\)2 mechanism:_

_Least amount of steric hindrance to an approaching of the nucleophile as there is only one bulky alkyl group bonded to electron deficient carbon_

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:13]

### Uses

Fluoroalkanes (RF) and fluorohalogenoalkanes (RFX) are useful because of the following properties:

* Chemically **inert** due to **strong** C-F bond.
* RF and RFX with small alkyl groups have **low** boiling points and so are easily vapourised. (they can be kept as liquid at high pressure and released as gas at atmospheric pressure).
* **Non-toxic** and odourless.
* Those without H atoms such as CF\({}_{2}\)Cl\({}_{2}\), CC/BrF\({}_{2}\) are non-flammable and can be used in **fire** **extinguishers** as they will not undergo combustion.

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|} \hline
**Compounds** & **Uses** \\ \hline CF\({}_{2}\)=CF\({}_{2}\) & making **Teflon** used in non-stick pans or water-proof cloth \\ \hline CF\({}_{2}\)Cl\({}_{2}\) & propellant gases in **aerosols** \\ (_Freon 12_) & \\ CFCl\({}_{3}\) & **refrigerant** in air-conditioner \\ (_Freon 11_) & \\ C\({}_{2}\)F\({}_{3}\)Cl\({}_{3}\) & **solvents** for cleaning electronic circuit boards \\ (_Freon 113_) & \\ \hline CC/BrF\({}_{2}\) & In **fire** **extinguishers** \\ \hline \end{tabular}

Effect of chloro-fluoro compounds (CFC) on Ozone Layer _Learning objective: (h) Natural equilibrium in the ozone layer_

* O\({}_{3}\) is formed at the upper atmosphere (stratosphere) via the following reactions: \(\mathsf{O}_{2}\to 2\mathsf{O}\) \(\mathsf{O}+\mathsf{O}_{2}\to\mathsf{O}_{3}\)
* O\({}_{3}\) also absorbs _ultra-violet (UV) radiation_ which is harmful to living organisms. _UV_ radiation can cause skin cancer in people and damage vegetation, including food crops.
* By absorbing _UV_ radiation, O\({}_{3}\) is split into O atoms and O\({}_{2}\) molecules which readily recombine to give back O\({}_{3}\). This naturally maintains the level of ozone in the stratosphere. 

_Effect of CFCs_
* CFC molecules are chemically **inert**. They do not react with air or water and are not biodegradable. As they rise into atmosphere, the C-C_l_ bond is broken in the presence of _UV_ light, forming highly reactive C_l_ radicals. Example: \[\text{CF}_{2}\text{C}l_{2}\rightarrow\text{CF}_{2}\text{C}l+\text{C}l^{*}\]
* C_l_ radicals react with O\({}_{3}\) thus, destroying ozone layer. C_l_ radicals act as **catalysts** as they are _not consumed_ in the reaction mechanism. Mechanism: \[\text{C}l^{*}+\text{O}_{3}\rightarrow\text{C}\text{/O}^{*}+\text{O}_{2}\] \[\text{C}\text{/O}^{*}+\text{O}\rightarrow\text{C}l^{*}+\text{O}_{2}\] Overall reaction: \[\text{O}_{3}+\text{O}\to 2\text{O}_{2}\] _Note: There is no need to memorise the mechanism._ Hence C_l_ radicals _catalyse_ the destruction of ozone.
* Note that C-F bond is **not broken** in the stratosphere as it is much stronger than C-C_l_.

## 3 Chemical Properties

### Reactions involving halogen atom

* No nucleophilic substitution under normal laboratory conditions in contrast to CH\({}_{3}\)CH\({}_{2}\)Cl, i.e. no reaction with OH-, CN-, NH\({}_{3}\).
* Nucleophilic substitution (or hydrolysis) with NaOH will only occur under **drastic** conditions of high temperature and high pressure.

Reagents and conditions: NaOH(aq) at high temperature and high pressure, followed by HCI(aq)

* The behaviour of C_I_ atom in C\({}_{6}\)H\({}_{5}\)CH\({}_{2}\)Cl is similar to CH\({}_{3}\)CH\({}_{2}\)Cl.
