### Formulae of Organic Compounds

We can show the elements present in an organic compound and their relative proportions in a few different ways.

The following different formulae are illustrated using **lactic acid**.

## 3 Classification of Organic Compounds

[label=LO ()]

Organic compounds are thought of as consisting of a relatively **unreactive backbone**, _e.g._ a chain of sp\({}^{3}\) hybridised carbon atoms, and one or several **functional groups**. Names of organic compounds are derived from the functional group(s) and main carbon chain.

### Nature of structure

We can categorise organic compounds based on the nature of their carbon skeletons:

* **saturated** : compounds such as alkanes, whose molecules contain only _single bonds_, are referred to as saturated compounds **because these compounds contain the maximum number of hydrogen atoms that the carbon compound can possess**
* **unsaturated** : compounds with _multiple bonds_, such as alkenes, alkynes, and aromatic hydrocarbons, are said to be unsaturated because they possess fewer than the maximum number of hydrogen atoms, and are capable of reacting with hydrogen under the proper conditions
* **aliphatic** : acyclic (compounds with no ring of atoms) or cyclic (compounds containing ring of atoms), saturated or unsaturated carbon compounds, excluding aromatic compounds
* **aromatic** : a cyclically conjugated molecular entity with a stability (due to delocalisation of electrons) significantly greater than that of a hypothetical localised structure is said to possess aromatic character, i.e. containing benzene

### Functional groups

The **functional group** is an atom, or a group of atoms that has similar chemical properties whenever it occurs in different compounds. It defines the characteristic **physical and chemical properties** of families of organic compounds.

The carbon atom on which the functional group is attached to is known as the **alpha (a) carbon**. The naming continues as beta (\(\beta\)), gamma (\(\gamma\)), delta (\(\delta\)),..., until the last carbon in the chain, which is termed the omega (\(\omega\)) carbon.

A series of compounds with the **same functional group**, where each member differs from the next member by a **constant CH2 unit** is called a **homologous series**. Members of a homologous series are called homologs.

**All compounds in any one homologous series**

* can be represented by a general formula
* have a relative molecular mass 14 (corresponding to one CH2 unit) greater than the preceding compound in the series
* can be prepared by similar methods
* have similar chemical properties
* exhibit a regular gradation of physical properties (due to the increasing size of hydrocarbon chain)

Here are the common functional groups you will encounter:

**Hydrocarbons** (compounds that contain only carbon and hydrogen atoms)

From the electrostatic potential maps for ethane, ethene, ethyne and benzene, it can be seen that ethane is **non-polar** (generally green), while there are regions of **higher electron density** (yellow\(\rightarrow\)red) in the other three due to the **\(\pi\) bond/system**.

This is generally true for alkanes in that the C--C and C--H bonds are **essentially** non-polar and hence they are unreactive towards polar (charged) reagents, and forms the **unreactive skeleton** of most organic compounds.

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:9]

### Alkyl and Aryl Groups

When a hydrogen atom is removed from an alkane, this gives an **alkyl group**. The symbol **R** is used to represent a general alkyl group (_i.e._ a methyl, ethyl, etc. group).

Alkanes have the general formula, **C\({}_{n}\)H\({}_{2n+2}\)**. So **the general formula for alkyl chains is **C\({}_{n}\)H\({}_{2n+1}\)**--**.

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|} \hline alkane & alkyl group & bond-line & ball-and-stick model \\ \hline CH\({}_{3}\)--H & H\({}_{3}\)C\({}_{2}\) & & \\
**methane** & **methyl** & & \\ \hline CH\({}_{3}\)CH\({}_{2}\)--H & CH\({}_{3}\)CH\({}_{2}\)--S & & \\
**ethane** & **ethyl** & & \\ \hline CH\({}_{3}\)CH\({}_{2}\)--H & CH\({}_{3}\)CH\({}_{2}\)CH\({}_{2}\)--S & & \\
**propane** & **propyl** & & \\ \hline CH\({}_{3}\)CH\({}_{2}\)CH\({}_{2}\)--H & CH\({}_{3}\)CH\({}_{2}\)CH\({}_{2}\)--H & & \\
**buttas** & **butyl** & & \\ \hline \end{tabular}

_FYr:_ Ball-and-Stick Model

\(\bullet\) Displays both the three-dimensional position of the atoms and the bonds between them

\(\bullet\) Atoms are typically represented by spheres, bonds are represented by rods

Similarly, groups derived from arenes by removal of a hydrogen atom from an aromatic ring carbon atom are known as **aryl groups**. The symbol **Ar** is used to represent a general aryl group.

When a benzene ring is attached to some other group of atoms in a molecule, it is called a **phenyl group**, and it is represented in several ways:

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|} \hline  & or & C\({}_{6}\)H\({}_{5}\)-- \\ \hline \end{tabular}

### Degree of Substitution

Degree of substitution in an organic molecule is based on the **number of carbon atom(s)** (generally also the **number of alkyl group(s)**) bonded to the atom of interest.

In the case of alkanes:

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|} \hline H & R & R \\ \hline H & R & R \\ \hline A primary (or 1\({}^{o}\)) & A secondary (or 2\({}^{o}\)) & A tertiary (or 3\({}^{o}\)) & A quaternary (or 4\({}^{o}\)) \\ carbon is & carbon is & carbon is & carbon is \\ bonded to one & bonded to two & bonded to three & bonded to four \\ other carbon & other carbons & other carbons & other carbons \\ \hline \end{tabular}

For alcohols and halogenoalkanes, this is based on the number of carbon atom(s) attached to the \(\alpha\)-carbon; while for **amines and amides**, it is based on the number of carbon atom(s) attached to the nitrogen atom.

\begin{tabular}{l l l l}  & **Halogenoalkanes** & **Alcohols** & & & **Amines** \\ primary (1\({}^{\circ}\)) & RCH\({}_{2}\)X & RCH\({}_{2}\)OH & primary (1\({}^{\circ}\)) & RNH\({}_{2}\) \\ secondary (2\({}^{\circ}\)) & R\({}_{2}\)CHX & R\({}_{2}\)CHOH & secondary (2\({}^{\circ}\)) & R\({}_{2}\)NH \\ tertiary (3\({}^{\circ}\)) & R\({}_{3}\)CX & R\({}_{3}\)COH & tertiary (3\({}^{\circ}\)) & R\({}_{3}\)N \\ quaternary & & & & \\ ammonium ion (4\({}^{\circ}\)) & R\({}_{4}\)N \\ \end{tabular}

Important concepts to remember:

1. _I need to know that if an organic molecule contains double (C=C, C=O, etc) or triple (C =C, C=N, etc) bond, it is unsaturated._
2. _I need to know that compounds having same functional group have similar chemical properties BUT different physical properties (such as melting and boiling points)._
3. _I need to know the STRUCTURE of different functional groups and I MUST know how to identify them: Alkene, Alkyne, Halogenoalkanes, Alcohol, Phenol, Aldehyde, Ketone, Carboxylic acid, Amide, Ester and Ether._

_Note: ether is not in H2 syllabus_
4. _I need to know the meaning of primary (1\({}^{\circ}\)), secondary (2\({}^{\circ}\)) and tertiary (3\({}^{\circ}\))._
5. _I need to know that alcohol and amine need to be labelled as 1\({}^{\circ}\), 2\({}^{\circ}\) and 3\({}^{\circ}\)._

INTRODUCTION TO ORGANIC CHEMISTRY

The names of two or more different substituents should be included in **alphabetical order** in the prefix (_e.g._ hydroxy before methyl). If two substituents happen to be on the **same carbon**, they are given the **same number**.

A **multiplier** is used in the prefix or suffix to indicate the presence of two or more of the minor or major functional groups (or substituents).

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|} \hline number & multiplier & number & multiplier \\ \hline
1\({}^{*}\) & mono- & 6 & hexa- \\ \hline
2 & di- & 7 & hepta- \\ \hline
3 & tri- & 8 & octa- \\ \hline
4 & tetra- & 9 & nona- \\ \hline
5 & penta- & 10 & deca- \\ \hline \end{tabular}

\({}^{*}\) The multiplier'mono-' for one substituent is seldom used in the actual naming, but rather, is used in comparison to molecules with more than one substituent.

### Special cases

#### Alkenes and alkynes

The position of the double or triple bond is indicated by the number of the lowest carbon atom in the alkene or alkyne.

### Esters

These are named in two parts. The first part represents the R\({}^{1}\) group attached to oxygen (Note: **This R\({}^{1}\) group comes from the alcohol)**. The second represent the R\({}^{2}\)CO\({}_{2}\) (Note: R\({}^{2}\) group comes from the carboxylic acid) portion which is named as an alkanoate (_i.e._ the suffix is \(-\)date). A space separates the two parts of the name.

Important concepts to remember:

1. _During the naming of an organic molecule:_ * _Find the longest carbon chain that contains the functional group with the highest priority._ * _The "parent" will carry the suffix of the functional group with the highest priority._ * _The suffix will be numbered with the smallest number._ * _The substituents will then be the prefix with the lowest numbering, arranging in alphabetical order._
2. _For A-level, please be assured that examiner won't ask you to name very big and complex molecules. Usually it will be simple molecule. Most importantly, you need to be able to identify the different functional groups stated in the last section's "Important concepts to remember"._

Overlapping of the 2p orbitals can take place either between (i) C\({}_{1}\) and C\({}_{2}\), C\({}_{3}\) and C\({}_{4}\), C\({}_{5}\) and C\({}_{6}\); or between (ii) C\({}_{1}\) and C\({}_{6}\), C\({}_{2}\) and C\({}_{3}\), C\({}_{4}\) and C\({}_{5}\), leading to the two Kekule structures for benzene that involve alternating double and single bonds.

However, such a structure does not support the differences benzene displays compared to alkenes. Rather, a more probable structure of benzene is one in which **all** six adjacent 2p orbitals could overlap, resulting in the formation of an annular \(\pi\) electron cloud, above and below the plane of the ring:

As the 2p electrons are no longer held between just two carbon atoms but are spread over the entire ring, the electrons are said to be **delocalised**. To represent the unique structure of benzene, we use the following symbol:

**Making Thinking Visible**

**Q:**: When we say that benzene is a planar molecule, so, it means that ALL the atoms of the molecule lie on a flat plane?
**A:**: Yes. Ethene (C\({}_{2}\)H\({}_{4}\)) and ethyne (C\({}_{2}\)H\({}_{2}\)) are two other planar molecule but ethane is not.
**Q:**: Hmm...so can I say that as long as a molecule contains at least one sp\({}^{3}\) hybridised carbon atom, the molecule will not be planar?
**A:**: Absolutely spots on, Eunoian!
**Q:**: If the six \(\pi\) electrons are moving round the six-membered carbon ring, can we say that on average, the \(\pi\) bond between two carbon atoms is only formed by one electron?
**A:**: Yes, you may say that. And this is why the carbon-carbon bond length in benzene is intermediate between a C=C and a C-C bonds. The **bond order is 1.5**.

* _I need to know how to predict the hybridisation state of an atom based on the following:_ 

* _The greater the percentage of s-character in the hybrid orbital, the stronger the bond formed._
* _I need to know how to draw the following:_ 

* _I need to know that each of the six carbon atoms of benzene is sp\({}^{2}\) hybridised. Hence, a benzene (C\({}_{6}\)He) molecule is planar in shape._ 

## 6 Organic Reactions

[label=LO]
**(b)**: interpret, and use the following terminology associated with organic reactions:
**(ii)**: homolytic and heterolytic fission
**(vi)**: electrophile (Lewis acid), nucleophile (Lewis base)
**(vii)**: addition, substitution, elimination, condensation, hydrolysis
**(viii)**: oxidation and reduction

In organic chemistry, we are interested in **the type** of reactions that occur and **how** they occur.

### Types of Reactions

[label=()]
**(a)**: Addition reactions

Addition reactions occur when two starting materials add together to form only one product, _i.e._ "1+1 = 1".

**(b)**: _Electrophilic addition_ to alkenes

[label=()]
**(c)**: _Electrophilic addition_ to aldehydes and ketones

[label=()]
**(d)**: _Substitution reactions occur when two starting materials exchange groups to form two new products, _i.e._ "1+1 = 1+1".

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:28]

* Reduction reactions
* Reduction reactions occur when there is a decrease in oxygen and/or increase in hydrogen.
* _Reduction of aldehydes_
* _Free-radical substitution of alkanes_

### Reaction Mechanisms

* LO (h) recognise that the mechanism of polar reactions involve the flow of electrons from electron-rich to electron-poor sites

Reaction mechanisms provides a description of how a reaction occurs. It details what takes place at each stage of a chemical transformation - which bonds are broken/formed and the order in which they do so, as well as the relative rates of the different steps within the reaction (recall what you have learnt in the topic of Reaction Kinetics).

#### 6.2.1 The Breaking and Forming of Bonds

All chemical reactions involve the bond breaking and bond formation. A covalent bond between two atoms can be broken essentially in the following ways:

* _homolytic fission / cleavage_
* _heterolytic fission / cleavage_

In homolytic fission, each atom separates with one electron, leading to the formation of highly reactive entities called (free) radicals, owing their reactivity to their unpaired electron; this is referred to as homolytic fission or cleavage of the bond.

To show the movement of a single, unpaired electron, a half-arrow or fish hook is used.

* _The two-electron bond is split_
* _revised and one electron moves to each of the atoms_Alternatively, one atom may hold on to both electrons, leaving none for the other, resulting in the formation of an ion pair, consisting of a negative and a positive ion; this is referred to as heterolytic fission or cleavage of the bond.

When R and X are not identical, the fission can take place in either of two ways, depending on whether R or X retains the electron pair.

To show the movement of a pair of electrons, a full arrow is used.

[MISSING_PAGE_POST]

#### 6.2.2 Types of Reagents

##### In Polar Reactions

All polar reactions take place between an **electron-poor site** and an **electron-rich site**. Such reactions involve the **donation of an electron pair** from a **nucleophile** to an **electrophile**.

**Electrophiles** ("electron-loving') are **electron-poor** species that can form a covalent bond by **accepting** an electron pair from an **electron-rich** site. They are _often_ **positively charged** (cations) although they can also be sites on neutral species carrying a **partial positive charge** (\(\otimes\)+).

For example, electron-rich (and hence nucleophilic) phenol can be attacked by electrophiles such as the positively charged nitronium cation, NO\({}_{2}^{\circ}\), and the electron-deficient nitrogen atom of nitric acid (HNO\({}_{3}\)) or dinitrogen pentoxide (N\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{5}\)):

The relative electrophilic strength (or electrophilicity) of a cation, or electrophilic site within a neutral molecule depends on the **level of electron deficiency**.

* An electrophile with a positive charge is always a **more powerful** electrophile than its conjugate base (which is neutral).
* Carbon atoms are electrophilic when attached to electronegative atoms. The more electronegative the atom(s) bonded to carbon, the more electrophilic the carbon atom.

**Making Thinking Visible**

**Q:**: When we are asked to draw the various constitutional isomers, must we really draw in the skeletal form?

**A:**: No! Not necessary. If the question did not request for skeletal formula, you can draw the full structural formula form. Importantly, show the bonding between the atoms correctly.

### Stereoisomerism

Stereoisomers are isomers that have the **same molecular and structural formulae** but differ in their **spatial arrangement** (3-dimensional orientation) of the atoms.

#### 7.2.1 _cis-trans_ Isomerism

[label=LO]

* **Occurs when free rotation of certain parts of a molecule relative to the rest is restricted by the presence of multiple bonds or a ring structure.**

In order to have _cis-trans_ isomers:

1. There must be **restricted rotation about a bond**. (e.g. C=C double bond or ring) (**Note:** a double bond is rigid because of presence of the \(\pi\) bond which prevents rotation, as rotation can only take place if the \(\pi\) bond / p-p orbital overlap is broken)
2. At point of restricted rotation, the **2 groups attached to the same C are different.**

In general, alkenes have two adjacent sp\({}^{2}\) hybridised carbons. These carbon atoms together with the four atoms to which they are attached are co-planar. Above and below the plane defined by these six atoms, there exists a region of electron density, the \(\pi\) bond, which arises from the sideway overlap of p orbitals on the adjacent alkene carbons.

We have seen this in ethene in Section 5.1:

Note: alkenes can be viewed either (a) from 'above' the plane of the molecule, in which case the wedges and dashed wedges are _not_ included, or (b) from almost sideway; in this case, wedges and dashed wedges are included.

#### 7.2.2 Enantiomerism

[noitemsep]
**LO (c)**: explain what is meant by a chiral centre
**(d)**: deduce whether a given molecule is chiral based on the presence or absence of chiral centres and/or a plane of symmetry
**(e)**: recognise that an optically active sample rotates plane-polarised light and contains chiral molecules
**(f)**: recognise that enantiomers have identical physical properties except in the direction in which they rotate plane-polarised light
**(g)**: recognise that enantiomers have identical chemical properties except in their interactions with another chiral molecule
**(d)**: deduce the possible isomers for an organic molecule of known molecular formula
**(j)**: identity chiral centres and/or cis-trans isomerism in a molecule of given structural formula

A sp\({}^{3}\) hybridised tetrahedral carbon atom that is attached to four different entities (atoms or groups) is known as an asymmetric carbon atom.

A molecule with an asymmetric carbon atom (denoted by an **asterisk (*)** on the C), as in the diagram below, **cannot be superimposed on its mirror image**.

This is the same property that a right hand, say, placed in front of a plane mirror possess.

Molecules such as the one shown above and our hands are said to be **chiral** (or handed), from the Greek word 'cheir' for hand.

**Chirality** then is the property of handedness. It is the geometric property of a rigid object (or spatial arrangement of points or atoms) of being **non-superimposable on its mirror image**. The adjective 'chiral' refers to the molecule as a whole, rather than to a particular atom.

Molecules such as CC\(4\), CH\({}_{2}\)C\({}_{k}\) and CHFC\({}_{k}\) that can be superimposed on their mirror images are said to be '**achiral**'.

**Eunoa Junior College**
An asymmetric carbon attached to four different substituents is said to be a chiral carbon or **chiral centre**, since the resulting molecule is chiral.

To represent three-dimensional molecules in two-dimension, the **wedge-and-dash notation** is used. In this notation, two bonds are drawn in the plane of the page (sticks: ---), one bond is drawn coming toward you, out of the page (wedged: ---), and one bond is drawn going away from you, behind the page (dashed: ---). _E.g._ 2-bromobutane

A pair of molecules which are **mirror images** of each other and **non-superimposable**, such as molecules **1** and **2**, are **enantiomers**, from the Greek 'enantio' meaning opposite.

Enantioners have **identical physical** (_e.g._ melting point, boiling point and solubility) **and chemical properties** under normal (achiral) conditions, with one exception - optical activity.

## Introduction to organic chemistry

The ultimate way to test for molecular chirality is to construct models of the molecule and its mirror image and then determine whether they are superimposable. We can apply this test with actual models, or by attempting to superimpose them in our minds.

There are other aids, however, that will assist us in recognising chiral molecules.

We have seen one already: the presence of a _single_ chiral centre.

However, when there are more than one chiral centre in a molecule, it may sometimes lead to an achiral molecule due to the presence of a plane of symmetry (see below). _E.g._ meso-tartaric acid

Other aids are based on the absence of certain symmetry elements in the molecule.

A molecule will not be chiral if it possesses a **plane of symmetry**.

A plane of symmetry (also called a mirror plane) is defined as an imaginary plane that bisects a molecule in such a way that the two halves of the molecule are mirror image of each other.

However, the absence of a plane of symmetry does not necessarily guarantee that a molecule is chiral, although it is true in many cases.

### Making Thinking Visible

**Q:** Sir, what is the definition of a chiral carbon atom?

**A:** A chiral carbon atom has four different groups of atoms bonded to it (Note: This is the definition of a chiral carbon atom).

**Q:** So, in order to be a chiral atom, does it need to be sp\({}^{3}\) hybridised?

**A:** Yes! Because only a sp\({}^{3}\) hybridised carbon atom can form four \(\alpha\) bonds. Hence, four groups of atoms bonded to it. Which means that if you have a sp\({}^{2}\) or sp hybridised atom, you can forget about looking for chirality.

**Q:** So, the consequence of having a molecule with chiral atom is the molecule and its mirror image will be non-superimposable?

**A:** Absolutely right!

**Q:** But if a molecule has more than one chiral atom, the molecule MAY have a mirror image that is superimposable with it?

**A:** Yes, you are right. A molecule with ONLY one chiral carbon guarantees a chiral molecule with non-superimposable mirror image. BUT if a molecule _has more than one chiral atom_**, resulting in an internal plane of symmetry within the molecule**, then this molecule and its mirror image are superimposable.

**Q:** What is the definition of enantiomers?

**A:** Enantiomers are _a pair of molecules that are mirror images of each other and and are non-superimposable_.

## Chapter 1 Introduction to organic chemistry

Light may be regarded as a wave motion that contain oscillating perpendicular electric and magnetic fields, at right angles to the direction of propagation of the light wave:

In normal light, the electric and magnetic fields of light oscillate in all planes. Considering only the electric field components:

When a beam of normal light is passed through a device called a **polariser**, that in effect acts as a filter, only light waves that are oscillating in a single plane are allowed to pass through. The polariser thus serves to block the passage of light that is oscillating in all other planes. The light that emerges from the polariser is said to be **plane polarised**.

In 1815 the French physicist Biot made the important observation that when a beam of **plane polarised light** is passed through a solution of certain naturally occurring organic compounds, the plane of polarised light is rotated either to the left or to the right.

Molecules that are able to rotate the plane of polarisation of a beam of transmitted plane-polarised light is said to possess **optical activity** (or to be **optically active**).

An enantiomer causing rotation in a clockwise direction (when viewed in the direction facing the oncoming light beam) under specified conditions is called dextrorotatory and its chemical name or formula is designated by the prefix (+)-; one causing rotation in the opposite direction is leavorotatory and designated by the prefix (-)-.

#### 7.2.3 Biological Importance of Stereochemistry

LO (h) recognise that different stereoisomers exhibit different biological properties, for example in drug action

The origin of biological properties relating to chirality is often likened to the specificity of our hands for their respective gloves; the binding specificity for a chiral molecule (like a hand) at a chiral receptor site (a glove) is only favourable in one way.

If either the molecule or the biological receptor site had the wrong handedness, the natural physiological response (e.g. neural impulse, reaction catalysis) would not occur.

A diagram showing how only the (+)-isomer in a pair of enantiomers can interact in an optimal way with a hypothetical binding site (e.g. in an enzyme) is shown below.

Because of the chiral centre of the enantiomer, three-point binding can occur with proper alignment for only one of the two enantiomers.

Chiral molecules can show their handedness in many ways, including the way they affect human beings.

The (+)-enantiomeric form of a compound called limonene is primarily responsible for the odour of oranges and the other (-)-enantiomer for the odour of lemons.

The (+)-enantiomer of a compound called carvone is the essence of caraway, and the other is the essence of spearmint.

Eunoa Junior CollegeThe activity of drugs containing chirality centres can similarly vary between enantiomers, sometimes with serious or even tragic consequences.

For several years before 1963 the drug thalidomide was used to alleviate the symptoms of morning sickness in pregnant women. In 1963 it was discovered that thalidomide was the cause of horrible birth defects in many children born subsequent to the use of the drug.

Even later, evidence began to appear indicating that whereas one of the thalidomide enantiomers (the right-handed molecule) has the intended effect of curing morning sickness, the other enantiomer, which was also present in the drug (in an equal amount), may be the cause of the birth defects.

The evidence regarding the effects of the two enantiomers is complicated by the fact that, under physiological conditions, the two enantiomers are interconverted.

Now, however, thalidomide is approved under highly strict regulations for treatment of some forms of cancer and a serious complication associated with leprosy. Its potential for use against other conditions including AIDS and rheumatoid arthritis is also under investigation.

#### 7.2.4 Number of Stereoisomers

The **maximum** number of stereoisomers possible for a molecule with _n_**chiral centres** is given by \(\underline{2^{n}}\).

The **actual number may be less since some of the isomers may possess internal symmetry elements**.

_E.g._ consider tartaric acid, HOO-C-OH, with two chiral centres. So there is a maximum of HOO2C CO2H

2\({}^{2}\) = 4 stereoisomers.

There are two pairs of mirror images possible:

**1** and **2** are a distinct pair of mirror images which are non-superimposable.

**3** and **4**, although distinct from **1** and **2**, are however superimposable (due to the presence of an internal mirror plane). They are in fact the _same_!! This is the _m_eso compound that we have seen earlier on page 41.

Hence there are only **3 distinct stereoisomers** for tartaric acid.

The **maximum** number of stereoisomers possible for a molecule with _m cis-trans_** double bond** is also given by \(\underline{2^{m}}\).

Again, the actual number may be less as some of the isomers are in fact the same compound due to the presence of internal symmetry elements.

In addition, it is not possible to have _cis-trans_ isomerism for double bond in a small ring system.

_E.g._ for 1,2-dimethylcyclohexene, CH3, the two methyl groups can only assume a _cis_-configuration, since it is geometrically **not** possible to bend the ring to be in a _trans_-configuration.

For a molecule with _n_**chiral centres** and _m cis-trans_** double bond**, the **maximum** number of stereoisomers possible is given by \(\underline{2^{n\cdot m}}\).
