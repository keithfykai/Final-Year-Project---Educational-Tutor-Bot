### 3.1 Introduction

_Dynamics_ is the branch of classical mechanics concerned with the study of forces and their effects on motion. Isaac Newton defined the fundamental physical laws which govern dynamics in physics, especially his second law of motion.

#### 3.1.1 Types of Forces

Broadly speaking, forces may be categorized into two kinds: **contact** forces and **non-contact** forces.

#### 3.1.1.1 Contact Forces

Forces acting between two bodies that are in physical contact.

\begin{tabular}{l|l} \hline
**Contact forces** & **Description** \\ \hline Friction & Force that resists the **relative** motion or the tendency for **relative** motion between two surfaces that are in contact. \\ \hline Normal contact & Net electrostatic repulsion between two surfaces that are in contact. \\ force & \\ \hline Contact force & Vector sum of friction and normal contact force, meaning the total contact force. \\ \hline Spring force & Force exerted by one end of a spring when the spring is extended or compressed from its natural length. The spring forces acts throughout a spring, in both directions. \\ \hline Tension & Force exerted by one end of a string/rope which is being pulled taut. The tension is constant throughout the string/rope and acts in both directions. \\ \hline \hline Uphtrust & **Net** upward force exerted by the fluid on a body fully or partially submerged in the fluid. \\ \hline Viscous drag force & Force that resists a body moving **relative** to a fluid. \\ \hline Air resistance & Drag force exerted by air on a body moving in air. Air resistance is a specific form of drag. \\ \hline \end{tabular}

#### 3.1.1.2 Non-contact Forces

Forces acting between two bodies which are NOT in physical contact (separated by a distance). This characteristic of the force is described as **action-at-a-distance**.

\begin{tabular}{l|l} \hline
**Non-contact forces** & **Description** \\ \hline \multicolumn{1}{c|}{} & **Physical property of a** \\ \multicolumn{1}{c|}{} & **body on which the force** \\ \multicolumn{1}{c|}{} & **acts on.** \\ \hline Gravitational force & Attractive force exerted between masses. & Mass \\ \hline Electric force & Attractive/repulsive force exerted between electrically charged bodies. & Electric charge \\ \hline Magnetic force & Force exerted between currents & Moving charges \\ \hline \end{tabular}

#### Weight

The weight of a body is due to the body being in a gravitational field. In most cases, the object of interest is close to the Earth and its weight refers to the gravitational force exerted on its body by the Earth. However, an object may have a different weight elsewhere, for instance, when it is in the gravitational field of the Moon.

Notes:

* Weight is a **force** (hence a **vector**).
* Direction: For everyday-life problems, the weight of the object is taken to act **vertically downwards** at the centre of gravity of the object.
* Magnitude: \(W=mg\)

_W:_ weight of an object (SI unit: N)

_m:_ mass of the body (SI unit: kg)

_g:_ acceleration of free fall/ gravitational field strength at the point (SI unit: m s-2)
* Weight is a non-contact force. It does not only act on a person sitting in a chair, but also on a flying bird, regardless of whether we take into account air resistance.

Distinction between mass and weight

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|} \hline
**Mass** & **Weight** \\ \hline A measure of the inertia of a body & A measure of the gravitational pull on a body \\ \hline Scalar quantity & Vector quantity \\ \hline SI unit: kg & SI unit: N \\ \hline Same regardless of location & Varies with gravitational field strength at each \\  & location \\ \hline Same regardless of the method of measurement. & Some methods of measurement do not measure the \\  & true weight but the apparent weight (see example 7) \\ \hline \end{tabular}

In everyday language, the terms'mass' and 'weight' are used interchangeably, e.g. I "weigh" 70 kg. In physics, and especially during examinations, such casual usage is _not tolerated_.

#### 3.1.2.1 Centre of Gravity

An object of a significant size has its mass distributed (not necessarily uniformly) throughout its volume.

The **centre of gravity** of an object is the point at which the weight of the object _appears to_ act.

Notes:

- In free-body diagrams, the weight should be drawn from the centre of gravity of an object.

- The centre of gravity of an object is not necessarily on the object. It may lie outside the object.

- In a uniform gravitational field, the centre of gravity always coincides with the centre of mass of the object.

#### Contact Forces

When two surfaces come into contact, they both experience contact forces arising from electrostatic forces between atoms of the surfaces. For ease of analysis, this contact force is often resolved into two components: the component perpendicular to the surfaces is called **normal contact force**, and the component parallel to the surfaces is given the name **friction**.

##### 3.1.3.1 Normal Contact Force

A block can rest on a table because its weight is balanced by an upward force the table exerts on it. This force arises from the electrostatic repulsion between the molecules of the table and the molecules of the block. It is called the normal contact force since it acts perpendicularly (normal) to the surfaces.

In free-body diagrams (see Section 3.2.5.1 for details), contact forces must be drawn from a contact point (e.g. somewhere along the base of the block). A common mistake is contact forces that are drawn from the centre of gravity (see diagram below).

* By definition, the normal contact force is always directed **perpendicular to the surfaces**.
* The magnitude depends on how hard the two surfaces are pressed into each other.

##### 3.1.3.2 Friction

Friction is the force that resists relative motion between two sliding surfaces (called kinetic friction), or the tendency for relative motion between two stationary surfaces (called static friction).

Direction

Friction is always directed in the direction opposite to the direction of **relative motion**.

For example, a block sliding along a rough table is gradually decelerated to rest. It experiences a (kinetic) friction directed backward because the block's surface is sliding forward relative to the table's surface.

On the other hand, a person is able to walk forward only if he experiences a (static) friction that is directed forward. The sole of his shoe tends to rub backward relative to the floor's surface. When an exam question refers to friction, you have to infer from the question whether the relevant force is a _retarding_ frictional force or a _propelling_ frictional force.

#### 3.1.4 Tension

In physics, tension refers to the magnitude of the pulling force exerted by a string, rope, cable or chain on the object tied to its end when it is pulled **taut**.

- _At the end of a string_, the direction of the tension force exerted on the object is **along the string**, directed **away from the object**.

- _Within the string_, the magnitude of the tension is constant, and the tension acts in both directions equally. The magnitude of the tension in the string is equal to the magnitude exerted at the ends.

- _The magnitude of the tension force depends on how much the string is stretched. Once the string is **slack**, the tension falls to zero.

- _In many situations, we idealise the string, rope, cable, etc. to be **massless** and **inextensible** to simplify analysis.

- _Strings or ropes are often used together with pulleys. Again, in many situations, we idealise a pulley to be **massless** and **frictionless** (at the axle) to simplify analysis.

- _The tension is equal to the magnitude of the forces applied by the ends of the string, even if the bodies and the cord are accelerating and even if the cord runs around a massless, frictionless pulley (figs. b and c)._

\(\bar{T}\) is the tension force in the cord (directed away from the body).

### Newton's Laws of Motion

#### Newton's 1st Law

**Statement of Newton's 1st law of motion**

A body stays at rest or continues to move with a constant speed in a straight line unless acted upon by a _net external force_.

Notes

Changes in a body's state of motion refer to changes in its velocity. It can be a change in either its **speed** or **direction** (or both).

An object's resistance to change its state of motion is called **inertia**. As such, Newton's 1st law is also referred to as the Law of Inertia.

An object's inertia is dependent on its mass: The larger its mass, the larger its inertia.

#### Linear Momentum

Everyday experience tells us that two objects moving at the same velocity can result in very different consequences. Consider a 3-gram ping pong ball and a 3-ton lorry, both travelling at 5 m s-1. Which would you rather collide with?

In physics, we define a "quantity of motion" called **momentum**, \(p\).

**Definition of Linear Momentum**

The linear momentum of a body is the product of its mass and its velocity.

Mathematically, linear momentum, \(\vec{p}=m\vec{\nu}\)

Notes

Momentum is a **vector quantity**. It has the same direction as the object's velocity.

Momentum has the Sl unit: **kg m s-1**. Sometimes the alternative unit **N s** is used.

In H2 Physics, when we refer to momentum, we mean linear momentum. It is not to be confused with angular momentum, which is not in the syllabus.

A 110 g billiard ball rebounds off a wall, with velocities as shown in the (top view) diagram. The ball moves on a horizontal plane. Evaluate the change in momentum of the ball.

#### Newton's 2nd Law

**Statement of Newton's 2nd law of motion**

The _rate of change of linear momentum_ of a body is _directly proportional_ to the _resultant force_1 acting on it and is in the direction of the resultant force.

Strictly speaking, Newton's 2nd law only states that \(\vec{F}_{net}\propto\frac{d\vec{p}}{dt}\).

Hence, \(F_{net}=k\,\frac{dp}{dt}\), where \(k\) is some constant of proportionality. When SI units are used for all quantities in the equation, the constant \(k\) has a value of 1.

Mathematically, net force, \(\vec{F}_{net}=\frac{d\vec{p}}{dt}=\frac{d(m\vec{\nu})}{dt}\)

Average net force, \(\left\langle F_{net}\right\rangle=\frac{\Delta\vec{p}}{\Delta t}=\frac{\Delta(m \vec{\nu})}{\Delta t}\)

The SI unit for force is the newton (N).

**Example 1b: Rate of Change in Momentum**

The time interval of contact between the billiard ball and the wall is 0.100 s. Find the average net force acting on the wall during the collision.

\({}^{\dagger}\) Resultant force is also known as net force, or (vector) sum of forces.

#### Impulse

**Definition of Impulse**

The impulse of a force is the product of the **average force** and the time interval over which it is applied.

Mathematically, \(\vec{J}=\left\langle\vec{F}\right\rangle\Delta t\)

Notes

* Impulse is a **vector** quantity; its direction is the same as that of the average force \(F\).
* The SI units for impulse are **N s**. They can be shown to be equivalent to **kg m s\({}^{-1}\)**, the same as the units of momentum.

#### Relation between Impulse and Momentum

From Newton's second law,

\[\vec{F}=\frac{d\vec{p}}{dt}\]

Rearranging and integrating, we obtain

\[\int\vec{F}dt=\int d\vec{p}\]

The left-hand side of the equation, \(\int\vec{F}\ dt\), is the **impulse** of the force.

The right-hand side, \(\int d\vec{p}=\vec{p}_{t}-\vec{p}_{i}=\Delta\vec{p}\), is the **total change in momentum**.

This result, which links impulse to the change in momentum, is known as the **impulse-momentum theorem**.

**Impulse-Momentum Theorem**

The impulse-momentum theorem states that the _total change in momentum_ of a particle during a time interval **equals the impulse of the net force** that acts on the particle during that interval.

Mathematically, \(\vec{J}=\int\vec{F}dt=\Delta\vec{p}\)

For **average** or **constant** forces, this simplifies to \(\vec{J}\ =\ <\vec{F}>\Delta t=\Delta\vec{p}\).

#### 3.2.4.2 Graphical Representation of Impulse

Since \(\bar{J}=\int\tilde{F}\tilde{e}t=\Delta\tilde{\rho}\), impulse is represented by the **area under the _force-time_ graph. The same area also represents the **(total) change in the momentum** of the body.

To illustrate further, study the _F-t_ graphs below. Notice that, even though the two forces have different peak magnitudes, they both deliver the same impulse (i.e. same area under each graph). Hence, the two forces will cause the same change in momentum to the object they are applied on.

**Applying \(F_{net}\) = _ma_ to a system with forces in 1D - the importance of identifying the system**

**Example 3**

A helicopter of mass \(M\) and weight \(W\) rises with vertical acceleration, \(a\), due to the upward thrust \(U\) generated by its rotor. The crew and passengers of total mass \(m\) and total weight \(w\), exerts a combined force \(R\) on the floor of the helicopter.

Draw an appropriate free-body diagram, and write down an equation for the motion of

(a) the helicopter, (b) the crew and passengers, (c) helicopter, crew and passengers

Two blocks A and B, of masses \(2M\) and \(4M\), respectively, are pushed along a smooth horizontal surface by a force of \(F\) as shown in the diagram.

What is the magnitude of the force exerted by block A on block B during the acceleration?

**Applying \(F_{net}\)= \(ma\) to a system with forces in 2D**

#### 3.2.6 Newton's 3rd Law

**Statement of Newton's 3rd law**

If body A exerts a force on body B, then body B will exert an equal and opposite force on body A.

It is easy to confuse action-reaction pairs with force pairs that happen to be pairs of "equal-but-opposite" forces. Performing the following "mental checklist" may help to detect "impostors".

**For two forces to be Action-Reaction Pair, the two forces must be**

**Equal in magnitude**

**Opposite in direction**

**Acting on different bodies**

**Of the same nature (e.g. gravity-gravity, friction-friction, tension-tension)**

To illustrate, consider the forces when a person is standing on the floor.

(a) is at rest,

(b) moves with an upward acceleration of 1.8 m s-2,

**Answer:**

### Principle of Conservation of Linear Momentum

Momentum is an important concept because, momentum is a **conserved** quantity. Consider, for example, the head-on collision of two billiard balls, A and B.

Assuming **no net** _external_ **force act on the two bodies**, the only forces experienced by the two bodies A and B during the collision will be the mutual normal contact forces, \(F_{AB}\) and \(F_{BA}\), respectively.

By Newton's 3\({}^{\text{rd}}\) law, the two forces must be equal but opposite:

\[\vec{F}_{AB}=-\vec{F}_{BA}\]

Since the entire interaction is simultaneous and over the same duration, the impulses of the two forces must also be equal but opposite:

\[\begin{array}{c}\int\vec{F}_{AB}\ dt=\int-\vec{F}_{BA}\ dt\\ \vec{J}_{AB}=-\vec{J}_{BA}\end{array}\]

It follows that the momentums exchanged between A and B must also be equal but opposite:

\[\left(\Delta\vec{\rho}\right)_{A}=-\left(\Delta\vec{\rho}\right)_{B}\]

If we see the two billiard balls as making up one system, then the **total momentum of the system does not change** in the collision:

\[\begin{array}{c}\sum\Delta\vec{\rho}=\left(\Delta\vec{\rho}\right)_{A}+ \left(\Delta\vec{\rho}\right)_{B}\\ =\left(\Delta\vec{\rho}\right)_{A}+-\left(\Delta\vec{\rho}\right)_{A}\\ \sum\Delta\vec{\rho}=0\end{array}\]

The above derivation can be extended to include any number of interacting objects in three-dimensional space, involving forces of any nature (magnetic, electric, gravitational, etc.), as long as the condition of **no resultant external force** holds. The logic is surprisingly straight-forward:

\[\begin{array}{cccc}\sum\vec{F}=0&\Rightarrow&\sum\vec{J}=0&\Rightarrow& \sum\Delta\vec{\rho}=0\end{array}\]

Thus the general statement of the principle of conservation of momentum is

**Statement of the Principle of Conservation of Linear Momentum**

The **total linear momentum** of a system **remains unchanged** if **no net external force** acts on the system. Mathematically, \(\ \sum m_{n}\vec{u}_{n}=\sum m_{n}\vec{v}_{n}\)

The principle is **NOT restricted to collisions!**

Sadly, every year, many students get zero marks during examinations when asked to state the principle of conservation of linear momentum, because they write about momentum before and after collisions and stuff.

Notes:

* By a system, we mean a set of objects that we choose.
* Some textbooks refer to the system as being _isolated_. An isolated system is one in which the only (significant) forces are those between the objects in the system. The sum of all these "internal" forces within the system will be zero because of Newton's 3rd Law.
* then the total momentum of the system will _not_ be conserved. E.g., if we take as our system a rock falling under gravity, the momentum of this system is _not_ conserved because an _external_ force, the gravitational pull by the Earth is acting on it. However, if we include the Earth in the system, the total momentum of rock plus Earth _is_ conserved.

**Example 8: (Freedman)**

An open-topped freight car with mass 24 000 kg is coasting along without friction along a level track. It is raising very hard and the rain is falling vertically downward. Originally the car is empty and moving with a speed of 4.00 m/s. What is the speed of the car after it has collected 3000kg of rainwater?

**Answer:**

#### Two-body Systems

For a **two-body system**, the principle of conservation of momentum can be mathematically simplified as follows:

\[\begin{array}{c}\left(\Delta\vec{p}\right)_{A}=-\left(\Delta\vec{p}\right)_ {B}\\ \left(\vec{p}_{r}-\vec{p}_{i}\right)_{A}=-\left(\vec{p}_{r}-\vec{p}_{i}\right) _{B}\\ m_{A}(\vec{v}_{A}-\vec{u}_{A})=m_{B}(\vec{u}_{B}-\vec{v}_{B})\\ m_{A}\vec{u}_{A}+m_{B}\vec{u}_{B}=m_{A}\vec{v}_{A}+m_{B}\vec{v}_{B}\end{array}\]

**Example 9**

A marksman holds a rifle of mass \(M=3.00\) kg loosely in his hands, so as to let it recoil freely when fired. He fires a bullet of mass \(m=5.00\) g horizontally with a velocity of \(\nu_{B}=300\) m s\({}^{-1}\).

What is the recoil velocity \(\nu_{R}\) of the rifle?

Answer:

Note that since both the rifle and bullet are **stationary** before firing, the total initial momentum of the system is **zero**. Since momentum is a vector quantity, in order for the final total momentum to be zero, the **rife must move in the direction opposite to the bullet** (recoil).

#### Types of Collisions

A **collision** is an isolated event in which two or more interacting bodies exert **relatively strong** forces on each other for a relatively short time. Note that the two bodies do not necessarily have to be in any physical contact, as interaction may involve a force at a distance.

##### 3.3.2.1 Head-on vs Glancing Collisions

Head-on collision (1-D)Glancing collision (2-D)

A **head-on** collision is one in which the directions of motion before and after the collision are along the same line of motion.

##### 3.3.2.2 Elastic vs Inelastic Collisions

The total _kinetic_ energy of the colliding bodies is _not_ necessarily conserved during a collision. (This is unlike the total momentum, which is _always_ conserved during a collision.) Some kinetic energy is usually converted into vibrational energy of the atoms, causing a heating effect, sound, and deformation energy. How much of the original kinetic energy is conserved after the collision depends on the **elasticity** of the collision.

* An **elastic** collision is one where 100% of the kinetic energy is conserved, e.g. two diamonds bouncing off each other. Note that _during_ an elastic collision, some of the kinetic energy can temporarily be converted to potential energy.
* An **inelastic** collision is one that is _not_ elastic, i.e. some or all of the kinetic energy is converted into vibrational energy, sound, deformation energy, etc.
* A **perfectly inelastic** collision is one where the 2 objects coalesce (stick together) and move with **common velocity** after the collision, e.g. two lumps of clay that don't bounce at all, but stick together after the collision. This represents the **maximum possible loss** of kinetic energy without violating the principle of conservation of energy; it does _not_ necessarily mean all the kinetic energy is lost.

Note that **momentum** is **always** conserved, regardless of whether a collision is elastic or inelastic. In most exam questions, you will have to apply the principle of conservation of linear momentum.

**Example 10** (Perfectly Inelastic collision)

A car of mass 1000 kg moving at 20.0 m s\({}^{-1}\) collides with a car of mass 1200 kg, moving at 5.0 m s\({}^{-1}\) in the same direction.

(a) If the collision is perfectly inelastic, determine their final velocity after the collision.

(b) Calculate also the ratio of (total final kinetic energy) to (total initial kinetic energy).

**Answer:**

#### 3.3.2.3 Relative Speed of Approach/Separation during Elastic Collisions

Consider a two-body elastic head-on collision.

\[\begin{array}{c}\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt, width=142.26378pt]{figure1}\end{array}\]

By the principle of conservation of momentum,

\[m,\nu_{1}+m_{2}\nu_{2}=m,\nu_{1}+m_{2}\nu_{2}\]

Rearranging, we get

\[m_{1}(\nu_{1}-\nu_{1})=m_{2}(\nu_{2}-\nu_{2})\]

Since the kinetic energy is conserved during an elastic collision,

\[\frac{1}{2}m,{\nu_{1}}^{2}+\frac{1}{2}m_{2}{\nu_{2}}^{2}=\frac{1}{2}m,{\nu_{1 }}^{2}+\frac{1}{2}m_{2}{\nu_{2}}^{2}\]

Rearranging, we get

\[m_{1}({\nu_{1}}^{2}-{\nu_{1}}^{2})=m_{2}({\nu_{2}}^{2}-{\nu_{2}}^{2})\]

\[m_{1}(\nu_{1}-\nu_{1})(\nu_{1}+\nu_{1})=m_{2}(\nu_{2}-\nu_{2})(\nu_{2}+\nu_{2}) \]

Dividing question (2) by equation (1),

\[(\nu_{1}+\nu_{1})=(\nu_{2}+\nu_{2})\]

Rearranging, we get

\[(\nu_{1}-\nu_{2})=(\nu_{2}-\nu_{1})\]

The \((\nu_{1}-\nu_{2})\) term represents the relative speed of approach before the collision.

The \((\nu_{2}-\nu_{1})\) term represents the relative speed of separation after the collision.

We thus come to the following conclusion:

\[\begin{array}{c}\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt, width=142.26378pt]{figure2} \end{array}\]

For **elastic** collisions, the relative speed of approach is equal to the relative speed of separation.

Mathematically, \(\nu_{1}-\nu_{2}=\nu_{2}-\nu_{1}\)

This result can only be applied for a 2-body **elastic** collision. During examinations, the above statement must be **made** before it can be applied mathematically in solving problems.

**Example 11**: Assuming the following are **head-on elastic collisions**, solve for the unknown velocity \(\nu\) in each case. Note that the masses of the objects are not (necessarily) equal.

**Sloving 2-body Collision Problems**

Step 1: Indicate velocity vectors for each of the bodies before and after the collision. Choose a convenient positive direction, usually to the right. You can assume the unknown velocities are all positive. If the solutions turn out to be negative later, it means these velocities are in the negative direction.

Step 2: Set up the equation for the principle of conservation of linear momentum. The positive direction chosen in step 1 helps us to define the signs of the (known) velocities in the equations: velocities in the positive direction get a "+" and those in the negative direction get a "-".

Step 3: IF the collision is perfectly inelastic, use one variable to represent the final velocities of both bodies (i.e. make \(\nu_{1}=\nu_{2}=\nu\) ).

IF the collision is elastic, you will probably have two unknown velocities and need another equation. (You need as many independent equations as there are unknowns to solve them uniquely.) Use the equation for relative speed of approach/separation (preferred) of that for the conservation of kinetic energy (which is more tedious, as it is a quadratic equation).

Step 4: Solve for the unknowns, e.g. mass, initial or final velocities.

## Appendix A Static and Kinetic Friction

### Static Friction

The magnitude of _static_ friction between two surfaces can be expressed as

\[f_{s}\leq\mu_{s}N\]

where \(\mu_{s}\) is the coefficient of static friction between the two surfaces in question and \(N\) is the magnitude of the normal contact force between the two surfaces.

Static friction thus has a maximum magnitude, called the limiting friction, \(f_{\max}=\mu_{s}N\).

### Kinetic Friction (or sliding friction or dynamic friction)

The magnitude of _kinetic_ friction between two surfaces can be expressed as

\[f_{k}=\mu_{k}N\]

where \(\mu_{k}\) is the coefficient of kinetic friction between the two surfaces in question and \(N\) is the magnitude of the normal contact force between the two surfaces.

Unlike the static friction, kinetic friction is a constant value. It is also independent of the relative speed of motion.

Both \(\mu_{s}\) and \(\mu_{k}\) are empirically found to be always less than 1 (friction is always less than the normal contact force). \(\mu_{k}\) is found to be always less than \(\mu_{s}\) (kinetic friction is always smaller than the limiting static friction).

To better understand the two, consider the results of the following experiment.

An external force is applied on the block and is increased very gradually until the block starts moving and continues to move at a constant speed. Since the block is always either stationary or moving at constant speed, the magnitude of the frictional force can be inferred from the applied force as measured by the force sensor.

The graph of the applied force against time is shown below in relation to the magnitudes of friction, both static and kinetic:

## Appendix B: Newton's Law in Car Safety

Using Newton's laws, discuss how each of the following features in vehicles increases the safety of its passengers:

a) seat belts,

b) head restraints,

c) air bags.

**(a)**: Seat belt exerts a retardation force on the passenger, without which he would have continued in his state of uniform motion in a straight line into the windscreen. (Newton's 1st Law).

If a moving car crashes into another (stationary) car, it comes to an abrupt stop. If the passenger continues to move forward, he will crash into the windscreen and likely suffer from severe injuries, or even death. Without the seat belt, the only retardation force on the passenger is the frictional force between the seat and the passenger's bum. But this force is limited. If the vehicle decelerates too fast, the frictional force is not large enough to decelerate the passenger at the same rate as the vehicle. When passengers crash into the wind screen, it is due to their inertia: they are already moving forward and continue to do so. It is not due to some mysterious "forward force" that pushes them into the wind screen
**(b)**: If a car is hit from the rear, the head restraint provides a forward force on the passenger's head so that the head is accelerated at the same rate as the rest of his body. If the passenger's body accelerates forward much faster than his head, the passenger may suffer from whiplash (a kind of neck injury). The muscles in the passenger's neck do not provide enough force to accelerate his head as fast as the rest of his body. (Newton's 2nd Law)
**(c)**: A collision with the car's wind screen would bring the passenger to rest in a very short period of time. Airbags exert a relatively small force over a relatively long duration of time, safely bringing the passenger to rest by reducing the passenger's momentum at a relatively slower rate. (Newton's 2nd Law)
