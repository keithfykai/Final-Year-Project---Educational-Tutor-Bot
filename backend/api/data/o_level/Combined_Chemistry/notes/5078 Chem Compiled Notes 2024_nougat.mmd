How are SPA soluble salts prepared?
* **Tiltration** soluble + soluble (acid) \(\rightarrow\) soluble salt
* Sodium, potassium and ammonium do not form insoluble compounds, hence exact volume have to be used to avoid contamination of the salt. \(\triangleright\)acid + alkali
* **acid + carbonate solution** Eg: \(\text{HNO}_{3}(\alpha\text{q})+\text{NaOH}(\alpha\text{q})\rightarrow\text{NaNO}_{ 3}(\alpha\text{q})+\text{H}_{2}\text{O}(\text{I})\)

1. **Pipette 25.0 cm\({}^{3}\)** of aqueous sodium hydroxide into a conical flask. Add \(2-3\) drops of methyl orange. The indicator turns yellow.
2. Add nitric acid slowly from a burette into the conical flask with swirling, until the indicator turns orange permanently. This is the endpoint.
3. Note the volume of acid required to neutralise the alkali. Repeat the titration to determine the average volume of acid required.
4. Repeat the titration using the determined volume of acid without an indicator.
5. Heat the sodium nitrate solution until it is saturated. Allow the saturated solution to cool and crystallise.
6. Filter off the crystals. Wash the crystals with cold distilled water. Dry the crystals with filter paper.

Reason for Steps 1 & 2:

The reaction of an aqueous alkali/carbonate solution and acid cannot be determined visually, thus an indicator is necessary to show a colour change which represents complete reaction and no reactant is in excess.

Reason for Step 3:

The amount of each reactant is confirmed and there is no need to add in the indicator anymore, as it will contaminate the salt formed. We want to obtain a pure salt.

What is the purpose of adding aqueous sodium hydroxide & aqueous ammonia?

Dissociate to produce OH-ions to form an insoluble hydroxide as a precipitate.

How do you remember the results of cation tests?

First, by colours of ppt. (coloured ppt. are the most obvious)

Next, by the solubility of the (white) ppt. In excess aqueous sodium hydroxide & aqueous ammonia; Zn(OH)\({}_{2}\) while ppt. dissolves in excess in both aqueous sodium hydroxide & aqueous ammonia.

Co2* has very different results compared with the other while precipitates!

What are the identities of the ppt.?

Hydroxides of the cations

Co(OH)\({}_{2}\), Zn[OH]\({}_{2}\), Pb[OH]\({}_{2}\), Cu(OH)\({}_{2}\), Fe[OH]\({}_{2}\), Fe[OH]\({}_{3}\)

E.g.

Chemical equation: CuSO\({}_{4}\) (eq) + ZnSOH (eq) \(\rightarrow\) Cu(OH)\({}_{2}\) (s) + Na\({}_{2}\)SO\({}_{4}\) (eq)

Ionic equation: Cu\({}^{2*}\) (eq) + 2OH\({}^{*}\) (eq) \(\rightarrow\) Cu(OH)\({}_{2}\) (s) [blue ppt.]

Why does the ammonium ion produce ammonia gas upon warming with aqueous sodium hydroxide?

Recall: ammonium salt + alkali - salt + water + ammonia gas 

## 1 Redox

A redox reaction: _a chemical reaction which involves the oxidation of a reactant and reduction of another reactant at the same time_.

Definitions of oxidation and reduction for reactants:

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|} \hline  & **Oxidation** & **Reducclon** \\ \hline O atom(s) & gains & loses \\ \hline H atom(s) & loses & gains \\ \hline electron(s) & loses & gains \\ \hline oxidation & increases & decreases \\ \hline \end{tabular}

Oxidising agent: a reactant that causes the other reactant to be oxidised

giving oxygen; removing hydrogen; or accepting electrons;

**Itself is reduced in the process**

Reducing agent: a reactant that causes the other reactant to be reduced

removing oxygen; giving hydrogen; or donating electrons

**Itself is oxidised in the process**

Oxidising agents & Reducing agents \\ \hline oxygen (Oa) & reactive metals \\ \hline chlorine (Cl) & carbon (C) \\ \hline bromine (Br) & carbon monoxide \\ \hline _[QA]: potassium_ & _[QA]: sulfur dioxide_ \\ _manganate(VII) & _[QA]: sulfur dioxide_ \\ _(KMnO)_ & _[SO2]_ \\ \hline \end{tabular}

## 2 Redox in terms of O atom(s)

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|} \hline  & **Redox in terms of O atom(s)** \\ \hline \(2\)Mg (s) + O\({}_{2}\) (g) \(\to\) 2MgO (s) \\ oxidised & reduced \\ RA & OA \\ \hline \end{tabular}

## 3 Redox in terms of electrons

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|} \hline  & **Redox in terms of O atom(s)** \\ \hline \(\mathrm{N_{2}}\) (g) + \(3\mathrm{H_{2}}\) (g) \(\to\) 2NH\({}_{3}\) (g) \\ reduced & oxidised \\ OA & RA \\ \hline \end{tabular}

## 4 Redox in terms of oxidation state

Oxidation state: the charge an atom of an element would have if it existed as an ion in a compound.

This is true even if the atom is covalently bonded.

When a substance loses or gains electrons, its oxidation state changes

**Rules to work out oxidation states:**

1. The oxidation state of **a free element is 0**. (Cu, Mg, H2, O2 etc)
2. The oxidation state of **a simple ion is the same as the charge** on the ion. (_CI -?_, O.S. is -1 for chlorine)
3. Some elements have **a** fixed oxidation state in their compounds (Group I is +1, Group II is +2, O is -2, H is +1).

**Some possible exceptions:**

NoH, sodium hydride; H is -1

H2O2, hydrogen peroxide; O is -1

HOCI, hypochlororous acid; Cl is +1
4. The oxidation states of all the atoms or ions in **a** compound add up to 0.

e.g. CaO; (+2) +(-2) = 0
5. The sum of oxidation numbers of all the atoms in **a** polyatomic ion is the same as the charge on the ion.

e.g. OH; (-2) +(+1) = -1

\begin{tabular}{c c}  & **Test for oxidising agents:**

Add 2 cm3 of the reducing agent, aqueous

**polassium iodide, KI, to the unknown solution in **a** test tube. \\ \end{tabular}

_Not all reactions are redox reactions_ e.g. neutrolisation and precipitation as there is no change in the oxidation states of the elements from reactants to products.

**Observation:**

Colourless potassium iodide solution turns

brown.

**Explanation:**

Iodide ions are oxidised to iodine molecules by the oxidising agent; the iodine solution formed

is brown.

**Test for reducing gases:**

Place a piece of filter paper soaked with acidified potassium mangonate(VII), KMnO4, at the mouth of the test tube.

**Test for reducing solutions:**

Add 2 cm3 of the oxidising agent, acidified potassium manganate(VII), KMnO4, to the unknown solution in **a** test tube.

**Observation:**

Purple acidified potassium manganate(VII)

solution turns colourless.

**Explanation:**

Manganate(VII) ion MnO4 is reduced to manganese(II) ion Mn2+.

Oxidation state of Mn decreases from +7 to +2.

MnO4 (aq) + 6H+(aq) + 5e- \(\rightarrow\) Mn2+(aq) + 4H2O (I)

purple colourless

**Question:**

Mg(s) + 6H(g) \(\rightarrow\) MgC_h_(s)

Explan why this is **a** redox reaction?

How is chlorine acting as an oxidizing agent?

## Methods

* [1]**General Physical Properties of Metals*
* good conductors of heat and electricity
* have high melting points and boiling points and densities (except Group I metals)
* solids at room temperature and pressure (except mercury)
* are malleable and ductile
* Diagrams of Metallic and Alloy Structure
* [2]**Why are pure metals not widely used?*
* Pure metals are soft as the atoms are packed regularly in layers. The layers can slide over one another easily when \(\alpha\) force is applied.
* Pure metals may react with air and water and thus wear away or corrode easily.

Alloys
* A mixture of \(\alpha\) metal with one or \(\alpha\) few other elements
* E.g. brass (Cu & Zn), stainless steel (Fe, C, Cr & Ni)

Why are metals used in the form of alloys?
* Make metals harder and stronger
* Improve the appearance of metals
* Lower the melting points of metals
* Make metals more resistant to corrosion

Why are alloys stronger and harder than their constituent metals?

* The **atoms** of the different metals or elements have different sizes.
* This disrupts the orderly arrangement of atoms in the pure metal, thus making it difficult for the layers of different-sized atoms to slide over each other when \(\alpha\) force is applied.

* Arangement of metals from the most reactive to the least reactive.
* Determined by:
* reaction of metals with cold water or steam
* reaction of metals with dilute hydrochloric acid
* More reactive metals have \(\alpha\) higher tendency to lose electrons (more reducing) to form positive ions compared to metals that are less reactive.

The Reactivity Series can be used to:

* predict the behaviour of \(\alpha\) metal from its position in the reactivity series; predict the position of an unfamiliar metal in the reactivity series from \(\alpha\) given set of experimental results.

**Displacement Recalcions of Metals**

A more reactive metal can displace the ions of a less reactive metal from its salt solution.

E.g. 1: Place a 2-cm length magnesium ribbon into copper(II) sulfate solution in \(\alpha\) test-tube.

Mg (s) + CuSO\({}_{4}\) (\(\alpha\)q) \(\rightarrow\) Cu (s) + MgSO\({}_{4}\) (\(\alpha\)q)

Blue solution starts to fade.

Copper metal is deposited as a pink/ reddish-brown solid on magnesium.

E.g. 2: Place a copper foil into iron(III) sulfate solution in \(\alpha\) test-tube.

No displacement reaction occurs thus there is no visible reaction.

**Extraction of Metals**

Metal ore: an ore contains a compound of the metal (oxides, sulfides, chlorides or carbonates) with sand

The process of obtaining metals fromores is called the extraction of metals.

There are two main methods to extract metals from their ones. They are:

Electrolysis of the molten melt compound, &.

Reduction by carbon in a blast furnace

The method used to extract a metal depends on the position of the metal in the carefully series. The methods used for extracting some common metals are summarized below.

\begin{tabular}{c}  \\ \end{tabular} The position of the metal in the Reactivity Series determines the method used for its extraction. The more reactive the metal is, the harder it is to extract the metal from its ore.

Why is this so?

The more reactive the metal, the stronger the electrostatic forces of attraction between the oppositely-charged ions of its compounds.

Hence, more energy is needed to extract the more reactive metals from their compounds.

## 4 Removal of impurities

L limestone is decomposed by heat to produce carbon dioxide and calcium oxide,

CoCO\({}_{3}\) (s) \(\rightarrow\) CoO (s) + CO\({}_{2}\) (g)

The **basic oxide**, calcium oxide, reacts with the **acidic impurities**, sand - SiO\({}_{2}\) in the iron ore to form molten slag.

CoO(s) + SiO\({}_{2}\) (s) \(\rightarrow\) CoSiO\({}_{3}\) (I)

Lighter slag runs down and floats on top of the molten iron. Mollen slag and molten iron can be topped separately from the furnace.

* [17] Using a protective layer
* [18] To keep iron/ steel from coming into contact with oxygen and water
* fin or zinc
* [20] This layer cannot be scratched or damaged.

The Need to Recycle Metals
* to ensure that the supply of metals last longer**.

Recycling Steps
* [22] Metal objects which are no longer needed are collected,
* crushed and
* [23] melted into blocks of clean metals.

Advantages of Recycling Metals
* [24] Better conservation of natural resources such as fossil fuels as extraction of metals from their ones requires a continuous supply of energy; by recycling metals, there is no need for metal extraction.
* [25] Reduce environmental problems related to extracting metals from their ones and better land use.
* [26] Mixed land cannot support life.
* [27] Waste from extraction, if not disposed properly, will leach into soil and pollute the land and water,
* [28] Recycling frees up land for agriculture and housing and greatly reduce pollution.
* [29] Saves cost of extracting metals from their ones as fewer land fills need to be built to dispose used metal objects and waste material from metal extraction.

**Chemical Properties:**

* **reacts with cold water to form an alkali and hydrogen**

Place 2 g of metal into a weaker containing 100 cm\({}^{3}\) cold water.

**U: reacts quickly. Lithium floats on water. No flame is seen. 2ti (s) + 2H\(\alpha\)O (\(I\)) \(\rightarrow\) 2lUGH (\(\alpha\)) + H\({}_{2}\) [g]**

**No: reacts violently. Sodium melts into a silver ball and darts about on the surface of water. The hydrogen gas may catch fire and burn with a yellow flame. 2N\(\alpha\) (s) + 2H\(\alpha\)O (\(I\)) \(\rightarrow\) 2l NaOH (\(\alpha\)) + H\({}_{2}\) [g]**

**K: reacts very violently. Potassium burst into flames upon contact with water. The hydrogen gas may catch fire and burn with a llac flame. 2K (s) + 2H\(\alpha\)O (\(I\)) \(\rightarrow\) 2KOH (\(\alpha\)q) + H\({}_{2}\) [g]**

**Chemical Trend Down Group I**

* **reactivity increases (Fracticum is the most reactive)**
* **as the size of the atom increases, it becomes easier to lose its valence electron as this electron is further away from the positively-charged nucleus.**

**Group VII: Halogens**

* **Physical Properties**
* **exist as diatomic molecules (F\({}_{2}\), C\({}_{L}\), Br\({}_{2}\), I\({}_{2}\) and A\({}_{2}\)) with low melting and boiling points**
* **a low amount of energy is needed to overcome the weak intermolecular forces of attraction between halogen molecules**
* **coloured**

* **halogen**
* **f.t.p**
* **C\({}_{L}\) **gos**
* **greeish-yellow**
* **Br\({}_{2}\) **liquid**
* **reddish-brown**
* **I\({}_{2}\) **solid**
* **purplish-black**
* **At\({}_{2}\) **solid**
* **black**

* **Physical Trends Down Group VII**
* **melting points and boiling points increase (physical state changes from gases to liquid to solids)**
* **colours of halogens become darker**

* [1] **Measuring Speed from the Decrease in Mass of Reactant at Regular Time Intervals**

We can also measure the decrease in mass of the reaction mixture **if one of the products is a gas**. When the gas escapes to the surrounding, there will be a decrease in the mass of the flask and its contents.

## 2 Concentration (of _solutions e.g. acids_)

* [2] **The more concentrated the solution, the more recating particles per unit volume.**
* [3] **The reacting particles are closer together, hence the frequency of effective collisions increases, more recation increases.**
* [4] **The higher the concentration of the reactants, the faster the speed of reaction.**

* [5] **Using a measuring cylinder, measure 50 cm**\({}^{3}\) **of** \(1\) **mol/dm**\({}^{3}\) **HC**\(I\) **in a beaker.**
* [6] **Add 2 cm of magnesium ribbon into the HC**\(I\) **in the beaker and start the stopwatch.**
* [7] **As soon as the magnesium has completely dissolved, stop the stopwatch and record the time taken.**
* 3 with 50 cm**\({}^{3}\) **of** \(2\) **mol/dm**\({}^{3}\) **HC**\(I\) **using fresh magnesium (2 cm).**
* [9] **Record the time taken in a suitable format e.g. (table).**

* [1] **The reacting gaseous particles are closer together, hence the frequency of effective collisions increases, more product formed, thus the speed of reaction increases.**
* [1] **The higher the pressure of gaseous reactants, the faster the speed of reaction.**
## 3 Surface area/particle size

The surface area \(\propto\) 1 / particle size, the larger the exposed surface area of these particles.

There is more exposed surface area for the other reactant particles to collide into. Therefore, the frequency of effective collisions increases, more product formed, thus the speed of reaction increases.

The smaller the particle size, the larger the exposed surface area, the faster the speed of reaction.

## 4 Temperature

As the temperature increases, more particles have energy greater than the activation energy and the reacting particles gain more energy, moving faster.

The frequency of effective collisions increases, more product formed, thus the speed of reaction increases.

The higher the temperature, the faster the speed of reaction.

## 5 Experiment to Investigate Factor:

1. 50 cm\({}^{3}\) of HC/I is measured and placed in a small beaker.
2. Add a strip of magnesium ribbon (2 cm) into the small beaker with HC/I at 20 \({}^{\circ}\)C.
3. Start the stopwatch immediately and stop the timing when the magnesium ribbon has just fully disappeared.

Record the time taken.
4. Repeat steps 1 - 3 at different temperatures of 30 \({}^{\circ}\)C, 40 \({}^{\circ}\)C, 50 \({}^{\circ}\)C and 60 \({}^{\circ}\)C of HC/I.
5. The higher the temperature, the shorter the time taken by the reaction, the faster the speed of reaction.
