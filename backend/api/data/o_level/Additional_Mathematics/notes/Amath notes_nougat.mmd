**Chapter 8: Linear Law**

The graph of a linear equation \(Y=mx+c\) is a straight line with gradient \(m\) and \(y\) intercept \(c\).

There are 2 parts to solving linear law questions: Draw a straight line graph to determine gradient and \(y\)-intercept, and to find the equation of the straight line.

**Key Steps**:

1.) Force the equation into the form of \(Y=mx+c\).
2.) Take some experimental values of \(x\) and \(y\) and compute the corresponding values of \(X\) and \(Y\).
3.) Use these computed values to plot the points on a graph with \(X\) and \(Y\) axis.
4.) Draw a line passing through the plotted points. Always have more space at the lower end of graph for the line to cut the \(Y\) axis for \(Y\)-intercept.
5.) Obtain the Gradient and the \(Y\)-intercept.

Note: In \(Y=mx+c\)

(a): \(Y\) must not have any coefficient,

(b): \(mx\) is part constant and part variable.

(c): \(c\) must not contain any variable \(X\) and \(Y\).

\begin{tabular}{|p{142.3pt}|p{142.3pt}|} \hline Polynomial & An expression that is a sum of terms in the form ax\({}^{n}\) where n is non-negative and a is constant. \\ \hline To find unknown constants, either equate coefficients of like powers of x or substitute values of x. \\ \hline \end{tabular}

If a polynomial f(\(x\)) is divided by a linear divisor (\(x-a\)), the remainder is f(\(a\)).

If (\(x-a\)) is a factor of the polynomial f(\(x\)), f(\(a\)) = 0.

\begin{tabular}{|p{142.3pt}|p{142.3pt}|} \hline g(\(x\)) has & Corresponding Partial Fraction(s) \\ \hline linear factor \(ax+b\) & \(\frac{A}{ax+b}\) \\ \hline repeated linear factor \((ax+b)^{2}\) & \(\frac{A}{ax+b}+\frac{B}{(ax+b)^{2}}\) \\ \hline quadratic factor \(x^{2}+c^{2}\) (which cannot be factorised) & \(\frac{Ax+B}{x^{2}+c^{2}}\) \\ \hline \end{tabular}

Basically, a linear factor that cannot be factorised is to be remained in the same form. A repeated linear factor like \((ax+b)^{2}\)is to be split into 2: \(\frac{A}{(ax+b)}+\frac{B}{(ax+b)^{2}}\).

2. For \(y=\sqrt{x}\) or \(y=x^{2}\), x will be more or equal to 0 (x cannot be less than 0). y is also more than 0 as square root is taken to be positive.

Legend: Black: \(y=\sqrt{x}\). Brown: \(y=x^{2}\).

2. Comparing concavity of curves.

When \(y=\sqrt{x}\), graph concaves downwards.

When \(y=x\), graph is straight and constant.

When \(y=x^{2}\), graph concaves upwards.

3Graph of \(y^{2}=kx\)

1. The graph of \(y^{2}=x\) is actually a 90 degree clockwise rotation of the graph of \(y=x^{2}\) about the origin O.

2. In general, the graphs of \(y^{2}=kx\) have the same properties as that of \(y^{2}=x\) except that they differ in the steepness.

3. Each graph passes through (0, 0) and is symmetrical about the \(x\) axis.
