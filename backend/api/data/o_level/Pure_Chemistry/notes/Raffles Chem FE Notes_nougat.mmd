**Purification Techniques:**

If it's solid + solid dissolved in water (solution),

1. Filter mixture and collect residue/filtrate
2. A. Wash residue with deionised water and pat dry

B. Heat filtrate in an evaporating dish until all the water evaporates, collect remaining solid

If solid dissolved in water is thermally unstable, do crystallisation instead:

1. Heat solution in evaporating dish, stop heating when there is about \(\nicefrac{{1}}{{3}}\) of solution left
2. Let solution cool to allow crystals to form

3. Filter the mixture to obtain crystals, then pat dry

To collect the solvent from a solution (where solute and solvent have different boiling points) - use simple distillation

To separate a mixture of two miscible liquids, which have different boiling points - use fractional distillation

As vapours go up the fractionating column, they condense when they reach a part of the column that is below their boiling point

Liquid with the lower boiling point is collected as distillate

Fractionating beads increase the surface area for the condensation of vapour, making separation of vapours more efficient

To separate two immiscible liquids - separating funnel

To separate a solid from a solid that sublimines easily under heat - sublimation 

## 2 Bonding and Structure

\(\begin{array}{l}A\\ z^{X}\end{array}\)

A is the nucleon number, Z is the atomic number

Isotopes are atoms with the same number of protons but different number of neutrons

Relative molecular mass represents the average mass of one atom of an element taking into account the different isotopes and their relative abundances (Ar)

Ar = (Mr of isotope) x (abundance in %) + (Mr of other isotope) x (abundance in %)...

### Chemical Bonding

All chemical bonds are electrostatic forces of attraction

Physical Properties: mpt, bpt, conductivity and solubility

Ionic Bonds

- Usually formed when a metal reacts with a non-metal

- Soluble in water
- the charge of water molecules are attracted to the charges of ions in giant ionic structure and pulls the ions away from their regular arrangement

- Can conduct electricity in solid/aq state due to presence of free-moving ions

Covalent Bonds

- Forces pulling together molecules of non-metals* Giant Covalent: Insoluble in almost all solvents, poor conductors of electricity except graphite (ONLY MENTION GIANT COVALENT FOR GRAPHITE OR DIAMOND)
* Simple Molecular: Insoluble unless polar, do not conduct electricity (e.g ammonia, CO2, water)
* The greater the difference in electronegativities between the 2 bonded atoms in a covalent bond, the greater the polarity of the bond
* The more polar the molecules in a substance, the more soluble it is in water (e.g NH3)

Metallic Bonds

* 1, 2 or 3 valence electrons
* Insoluble in water, metal bonds do not dissolve in water
* Metallic bonds are between positive metal ions and sea of delocalised electrons
* Malleable and ductile: layers of atoms can easily slide against each other
* Good conductors of electricity due to movement of delocalised electrons

Graphite vs Diamond

Diamond: Strong covalent bonds holding carbon atoms together in a giant covalent structure

Graphite: Strong covalent bonds holding carbon atoms together in layers, WEAK Van der Waals forces (intermolecular forces of attraction) in between layers.

Graphite has a giant covalent structure where each carbon atom is covalently bonded to 3 other carbons in a hexagonal ring and has a 4th electron that is delocalised within each layer - conduct electricity.

## 3 Formulae and Mole Concept

Amount = Mole Conc. x Vol

Mass (g) = Mass Conc. x Vol

Mass (g) = Amount x Molar Mass (Mr)

Number of Particles = Amount x (6 x 10\({}^{23}\))

Gas _@_ rtp: Vol = N x 24 \(dm^{3}\)

For gases - Mole ratio = Vol ratio

Percentage Composition by Mass = \(\frac{\text{mass of element}}{\text{total mass of compound}}\times\) 100%

Percentage yield = \(\frac{\text{actual yield (usually given in question)}}{\text{theoretical yield (usually calculated)}}\times\) 100%

Percentage purity = \(\frac{\text{mass of pure substance in sample}}{\text{mass of sample}}\times\) 100%

Empirical Formula - Simplest ratio of atoms

Molecular formula - Actual number of atoms

Molecular formula = Empirical formula x N

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|} \hline  & H & O &... \\ \hline Assume 100g of \(\frac{\text{mass of element present/g}}{\text{mass of element present/g}}\) & & & \\ \hline Amount/mol (divide by Mr) & & & \\ \hline Divide by smallest no. of moles & & & \\ \hline Simplest ratio & & & \\ \hline \end{tabular}

#### Reaction Kinetics

Activation energy is the minimum amount of energy that reacting particles must possess in order to undergo the reaction. The smaller the Ea, the faster the reaction.

Increased temperature: This increases the number of reactant particles having the activation energy, causing particles to have greater kinetic energy and collide harder and more frequently

Increased concentration: This causes more particles per unit volume and thus more frequent effective collisions between reactant particles

Increased concentration would result in an increased amount of products, since the initial amount of reactant is also increased with its concentration increased

Increased pressure (for gases): This decreases the average distance between reactant particles thus more frequent effective collisions

Increased surface area (decreasing size of solid): This causes more frequent effective collisions between reactant particles

Catalyst: Provides an alternative pathway of lower activation energy, so more reactant particles will have activation energy and there will be more frequent effective collisions between them

A catalyst is not used up by the reaction; it may initially take part in the reaction but will finally be regenerated before the reaction ends

If one of the products is a gas then the usual method of determining the speed of reaction is shown below:

## Equilibrium

When the speed of a forward reaction is equal to the speed of a backwards reaction, a state of equilibrium is attained and the equilibrium mixture always contains both the reactants and the products. The reaction does not stop when equilibrium is attained; the amount of reactants and products are just constant

Le Chatelier's Principle states that if a system at equilibrium is subjected to a disturbance, the equilibrium's response is to counteract the disturbance to minimise its effect.

The Haber process, carried out at 200 atm, 450\({}^{\circ}\)C, using iron as a catalyst, is a reversible reaction:

N2+3H2 \(\rightleftharpoons\) 2NH3 \(\Delta\)H is negative

* Remove some NH3 from the equilibrium mixture System's response
- favour the forward reaction to replace the lost NH3, position of equilibrium shifts right, increasing the yield of NH3
* Temperature is increased System's response
- favour the backward endothermic reaction to absorb the excess heat from surroundings, position of equilibrium shifts left, decreasing the temperature of the equilibrium mixture
* Increase pressure of equilibrium mixture System's response
- favour the forward reaction to decrease the total number of molecules to relieve the pressure, position of equilibrium shifts right, increasing yield of NH3
* A catalyst does not affect the position of equilibrium or yield as it speeds up both the forward and the backward reaction and helps the reaction reach equilibrium earlier

AvT graph:

If only one of the reactants suddenly spikes, it is the addition/removal of that reactant (concentration) For gases, if all go through a spike, it is an increase/decrease in pressure or a increase/decrease in volume No spike, reactants increase and decrease, it is a change in temperature

RoRvT graph:

Forward reaction decreases at a decreasing rate while backward reaction increases at an decreasing rate to meet at a straight line in the middle - equilibriumPeriodic Table

Across a period,

Atomic radius decreases, as proton number increases, but the number of shielding electrons remains constant. Valence electrons are pulled closer to the nucleus, making the atom smaller.

**Group 1**:

- Low densities; densities increases down the group

- Melting point decreases down the group

- Soft and silvery

- Reactivity increases down the group as atoms are getting larger and the valence electron is getting further from the nucleus and is more easily lost

**Group 17**:

- 7 valence electrons, made up of diatomic molecules

- Elements become darker down the group

- Reactivity decreases down the group

- The more reactive halogen will displace the less reactive halogen from a solution of its ions

- Melting point increases down the group as molecules are getting larger and have stronger intermolecular forces of attraction which require more energy to break

**Group 18**:

- 8 valence electrons

- Chemically unreactive, provides an inert atmosphere

**Transition Metals**:

- High densities and melting points

- Colourful solid compounds and aqueous solutions

- Variable oxidation states in their compounds (e.g. Iron (II) chloride and Iron (III) chloride)

- Good catalysts (e.g Iron in Haber process)

Thermal stability is opposite of reactivity series

Reaction with water: the **hydroxide** is formed (e.g 2Na + 2H2O \(\rightarrow\) 2NaOH + H2) Reaction with steam: the **oxide** is formed (e.g Mg + H2O (g) \(\rightarrow\) MgO + H2) Extraction by carbon: also can use CO (e.g Fe2O3 + 3C \(\rightarrow\) 2Fe + 3CO or Fe2O3 + 3CO \(\rightarrow\) 2Fe + 3CO2) Extraction by hydrogen: PbO + H2O (hydrogen is highly flammable, not use on large scale)

Most metals are extracted from their oxides (ores) by reduction with carbon or carbon monoxide. Those that cannot be extracted through this method are usually extracted by electrolysis.

Displacement reaction: more reactive metal replace the ion or compound of a less reactive metalAlloying:

- Metals are soft and malleable due to the regular layers of atoms that are able to slide over each other easily.

- Alloying mixes other metals that have atoms of different sizes, so they are unable to form regular layers and cannot slide over each other

- Alloys are therefore harder and stronger

- Brittle too: When a force is focussed on a disruption in these regular layers, alloys can easily break

- Iron is alloyed with copper to make steel

- Mild steel (\(\sim\)0.25% carbon) used to make car bodies, bridges, railway lines

- Hard steel (\(\sim\)1% carbon) is harder and more brittle, used to make tools

- Stainless steel (other additives besides carbon) is used to make cutlery and surgical instruments

Corrosion of Metal:

The corrosion (or rusting) of metals (specifically iron) requires oxygen and water

Rusting can be prevented by:

1. Surface protection: Coating metal with a barrier to block air and water from reaching the metal underneath (paint or oil or plastic or a metal such as tin or chromium)
2. Sacrificial protection: Coat/have metal in contact with a more reactive metal. The more reactive metal reacts with oxygen and water in place of the less reactive metal, thus protecting it. Even if the layer of more reactive metal is scratched to expose the less reactive metal underneath, the less reactive metal is still protected (until all of the more reactive metal is corroded off)
3. Alloying: In stainless steel, the iron is mixed with carbon and copper and nickel. The chromium and nickel prevents the iron from reacting with water and oxygen

**Aluminium is covered by a layer of non-corroding, non-porous aluminium oxide that protects and prevents the metal from reacting, so it does not corrode easily**

## Electric Cell vs Electrolytic Cell

Electric Cell:

The two electrodes are 2 different metals

An electrolyte contains free, mobile ions

Electrons flow from the more reactive metal to the less reactive metal, and are then 'captured' by the cations in the electrolyte

The greater the difference in reactivity of the metals, the greater the voltage produced

The more reactive metal oxidises and loses electrons and moves from M to the other electrode. The M\({}^{+}\) ions produced due to the oxidation of M will enter the electrolyte, so M becomes smaller as the reaction progresses

**M**\(\rightarrow\)**M**\(++\)**e**-

The less reactive metal receives the electrons and passes them to the electrolyte. The cation in the electrolyte, Y\({}^{+}\), accepts the electrons to undergo reduction. A substance is produced at the less reactive metal, dependent on the identity of the cation Y\({}^{+}\) present in the electrolyte

**Y**\(++\)**e**- \(\rightarrow\)**Y**

Overall algebraic eq: M + Y\(+\)\(\rightarrow\) M\(++\) Y

### Clarifications:

In electric cells, **CRAO**

**Anode** - negative electrode: it is the **more reactive metal** and electrons are generated continuously through **oxidation**, so this is the source of negative charge and called the **negative electrode**.

**Cathode** - **positive** electrode - **reduction** occurs here - **less reactive** metalWhen an electric current is passed into an electrolyte, the free ions lose their random movement. Electrophysi is an ENDOTHERMIC reaction

**CRN Apo:**

The positive cations will be attracted to the **negative electrode (cathode)**; **reduction** occurs at the cathode where cations gain electrons and are discharged, forming products

The electrode is connected to the negative terminal of the power source and receive electrons from it, so it is negative.

The negative anions will be attracted to the **positive electrode (anode)**; **oxidation** occurs at the anode where anions lose electrons and are discharged, forming products

If an electrolyte is molten, it contains only 1 type of cations and anions that will be reduced and oxidised respectively. If an electrolyte is aqueous, it would also contain H+ and OH- ions, and the ions discharged will be dependent on the factors affecting electrolysis.

**IMPORTANT EQUATIONS**

Oxidation of OH-: 4OH- 2H2O + O2 + 4e-

Reduction of H+: H+ 2e-  H2

For 4 moles of electrons that pass through the circuit, 1 mole of oxygen and 2 moles of hydrogen gas are formed - therefore volume ratio of oxygen to hydrogen produced is theoretically **2:1**, however it is not exactly so as some oxygen dissolves back into the electrolyte while volume of hydrogen gas remains constant (O2 is slightly soluble in water while H2 is insoluble)Factors affecting electrolysis:

1. Electro-chemical series: which ion is "**preferentially oxidised/reduced** and discharged" - phrase like this
2. Concentration effect - **affects between halides and hydroxide ions - for cations it does affect but only those ions in near vicinity, not between ions where the distance between them in the electrochemical series is too great** (e.g between H\({}^{+}\) and Na\({}^{+}\))  Dilute - OH- \(>\) Cl-/I-  Concentrated - Cl-/I- \(>\) OH-
3. Nature of electrode  Inert electrodes are graphite and platinum; they do not interfere with the electrolysis  Active electrodes are other metals, it **takes part in the reaction** and is **preferentially oxidised** over OH- and other anions, so the active anode eventually becomes smaller and dissolves away (also check if cathode is preferentially reduced over the cations)

Industrial applications of electrolysis:

1. Electroplating - e.g in copper plating, the **object to be plated is the cathode** and the anode is the metal (copper), and the electrolyte is copper (II) sulfate solution. If object to be plated is non-conductive, object is first covered with a layer of graphite. During the plating process, the copper anode dissolved, forming Cu2+ and replenishing the Cu2+ used up for plating. Since **for every 1 mol of Cu2+ reduced to Cu at the cathode another 1 mol of Cu is oxidases to Cu2+ at the anode**, the blue colour of the solution remains the same as **concentration of Cu2+ is constant**.
2. Purification of copper - To get 100% pure copper, **impure copper is made the anode** and a small piece of pure copper the cathode, and the electrolyte is a copper (II) sulfate solution. The anode becomes smaller and the cathode larger as electrolysis progresses.

Hydrogen (as a fuel) burns cleanly - only producing water, and it also produces more energy per gram when burnt.

1. Hydrogen enters through an inlet. A catalyst at the anode speeds up the oxidation of hydrogen, producing electrons: H2 \(\rightarrow\) 2H\(+\) + 2e-
2. The electrons run in the external wire to go do work, and returns back to the cell, entering the current
3. At the cathode, the electrons react with oxygen in the air, as well as the H\(+\) ions that have diffused from the anode to the cathode: O2 + 4H\(+\) + 4e- \(\rightarrow\) 2H2O
4. **OVERALL REACTION: 2H2 + O2 \(\rightarrow\) 2H2O + electricity**
5. Here, the anode is the negative terminal, where electrons are running out of the cell 

**10. Organic Chemistry**

Fractional Distillation of Crude Oil:

1. Crude oil is heated in a furnace so that it evaporates

2. The vapours are passed up the fractionating column, which is cool at the top and hot at the bottom, and they begin to cool down and condense

3. Smaller hydrocarbons with lower boiling points are collected at the top column

4. Larger hydrocarbons with higher boiling points are collected at the bottom column

Cracking of hydrocarbons: (condition: high amounts of heat, catalyst AlO3 and SiO2(Silicon (V) oxide))

- Breaking larger hydrocarbons into smaller molecules of alkanes, alkenes and/or hydrogen

- The mixture of products is separated through fractional distillation

- Cracking is used to:

- Change heavy fractions (lubricating oil) in low demand to lighter fractions (petrol) in high demand

- Make alkenes (especially ethene)

- To make hydrogen gas

**Homologous series: A family of organic compounds with the same general formula and similar chemical properties**

Members in the same homologous series:

1. Same functional group, general formula, similar chemical properties

Functional group: An atom or a group of atoms that give a molecule its characteristic properties

2. Has a gradual change in their physical properties as the **number of carbon increases**:

**Mp/Bp increases, density increases, viscosity increases, flammability decreases**

Hydrocarbons are simple molecules held by intermolecular forces, as size of

molecules increase, strength of intermolecular forces increase, mpt/bpt increase

* All alcohols are colourless liquids at room conditions, first four members are soluble in water

* Preparation of Ethanol
* Preparation from ethene: C2H4 + H2O \(\rightarrow\) C2H5OH - a mixture of ethanol and steam are passed over heat and a catalyst (phosphoric acid)
* Preparation by **fermentation**: C6H12O6 \(\rightarrow\) 2 C2H5OH + 2 CO2 glucose \(\rightarrow\) 2 ethanol + 2 carbon dioxide Condition: 37\({}^{\circ}\)C, yeast, absence of oxygen - fermentation is an anaerobic process + to prevent the oxidation of ethanol into ethanoic acid Disadvantages of fermentation: - Slow - Fermentation gives a low yield as a high concentration of ethanol kills the yeast - Need to carry out fractional distillation to obtain pure ethanol from reaction mixture **Uses of ethanol**: solvent for organic compounds, alcoholic drinks (ethanol) and fuel
* Combustion: alcohol + O2 \(\rightarrow\) CO2 + H2O
* concentrated sulfuric acid
* acidified aq potassium (VII) manganate (KMnO4)
- the 2[O] represents oxygen that comes from the oxidising agent
KMnO4 can be used to **test for alcohol** - turns from purple to colourless as it is reduced Oxygen in the air can also oxidise alcohols - beer and wine left exposed in the air becomes sour due to the formation of ethanoic acid
5. Esterification: see carboxylic acids section

Carboxylic Acids:

- Vinegar is a solution of ethanoic acid and water, ethanoic acid is also known as acetic acid
- Acids with two carboxyl groups have names ending with -dioic
- First 4 members are liquids at room conditions. They partially dissociate in water and are weak acids

1. Preparation of Ethanoic Acid: 1. From ethanol: see oxidation 2. From methane: methane is used to manufacture methanol and carbon monoxide - and these two reacted together in the presence of a catalyst forms ethanoic acid Uses: manufacture esters which are used as solvents, insecticides, drugs
2. Acidic Properties: reacts with base, some metals and carbonates **Test for carboxylic acids** - react with carbonate since effervescence (carbon dioxide) is observed
3. Esterification: alcohol + carboxylic acid \(\rightleftharpoons\) ester + H2O Condition: concentrated sulfuric acid, heat Uses of esters (colourless liquid with a sweet smell): perfumes, flavouring Examples: ethanoic acid + propanol \(\rightleftharpoons\) propyl ethanoate + water (CH3COOH + C3H7OH \(\rightleftharpoons\) CH3COOC3H7 + H2O) - ester bond R - COO - R (including C=O and C-O) This is a reversible reaction, forward reaction is esterification and backwards reaction is **hydrolysis** - catalyst used would be dilute HCl

Condensation Polymerisation:

- Many monomers joining to form a polymer and at the same time removing small molecules like water
- forming an ester bond between two monomers when a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) reacts with an alcohol group (-OH)
Terylene is an example,

* Another condensation polymer is nylon, which is a polyamide. The amide bond between its monomers is formed from an amine group (-NH2) and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH), with the loss of H2O

\begin{tabular}{l l}  & Terylene and Nylon are used in the production of clothes, parachutes, fishing lines and sleeping bags \\ \end{tabular}

Plastics are usually non-biodegradable, there are 2 methods of recycling plastics:

1. Physical methods: breaking down plastics e.g poly(ethene) into smaller pieces, melting them into pellets that can be made into 'new' products
2. Chemical methods: 1. Cracking - larger molecules can be broken down into smaller molecules by applying high temperatures in the presence of a catalyst 2. Depolymerisation - a polyester can be converted to its monomers by reacting with acids like dilute hydrochloric acid - reaction is called hydrolysis. The acid provides H+ ions that act as a catalyst
