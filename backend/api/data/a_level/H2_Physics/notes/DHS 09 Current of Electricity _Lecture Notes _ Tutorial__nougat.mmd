## Introduction

Charge is a property possessed by some (but not all) elementary particles (e.g. electrons, protons). Charge is found as two types, positive and negative, which 'neutralise' one another if brought together in equal quantities. Objects that have an electrical charge exert electrostatic forces on each other.

The SI unit used to measure electrical charge is the **coulomb** (C). Physicists used to think that electrical charge could only be found in whole number multiples of a fundamental amount of charge,

\[e=1.602192\times 10^{-19}\ \mathrm{C}.\]

Charge on the proton = \(+e\)

Charge on the electron = \(-e\)

However, in the late 1960s, small particles called quarks were discovered with electric charge of either \(+\frac{2}{3}e\) or \(-\frac{1}{3}e\). These, together with \(-e\), seem to be the basic quantities of electric charge.

_(a)_ _show an understanding that electric current is the rate of flow of charge_

_(c)_ _recall and solve problems using the equation \(Q=It\)_

Electric current (SI base unit: _ampere_), consists of _charges in motion_ from one region to another. When this motion takes place within a conducting path that forms a closed loop, the path is called an _electric circuit_.

In metals, current is due to the flow of electrons which carry negative charges. It should be noted, however, that the direction of the current is, _by convention_, the direction that positive charges move.

At room temperature, metals such as copper or iron have electrons that are _free to move_ within the physical constraints of the material. These free electrons move _randomly in all directions_, somewhat like the molecules of a gas but with much greater speeds (of the order of \(10^{6}\) m s\({}^{-1}\)).

Electric current flowing through a cross-section of a conductor is the rate of flow of charges through it. Hence, the instantaneous current passing through a cross section of the conductor at a given time is given by

\[I=\frac{dQ}{dt}\]If the electric current \(I\) is steady, then the total amount of charge \(Q\) which flows past a point in a time duration \(t\) would be given by

**Example 1**

The diagram on the right shows a model of an atom in which two electrons move round a nucleus in a circular orbit. The electrons complete one full orbit in 1.0 x 10-10 s. What is the current caused by the motion of the electrons in the orbit?

**Example 2**

A high potential is applied between the electrodes of a discharge tube so that the gas is ionized. Electrons and positive ions move towards the positive and negative electrodes respectively. In each second, 5 x 1018 electrons and 2 x 1018 singly charged positive ions pass a cross-section of the tube. Determine the current flowing in the discharge tube.

**(b)**: _derive and use the equation I = nAvq for a current-carrying conductor, where n is the number density of charge carriers and v is the drift velocity_

The diagram shows a current passing through a cross section of a wire. Each positive charge carrier has charge \(q\) and there are \(n\) charge carriers per unit volume. Their average drift velocity is \(\nu\). One section of the wire has been magnified. Its cross-sectional area is \(A\).

Current = rate of flow of charge

= (number of charge carriers _per unit time_) \(\times\) (charge on each carrier)

The number of charge carriers _per unit time_ passing a point (P) in the wire is equal to the number contained in a volume of wire with length \(\nu\).

\(\therefore\) number of charge carriers per unit time \(=nAv\)

Thus the current in wire is

\(I=nAvq\)

Note

The thinner the wire (for the same current) the faster the charge carriers must move.

If current is increased, the only term that can increase is \(\nu\).

For the same length of wire, greater cross-sectional area allows more room for charge carriers, leading to more current.

### Drift velocity \(\nu\)

Thermal energy makes free charge carriers move about at high speeds (of the order of \(10^{6}\) m s\({}^{-1}\)). The collisions between electrons and metal ions are frequent and random. Thermal motion does not carry the electron any distance along the wire. Under the influence of a potential difference applied across the conductor, the charge carriers gain an additional drift motion that carries them along the conductor (at the order of \(10^{-4}\) m s\({}^{-1}\)) and as a result, charge is transferred. The direction of this drift is not random, as they are being directed by the field lines from the cell. This is the drift velocity.

**Example 3**

The number of free electrons per cubic metre in a copper wire is approximately 8.0 x 10\({}^{28}\), that is, about 1 or 2 free electron per atom. A typical diameter of wire is 1.0 mm. If the current is 1.0 A, what is the average speed of the electrons along the wire?

_Example 3_ shows how slowly electrons drift (often in the order of 10\({}^{-4}\) m s\({}^{-1}\)) along a wire, but there is no time delay between turning on a light switch and the light coming on. This is because the electric field is set up in the wire with a speed approaching the speed of light, and all the electrons start to move all along the wire at very nearly the same time. The time that it takes any individual electrons to get from the switch to the light bulb is not relevant.

A common misconception is that when a lamp, for example, is switched on, electrons somehow rush round to the lamp at a very high speed, hence it illuminates instantaneously. The magnitude of the drift velocity shows that this is quite clearly not the case. We should regard the connecting wires as being already 'full' of electrons all the way round the circuit and switching on merely starts the slow flow for all, rather like turning on a tap to start water flowing in 'full' water pipes.

### Analogy between waterfall and lighting circuit

Consider the analogy of the human powered waterfall to a simple lighting circuit.

The people act as a pump, taking water from the place where its potential energy is lowest and doing the necessary work to carry it uphill to the place where its potential energy is highest. The water then runs downhill, encountering resistance to its flow along the way before returning to the point with the lowest potential energy.

With the flow of water representing the flow of positive charge in an electric circuit, a battery plays a role analogous to the people who carry buckets of water. A battery takes positive charges from the place where the electric potential is lowest (negative terminal of the battery) and does the necessary work to move it to the place where the electric potential is the highest (positive terminal). Then the charge flows through an electrical device (i.e. light bulb) which offers resistance to the flow of current before returning to the negative terminal of the battery.

Just as water would flow naturally from a place with higher potential to a lower potential, electric current flows from a _point of higher potential_ in an electric circuit to a _point of lower potential_.

_(i)_ _distinguish between electromotive force (e.m.f.) and potential difference (p.d.) using energy considerations_

When a current passes through an electrical device, electrical energy is converted into other forms of energy (i.e. heat in a resistance wire, light emitted by a lamp or mechanical energy in a motor). The amount of electrical energy converted per unit charge is called the _electric potential difference_.

Mathematically, the electric potential difference \(V\) between two points in a circuit is given by

\[V=\frac{W}{Q}\]

where \(W\) is the energy transformed from electrical to non-electrical energy when a charge of \(Q\) flows in that part of the circuit.

The potential difference between two points in a circuit may be defined as

_work done per unit charge when electrical energy is transferred to non-electrical energy when the charge passes from one point to the other._

In order to maintain an electric current in an electrical circuit, a potential difference across the ends of the entire circuit is required. To achieve this, the ends of the electrical circuit may be connected to the opposite terminals of a battery.

This potential difference which is maintained by the battery is known the _electromotive force or the e.m.f. of the battery_. The e.m.f. is a measure of the work done per unit charge by the battery.

The e.m.f. of a source can be defined as _the work done per unit charge when non-electrical energy is transferred into electrical energy when the charge is moved round a complete circuit._

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|} \hline
**Electromotive Force** & **Potential Difference** \\ \hline Refers only to source. & Refers to any two points in an electrical circuit. \\ \hline Considers the amount of non-electrical energy converted into electrical energy per unit charge passing through the terminals of the cell (source). & Considers the amount of electrical energy converted to non-electrical energy per unit charge passing from one point to the other. \\ \hline It is a source of energy and it will exist whether or not a current is flowing in the circuit. & It can only exist if current is flowing in the electrical circuit. \\ \hline \end{tabular}

#### (d) recall and solve problems using the equation \(V=W/Q\)

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|} \hline
**Example 4** \\ \hline The potential difference across a resistor is 12 V. The current in the resistor is 2.0 A. A charge of 4.0 C passes through the resistor. \\ \hline What is the energy transferred in the resistor and the time taken for the charge to pass through the resistor? \\ \hline
**A** & 3.0 & 2.0 \\
**B** & 3.0 & 8.0 \\
**C** & 48 & 2.0 \\
**D** & 48 & 8.0 \\ \hline \end{tabular}

f) define the resistance of a circuit component as the ratio of the potential difference across the component to the current passing through it and solve problems using the equation \(V=IR\)

The _resistance_ of a conductor is a measure of its opposition to the flow of current through itself. It is the property of a given conductor which limits the current flow.

The same analogy that compares the flow of electric charge in a wire to the flow of water in a river, or in a pipe, acted on by gravity is helpful to understand how the current through the conductor depends on the potential difference across the conductor.

If the water is nearly level, the flow rate is small. However, if one end is higher than the other, the flow rate is greater. In fact, the greater the height difference, the larger the swift the water flow. The gravitational potential or height of the cliff is analogous to electric potential. Just as an increase in height can cause a greater flow of water, the _greater the electric potential difference_, the _larger the electric current_.

Exactly how large the current in the wire depends not only on the potential difference but also on the resistance the wire offers to the flow of electrons (current). The banks of the river or the rocks in the middle offer resistance to the flow of water. Similarly, electron flow in the conductor is impeded because of interactions with the atoms of the wire. The higher the resistance, the lesser the current for a given potential difference. So electrical resistance is such that the current is inversely proportional to the resistance.

The resistance \(R\) of a component is defined as the ratio of the potential difference across the component to the current passing through it.

Mathematically,

Ohm's Law

Georg Simon Ohm was the first to study the resistance of different materials systematically. He established experimentally that _a current (I) flowing through a conductor is directly proportional to the potential difference (V) applied across the conductor, provided that physical conditions (like temperature, stress of the material etc) remains constant._

Mathematically:

\[I\propto V\]

Hence, an implicit characteristic of ohmic conductors is that their resistance remains a constant.

**Point to Ponder**

When comparing Ohm's Law (\(I\propto V\)) to the definition of resistance (\(R=\frac{V}{I}\)), it would seem that the 2 relationships are the same. Hence, is the latter just a restatement of the former?

_(g)_ _sketch and explain the I-V characteristics of various electrical components such as an ohmic resistor, a semiconductor diode, a filament lamp and a negative temperature coefficient (NTC) thermistor_

The _I-V_ graph of a material, which is obtained experimentally, allows the resistance of the material to be determined for various values of \(V\) (or \(I\)). Why does the resistance of most materials not remain a constant?When the current passes through a material increases, the _temperature_ of the material is likely to increase. When the latter occurs, two main changes occur at the molecular level which affects the resistance of the material:

1. the number of charge carriers per unit volume, \(n\) (or the charge concentration) increases which reduces the resistance of the material.
2. the thermal vibrations of the lattice atoms increases which increases the resistance of the material.

_Metallic Conductor at Constant Temperature_

Since the conductor is maintained at constant temperature, number of free electrons per unit volume, \(n\) is fixed. The amplitude of atomic vibration and the rate of collisions with the atoms remains unchanged. Thus the resistance remains a constant and the conductor is said to be ohmic.

As \(V\) increases, \(I\) increases initially. Further increase of the \(V\) causes a less than proportionate increase in the current.

As the temperature increases, \(n\) will not vary significantly but the amplitude of atomic vibration increases and so does the number of collisions with the atoms per unit time. Since the increase in the rate of interaction of electrons with the lattice predominates over the increase of \(n\), the overall effect is that resistance \(R\) increases.

Considering for the _forward-biased_ region (region A) of the _I_-_V_ graph: As \(V\) increases, temperature of the semiconductor increases. Electrons in semiconductor are more likely to have sufficient energy to escape from a particular atom if the temperature is higher. This increases \(n\) significantly. At the same time, there is also an increase in rate of interaction of electrons with the vibrating atoms. However, as the increase in \(n\) predominates over the rate of interactions of electrons with the lattice, the overall effect is that resistance \(R\) decreases.

If the forward voltage is greater than a threshold value (0.7 V for silicon diode), then a large current will pass through the diode. Region B is known as the _reverse-biased region_. There is no current flow through the diode until the breakdown voltage (at least 50 V at room temperature).

#### 3.2.1 Negative Temperature Coefficient (NTC) Thermistor

An NTC thermistor's resistance falls as the temperature rises. As the temperature increases, the number of charge carriers per unit volume in the material increases, reducing the resistance.

As such, its _I-V_ characteristic is the same as that for a semiconductor diode for positive values of \(V\) and \(I\).

#### 3.2.2 (h) sketch the resistance-temperature characteristic of an NTC thermistor

Thermistors (thermal resistors) are semiconductor devices with resistances that change dramatically under different conditions.

An NTC thermistor's resistance falls as the temperature rises.

#### 3.2.3 (i) recall and solve problems using the equation R= \(\rho\)l / A

The resistance of a conductor depends on

* the nature of the material;
* the size of the sample (length and cross-sectional area);
* the temperature of the sample.

In many cases, the change in resistance with temperature is so small that it can be ignored except under extreme conditions.

Consider the analogy of water flow through a pipe; a longer pipe offers more resistance to water flow than a short pipe while a wider pipe offers lesser resistance than a narrow pipe. Hence, one would expect electrical resistance to be greater with a longer and thinner conductor.

It is found experimentally that the resistance \(R\) of any conductor is directly proportional to its length \(l\) and inversely proportional to its cross-section area \(A\).

Mathematically:

The constant of proportionality \(\rho\), known as the _resistivity_ (which depends on temperature), is the only factor in this equation governed by the nature of the material, and is independent of its length or cross-sectional area.

Metals generally have low resistivity values (of the order of \(10^{-8}\,\Omega\) m) whereas insulators such as rubber have high resistivity values (\(10^{13}\sim 10^{16}\,\Omega\) m). Semiconductors have intermediate resistivity values which are highly dependent on temperature; the room-temperature resistivity of a typical semiconductor is several orders of magnitude greater than that of a typical metal.

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|} \hline Material & Resistivity, \(\rho\) / \(10^{-8}\)\(\Omega\) m & Temperature coefficient, \(\alpha\) / \(10^{-3}\) K\({}^{-1}\) \\ \hline copper & 1.7 & 4.3 \\ \hline lead & 21.0 & 4.3 \\ \hline gold & 2.4 & 4.0 \\ \hline silver & 1.6 & 4.0 \\ \hline nichrome & 130.0 & 0.17 \\ \hline constantan & 47.0 & 0.02 \\ \hline \end{tabular}

**Example 5**

A cylindrical wire of radius \(r\) and length \(L\) has a resistance \(R\). Another wire made of a similar material has a radius \(2r\) and \(2L\). What is the resistance of the second wire in terms of \(R\)?

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|} \hline \(R=\rho\frac{l}{A}\) & & & \\ \hline Resistivity & \(\rho\) & & \\ \hline Length & \(L\) & & \\ \hline Cross-sectional Area & \(A\) & & \\ \hline Resistance & \(R\) & & \\ \hline \end{tabular}

_(e)   recall and solve problems using the equations P = VI, P = \(l^{2}R\) and P = \(V^{2}/R\)_

Potential difference \(V\) across two points is defined as the _work done W_ to transfer electrical energy to non-electrical energy when a charge \(Q\) moves through the points, and is given by

\[V=\frac{W}{Q}\]

If both the numerator and denominator are divided by time \(t\),

\[V=\frac{\frac{W}{Q}}{t}=\frac{P}{I}\]The result is re-arranged to give the familiar relationship

\[P=VI\]

where \(P\) is the electrical power dissipated by the conductor, \(I\) is the current passing through it and \(V\) is the potential difference across it.

Using the definition of resistance, alternative expressions for power dissipated can be obtained:

\[P=I^{2}R\]

\[P=\frac{V^{2}}{R}\]

### Power Rating

The rated power is the rate at which energy is used (power consumption) by a device when the device is operating at the rated potential difference across it.

For an electrical device rated 100 W, 220 V, it means that when a potential difference of 220 V is applied across the terminals of the device, the device dissipates 100 W of power.

**Example 6**

The same potential difference is applied across a 30 W light bulb and a 60 W light bulb. These bulbs operate at their rated power only when connected to a 120 V source. Assuming the resistance of the light bulbs remain the same, which one of the following statement is true?

* The 30 W bulb carries a greater current and has a higher resistance.
* The 30 W bulb carries a greater current, but the 60 W bulb has a higher resistance.
* The 30 W bulb has a higher resistance, but the 60 W bulb carries a greater current.
* The 60 W bulb carries a greater current and has a higher resistance * _show an understanding of the effects of the internal resistance of a source of e.m.f. on the terminal potential difference and output power._

Consider a simple circuit consisting of a cell and a resistor.

In an _ideal_ circuit,

* the connecting wires would have no resistance, and
* the p.d. \(V\) across the cell terminals (terminal p.d.) = e.m.f. \(E\) of the cell.

However, **real** cells always have some internal resistance \(r\) and not all electrical energy generated is available to the external load \(R\). Some energy is lost as heat within the source due to its internal resistance. As a result, the terminal p.d. is _not equal_ to the e.m.f. of the source.

The value quoted on a cell refers to the p.d. between its terminals when no current is flowing, or when its internal resistance is zero.

Note:

**The difference between 'cell' and 'battery'** is that a cell is a single unit which converts chemical energy to electrical energy to deliver a voltage, while a battery can be a single cell or multiple cells connected together in series or parallel to achieve a desired voltage or / and current rating.

A **real** battery can be modelled as (a battery or a combination of cells) a resistance \(r\), which is connected in series to an ideal e.m.f. source of e.m.f. \(E\) as shown in the dashed box below.

Within the source of e.m.f., chemical energy is converted to electrical energy,

power supplied by the source, \(P_{\mathrm{S}}=IE\)

In the internal resistance \(r\),

power dissipated as heat, \(P_{r}=I^{2}r=IV_{r}\)In the external load \(R\),

\[\text{power dissipated as heat},P_{R}=I^{2}R=IV_{R}\]

By the principle of conservation of energy,

\[\text{power supplied by source = power dissipated in $r$ and $R$}\]

\[P_{S}=P_{r}+P_{R}\]

\[I\E=I^{2}r+I^{2}R\]

Also

\[P_{S}=P_{r}+P_{R}\]

\[I\E=IV_{r}+IV_{R}\]

\[E=Ir+V_{R}\]

When a current \(I\) is flowing, the voltage drops by \(Ir\) across the internal resistance and hence the remaining voltage across the battery (terminal p.d.) will be \(V=E-Ir=V_{R}\).

The graph of terminal p.d. against current drawn from a cell:

\[\text{terminal p.d. / V}\]

\[\text{gradient = - internal resistance = ( -r)}\]

\[\text{current / A}\]
**Example 7**:

1. By considering a practical source with e.m.f. \(E\) and internal resistance \(r\) connected in series with an electrical device of resistance \(R\), determine 1. an expression for output efficiency of the source, \(\eta=\dfrac{\text{useful power output}}{\text{total power generated}}\).
2. Using your answers to part (a), discuss the effect on the output efficiency of a source when it is used to operate an electrical device at maximum power.
