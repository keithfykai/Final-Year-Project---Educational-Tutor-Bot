### 9.1 Introduction

Consider a rope that is held under tension. If we give the left of the rope a small wiggle, a pulse is formed (called the waveform) which can be seen to travel along the length of the rope (Fig. 9.1.1).

When the waveform travels down the rope, **there is a transfer of energy and momentum** from one end of the rope to the other. However each section of the rope only vibrates up and down about an equilibrium position-- **no section of the rope actually travels from one end to the other**.

### 9.2 Classification of Waves

Waves can be categorised by three broad properties (Fig. 9.2.1):

(i) the type of the wave,

(ii) the mode of vibration of the wave, and

(iii) the motion of the wave.

For example, a sound wave can be characterised as mechanical in nature, longitudinal in terms of its displacement and can be either progressive or stationary.

Figure 9.2.1: Classifications of Waves

Figure 9.1.1: Wave pulse travelling down the rope

### Mechanical Waves

Mechanical waves are created when part of a physical medium is disturbed. The disturbance spreads through the medium distributing energy to points far from the original disturbance. All mechanical waves therefore require a medium for propagation.1 The speed of wave propagation depends on the medium (specifically both its inertial and elastic properties). Sound waves, waves in ropes, water waves and seismic waves are all examples of mechanical waves.

Footnote 1: Propagation of mechanical waves is possible due to the restoring forces produced upon deformation; Sound waves, which rely on oscillations of molecules of the medium resulting in pressure variation, obviously cannot be propagated through a vacuum.

### Electromagnetic (EM) waves

Electromagnetic (EM) waves consist of _mutually perpendicular time-varying electric field (\(\vec{\mathbf{E}}\) ) and magnetic field (\(\vec{\mathbf{B}}\) ) oscillating perpendicularly to the direction of wave travel_ (Fig. 9.2.2).

Characteristics of EM Waves:

* All EM waves are transverse in nature, i.e. the planes of oscillation of the electric and magnetic fields are perpendicular to the direction of motion.
* All EM waves are self-propagating and hence do not require a medium in which to travel. Unlike mechanical waves they can move through a vacuum but are also able to propagate through materials e.g. light through glass, X-rays through bone and radio waves through walls.
* In vacuum, all EM waves travel at the same speed \(c\) known as the speed of light: \[c=3.00\times 10^{8}\text{ m s}^{-1}\]

### The Electromagnetic Spectrum

Common examples of electromagnetic waves include visible light, ultraviolet light, radio wave, microwaves and x-rays. Fig. 9.2.3 shows the electromagnetic spectrum and relative positions of these EM waves on the spectrum.

Figure 9.2.3: The electromagnetic spectrum.

Figure 9.2.2: The E-field and B-field are mutually perpendicular to each other and both fields are also perpendicular to the direction of wave travel.

* A useful mnemonic to remember for visible light : **Red** : **Richard** (700 nm) **O**range : **Of** **Yellow** : **York** **Green** : **Gave** **Blue** : **Battle** **Indigo** : **In** **Violet** : **Vain** (400 nm) The electromagnetic spectrum is a _continuous spectrum_ i.e. there are no gaps or _sharp boundaries_ between one type of radiation and next. For example, the wavelengths of \(\gamma\)-rays and x-rays overlap. Their key difference is in their mechanism of production.

### Basic Terminology

The waves that we encounter may be one-dimensional, two-dimensional or three-dimensional. Waves on string and slinky are examples of one-dimensional waves, i.e. the waves are travelling only in one dimension. A water wave that is produced by a raindrop that is striking the surface of a lake is an example of a two-dimensional wave. (Fig. 10.1). A sound wave in air is an example of a three-dimensional longitudinal wave. It consists of compressions and rarefactions of air molecules spreading out in all directions

### Sinusoidal Waves

If we sound a tuning fork which produces a "pure tone" i.e. a single frequency and use a microphone and oscilloscope (See Appendix A for review of CRO) to capture the wave form we will observe a near perfect sine profile. So, for a medium that undergo a periodic disturbance of a single frequency, we characterise the waves that emanate from the disturbance and pass through the medium as sinusoidal.

Figure 10.1: (a) and (b) Two-dimensional water wave (c) Three-dimensional sound waves propagating from a speaker

Figure 10.1: Different types of Periodic Waves. All periodic waves can be formed from a combination of sinusoidal waves.

We will use a transverse sinusoidal wave set up on the string to illustrate some basic terminology used in waves.

Suppose we set the free end of a string in simple harmonic motion. A transverse wave will be set up along the string and propagate down the string.

**Displacement (\(y\)) :**

The displacement of a particular point on the wave refers to the **distance and the direction** of the point from its equilibrium position.

Before the wave is setup, the rope lies along the x-axis. When the wave is setup in the rope, some points on the rope are being displaced from their equilibrium positions.

Points P and Q are displaced at a distance of \(y_{i}\)_from_ their equilibrium position in the positive direction (as defined by the \(y\)-axis). Hence, their displacements are both \(y=+y_{i}\).

Point U is displaced at a distance of \(y_{o}\) from its equilibrium position in the negative direction. Hence its displacement is \(y=-y_{o}\).

**Amplitude (\(A\) or \(y_{o}\)) :**

The amplitude of a wave is the magnitude of the maximum displacement of a point on the wave.

Fig. 9.3.4: Points S, T and U are at the amplitudes of the wave.

**Wavelength (\(\lambda\))** :

The wavelength of a wave is the distance between two adjacent points which are oscillating in phase.3

Footnote 3: This refers to two points in the same state of oscillation. The concept of phase associated with oscillations will be dealt with further in the chapter.

**Note:**

For a transverse wave, the distance between two successive crests or two successive troughs corresponds to a single wavelength.

For a longitudinal wave, the distance between two successive compressions or rarefactions also corresponds to a single wavelength.

Figure 9.3.4: The figure shows a snapshot of the wave on the rope at an instant of time.

**Example 9.3.1:**

Consider the snapshot of the wave shown below. Other than the distance between the 2 successive crests or troughs,

1. identify another point (B') that pairs with B that will correspond to a single wavelength.
2. Choose another pair of points on the wave that correspond to one wavelength.
3. What do you notice about the pairs of points that represent one wavelength?

Each pair of points not only have the but also the

. They are said to be in the same state of oscillation or

**Period (7) :**

Period is the time taken for a point on the wave to _complete one oscillation cycle._

Period is also the time taken for the wave to advance by a distance of one wavelength or the time taken for _2 consecutive crests/ compressions or troughs (rarefactions) to pass through a certain point._ (see Fig. 9.3.3)

**Frequency (\(\theta\)):**

Frequency is the _number of oscillations per unit time_ made by a point on a wave.

Frequency is also the number of crests/compressions or troughs/ rarefactions that pass through a point along the path of wave travel in a unit time.

S.I. unit of frequency is _s-1_ or _Hz (hertz)_.

The relationship between frequency \(f\) and period \(T\) is given by :

### Wavefronts

* A **wavefront*
* (of a 2-dimensional or 3-dimensional wave) is an imaginary line or curve which joins points on the wave which are oscillating in phase.
* _All points on a wavefront are at the same part of the cycle_ of their vibration.
* By convention, when we represent waves in a diagram, the _distance between consecutive wavefronts is one wavelength apart._
* The direction of propagation of the waves perpendicular to the wavefront as indicated by arrows (\(\rightarrow\)) are known as rays.

### Wave Speed (v):

The speed of a wave is the distance that the wave profile travels per unit time.

**Note:**

There are two sets of motion associated with waves.

* One is that of the motion associated with the oscillation of the individual points on the wave, the points always oscillate about the equilibrium position.
* The other is that of the motion associated with the propagation of waveform of the wave. This is the one that defines the wave speed.

Figure 9.3.6: Wave representations using wave fronts and rays.

Figure 9.3.5: Wavefront of a wave.

#### Relationship between Frequency, Speed and Wavelength

The time taken for a wave to move a distance of one wavelength \(\lambda\) is one period \(T\).

From the definition of wave speed: Speed of the wave, \(v=\dfrac{\text{Distance Travelled}}{\text{Time Taken}}=\dfrac{\lambda}{T}\)

\[\text{Now, }\ f=\dfrac{1}{T}\ \ \Rightarrow\qquad\overline{v}=f\lambda\qquad \text{ where }f\ \text{ is the frequency of the wave.}\]

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:14]

### Graphical Representation of Waves

Consider a transverse water wave travelling from left to right as shown in the diagram below.

As the wave moves through this region of space, we note the following:

* At a particular instant of time, the _displacement of each point on the wave varies with the distance it is located from the source_.
* For a particular point on the wave e.g. at **P**, the _displacement of the point also varies with time_.

Therefore, to completely represent a wave, we need two graphs:

**1**: **Graph of displacement (\(y\)) varies with position (\(x\))** of the points on a wave (at a particular instant of time.)

At a particular instant of time \(\implies\) Graph of \(y\) vs. \(x\).
**2**: **Graph of displacement (\(y\)) varies with time (\(\theta\)) for a particular point on the wave** (at a particular position).

At a particular position \(\implies\) Graph of \(y\) vs. \(t\).

#### Graph of Displacement (\(y\)) vs. Position (\(x\))

Consider a snapshot of a wave on a rope. (Fig. 9.4.2). By superimposing a pair of \(x\) and \(y\) axes on the snapshot, we can describe how the displacement of each point on the rope varies with position.

This graph of displacement vs. position at a particular instant of time (\(y\) vs. \(x\)) gives the **wave profile at an instant of time**. You can imagine this as a snapshot of the wave at a particular instant.

Note :

* +ve \(y\) : displacement of a point on the wave when it is above its equilibrium position
* -ve \(y\) : displacement of a point on the wave when it is below its equilibrium position
* \(x\) axis (\(y=0\)) : equilibrium position of points when there is no disturbance
* _Wavelength (\(\lambda\)) of the wave can also be obtained from the graph._

Figure 9.4.1: A progressive transverse wave moving towards the right.

**Example 9.4.1: Displacement-Position Graph for a Longitudinal Wave**

A displacement-position graph can also be drawn for a longitudinal wave. Consider the following displacement-position graph for the air molecules along a line when a sound wave passes through a region of space. Sketch the corresponding pressure variation of this region.

**Note:** Points of **compression and rarefactions** corresponds to points where **displacements of air molecules are zero.**

**Compressions** are regions of **high air pressure**, while **rarefactions** are regions of **low air pressure**.

**Graph of Displacement (\(\mathbf{y}\)) vs. Time (\(\mathbf{t}\))**

Consider a point P on a rope. As a wave propagates through the rope (Fig. 9.4.3), the displacement of this point varies sinusoidally with respect to time (as shown in Fig. 9.4.4).

**Fig. 9.4.4.**

The graph of displacement vs. time for a wave gives us **the variation of the displacement of a particular point on a wave (at a fixed position \(\mathbf{x}\)) with respect to time.** You can imagine it as a motion video of a particle in a wave.

**The period (\(\mathbf{7}\)) associated with the wave can be obtained from this graph.**

In summary, two graphs are needed to fully depict a wave:

\(\circ\) The graph of **displacement vs. position** (wave profile of a wave at a certain instant of time),

\(\Rightarrow\) Wavelength \(\lambda\) may be obtained

\(\circ\) The graph of **displacement vs. time** (Motion of a particular point on a wave w.r.t. time)

\(\Rightarrow\) Period \(T\) of the waves may be obtained.

**Example 9.4.2: Determining the speed of a wave**

A vibrating bar makes waves in a ripple tank. Fig. 9.4.5(a) shows the displacement of the wave as it travels out from the bar. The position of the floating cork in the tank varies with time as shown in Fig. 9.4.5(b).

**Figure 9.4.5**

From the above two graphs, determine the speed of the wave.

**Example 9.4.3**

The following graph shows a displacement vs. position graph of a progressive transverse wave at \(t\) = 0. For the point **Q** on the wave, sketch the corresponding displacement vs. time graph, given that the wave is moving in the positive \(x\) direction at a speed of 1.0 m s\({}^{-1}\).

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:19]

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:20]

1. **The two waves are said to be in phase** if every point on wave **P** is at the same state of oscillation as the corresponding point of the same position in wave **Q** at the same time. The phase difference between the two waves are \(\Delta\phi\) = 0, 2\(\pi\), 4\(\pi\),...

\(\circ\) Notice that when the two transverse waves are in phase, their "_crests_" will correspond and their "_troughs_" will also correspond.
2. When the phase difference between the two waves are \(\Delta\phi\) = \(\pi\), 3\(\pi\), 5\(\pi\),...., we say that the **two waves are in antiphase.**

\(\circ\) When the two waves are in antiphase, every particle in Wave P is in antiphase with the corresponding point.

\(\circ\) Note that the waveforms seem like a reflection of one another.

**Example 9.5.1 :**

(a) The following graph shows the displacement vs. position of two waves **P** and **Q** at a particular instant of time, what is the phase difference between the two waves **P** and **Q**?

(b) Is it possible to compare the phase difference between two waves of different wavelengths? What is the phase difference between the two waves shown below?

Answer:

No. As \(\Delta x\) is not constant for the 2 waves, the phase difference between the two waves keeps changing value.

It is only meaningful to talk about phase difference between 2 waves only if they have the same wavelength or same frequency.

Figure 9.5.5: (a) Wave P is in phase with wave Q

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:22]

#### Intensity of a Wave from Point Source or Spherical Source

In the special case where the source is **point source** or **spherical source**, and the propagation is _isotropic_ (i.e. the same in all directions), then the wavefronts of the waves are spherical in shape. The wave itself is said to be a _spherical wave_.

The energy spreads out over the wavefront as the wave propagates, hence, the intensity \(I\) at a particular point a distance \(r\) from the source is given by :

\[\text{Intensity},\ I=\frac{\text{Power}}{\text{Area}}=\frac{P}{4\pi r^{2}}\]

where \(P\) is the time rate of energy delivered by the wave to a distance of \(r\) away from the source.

Therefore, we see that the **intensity \(I\) at any distance \(r\) is therefore inversely proportional to \(r\)2.

\[I\propto\frac{1}{r^{2}}\qquad\qquad\text{(For constant P)}\]

#### Note:

* This relationship is called the _inverse-square law for intensity_.
* This relationship is only valid for _point sources / spherical sources_ and is based on the assumption that **the power of the wave does not diminish as it spreads out**.

**Example 9.6.1 : (N94/1/10 - modified)**

A sound wave of amplitude 0.20 mm has an intensity of 3.0 W m\({}^{2}\).

(a) What will be the intensity of a sound wave of the same frequency which has an amplitude of 0.40 mm?

(b) How will the intensity change if the frequency of the source of wave is doubled but the amplitude remains unchanged? Treat the source as a simple harmonic oscillator.

**Example 9.6.2**: **:**

If the intensity of an earthquake _P_-wave is \(1.0\times 10^{6}\) W m\({}^{2}\) at 100 km from the source, what is the intensity of the wave 400 km from the source?

### Polarisation of Waves

One characteristic that distinguishes _transverse waves_ and _longitudinal waves_ is _polarisation4_.

**Plane Polarisation**

**Polarisation** is a phenomenon whereby vibrations in a transverse wave are restricted to only one direction in the plane normal to the direction of energy transfer.

To polarise a wave, we often use a _polarising filter_, or _polariser_, that permits only waves with a certain polarisation direction to pass through.

Consider waves set up on a string. A slot as shown in Fig. 9.7.1 can be used to limit the string's plane of propagation to the x-y plane and the oscillation to the y-axis.

**Polarising Axis or Transmission Axis**

The polarisation direction of the polariser is also known as the _polarising axis_ or _transmission axis_.

_Only components of the waves parallel to the polarising axis are allowed to pass through._

Figure 9.7.1: A vertical slot is used to polarise the wave on the string so that oscillations are limited to a vertical plane.

Figure 9.7.2: A wave on a string polarised to oscillate in the x-y plane (a) and x-z plane (b). For each case, what is the polarizing axis on the polarizer?

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:25]

When unpolarised light is incident on an ideal polariser, the intensity of the transmitted light is exactly half that of the incident unpolarised light, no matter how the polarising axis is oriented.

Since incident light is a random mixture of all polarisation states, the components of the electric field vectors that are perpendicular or parallel to the polarising axis is roughly equal. By only transmitting the component that is parallel to the polarising axis, **only half the incident intensity** is transmitted.

An ideal polariser passes 100% of the incident light that is plane-polarised along its polarisation direction and 0% of the light that is 90\({}^{\circ}\) to its polarisation direction. Since unpolarised light is a mix of all possible polarisations, an ideal polariser transmits only 50% of the incident unpolarised light intensity.

### Light Passing Through Two Polarisers

By using two polarisers, we can also control the intensity of light.

Fig. 9.7.7 shows the typical setup used to control the intensity of light. An unpolarised light beam is incident on two polarisers **P** and **Q** with their polarising axes at an angle of \(\theta\)with each other.

* In such a setup, the second polariser is often known as an **analyser**.
* After passing through the first polariser **P**, the light is polarised along the polarising axis of polariser **P**. Suppose the light then has an amplitude of **E\({}_{o}\)** and an associated maximum intensity of \(I_{o}\).
* If this polarised light then falls on a second polariser **Q**, _then the component of **E\({}_{o}\)** perpendicular to the analyser axis is completely absorbed, while only the component parallel to polarising axis is allowed to transmit through Q._
* Since the plane of oscillation of the electric field of this light is oriented at an angle of \(\theta\)to the polarising axis of **Q**, the resultant amplitude of vibration of the light after passing through the polariser **Q** is given by **E = E\({}_{o}\)cos \(\theta\)**.

Figure 9.7.6: Intensity of plane polarised light

Figure 9.7.7: Using two polarisers to control intensity of light.

* Since the intensity of a wave is directly proportional to the square of the amplitude of vibration, therefore, \[\frac{\text{Intensity of Light after passing through the analyser Q}}{\text{Intensity of Light after passing through the polariser P}}=\frac{I}{I_{o}}=\left(\frac{E_{o}\cos\theta}{E_{o}}\right)^{2}\] \[\Rightarrow\] \[I=I_{o}\cos^{2}\theta\] Hence the intensity of light that passes through two polarisers that are aligned with an angle between their polarisation directions is \[I=I_{o}\cos^{2}\theta\] where \(I_{o}\) is the maximum intensity of light transmitted when the two polarisers are aligned along the same direction of polarisation. The above equation is known as **Malus' law** after its discoverer Etienne Louis Malus, who first observed this effect experimentally in 1809.

Malus's law applies only if the incident light passing through the analyzer is already _linearly polarized_.

Malus' law states that the intensity of a beam of plane-polarised light after passing through a polariser varies with the square of the cosine of the angle through which the polariser is rotated from the position that gives maximum intensity.

Based on Malus' law, when 2 polarisers are aligned at 90\({}^{\circ}\) with respect to each other, zero intensity of light passes through the second polariser.

Web Simulation on Polarization: [https://javalab.org/en/polarization_en/](https://javalab.org/en/polarization_en/)

Some applications of polarised light are:

1. Polarised sunglasses - Glare is usually due to light reflected off a horizontal ground (e.g. snow surface, car roof). As light gets reflected off a horizontal surface, it will be polarized horizontally. Polarised lenses contain a special filter which block off the reflected light from the ground, which reduces the glare.
2. Stress Analysis - Certain plastic materials under stress will affect the plane of polarization of light through them. This can be used to study stress in various structures.
3. 3-D films - Two images are projected through polarising filters onto a screen. The viewer will have to wear a pair of glasses which has 2 different polarising filters for each lens, so that the movie appears to be three dimensional. (see Appendix B 3-D films and Polarisation)

**Example 9.7**

The figure below shows a beam of initially unpolarised light passing through two polarizing filters P1 and P2. The polarising axis of P1 is fixed at 40\({}^{\circ}\) with respect to the vertical axis.

The polarizing axis of P2 is then rotated clockwise from its vertical axis. At what values of \(\theta\) will intensity minima of the emergent light occur?

**Example 9.8**

Two polarising sheets have their polarizing directions parallel so that the intensity \(I_{o}\) of the transmitted light is a maximum. Through what angle must either sheet be turned if the intensity is to drop by half?

**Figure 9.9**

Two polarising sheets have their polarizing directions parallel so that the intensity \(I_{o}\) of the transmitted light is a maximum. Through what angle must either sheet be turned if the intensity is to drop by half?

### Appendix A: Function Generator and Cathode Ray Oscilloscope (C.R.O)

### Function Generator

A function generator is an instrument that produces alternating (a.c.) voltage of different frequencies. The standard voltage signals it can produce are:

\(\circ\) sine waves,

\(\circ\) triangular waves

\(\circ\) rectangular waves

As not all function generators have a precise digital display of the frequency of the waveform or the amplitude of the voltage wave produced. It will sometimes be necessary to connect the function generator to a CRO in order to determine the precise frequency and amplitude of the voltage wave.

To generate the sound waves, the function generator is often connected to a speaker so that the speaker can convert the voltage signals to vibrations of the membrane of the speakers to produce sound waves.

Figure 1: Examples of function generators. The top one is a single output generator. The bottom generator is able to produce two outputs at the same time.

### Cathode Ray Oscilloscope

The other commonly used equipment in sound experiments is the **cathode ray oscilloscope** (CRO). The oscilloscope is basically a graph displaying device that traces the variation of the input voltage signal with respect to time.

Using the oscilloscope, you can measure the amplitude, period, and frequency of any voltage signal. Therefore, a CRO is actually a more complex voltmeter. Hence, to measure the frequency of a sound wave, we need to first connect a microphone to the scope. The microphone will then convert the vibrational energy of the air molecules to voltage signals which can be measured by the CRO.

Most scopes can display two signals on the screen at one time, enabling you to observe their time relationships. These scopes are known as dual-channel oscilloscopes. A typical front panel view of such a scope is shown in Fig. 2.

Actual CROs vary depending on model and manufacturer, but most have certain common features. The main controls will be discussed below. You will need to refer to the user manual for complete details of the scope you are using.

### Vertical Controls:

In the vertical section of the scope (Fig. 2), there are identical controls for each of the two channels (CH1 and CH2).

* **Position Control**. The position control lets you move a displayed waveform up or down vertically on the screen.
* **Volts/Div control**. The Volts/Div (volts per division) control is also known as the **Y-sensitivity / Y-gain control**. It adjusts the number of volts represented by each vertical division (usually 1 cm) on the screen. For this scope, the Volts/Div setting for each channel is displayed at the bottom of the screen. For CH1, it is 500 mV/div and for CH2, it is 200 mV/div.

### Horizontal Controls:

In the horizontal section, the controls apply to both channels.

* **Position Control**. The position control lets you move a displayed waveforms left or right horizontally on the screen.

Figure 2: A typical dual channel oscilloscope. Numbers below screen indicate the values for each division on the vertical (voltage) and horizontal (time) scales and can be varied using the vertical and horizontal controls on the scope. Although this may be a typical dual-channel oscilloscope, it does not lock like the ones we have in the lab!* **Sec/Div Control.** The Sec/Div (seconds per division) control is also known as the **Timebase** control, it adjusts the time represented by each horizontal division or main time base. Similarly, for this scope, the Sec/Div setting is displayed at the bottom of the screen.

## Appendix B 3-D films and Polarization

3-D films such as Avatar (by 20\({}^{\text{th}}\) Century Fox), G-Force (by Walt Disney Pictures) and Cloudy With A Chance of Meatballs (by Sony Pictures Animation) have been a hit with the cinema these days. In fact, 3-D films have existed in some forms since 1950s. There are various techniques to produce 3-D films. Current methods include interference filter technology, for example Dolby 3D and polarization systems, for example RealD. We will look at the latter in detail.

For 3-D films which are shown using polarization systems, the viewers will have to wear 3-D glasses to view the polarized image on the screen. The image will be blurry when viewed without the special glasses. There are two types of polarization systems: linear polarization and circular polarization.

For the linear polarization system, two images are superimposed onto the same screen through two polarizing filters which are at 90 degree angles of each other (orthogonal). The silver screen is specially constructed such that it is non-depolarizing to compensate for light loss and to preserve the polarization. The viewer wears a pair of glasses which is made of a pair of orthogonal polarizing filters. Each filter only allows light from the image which is polarized in the same plane to pass through and blocks the orthogonally polarized light, each eye will only see one of the images. The 3-D effect is then achieved.

Similarly, for a circular polarization system, two images polarized differently are superimposed onto the same screen. However, unlike linear polarization system, the two images pass through circular polarizing filter of opposite handedness. The viewer wears a pair of glasses made of a pair of circular polarizer mounted in reverse handedness. Hence, each eye will only see one of the images and the 3-D effect is achieved. RealD Cinema is a digital stereoscopic projection technology which uses similar techniques as a circular polarization system; except that it only needs one projector. A circularly polarizing liquid crystal filter which can switch polarity is placed in front of the projector lens, so that the left and right images are displayed alternately.
