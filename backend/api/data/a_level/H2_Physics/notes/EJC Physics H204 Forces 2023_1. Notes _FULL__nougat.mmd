### Introduction

Physics tries to understand all the different types of forces in the Universes using the fewest number of basic laws. We currently categorise all forces in terms of 4 fundamental interactions.

Force is a vector quantity. It has both magnitude and direction.

In recognition of Isaac Newton's work on classical mechanics, specifically Newton's 2\({}^{\text{nd}}\) Law of motion (see topic on Dynamics), the SI unit of force is the newton (N).

1 N is the magnitude of a force that acts on a mass of 1 kg resulting in an acceleration of 1 m s\({}^{-2}\) in the direction of the force.

### Field of Force

Forces can act on particles (such as masses and electric charges) without the particle _touching_ other particle(s). Some resources refer to these as "force at a distance". For A-Levels, we refer to a _field of force_.

If asked to consider the _types_ of force more specifically, we should specify the nature of the force when discussing the field of force.

In our everyday lives, we are familiar with Earth's gravitational field. We have weight because of the gravitational force that is acting on _every_ part of our body ranging from the head to the toes.

It will be simpler to picture the overall effect of gravity acting at a single point - the centre of gravity.

The centre of gravity is

The centre of gravity (CG) of an object changes with the shape. For a person standing upright, the CG is somewhere in the middle of the body, approximately behind the belly button. The CG will shift as the posture changes.

The _Fosbury_ **Top**. _The CG of this athlete claiming a high jump bar is shifted out behind the back._

**Art Meets Science**. _Aninators and game designers work with the concept of CG to convey body language or create realistic animations._

### Translational Equilibrium

When there is no resultant force on a body, there is no linear acceleration of the body's centre of gravity. 2 possible scenarios are: no resultant force.

When there is no resultant force on a body, there is no linear acceleration of the body's centre of gravity. 2 possible scenarios are: body is stationary body moves with constant velocity

**Example 2**

3 forces \(F_{1},\ F_{2}\) and \(F_{3}\) are parallel to the plane of paper and acts on mass \(m\) shown below.

If \(m\) is in translational equilibrium, state an equation expressing the magnitude of \(F_{3}\) in terms of \(F_{1}\).

**Solution**

no resultant force vertically:

\(F_{1}\ \sin\theta+F_{2}\ \ \sin\phi=F_{3}\)

no resultant force horizontally:

\(F_{1}\ \cos\theta=F_{2}\ \cos\phi\)

since \(F_{1}\ \frac{\cos\theta}{\cos\phi}=F_{2}\)

\(F_{3}=F_{1}\ \sin\theta+F_{1}\ \left(\frac{\cos\theta}{\cos\phi}\right)\ \sin\phi\)

(not to scale)

\(F_{3}=F_{1}\big{(}\sin\theta+\ \cos\theta\ \tan\phi\big{)}\)

**Note:** We can _resolve_ vector quantities along 2 perpendicular axes and perform vector addition.

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:5]

For a body moving in a fluid, the magnitude of viscous force(s) depends on

* shape of the body (whether the shape is streamlined or not)
* size of the body
* texture of the body's surface
* viscosity of fluid

If all of the above conditions are kept constant, then the magnitude of viscous force on a body increases with the relative speed of the body with respect to the fluid. We can also consider different _layers_ of fluid flowing past each other and exerting viscous force mutually. In reality when fluid flows through a pipe, the fluid layer immediately in contact with the (stationary) inner pipe walls have zero velocity, and causes drag on the adjacent layer.

#### 4.4.2 Lift

Lift is a force acting on a body (e.g. aeroplane wing or helicopter rotor) when there is relative motion between body and fluid. Unlike viscous forces which act along (parallel to) surfaces, lift acts _perpendicular_ to direction of relative flow of surrounding fluid. Hence, for an aeroplane, lift acts perpendicular to the plane's wings.

In still air, the relative flow of air has the same magnitude as the plane's speed but in opposite direction. When a plane andor its wings tilt up, the direction of lift changes as well. The lift generated by a helicopter rotor blade varies – less lift nearer to the rotation axis and more lift “outside”.

#### 4.4.3 Normal Contact Force

"Normal" here refers to the direction - normal contact force is exerted _perpendicular_ to surfaces that are physically touching.

In each of the following scenarios, a mass experiences a normal contact force \(N\). In a labelled diagram, forces are represented by arrows:

* length of arrow indicate magnitude of force relative to other forces in the same diagram
* direction of arrow indicate the line of action of the force
* starting point depicts where the force is applied to

We then practise drawing the free body diagram (FBD) which often uses the CG to simplify depiction of forces. A FBD shows all external forces acting on the body or system. All external forces acting on the body should be depicted using arrows.

#### Friction

Friction is a force that opposes relative motion between surfaces in contact. It can also act to oppose _impending_ relative motion of surfaces. Friction acts along (i.e. "parallel to") the surfaces.

The magnitude of friction depends on

* magnitude of normal contact force* material / type of surfaces in contact

**Pictorial representation of non-ideal surfaces in contact.**_If the mass moves along the table top, the "peaks" must skip along the surfaces and some "peaks" will be broken off. Therefore, a force is required to set the mass into motion and to keeping it moving. Even between 'perfectly flat' real surfaces, there are attractive forces between molecules of the 2 surfaces. Such adhesion depends on the type of material._

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:9]

#### 4.4.5 Tension and Compression

Tension is a force along the length of a body. We often work with tension that acts _parallel_ to a flexible medium such as a rope, cable or a string.

When a body is stretched along its axis by equal and opposite externally-applied forces, we can consider tension to be the internal forces that try to return the body to its original length.

Compression is the opposite of tension. We can consider compression to be the internal forces that try to return the body to its original length when the body is being pushed inwards along the axis.

**Example 6**

A hook of mass 50 g is hung on a light string as shown. There is no friction between the hook and the string. Find the magnitude of tension in the string.

**Solution**

\(T\)\(\theta\)\(=\)\(T^{\prime}\)\(\sin\phi\)

Since the string is light and there is no friction, the tension along the string is the same:

\(T\)\(=\)\(T^{\prime}\)\(\rightarrow\)\(\theta\)\(=\)\(\phi\)

Thus, hook must be hung from middle of string:

\(\tan\theta\)\(=\)\(\frac{15}{4}\)

no resultant force along vertical so

\(T\)\(\cos\theta\)\(+\)\(T\)\(\cos\theta\)\(=\)\(mg\)

\(T\)\(=\)\(\frac{mg}{2\)\(\cos\theta\)\(=\)\(\frac{\left(50\times 10^{-3}\right)\left(9.81\right)}{2\)\(\cos\left(\)\(\tan^{-1}\right)\left(\frac{15}{4}\right)\)\(\}\)\(=\)\(0.95\) N

**Notes:** Tension has the same magnitude throughout a _light_ ("massless") string and acts along the length of the string.

#### Hooke's Law

Springs can be stretched or compressed to provide a force that is governed by Hooke's Law.

Hooke's Law states that

the change in length of a material is directly proportional to the force applied on it, provided that the limit of proportionality is not exceeded.

A hook of mass 80 g is being hung onto a light spring of natural length 5.0 cm as shown. The spring has an elastic spring constant of 20 N m\({}^{-1}\). Find the final length of the spring at equilibrium.

#### Elastic Deformation

Depending on its original state, a spring is capable of providing tension, compressive or both forces, _elastically_.

In Physics, _elastic_ means the ability to return to the original value _before_ and _after_ a change has taken place.

For springs, _elastic_ refers to the ability of a spring to return to its natural length after the externally-applied force stops acting. The _elastic_ limit is the point beyond which the spring does not return to its original length when the force is removed.

In Dynamics, an _elastic_ collision refers to one where the sum of kinetic energies of the bodies colliding remains the same _before and after the_ collision.

**Example 8**

The variation in length \(x\) with force \(F\) for a spring is shown below.

Identify the _proportionality_ limit of the spring by marking the point as \(L\).

Describe the meaning of _proportionality_ limit.

Another identical spring has not been stretched beyond the limit of proportionality. Determine

the natural length of the spring, and

the spring constant \(k\) for the spring.

**Solution**

The point beyond which

the force applied is no longer proportional to the extension of the spring

Natural length is when no force is exerted on spring, \(F\) = 0.

\(x_{{}_{0}}\) = 1.4 cm = 1.4\(\times\)10\({}^{-2}\) m.

By Hooke's Law,

\(F=k\left(x-x_{{}_{0}}\right)\)

\(4.7=k\left(8-1.4\right)\times\)10\({}^{-2}\)

\(k=71.2\) N m\({}^{-1}\)

**Notes:** Graphs should be read to half-smallest square accuracy. For (c)(ii), do **take note of the unit conversion**. Such mistakes are very common especially when working under time constraints.

#### 4.4.6 Fluids

#### 4.4.6.1 Pressure

Pressure is defined as the force per unit area (normal to force).

Pressure is a scalar quantity.

Some commonly seen units include N m\({}^{-2}\), Pa, atm, bar, torr, mm Hg.

**Example 9**

Derive, from the definitions of pressure and density, the equation

\[p=\rho gh\]

where \(p\) is the pressure exerted by the liquid on the base of the container and \(g\) is the acceleration of free fall.

**Solution**

Consider a cylindrical column of liquid with circular cross-sectional area A:

\[\begin{split}\text{density}&=\frac{\text{mass of fluid}}{\text{volume}}\\ \text{height }h&\rho=\frac{m}{Ah}\\ \frac{m}{A}&=\rho h\end{split}\]

pressure is force acting normally per unit area of a surface

\[\begin{split}\rho&=\frac{F}{A}\\ &=\frac{W}{A}=\left(\frac{m}{A}\right)g\\ &=\rho hg\end{split}\]

**Notes:**\(\rho gh\) is the hydrostatic pressure of that particular fluid only. If this is a cylinder of water near Earth's surface, the total pressure acting on area \(A\) includes the column of water and column of atmosphere above it

\[p_{\text{total}}=\rho_{\text{water}}h_{\text{water}}g+(1\text{ atm})\]

#### 4.4.6.2 Upthrust

Fluid pressure does not depend on shape (of container), total fluid mass or surface area of fluid:

\begin{tabular}{c c}  & **isobars.** _Each of the dotted lines is an isobar for the fluid. The fluid pressure along each dotted line is the same and is dependent on height \(h\). (Tsobar' : Line of equal pressure)_ \\ \end{tabular}

Because pressure increases with depth, the pressure at isobar B is greater than the pressure at isobar A. If an object is submerged into the fluid to the extent the volume spans both isobars, the object encounters a difference in the pressure exerted normally across its cross-sectional areas.

\begin{tabular}{c c}  & **Example 10** \\ A cylinder is totally submerged into water. An upthrust acts on it. **Explain the origin of the upthrust.** \\ \end{tabular}

\begin{tabular}{c c}  & **[magnitude]** Upwards force on bottom surface larger than downwards force on top surface \\ \end{tabular}

\begin{tabular}{c c}  & **[direction]** Net upwards force is upthrust \\ \end{tabular}

**Note**: Pressure acts equally in all directions in a fluid.

Mathematically,

\[U_{\text{on object by fluid}} =F_{\text{bottom}}-F_{\text{top}}\] \[=\left(P_{\text{bottom}}-P_{\text{top}}\right)A\] \[=\left(h_{\text{bottom}}P_{\text{fluid}}g-h_{\text{top}}\rho_{ \text{fluid}}g\right)A\] \[=\left(h_{\text{bottom}}-h_{\text{top}}\right)\rho_{\text{fluid}}gA\] \[=V_{\text{displaced fluid}}P_{\text{fluid}}g\]

Hence

\begin{tabular}{c c}  & **[magnitude]** Upthrust & \[=\] weight of fluid displaced \\ \end{tabular}

A free-body diagram helps us identify the forces acting on an object and form the force equation.

In the simplest case of a floating or submerged object that is in equilibrium, upthrust is equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to the weight of fluid displaced by that object.

\begin{tabular}{c c}  & **For a floating/submerged object,** \\  & **upthrust = weight of object** \\  & \(U_{\text{on object by fluid}}=W_{\text{object}}\) \\  & \(V_{\text{displaced fluid}}\rho_{\text{fluid}}\mathcal{G}=V_{\text{object}} \mathcal{G}\) \\ \end{tabular}

When the object **sinks,** upthrust is smaller in magnitude than the weight of the object. Using the relevant formula for upthrust and weight of object (as well as the fact that the volume of displaced fluid would be the same as the volume of the object when the object is fully submerged in the fluid), we arrive at a conclusion that you learnt in primary school - an object with higher density than the fluid sinks!

\begin{tabular}{c c}  & **upthrust \textless{} weight of object** \\  & \(U_{\text{on object by fluid}}<W_{\text{object}}\) \\  & \(V_{\text{displaced fluid}}\rho_{\text{fluid}}\mathcal{G}<V_{\text{object}} \mathcal{G}\) \\  & \(\rho_{\text{fluid}}<\rho_{\text{object}}\) \\ \end{tabular}

**Example 11**: The average human body occupies a volume of 7.4\(\times\)10\({}^{-2}\) m\({}^{3}\). Find the magnitude of upthrust acting on the body immersed in

(a) (i) air of density 1.3 kg m\({}^{-3}\), and

(ii) sea water of density 1030 kg m\({}^{-3}\).

(b) Hence, explain why upthrust due to air is usually ignored when body mass is taken at health check-ups.

**Solution**

(a) Assuming full submersion,

\[U_{\text{due to air}} =\rho_{\text{air}}V_{\text{body}}g\] \[=\big{(}1.3\big{)}\big{(}7.4\times 10^{-2}\big{)}\big{(}9.81\big{)}\] \[=0.944\text{ N}\] \[U_{\text{due to sea water}} =\rho_{\text{sea water}}V_{\text{body}}g\] \[=\big{(}1030\big{)}\big{(}7.4\times 10^{-2}\big{)}\big{(}9.81 \big{)}\] \[=748\text{ N}\] (b) Majority of human body is water. Using sea water density as estimate:

\[\rho_{\text{body}} \approx\frac{m_{\text{body}}}{V_{\text{body}}}\] \[m_{\text{body}} \approx\rho_{\text{sea water}}V_{\text{body}}\]

\[\frac{U_{\text{due to air}}}{W_{\text{body}}}\times 100\% =\frac{\rho_{\text{air}}V_{\text{body}}g}{\rho_{\text{sea water}}V_{\text{body}}g}\times 100\%\] \[\approx\frac{\rho_{\text{air}}}{\rho_{\text{sea water}}}\times 100\% =\frac{1.3}{1030}\times 100\%\] \[=0.13\%\]

The upthrust due to air is 3 orders of magnitude less than the weight and is insignificant.

**Notes:**

- When "hence" is used in the question, answers to previous parts need to be referenced.

- When comparing figures, it is good practice to think in terms of ratios such as percentages.

**Example 12**: Two beakers of water are shown below. Both beakers are filled to the brim with cold water. A solid ice block floats in beaker A while an ice block encasing a lead ball floats in beaker B.

State and explain the change (if any) to the water level in both beakers when all of the ice melts.

**Solution**

**Algorithm 1** The water level is shown in Figure 12.

From results of beaker A, pure ice will not cause change to water level when it melts completely.

For lead ball to float, the upthrust on the ball has same magnitude as its weight

\[\begin{array}{l}U_{\text{on ball}}=\rho_{\text{water}}V_{\text{water displaced for ball}}g\\ W_{\text{ball}}=\rho_{\text{water}}V_{\text{water displaced for ball}}g\\ m_{\text{ball}}=\rho_{\text{water}}V_{\text{water displaced for ball}}\\ \rho_{\text{ball}}V_{\text{ball}}=\rho_{\text{water}}V_{\text{water displaced for ball}}\end{array}\]

Since lead is denser than water, a volume of water that is greater than the ball's volume is displaced to float the ball.

When the ball no longer floats (because ice has melted) there is less water being displaced so water level falls

**Example 13**

A boat floats on fresh water and displaces 35.6 kN of water.

Find the volume of sea water displaced if the boat floats on sea water of density1030 kg m-3.

**Solution**

Boat floats so upthrust on boat is

equal in magnitude and

opposite in direction to the weight of boat.

\[W_{\text{sea water displaced}} =W_{\text{ boat}}=W_{\text{reah water displaced}}\] \[W_{\text{sea water displaced}} =35.6\text{ kN}\]

Let density of sea water = \(\rho_{\text{s}}\) and

volume of sea water displaced = \(V_{\text{s}}\)

\[U =\rho_{\text{s}}V_{\text{s}}g=W_{\text{ boat}}\] \[V_{\text{s}} =\frac{W_{\text{ boat}}}{\rho_{\text{s}}g}\] \[=\frac{35.6\times 10^{3}}{\left(1030\right)\left(9.81\right)}\] \[=3.52\text{ m}^{3}\]

**Notes:** Sea water is denser, so _less_ of the boat needs to be submerged to displace sufficient fluid.

Similar to the concept of CG, all of upthrust can be regarded as acting upwards through the centre of mass of the displaced fluid. This is referred to as the centre of buoyancy.

**Example 14**

_If the ship is top-heavy, the resulting couple from a tilt can act to rotate the ship in the direction of the tilt, perpetuating an unstable equilibrium._

**A labelled force diagram sometimes helps us visualize better. In the above, knowing the relative positions from which forces act helps predict a cargo ship's stability. It takes deliberate practice to better gauge when to sketch labeled force diagrams versus FBDs._

### 4.5 Lobelled Force Diagram

During problem-solving, it is often useful to draw the labelled force diagrams or free body diagrams of the appropriate body or system.

A _free-body diagram_ of a body (or system) shows all external forces acting on the body (or system) acting through the CG.

A labelled force diagram can additionally show the point(s) of exertion and line(s) of action on simple representation(s) of the body (or system). When considered together with approximate representations of the magnitudes and direction of forces, a labelled force diagram helps much in determining equilibrium and stability of a body or system.

In drawing a labelled force diagram, one should

1. identify the body (or system) that is being considered and draw a simple sketch (e.g. boxes, blocks etc) representing the body (or system).
2. mark and label on the sketch from (1), all external forces acting on the body (or system), paying attention to the point of exertion and line of action of each force.
3. determine the magnitude of the forces (if necessary) that can be directly calculated via a formula.
4. Identify 2 suitable perpendicular axes for analysis and resolve all forces along these 2 perpendicular axes.

A good understanding of Newton's 3\({}^{\text{rd}}\) Law of Motion will help us decide whether a force is to be included in a labeled force diagram or not.

#### 4.5.1 Newton's Third Law

**Newton's Third Law of Motion** states that

when body A exerts a force on body B,

body B exerts on body A

a force of the same type

that is equal in magnitude and

opposite in direction.

One implication of this law is that the free-body diagram of body A (or that of body B) should not have both "action-reaction" forces drawn on it.

Note that:

1. Newton's Third Law of Motion involves two different bodies; the 'action and reaction' pair of forces as stated within the law acts on **separate bodies** (if the 'action' acts on body A, then the'reaction' must act on body B).
2. The pair of forces is equal in magnitude and opposite in direction; they must also be of the same type/nature. In other words, if the force that A exerts on B is a gravitational force, then the equal and opposite force exerted by B on A is also a gravitational force.

Study the forces in the following scenarios for each of the underlined bodies. Identify which are action-reaction pairs ("Newton's Third Law pairs"):

**Scenario 1:** A man standing stationary on the floor holding a suitcase.

**9749(2023) H2 Physics**

H204 Forces - Notes

Sometimes this state of equilibrium is referred to as "dynamic equilibrium" or "total mechanical equilibrium".

there is no resultant force and

there is no resultant torque about any point on it.

Basically it is when a body has reached both translational and rotational equilibrium.

**Example 14**

A boat of weight 15 000 N is being lifted by two ropes attached at points A and B. It remains horizontal and travels up vertically at constant speed. Find the tensions \(T_{1}\) and \(T_{2}\) in rope 1 and 2 respectively.

**Solution**

B boat is in rotational equilibrium.

By Principle of Moments, taking moments about A, sum of clockwise moments

= sum of anticlockwise moments

\[(15\ 000)(0.75) = (T_{2})(2.00)\] \[T_{2} = \frac{(15\ 000)(0.75)}{2.00}\] \[= 5625\ \text{N}\]

B boat is in translational equilibrium.

No resultant force vertically.

**Notes:** Note the presentation expected for questions involving rotational equilibrium: the principle of moments, the pivot, and the relationship relating to sum of moments.

Be reminded that a body under translational equilibrium does not have linear _acceleration_ so it can either (i) have constant velocity or (ii) be stationary.

**Example 15**

A 4.0 m long ladder of uniform density and mass 6.0 kg leans 40\({}^{\circ}\) against a smooth vertical wall at P. Its lower end contacts the floor at Q. Find the force exerted by ladder on floor at Q, \(F_{\text{on floor}}\).

**Solution**

Vertical wall is smooth so only normal contact force \(N_{p}\) acts on ladder to the right at P.

Ladder is in translational equilibrium. No resultant force horizontally: there must be friction \(F_{r}\) acting on ladder to the left at Q:

\[\left|N_{p}\right|=\left|F_{r}\right|\]

No resultant force vertically:

\[\left|N_{Q}\right|=\left|W\right|\]

Ladder is in rotational equilibrium.

By Principle of Moments, taking moments about Q,

sum of clockwise moments

= sum of anticlockwise moments

\[(W)(2\text{ cos }50^{\circ}) = \left(N_{p}\right)(4\text{ cos }40^{\circ})\] \[N_{p} = \frac{(W)(2\text{ cos }50^{\circ})}{(4\text{ cos }40^{\circ})}=\frac{( mg)(2\text{ cos }50^{\circ})}{(4\text{ cos }40^{\circ})}\] \[= \frac{(6.0)(9.81)(2\text{ cos }50^{\circ})}{(4\text{ cos }40^{\circ})}\] \[= 24.69\text{ N}\]

**Notes:** The force by ladder on floor is the reaction force by floor on ladder.

**Example 16**: A non-uniform bar AB of weight 36 N makes an angle of 60\({}^{\circ}\) with a horizontal surface.

(a) Show that the magnitude of force X which supports the bar is 8.8 N.

(b) (i) Explain why a force \(F\) must act at A to keep the bar in equilibrium

(ii) Find the magnitude of \(F\).

(iii) Draw an arrow to show the approximate direction of \(F\).

**Notes:** For (b)(i), you need to address both conditions of equilibrium to gain full credit.

**Example 16 (continued)**

**For a body that is in equilibrium, when none of the forces acting on the body are parallel all the lines of action from the forces will meet at a common point.**

i.e the three forces must be **CONCURRENT.**

_(4 or more non parallel forces need not be concurrent for rotational equilibrium to take place. Why? A body in equilibrium under the action of more than three forces may be reduced to a three-force member by a combination of two or more of the known forces.)_

**Notes: (b)(iii) is a special geometric result, often useful in answering MCQs.**

**We can understand using rotational equilibrium: the sum of moments about any point (which can be outside the body) must sum up to zero torque.**

**The common point where the lines of action meet results in zero perpendicular distance to the point for each of the forces:**

\[\text{torque}=F(0)+W(0)+X(0)=0\]

**Example 17**

A wheel is being rolled up a kerb by a forward force \(F\) at the top as shown. The weight of 1400 N passes through the centre of wheel, the wheel has a radius of 30 cm and the kerb is 10 cm high. Determine (i) \(F\) and (ii) the reaction force on the wheel by the kerb **just** as wheel mounts the kerb.

**Solution**

Let reaction force be \(R\)

To just mount kerb, the wheel loses contact with the lower ground so no normal contact force there.

**Notes:** The geometric result in Example 16(b)(iii) was used - can you spot it?

### Ending Notes

Force is one of the fundamental building blocks on which the rest of the A-Level Physics syllabus will build on. You should master the skills necessary to solve these problems soonest possible.

In general, if you ever find yourself uncertain on how to approach answering any question, a good "fall-back strategy" is to consider the following matrix:

\begin{tabular}{c c c}  & **magnitude** & **direction** \\  & & "which force?" \\  & & "how strong?" \\  & & "any "cancellation?" \\  & & "what is the resultant?" \\  & & "what type of energy?" \\ energy & & "how much energy?" \\  & & "is there energy loss / dissipation?" \\ \end{tabular}

You can use the space below to do up your own mind-map to summarise this topic.
