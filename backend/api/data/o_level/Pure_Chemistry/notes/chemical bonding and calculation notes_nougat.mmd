The strong electrostatic forces of attraction between "sea of electrons" and "immobile" positive metal ions that form the structure of the giant metallic lattice is the metallic bonds

"Sea of electrons" consists of free electrons, mobile electrons and delocalised electrons)

Properties:

Generally exists as a solid at rtp

A large amount of energy has to be absorbed to overcome to strong metallic bond

Have high melting and boiling points

Good heat conductor

Sea of electrons are free to move to transfer heat

Conduct electricity in any state (aka good electrical conductor)

Sea of electrons are free to move to carry electricity

Malleable (can bend/be hammered) and ductile (can be drawn out into thin wire without breaking)

When force is applied, the neatly arranged layers of metal atoms can envelop each other easily

Giant covalent bonds: substrate

Formed between thousands and million of atoms extended 3-dimensionallyONLY covalent bonds (_duh_, that's why they're called giant covalent bonds) supporting (_duh_)

Grand covalent bonds \(\rightarrow\) Giant covalent substances

Example I of giant covalent substance: Diamond

Has a tetrahedral structure

Each carbon atom covalently bonded to 4 other carbon atoms

Example 2 of giant covalent substance: Graphite

Formed by many layer of graphene (a grant molecule)

Has a hexagonal structure

Each carbon atom covalently bonded to 3 other carbon atoms

This leaves I free electron per carbon atom not bonded

Bush a great molecule Property 1. High melting point 2. High boiling point 3. Low volatility

Reason Large amount of energy to be **Same applies here** absorbed to break the strong **covalent bonds between the **carbon atoms**

Property 4. Non-electrical conductor 4. Electrical conductor **weak**

Reason No free moving ion or electron **One free electron per carbon**

to carry electric current **atom to carry around **electric current**

Property 5. Hard 5. Soft and slippery

Reason Large force needed to break **Low force needed to break the strong covalent bonds**

between the carbon atoms **forces of attraction to allow to layers to slide over each other easily**

Uses Used in cutting tools or drill **Used as a solid**

bits due to its hardness **lubricant or in pencil**

(or used in engagement rings **lead due to its softness **#hopelessromantic**) **and slippery property Chemical equations

One mole of particles / Avogradov's number = 6 x 10^23 = 1 mol

One mole of any gas occupies a volume of 24 dm^3 at rtp and pressure
