DIR-Iucleotide

Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is a molecule that carries genetic code which is used to synthesise specific polypeptides

DNA has a double helix structure that comprises of two strands of nucleotides linked together that run in opposite direction

Each nucleotide consists of:

- A deoxyribose sugar

- A phosphate group

- A base containing nitrogen

There are four types of nitrogenous bases:

- Adenine (A)

- Guanine (G)

- Cytosine (C)

- Thymine (T)

Rule of complementary base pairing:

- Adenine always pair with thymine

- Cytosine always pair with guanine 

(e) State that DNA is used to carry the genetic code, which is used to synthesise specific polypeptides (details of transcription and translation are not required)transcription & translation

\begin{tabular}{c c}  & **Transcription** is the process by which the DNA template is used to make a single-stranded molecule called messenger RNA (mRNA) by complementary base pairing \\ \end{tabular}

\begin{tabular}{c c}  & **Translation** is the process by the ribosome reads the sequence of mRNA codons to make a polypeptide, which will fold into a protein \\ \end{tabular}

Genetic Engineering is used to transfer genes from the cells of one organism to the cells of another to form transgenic organisms
* The transferred gene can express itself in the recipient organism.

(g) Briefly explain how a gene that controls the production of human insulin can be inserted into bacterial DNA to produce human insulin in medical biotechnology

Bendits of particle engineering

Genes that allow crops to survive in harsh environment such as drought or reduce maturation period can be introduced into crops, which can increase food production

Lower cost for farmer which can be passed on to the consumers

Genetically modified crops with enhanced nutritional value can be used to supply nutrients to people 
## Risks of genetic engineering

Insect pests may develop resistance to the poison produced by the plant.

Useful insects such as insects that help with pollination such as butterfly and bees may be killed indiscriminately by the toxins produced by GM crops

Pest-resistance may be spread to weeds through cross-pollination, producing super weed

Upset the ecological balance.

Potential health concerns including allergen transfer, transfer of antibiotic resistance, unknown health effects.

World food production would be controlled by a few biotechnology companies.

Companies produce GM plants that produce sterile seeds means farmers have to purchase new seeds every year, which is a burden to the farmers
Ethical Implications of genetic engineering

Unnatural to mix genes across species/ tampering

with nature

GMR food labelling is not mandatory in some

countries. Consumers might be unaware that they

are purchasing and consuming GM products.

GMR food might not have been adequately tested,

which means the long term impact it has on human

is unknown

Genetic engineering may lead to class

distinctions. Only individuals with sufficient

financial means can afford certain gene

technologies.

Morally wrong to exploit animals for medical

research, especially when the animals are

designed to suffer.
