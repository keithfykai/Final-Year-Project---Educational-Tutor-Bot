Topic 11: Alkanes

Notes

**Checklist:**

Altenes (1)

1. I can recall the reactions an alkane can undergo, as well as their reagents and conditions
2. I can draw and describe the mechanism of free radical substitution, with particular reference to the initiation, propagation and termination reactions
3. I can explain the general un-reactivity of alkanes towards polar reagents
4. I am able to predict the possible products formed during free radical substitution, as well as their statistical probability ratio.
5. I can explain, using the concept of stability of radicals, why isomers of alkyl halides are formed in different proportions during free radical substitution
6. I able to recognise the environmental consequences of:

1. carbon monoxide, oxides of nitrogen and unburnt hydrocarbons arising from the internal combustion engine and of their catalytic removal
2. gases that contribute to the enhanced greenhouse effect
7. I am able to recognise that petroleum, a chemical feedstock, is a finite resource and the importance of recycling
