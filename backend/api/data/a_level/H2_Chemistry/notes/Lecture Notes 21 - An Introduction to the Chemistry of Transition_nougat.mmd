## 1 Introduction

### The d-block elements

These elements have atoms in which either the **inner 3d**, **4d**, **5d** or **6d subshells** are filling up. Their atoms are characterised by 'inner building' of d subshells.

* We will focus on the first row d-block elements.

The 3d block contains **ten elements**, because the **3d subshell** contains **five orbitals**, each able to accommodate up to two electrons. All these elements involve the filling of the 3d orbitals. They are all metals and tend to be hard metals compared with the s-block metals.

### Shapes of the 3d orbitals

There are a total of **five 3d orbitals**:

### Electronic Configurations of the Elements

The principles that govern the distribution of electrons in the orbitals are:

The Aufbau (building-up) Principle

Electrons fill orbitals from the lowest energy orbital upwards.

The Pauli Exclusion Principle

No more than two electrons may occupy a single orbital and, if two electrons do occupy a single orbital, their spins must be paired.

Hund's Rule

Orthats of a sub-shell (degenerate) must be occupied singly and with parallel spins before they can be occupied in pairs (with opposite spins).

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:4]

### The Transition Elements

A **transition element** is a d-block element which can form _one_ or _more_ stable ions with a partially filled d subshell.

Based on the above definition, which first row d-block elements are **not** transition elements?

Scandium and zinc are not transition elements since they do not form any stable ions with a partially filled d subshell. They ONLY form Sc3+ and Zn2+ ions respectively that do not have partially filled d subshell.

Sc 1s2 2s2 2p6 3s2 3p6 3d1 4s2 Zn 1s2 2s2 2p6 3s2 3p6 3d10 4s2 Sc3+ 1s2 2s2 2p6 3s2 3p6 3d10

The element copper forms Cu+ ion (electronic configuration: 1s2 2s2 2p6 3s2 3p6 3d10) which has a fully filled d subshell. Is copper a transition element?

Copper is still regarded as a transition element because it can form Cu2+ ion with a partially filled d subshell.

Cu 1s2 2s2 2p6 3s2 3p6 3d10 4s1 Cu2+ 1s2 2s2 2p6 3s2 3p6 3d9

## 2 GENERAL PHYSICAL PROPERTIES

The first row transition elements are all metals and all elements are remarkably **similar** in their physical properties.

they are _hard_ and have _high_ densities

they have _high_ melting and _b_olting points

they are _good_ conductors of heat and electricity

### Atomic Radius

The atomic radii of the first-row transition elements (in particular, from V to Cu) in Period 4 are **almost constant**

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|} \hline Element & Ca & Sc & Ti & V & Cr & Mn & Fe & Co & Ni & Cu & Zn \\ \hline Atomic & 0.197 & 0.144 & 0.132 & 0.122 & 0.117 & 0.117 & 0.116 & 0.116 & 0.115 & 0.117 & 0.125 \\ radius/nm & & & & & & & & & & & \\ \hline \end{tabular}

* In traversing the first-row transition elements, the **number of protons increases**, and hence, the **nuclear charge increases**.
* The number of electrons also increases. Electrons are added to the penultimate 3d subshell. These **inner 3d electrons shield the outer 4s electrons** from the increasing nuclear charge.
* The **increase** in shielding effect, due to an increase in the **number of 3d electrons**, **offsets** the **increase** in nuclear charge to a considerable extent**.
* There is only a **small increase in the effective nuclear charge** and attraction for valence electrons _increases_ slightly;_(_a relatively small_.)
* The atomic radii _decreases_ slightly and is often regarded as being **relatively constant**.
* Some of the first-row transition elements readily form alloys with each other partly because they have similar atomic radii.

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:6]

Example: The melting point of Ti is higher than that of Ca. Why is that so?

Both Ti and Ca are metals. Ti has a higher melting point than Ca due to stronger metallic

**bonding** in Ti which require more energy to break.

The stronger metallic bonding in Ti arises due to:

Ti cation has a higher charge density.

Both 3d and 4s electrons are available for delocalisation into the sea of electrons.

### Density

**Comparing s-block and transition elements**, the transition elements are generally much denser than the s-block elements in the same period.

* Transition elements have **smaller atomic size but larger atomic mass** as compared to s-block elements.
* There are more atoms packed per unit volume for the transition elements as compared to s-block elements.

* The almost constant atomic radius, coupled with increasing relative atomic mass, accounts for most of this trend.

## 3 CHARACTERISTIC CHEMICAL PROPERTIES

Some important characteristic chemical properties of transition elements are listed below and contrasted against those of s-block elements.

1. The transition elements form compounds in which the transition element shows a variety of oxidation states. Examples:

Examples:

+1 +1 +1 +1 +KCI \(\mathrm{K_{2}SO_{4}}\)

* The s-block elements form compounds in which they exist in a fixed oxidation state.

## 1 Approach

Reactant molecules diffuse towards the catalyst surface.

## 2 Adsorption

Reactant molecules become **adsorbed** onto the **active sites** of the catalyst surface by means of attractive forces.

This adsorption leads to an **increase in reaction rate** since

the bonds within the reactant molecules are weakened, thereby **reducing the activation energy**

the reactant molecules are brought into close contact with **correct orientation** for reaction

## 3 Chemical Reaction

Adjacent reactant molecules are brought into close contact with proper orientation for reaction. This reaction has lower activation energy than the uncatalysed reaction

## 4 Desorption

This is the reverse of adsorption. The product molecule eventually breaks free from the catalyst surface. The product molecule diffuses away from the surface. The vacant active sites are now available for adsorbing other reactant molecules.

Examples of heterogeneous catalysis

1. nickel in the hydrogenation of alkenes \(\cdot\)

R-CH=CH_2(g) + H_2(g) \(\stackrel{{\text{(s)}}}{{\text{N},\text{ heat}}}\) R-CH_2-CH_3(g)

2. iron/iron(III) oxide in the Haber process

3. vanadium(V) oxide in the Contact process

### Homogeneous Catalysis

In homogeneous catalysis, the **cataly and the reactants** are in the same phase, either liquid or gaseous.

Consider a reaction A + B \(\longrightarrow\) D catalysed by Ct

**Uncatalysed reaction: A + B \(\longrightarrow\) D**

**Catalysed reaction:** _Step 1_ A + Ct \(\longrightarrow\) A-Ct _Step 2_ A-Ct + B \(\longrightarrow\) D + Ct

_Overall reaction_ A + B \(\longrightarrow\) D* Typical features of homogeneous catalysis: 1. The catalyst (Ct) takes part in the reaction by being converted into an intermediate compound (A-Ct). 2. The intermediate compound subsequently undergoes reaction to yield the product(s) and the catalyst is regenerated. 3. The larger activation energy for the uncatalysed reaction is, in this case, replaced by two smaller activation energies for the catalysed reaction.
* _E\({}_{\alpha(0)}\) and \({}_{\alpha(3)}\) are smaller than E\({}_{\alpha(3)}\).
* _t rule 4 treatment_.
* What are the important features of transition elements which enable them to function effectively as homogeneous catalysts?
* their ability to exist in different oxidation states, and
* the relative ease with which they can be converted from one oxidation state to another.
* Reaction between peroxodisulfate ions and iodide ions **catalysed by Fe\({}^{2+}\)*
* or Fe\({}^{3+}\).
* \(\mathrm{S_{2}O_{8}^{2-}}\) (aq) + 2I\({}^{-}\)(aq)
* \(\mathrm{2SO_{4}^{2-}}\)(aq) + \(\mathrm{I_{2}(aq)}\)
* Relevant E\({}^{0}\) values:
* \(\mathrm{S_{2}O_{8}^{2-}}\) + 2e\({}^{-}\) = 2SO\({}_{4}\)\({}^{2-}\) E\({}^{0}\) = +2.01 V
* \(\mathrm{Fe^{3+}}\) + e\({}^{-}\) = Fe\({}^{2+}\) E\({}^{0}\) = +0.77 V
* \(\mathrm{I_{2}}\) + 2e\({}^{-}\) = 2I\({}^{-}\) E\({}^{0}\) = +0.54 V
* \(\mathrm{O}\)**Uncatalysed reaction*
* Since E\({}^{0}\)\({}_{\mathrm{eff}}\) > 0 V, the uncatalysed reaction is thermodynamically feasible under standard conditions.
* However, in the uncatalysed reaction, there is a direct reaction between two similarly charged ions. The electrostatic repulsion between the two negatively charged ions partly causes the reaction to have a **high activation energy*
* and hence to proceed slowly.

* **What are the conditions required for complex formation?** 
* **Why do transition metal ions show a high tendency to form complexes?** 
* **The transition metal ions have low-lying vacant orbitals (e.g. 3d, 4s and 4p orbitals) to accommodate the lone pairs of electrons from the ligands to form co-ordinate bonds.** 
* **The transition metal ions are relatively small and highly charged. Consequently, they have relatively high charge to size ratio (charge density) and are able to attract the lone pair of electrons from the ligands. Their high charge density and hence polarising power, produces a strong tendency towards covalent bond formation with ligands.**

## 7 STEREOCHEMISTRY OF COMPLEXES

### Shapes of complexes

The shape of the complex ion depends on the coordination number and nature of the metal ion.

When green crystals of chromium(III) chloride, [Cr(H\({}_{2}\)O)\({}_{4}\)Cl\({}_{2}\)]Cl/2H\({}_{2}\)O is dissolved in water, the chloride ions in the complex are slowly replaced by water to give blue-green [Cr(H\({}_{2}\)O)\({}_{6}\)Cl/Cl\({}_{2}\)H\({}_{2}\)O and finally violet [Cr(H\({}_{2}\)O)\({}_{6}\)]Cl/3.

* **Coloured objects** If selected wavelengths of the incident white light are absorbed and other wavelengths are reflected/transmitted, then the object will appear '**coloured**'. In general, an object appears coloured because it preferentially absorbs some wavelengths of light in the visible spectrum so that the transmitted or reflected light is richer in the remaining wavelengths of the visible spectrum.
* **What determines the observed colour of a coloured object?** The observed colour is the colour due to the combination of wavelengths of visible light reflected (for opaque objects) or transmitted (for transparent objects).
* **The observed colour is usually estimated using the idea of complementary colours.** (c) **Complementary colours** Each colour has a **complementary colour** as shown in the table above. A **colour wheel** can be used to help predict the colour that will be seen when absorption occurs in part of the visible spectrum. Colours directly opposite each other on the colour wheel are called **complementary colours.*** Example: A green object When white light (containing a broad spectrum of all visible wavelengths) passes through a substance that absorbs red light, the colour observed is green; green is the complement of red.
* The observed colour is said to be **complementary** to the colour of light absorbed. Hence if a compound absorbs light of one colour, we see the complement of that colour.

### Absorption of Light Energy and Electronic Transition

* When light energy is absorbed by a substance, an electron in the atom or ion of that substance is promoted from an orbital of lower energy to one of higher energy.
* The atom or ion absorbing the radiation changes from what is described as its **ground state** to an **excited state**.
* There can be more than one electronic transition. The different electronic transitions involve the absorption of radiation of different wavelengths (or different frequencies) and if the **absorbed wavelengths** are in the **visible region of the spectrum, then the substance appears coloured.

### Sodium chloride solution

Why is an aqueous solution of sodium chloride colourless?

* Consider the ground state and the excited state of the Na\({}^{+}\) ion. \(\begin{array}{c}\text{Na}^{*}\\ \text{(ground state)}\\ 1\text{s}^{2}\text{2s}^{2}\text{2p}^{6}\end{array}\) \(\begin{array}{c}\text{Na}^{*}\\ \text{(excited state)}\\ 1\text{s}^{2}\text{2s}^{2}\text{2p}^{5}\text{3s}^{1}\end{array}\) \(\begin{array}{c}\text{N}^{*}\\ \text{(excited state)}\\ \text{(only gap i}\text{ndndly large.}\end{array}\) \\ \end{array}\)
* The excitation of an electron from the lower energy 2p orbital to the higher energy 3s orbital requires wavelength of light well beyond the range of visible spectrum. Radiation from the visible spectrum does not provide sufficient energy to promote electrons in Na\({}^{*}\) ions to even the lowest of their possible excited electronic states.

_ademics solution_ \(\rightarrow\)_ _always all light to pass through._

### Occurrence of Colour in Octahedral Complexes

* **Crystal Field Theory*
* **Crystal Field Theory*
* provides a way of determining, by simple electrostatic considerations, how the energies of the metal ion orbitals will be affected by the set of surrounding ligands.
* In an isolated metal ion in the gaseous phase, the five 3d orbitals all have the same energy and are said to be **degenerate**.
* In an octahedral complex, six ligands L approach the central metal ion **M along the x, y and z axes.** This results in electrostatic repulsion between the electrons in the 3d orbitals and the lone pairs on the ligands, and thus an increase in potential energy. Hence the energy of an electron in either of the 3d orbitals in a complex of M is higher than in an isolated M atom.
* **3d\({}_{x}\)\({}^{2}\)\({}^{2}\) and 3d\({}_{z}\)\({}^{2}\)** : These orbitals have their greatest electron density **along** the co-ordinate axes on which the ligands are situated. Hence electrons in these orbitals are pointing towards the lone pairs of ligands, and will be repelled by them. _frequently._
* **3d\({}_{xy}\), 3d\({}_{xz}\), 3d\({}_{xz}\)** : These orbitals have their greatest electron density in **between** the co-ordinate axes. Hence the repulsion between electrons in these orbitals and those of the approaching ligands will be **less** compared to electrons in 3d\({}_{x}\)\({}^{2}\)\({}^{2}\) or 3d\({}_{z}\) orbitals. _frequently._
* **Thus the five 3d orbitals are affected differently by the approach of the ligands**. The orbitals are split into two energy levels with an energy gap between them, and the degeneracy of the five 3d orbitals is destroyed in complexes.

**Note:**

In **tetrahedral** complexes, the situation is reversed. The four ligands in these complexes approach the central metal ion **in between** the axes. Electrons in the 3d\({}_{xy}\), 3d\({}_{yz}\) and 3d\({}_{xz}\) now experience the **greatest** repulsion from ligand lone pairs, and so have a **higher** energy than electrons in the 3d\({}_{x}\)\({}^{2}\)\({}^{2}\) or 3d\({}_{z}\)\({}^{2}\) orbitals (see _Section 8.6_).

* The resulting **small energy gap** (i.e. \(\Delta\)E\({}_{\text{o}}\)) between the two sets of d-orbitals turns out to correspond to energies of electromagnetic radiation in the **visible region of the spectrum**.
* Transition metal compounds are therefore coloured because radiation in the visible region of the spectrum is of the right quantity of energy to promote electrons from d-orbitals of lower energy to one of higher energy (i.e. **d-d transitions**). The colour observed is the **complement** of the colour absorbed.

* **Why is an aqueous solution of NiC\(I_{2}\) coloured?**

In aqueous solution, Ni\({}^{2+}\) exists as an octahedral complex [Ni(H\({}_{2}\)O)\({}_{6}\)]\({}^{2+}\).

The presence of the H\({}_{2}\)O ligands causes the splitting of the five originally degenerate 3d orbitals in the Ni\({}^{2+}\) ion into two sets of slightly different energy levels.

Since the 3d subshell is partially filled (Ni\({}^{2+}\), 1s\({}^{2}\) 2s\({}^{2}\)2p\({}^{6}\) 3s\({}^{2}\) 3p\({}^{6}\) 3d\({}^{5}\)), the electrons from the lower energy d orbitals can absorb energy corresponding to certain wavelengths from the visible spectrum and get promoted to the higher energy d orbitals.

Such d-d transitions are responsible for the colour observed in NiC\(I_{2}\)(aq). The colour observed is the complement of the colour absorbed.

* **presence of ligands** causes the
* **splitting** of the five 3d orbitals into two sets of slightly different energy levels.
* **Since these 3d subshell is **partially filled**.
* **electrons** from the lower-energy d orbitals can absorb energy corresponding to certain wavelengths from the visible spectrum and get promoted to the higher-energy d orbitals. (d-d transitions)
* **The colour observed** is the complement of the colour absorbed.

### Factors affecting the Colour of Transition Metal Complexes

* **The colour of a transition metal complex is dependent on the energy gap (**\(\Delta\)E**) between the two groups of d orbitals. This in turn depends on the following factors.**

* **The identity of the metal and its oxidation state (which depends on the number of d electrons present).**
* **Compounds of the same element in different oxidation states show different colours.**
* **[Fe(H\({}_{2}\)O)\({}_{6}\)]\({}^{2+}\) and [Fe(H\({}_{2}\)O)\({}_{6}\)]\({}^{3+}\) have different no. of d-electrons and repel the electrons of the ligands to different extent, thus the energy gap between the split d-orbitals are different..**
* **[Cr(H\({}_{2}\)O)\({}_{6}\)]\({}^{2+}\)(aq) [Cr(H\({}_{2}\)O)\({}_{6}\)]\({}^{2+}\)(aq) [Fe(H\({}_{2}\)O)\({}_{6}\)]\({}^{2+}\)(aq) [Ar] 3d\({}^{4}\) [Ar] 3d\({}^{3}\) [Ar

### Splitting of d-orbitals in Tetrahedral Complexes

* In tetrahedral complexes, the situation is the reverse of that in octahedral complexes. The four ligands in tetrahedral complexes approach the central metal ion in **between** the x, y and z axes.
* Electrons in the 3d\({}_{xy}\), the 3d\({}_{yz}\) and the 3d\({}_{xz}\) orbitals now experience the greatest electrostatic repulsion from the ligand lone pairs, so have a higher energy than electrons in the 3d\({}_{x}\)-y\({}^{2}\) or the 3d\({}_{z}\) orbitals.

## 9 Ligand Exchange

### Stability constant

* An aqueous solution of nickel(II) sulfate contains [Ni(H\({}_{2}\)O)\({}_{6}\)]\({}^{2^{*}}\) ions. When excess aqueous ammonia is added to this solution, there is a noticeable change of colour because some of the [Ni(H\({}_{2}\)O)\({}_{6}\)]\({}^{2^{*}}\) ions are converted into [Ni(NH\({}_{3}\))\({}_{6}\)]\({}^{2^{*}}\) ions.
* A **ligand exchange reaction** occurs and the following equilibrium is established: \[\begin{array}{c}\par\par\par\par\par\par\par\par\par\par\par\par\par\par\par \par\par\par\par\par\par\par\par\par\par\par\par\par\par\par\par\par\par\par\par \par\par\par\par\par\par\par\par\par\par\par\par\par\par\par\par\par\par\par\par \par\par\par\par\par\par\par\par\par\par\par\par\par\par\par\par\par\par\par\par \par\par\par\par\par

### Ligand exchange in terms of stability constants

The formation of a complex ion can be regarded as a competition between two ligands for the metal ion. In general, the ligands forming the complex of higher stability constant will replace those forming the complex of lower stability constant.

**Note:**

1. In this case, there exist two **competing equilibria**, (1) and (2). Both NH\({}_{3}\) and OH\({}^{+}\) compete to combine with Cu\({}^{2+}\)(aq). With a large excess of NH\({}_{3}\) (i.e. higher [NH\({}_{3}\)]), the formation of [Cu(NH\({}_{3}\))\({}_{4}\)(H\({}_{2}\)O)\({}_{2}\)]\({}^{2+}\) is more favourable.
2. The following equation is sometimes used to represent the dissolution of the pale blue precipitate upon the addition of excess aqueous NH\({}_{3}\).

**N93/2/1a**

ii) Describe and explain what happens when an aqueous solution of edta is added to the solution in i)

When aqueous edta is added to a deep blue solution containing the [Cu(NH\({}_{3}\))\({}_{4}\)(H\({}_{2}\)O)\({}_{2}\)]\({}^{2+}\) ions, the colour of the solution lightens considerably as a ligand exchange reaction occurs. The hexadentate edta ligand replaces the NH\({}_{3}\) and H\({}_{2}\)O ligands to form the more stable [Cu(edta)]\({}^{2-}\) ions leading to the formation of a light blue solution. The following equilibrium is established and the equilibrium position lies more to the right.

[Cu(NH\({}_{3}\))\({}_{4}\)(H\({}_{2}\)O)\({}_{2}\)]\({}^{2+}\)(aq) + edta\({}^{+}\)(aq) \(\rightarrow\) [Cu(edta)]\({}^{2-}\)(aq) + 4NH\({}_{3}\)(aq) + 2H\({}_{2}\)O(\(I\))

The above reaction is **entropy favoured** as more aqueous particles are formed when the edta\({}^{4-}\) ligands substitute the NH\({}_{3}\) and H\({}_{2}\)O ligands. (\(\Delta\)n\({}_{\text{aq, particles}}\) = 5 - 2 = +3)

**Note:** The formation of the [Cu(edta)]\({}^{2-}\) is more favourable. (log K\({}_{\text{stab}}\) = 18.8)

**O. Worked Example 3**

**J91/4/1bii** Describe and explain what is seen when concentrated hydrochloric acid is added to a solution of Cu\({}^{2+}\) ions in water.

A solution of Cu\({}^{2+}\) ions in water is blue in colour due to the presence of [Cu(H\({}_{2}\)O)\({}_{6}\)]\({}^{2+}\) ions. Upon the addition of concentrated HC/, the blue solution turns green as a ligand exchange reaction occurs. The \(Cl^{-}\) ligands replace the water ligands in the [Cu(H\({}_{2}\)O)\({}_{6}\)]\({}^{2+}\) ions to form the more stable [Cu\(Cl_{4}\)]\({}^{2-}\) ions. The following equilibrium is established:

\[[\text{Cu(H${}_{2}$O)${}_{6}$]${}^{2+}$(aq)}+4Cl^{-}\text{(aq)} \approx\text{ [Cu$Cl_{4}$]${}^{2-}$(aq)}+6H_{2}O(I)\] blue yellow

The presence of both the blue [Cu(H\({}_{2}\)O)\({}_{6}\)]\({}^{2+}\) ions and yellow [Cu\(Cl_{4}\)]\({}^{2-}\) ions results in a green solution.

Addition of more concentrated HC/ to the green solution increases the Cl\({}^{-}\) concentration, causing the equilibrium position of the above reaction to shift further right in accordance to LeChatelier's principle. The green solution turns yellow as more yellow [Cu\(Cl_{4}\)]\({}^{2-}\) ions are formed. Dilution of the solution by adding water reverses the colour changes.

### Exchange of ligands in haemoglobin

* The body of an adult contains about 4 g of iron, 75% of which is in the form of haemoglobin. This vital oxygen-carrying constituent of the blood contains iron(II).
* red pigment in red blood cells
- acts as a transporter of oxygen in blood
- contains iron(II) which has a co-ordination number of six

Structure:

* The iron(II) exhibits hexa co-ordination.
* Four of the co-ordination sites are taken up by nitrogen from a ring system called a porphyrin which acts as a tetradentate ligand. This complex is called 'haem'.
* Above the plane of this ring is a fifth nitrogen atom, acting as a ligand. This atom is part of a complex protein called globin.
* The oxygen molecule may become reversibly bonded at the sixth site allowing the haemoglobin to carry oxygen from one part of the body to another.
* Better ligands than oxygen can bond strongly (almost irreversibly) to the iron(II) and thus destroy the oxygen carrying capacity of haemoglobin. This accounts for the toxic nature of carbon monoxide and cyanide ions, both of which are very good ligands.

### Effect of Ligand Exchange on E\({}^{0}\) values

* Replacement of H\({}_{2}\)O ligands in an aqua-complex by other ligands can cause large changes in electrode potential values.
* **Effect of CN\({}^{-}\) ligand on the relative stability of Fe(II) and Fe(III)** 

* Replacing the H\({}_{2}\)O ligand by the CN\({}^{-}\) ligand causes the E\({}^{0}\) value for the Fe(III)/Fe(II) system to become less positive i.e. Fe(III) becomes less oxidising.
* Hence there is stabilisation of the +3 oxidation state of iron relative to the +2 state of iron by the CN\({}^{-}\) ligand.

2. **Ligand exchange reactions** * Prediction of whether such a reaction occurs is usually based on the given relative stability constants of the complex ions or the given observations (i.e. colour changes, dissolution of precipitate, etc.). * Explanation is usually couched in terms of the relative stabilities of the complexes or the relative strengths of the ligands.

### Rules for Nomenclature of Complexes

The following rules apply to all complexes, whether or not they are derived from transition elements.

**(a) Formulae of Complexes**

1. The symbol for the central atom is written first, followed by anionic ligands and neutral ligands in that order. Example: [Fe(OH)(H\({}_{2}\)O)\({}_{5}\)]\({}^{\star}\)
2. Within each ligand class, the order should be alphabetical in terms of the symbol for the donor atom of the ligand. Example: [Cu(NH\({}_{3}\))\({}_{4}\)(H\({}_{2}\)O)\({}_{2}\)]\({}^{\star}\) N is the donor atom in NH\({}_{4}\). O is the donor atom in H\({}_{2}\)O.
3. Polyatomic ligands, but not monatomic ligands, are enclosed in curved brackets, and the formula of the whole complex is enclosed in square brackets. Example: [CrCl\({}_{2}\)(NH\({}_{3}\))\({}_{4}\)]\({}^{\star}\)

**(b) Naming of Complexes**

1. The cation is always named before the anion.
2. The names of the ligands precede the name of the central atom or ion.
3. The oxidation state of the central atom or ion is shown in Roman numerals in brackets immediately after its name.
4. Metals forming complex anions are given the word-ending -_afe_, whereas complex cations and neutral complexes are given their usual names.
5. Ligands are listed in alphabetical order, the multiplying prefix being ignored.
6. When a number prefix (e.g. di-, tri-) is already included in the name of the ligand, the name of the ligand is placed in a bracket with the prefix bis-, tris-, tetrakis- instead of di-, tri-, tetra- respectively.
7. Notice that the complex ion names are written as one word, with no spacing between the name and the oxidation state of the central atom.
3. Steps to be taken 1. Identify the ligands (see **Box A**). 2. Identify the number of ligands (see **Box B**). 3. If several ligands are present, list them in alphabetical order. Note: prefixes do not alter order.
4. Name the central cation/atom and indicate its oxidation state using a Roman numeral in parentheses. For **complex cation**, use the name of the metal. 4. Formulae of Complexes 1. The symbol for the central atom is written first, followed by anionic ligands and neutral ligands in that order. Example: [Fe(OH)(H\({}_{2}\)O)\({}_{5}\)]\({}^{\star}\)
2. Within each ligand class, the order should be alphabetical in terms of the symbol for the donor atom of the ligand. Example: [Cu(NH\({}_{3}\))\({}_{4}\)(H\({}_{2}\)O)\({}_{2}\)]\({}^{\star}\)

N is the donor atom in NH\({}_{4}\). O is the donor atom in H\({}_{2}\)O.
3. Polyatomic ligands, but not monatomic ligands, are enclosed in curved brackets, and the formula of the whole complex is enclosed in square brackets. Example: [CrCl\({}_{2}\)(NH\({}_{3}\))\({}_{4}\)]\({}^{\star}\)
