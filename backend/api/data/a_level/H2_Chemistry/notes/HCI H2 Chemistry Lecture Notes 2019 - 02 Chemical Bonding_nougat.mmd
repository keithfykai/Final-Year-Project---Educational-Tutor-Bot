## 1 Introduction

**LOOKING BACK**

The discovery of electrons by J. J. Thomson and the development of the atomic model, led to the development of the concept of a chemical bond. As you uncover the nature of the chemical bond, consider the following questions:

* Which parts of the atom is responsible for chemical bonding?
* How does the structure of the atom affect the chemical bonding it participates in?

### Overview

Why is copper (and most other metals) shiny, malleable and able to conduct electricity when solid or molten? Why is table salt (or any other ionic substance) a hard, brittle, high-melting solid that conducts electricity only when molten or dissolved in water? Why do simple molecular substances, which is the main ingredient of candle wax, have a low melting point, is soft and non-conducting, while diamond (or other giant molecules like Si or SiO\({}_{2}\)) has a high melting point and is extremely hard? The answer lies in the type of bonding in the substance.

In nature, only six elements exist as free, unbonded atoms at room temperature and pressure: These are the noble gases. All other elements exist in a form in which their atoms are said to be chemically bonded to each other - in the form of a metallic lattice, an ionic compound or a covalent molecule (simple molecules like O\({}_{2}\), HC\(l\) and pentane; or giant molecules like diamond).

Why do atoms bond? Bonding lowers the potential energy between positive and negative particles, which could be metal cations and delocalised valence electrons, oppositely charged ions, or atomic nuclei and the electrons between them. The natural state of most atoms, the state in which they have the lowest energy, is the bonded state. This also means that the bonded state is energetically more stable than the unbonded state. Energy is, given off when atoms form bonds. On the other hand, it always requires an input of energy to break a chemical bond - bond breaking is endothermic.

When atoms bond, the electrons in one atom are attracted to the nucleus of another atom. The three major types of chemical bonding - metallic, ionic and covalent - differ only in how far this attraction to another nucleus overcomes the attraction of the electron to its own nucleus. It is the valence electrons of the atoms that are involved in bonding. These valence electrons may be transferred from one atom to another or be shared between two or more atoms. Just as the electronic configuration and the strength of the nucleus-electron attraction determine the properties of an atom, the type and strength of chemical bonds determine the properties of a substance.

In this topic, we will study how atomic properties give rise to the three major types of chemical bonding. We will practice drawing dot-and-cross diagrams to illustrate ionic and covalent bonding. In covalent bonding, the bonded atoms share electrons and that is achieved through overlapping of orbitals. A simple covalent molecule is a fine little unit of architecture - a molecule containing three or more atoms has a three-dimensional shape. Simple covalent molecules form intermolecular attractions. We will study how each model of bonding and intermolecular attractions explains physical properties of substances such as melting and boiling points, electrical conductivity and solubility in

## 2 Metallic bonding & physical properties of metals

### Metallic bonding & the metallic lattice

Metals in the solid state have a giant metallic lattice structure held together by metallic bonding. Metallic bonding is the electrostatic forces of attraction between a lattice of metal cations and the sea of delocalised electrons in a metal.

A clue to the nature of metallic bonding comes from studying the atomic properties of metallic elements - the Group 1, 2 and 3 metals all have respectively only one, two or three electrons in the outer shell, and have low ionisation energies. The physical property that is most characteristic of metals, their, electrical conductivity, increases as the number of ionisable outer shell electrons increases. Electrical conductivity depends on the presence of mobile carriers of electric charge - in this case the outer shell electrons or valence electrons.

In this simplified model of metallic bonding, all the metal atoms in a piece of metal 'pool' their outer shell electrons into an evenly distributed sea of electrons that 'flows' between and around the metal-ion cores (nucleus plus inner shell electrons, i.e. metal cations) and attracts the metal cations, thereby holding them together. The electrons in metallic bonding are said to be delocalised, moving freely throughout the piece of metal.

Figure 2: The metallic lattice

### Factors affecting the strength of metallic bonding

The strength of metallic bonding is determined by:

1. **Number of valence electrons contributed per metal atom** into the sea of delocalised electrons. The larger the number of valence electrons contributed per atom, the greater the number of delocalised electrons, the stronger the metallic bonding.
2. **Charge, and radius of the metal cation**. The higher the charge and the smaller the radius of the metal cation, the higher its charge density, the stronger the metallic bonding. (The charge density of an ion, sometimes called surface charge density, is the amount of charge per unit surface area of that ion by treating it as a sphere. For simplicity, we can compare the charge densities of two ions by determining the ratio of charge/ionic radii.)

### Physical properties of metals

High melting and boiling points

The attraction between the delocalised electrons and these positive ions is strong and is responsible for the strength of the metallic lattices, and for their fairly high melting and boiling points.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|c|c|c|} \hline
**Metal** & sodium & magnesium & titanium & copper & iron & silver \\ \hline
**Melting point /°C** & 98 & 649 & 1668 & 1083 & 1535 & 962 \\ \hline
**Boiling point /°C** & 883 & 1091 & 3287 & 2562 & 2862 & 2162 \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 1: Melting and boiling points of metals are usually highIn molten metal (liquid state), metallic bonding is still present, although the ordered structure has been broken down. The metallic bonding is **not completely broken until the metal boils**. This means that the boiling point is actually a better guide to the strength of metallic bonding than the melting point is. **On melting, the metallic bonding is weakened, not broken**.

### Good electrical conductivity and thermal conductivity

In order for a material to conduct electricity, it must have mobile charge carriers which are typically electrons or ions. Metals are good electrical conductors because the delocalised'sea' of electrons, which act as mobile charge carriers, are free to move about. When a piece of metal is attached to a battery, electrons flow from the negative terminal into the metal and replace electrons flowing from the metal into the positive terminal.

Metals are good conductors of heat because of the mobile delocalised electrons. Thermal energy is picked up by the electrons as additional kinetic energy which makes them move faster. The energy is transferred throughout the rest of the metal by the moving electrons. So heat flows quickly from the hotter part to the cooler part of the metal.

### Hardness

Metals are usually hard e.g. iron is hard and has good mechanical strength - meaning that it does not deform easily when subjected to the stress of physical forces. However, the Group 1 and 2 metals are soft e.g. sodium can be cut easily with a pen knife.

The hardness of a solid material depends on how easily we can move the particles from their fixed position in the solid lattice. In metals, this depends on the strength of metallic bonding.

### Malleable and ductile

Metals are usually malleable (can be beaten or rolled into sheets) and ductile (can be drawn out under tension into rods, wires and tubes).

When a large stress (e.g. hammering) is applied to a piece of solid metal, the layers of ions will slide over one another into new positions. The overall shape of the metal piece changes (the metal deforms) but it does not break or shatter apart because the'sea' of delocalised electrons prevents repulsion between the cations as they move past one another, and metallic bonding remains intact.

Figure 3: The metallic lattice when subjected to shear stress

### Alloys & their uses

Most metals used in practical applications, such as aluminium aircraft frames are in the form of an alloy instead of the pure metal.

Alloys are mixtures of metals involving incorporation of small quantities of other element(s) into the pure metal. Alloying makes metals harder. This is because atoms of the added element(s) have a different size. This will disrupt the orderly arrangement of the main metal atoms such that they can no longer slide over each other easily when a force is applied. This increases the hardness and strength of the alloy compared to the pure metal.

Figure 4: Arrangement of atoms in an alloy

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|l|} \hline Alloy & Parent element & Alloying & Characteristics & Uses \\ \hline bronze & copper (90\%) & tin (10\%) & hard and strong & ship propellers \\ \hline brass & copper (70\%) & zinc (30\%) & corrosion & castings, hardware \\  & & & resistant & items, boilers in ships \\ \hline steel & iron (99.8\%) & carbon (0.2\%) & hard and strong & bridges, buildings \\ \hline stainless & iron (74\%) & chromium (18\%) & strong and & hospital and chemical \\ steel & & nickel (8\%) & corrosion & equipment, cuttery \\  & & & resistant & \\ \hline pewter & tin (97\%) & copper + antimony & hard and strong & ornaments \\  & & (3\%) & & \\ \hline \end{tabular}

## 3 Ionic Bonding & Physical Properties of Ionic Compounds

### Formation of ionic bonding

Ionic compounds in the solid state have a giant ionic lattice structure held together by ionic bonding. Ionic bonding is the electrostatic forces of attraction between oppositely charged ions in an ionic compound.

We typically observe ionic bonding between elements with large differences in electronegativity. One such difference occurs between reactive metals (Group 1 and 2 metals) and non-metals (Group 16 chalcogens and Group 17 halogens). The metal atom (low ionisation energy) loses its one of two valence electron(s), whereas the non-metal atom gains the electron(s). Electron transfer from metal to non-metal occurs, and each atom forms an ion with a noble gas electronic configuration. The electrostatic attraction between these positive and negative ions draws them into a regular three-dimensional array of an ionic solid, whose **chemical formula represents the cation-to-anion ratio (empirical formula) in the ionic lattice**.

Figure 5: Model of the NaCl lattice, the ions are arranged in a regular three-dimensional structure \(\mathrm{U}\mathrm{T}\).

#### 3.1.1 Dot-and-cross diagrams for ionic compounds

The **dot-and-cross diagram** gives a method for depicting the valence electrons of interacting atoms as well as the type of bond (ionic or covalent) present. The **element's symbol represents the nucleus _and_ the inner shell electrons, and the surrounding dots and crosses represent the valence electrons.

Figure 6: _Solanced equation showing the formation of the ionic compounds, Nact and MgCl._

_The dot-and-cross diagrams for the two compounds are also shown._

### The ionic lattice & coordination number

Now we have seen how individual ions are formed, we shall turn our attention to how they collect together in a **giant lattice**. Oppositely charged ions attract each other while ions of like charges repel each other. We therefore expect to find that each cation in an ionic lattice will be surrounded by a number of anions as its closest neighbours, and each anion will in turn be surrounded by a number of cations. We will not find two cations, or two anions, adjacent to each other.

The diagrams below are models of the sodium chloride lattice. As illustrated in the expanded version, one Na\({}^{*}\) cation is surrounded by six _Cl_ anions and vice-versa. The force of attraction = ionic bonding - exists between _any_ two adjacent ions of opposite charge. Ionic bonding is thus said to be _non-directional_ (while a covalent bond is _directional_ because one covalent bond can only be formed between two _specific_ atoms).

Figure 7: Models of the NaCl lattice. The space-filling model illustrates the close packing of ionic solids while the expanded model shows the coordination number of each ion and the orderly arrangement within the giant ionic lattice.

The number of ions that surround another ion of the opposite charge in an ionic lattice is called the **coordination number** of that central ion. The coordination number of an ion in an ionic lattice depends on two things - the relative sizes of the ions, and their relative charge.

If one of the ions is very small, there will not be room for many oppositely charged ions around it e.g. the maximum coordination number for Zn\({}^{2+}\) is usually four as it is a smaller ion than Na\({}^{*}\). If the cations and anions are nearly equal in size, one ion can be surrounded by eight others. The intermediate case of six neighbours occurs when one ion is bigger than the other, but not by very much.

To gain electrical neutrality, a cation with +2 charge needs twice as many anions with -1 charge, compared to a cation with +1 charge. We therefore find that the Ca\({}^{2+}\) cation in calcium chloride, CaCl\({}_{2}\), is surrounded by twice as many \(Cl\) anions as compared to the Li\({}^{*}\) cation in lithium chloride, LiCl.

The two factors are illustrated in the table below. This is for illustration purpose only, we are not required to memorise which type of ion has coordination number 4, 6 or 8. [See **N2009/III/1(d)**]

### Factors affecting the strength of ionic bonding

The strength of ionic bonding is determined by the charge of the ions, and their radii. The higher the charge and the smaller the radii of the ions, the stronger the ionic bonding.

We may compare the strength of ionic bonding using the term, lattice energy.

**Lattice energy** is defined as the heat evolved when 1 mole of a pure ionic solid is formed from its constituent gaseous ions. For example, the lattice energy of MgO is the energy released during the reaction, Mg\({}^{2+}\)(g) + O\({}^{2-}\)(g) \(\rightarrow\) MgO(s), which has a value of -3791 kJ mol-1. This is a bond forming process. For NaCl, its lattice energy has a value of -787 kJ mol-1. Lattice energy gives an indication of the strength of ionic bonding - the larger its magnitude, the stronger the ionic bonding.

There is a simplified mathematical relationship between the magnitude of the lattice energy and the ionic radii and charge.

So the magnitude of the lattice energy of an ionic compound depends on these two factors - ionic charge and ionic radius.

### Physical properties of ionic compounds

High melting and boiling pointsThere are strong electrostatic attractions between oppositely charged ions in the giant lattice. We therefore expect that ionic solids will have high melting points. On melting, although the ordered lattice is broken down, there is still a significant level of attraction between the mobile ions in the liquid state. This will result in high boiling points. Ionic attractions are stronger if the ions possess higher charge or are smaller, as shown in the table below.

### Good electrical conductors when molten or dissolved in water

The conduction of electricity is the movement of electrical charge. The cation or anion that make up an ionic compound has an electrical charge. In the solid state, ionic compounds do not conduct electricity as the ions are fixed in positions and are not free to move. When an ionic solid is melted or dissolved in water, the ions are now free to move and can act as mobile charge carriers to conduct electricity. The mobile ions move towards the electrode that carries an opposite charge to their own.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{c c c c c c}
**Compound** & **Cation radius /nm** & **Anion radius /nm** & **Cation charge** & **Anion charge** & **m.p./o**c \\ NaCl & 0.10 & 0.18 & +1 & -1 & 801 \\ NaF & 0.10 & 0.13 & +1 & -1 & 993 \\ MgF\({}_{2}\) & 0.07 & 0.13 & +2 & -1 & 1261 \\ MgO & 0.07 & 0.14 & +2 & -2 & 2852 \\ \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 4: Small, highly charged ions bond strongly leading to high melting points

Figure 8: Ionic compounds do not conduct electricity in the solid state but do so when molten or dissolved in qg. solutionThe electrical conductivity of an aqueous solution of an ionic compound increases as its concentration increases, because there are more ions to carry the charge. Similarly, for the same concentration, a salt solution that contains highly charged ions such as A/*, conducts electricity better than a salt solution that contains ions of lower charge such as Na*.

### Hard and rigid but brittle

Ionic solids e.g. NaCl(rock salt) are hard (do not dent or deform easily), rigid (do not bend easily) but brittle (crack without deforming).

In an ionic lattice, oppositely charged ions are held in fixed positions throughout the crystal lattice by strong ionic bonding. Moving the ions out of position requires large amounts of energy to overcome these bonds. Ionic lattices are therefore quite hard and rigid.

However, if a strong enough shearing force (e.g. by cutting or knocking) is applied, it will force ions of like charges to move next to each other. Repulsion between ions of like charges will cause the lattice to shatter apart. Ionic lattices are therefore said to be brittle.

Figure 9: A shearing force will shatter an ionic crystal

## 4 Covalent bonding

**Covalent bonding** is the electrostatic force of attraction between the positively charged nucleus of both the bonded atoms and their shared pair of electrons.

A covalent bond forms when orbitals of two atoms overlap and the overlap region, which is between the two nuclei, is occupied by a pair of electrons.

### Formation of covalent bonds & molecular orbitals

If the two bonding atoms have similar electronegativity, we observe electron sharing and covalent bonding. This type of bonding most commonly occurs between non-metal atoms. Each non-metal atom holds onto its own electrons tightly (high ionisation energies) and tends to attract other electrons as well. The attraction of each nucleus for the valence electrons of the other atom draws the two atoms together. A shared electron pair is said to be **localised** between the two atoms because it'spends' most of its time in the space there. The two atoms are linked in a covalent bond of a particular length and strength. In most cases, discrete or separate molecules form when covalent bonding occurs (we call these simple covalent molecules), and the chemical formula shows the actual numbers of atoms of each element in one molecule (**molecular formula**).

Let us consider the simplest covalent bond, i.e. between two hydrogen atoms in a H\({}_{2}\) molecule (refer to Figure 10): imagine two hydrogen atoms, initially a large distance apart, approaching each other. As they come close to one another, the first effect is that the electron of one atom experiences repulsion from the electron of the other atom. But this is compensated by the attraction each electron experiences towards the other atom's nucleus (in addition to the attraction it always experiences from its own nucleus). As the hydrogen atoms get closer still, the two electrons encounter an attraction to the opposite nucleus that is stronger than their mutual repulsion: Eventually, when the two nuclei become very close together, they in turn start to repel each other, since they are both positively charged. The most stable situation occurs when the attractions of the two electrons to the two nuclei is just balanced by the electron-electron and nucleus-nucleus repulsions, and a H-H covalent bond forms. At this point, to separate the two H atoms to their initial unbonded state, it would require a certain amount of energy - this is the **bond energy** of that bond. In addition, the nucleus-nucleus distance, which is the measured distance between the centre of both nuclei is its **bond length**.

Figure 10: Potential energy vs. distance between nuclei for the H\({}_{2}\) molecule

Being attracted to two nuclei, the two electrons in a H\({}_{2}\) molecule'spend' most of their time in the region half-way between the two nuclei. This is where the highest electron density, or highest probability of locating an electron, occurs in a single covalent bond.

We use the term **atomic orbital** to describe the region of space around the nucleus of an atom where an electron can be found, Similarly, we can use the term **molecular orbital** to describe the region of space within a molecule where the pair of bonding electrons or shared electrons can be found.

Figure 11: Bonding between two H atoms, their 1s orbitals overlap to form a molecular orbital

Figure 10: Potential energy vs. distance between nuclei for the H\({}_{2}\) molecule

### Covalent bonding in terms of orbital overlap

There are two types of orbital overlap:

1. **Sigma (\(\sigma\)) bond** formed by '**head-on' overlap** of two orbitals:

When two atoms share only one electron pair, they form a single bond.

**A single bond consists of a \(\sigma\) bond**, as shown in the examples above.

Sharing two electron pairs produces a double bond e.g. O=O in O\({}_{2}\), C=O in CO\({}_{2}\) and C=C in alkenes. Sharing three electron pairs produces a triple bond e.g. N=N in N\({}_{2}\), C=C in organic compounds, C=O in carbon monoxide, and C=N in HCN. But there can only be one \(\sigma\) bond between two atoms as it is not possible for a second pair of orbitals to overlap head-on as well. Thus, the second type of orbital overlap is described in Figure 13.

Figure 12: Examples of \(\sigma\) bond: **(a)**\(\sigma\) bond formed by s-s overlap (i.e., \(\sigma\) bond in H\({}_{2}\)): **(b)**\(\sigma\) bond formed by s-p overlap (e.g. H-F bond); **(c)**\(\sigma\) bond formed by p-p overlap (e.g. F-F bond)Figure 13: Example of \(\pi\) bond formed by side-on overlap between two sets of \(p\) orbitals (found in \(O_{2}\), \(CO_{2}\), \(C\)=\(C\), \(N_{2}\), \(C\)=\(C\), \(C\)=\(N\), \(C\)=\(C\)).

Figure 13: Example of \(\pi\) bond formed by side-on overlap between two sets of \(p\) orbitals (found in \(O_{2}\), \(CO_{2}\), \(C\)=\(C\), \(N_{2}\), \(C\)=\(C\), \(C\)=\(N\), \(C\)=\(C\)).

### Factors affecting the strength of covalent bonding

The strength of a covalent bond is measured by the **bond energy** of that covalent bond. The bond energy of a covalent bond is the average energy required to break 1 mole of that covalent bond in the gaseous state. The bond energy is dependent on how strongly the two positively charged nuclei attracts the shared electrons. This in turn is affected by the bond length and the bond order.

The **bond length** of a covalent bond is the distance between the nuclei of the two bonded atoms. The **bond order** is the number of covalent bonds between a pair of atoms.

Two generalisations can be made:

1. **Smaller atoms form shorter and stronger bonds** For small atoms, overlap between the valence orbitals is more effective and the valence orbitals are close to the nucleus. Electrons in overlapping orbitals experience a strong attraction to the bonding nucleus.

2. **Multiple bonds are stronger and shorter than single bonds** The more valence orbitals that overlap, the more electrons being shared, the stronger the attraction between the two positively charged nuclei and the shared electrons.

Since a triple bond has six shared electrons, there will be a much stronger attraction between the shared electrons and the two positively charged nuclei as compared to a double bond which has four shared electrons; or a single bond which has only two shared electrons.

How is bond energy or bond length related to the reactivity of covalent bonds?A longer, hence, weaker bond is usually broken more easily and reacts more readily. We will study more about this in the organic chemistry reactions.

Figure 14: Bond length, covalent radius and bond energy in the diatomic halogen molecules

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{l|l|l|l|l|l}
**Bond** & **Bond length /pm** & **Bond energy /kl mol\({}^{3}\)** & **Bond length /pm** & **Bond energy /kl mol\({}^{3}\)** \\ C-C & 154 & +350 & C-O & 143 & +360 \\ C=C & 134 & +610 & C=O & 123 & +740 \\ C=C & 121 & +840 & C=O & 113 & +1080 \\ \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 5: Multiple bonds are stronger and shorter than single bonds

### Using dot-and-cross diagrams to represent covalent bonding

The dot-and-cross diagram is a method for depicting the valence electrons of interacting atoms as well as the type of bond (ionic or covalent) present.

For the drawing of dot-and-cross diagrams, the syllabus specified a number of substances (refer to learning outcomes on pg.32). Other than these simple examples, you will need to be able to draw the dot-and-cross diagrams for analogous situations as well as more complicated situations.

To do well in A-level chemistry, you must first master the basic content, then develop skills and exam strategies. For example, if you are tested on the dot-and-cross diagrams for substances stated in the syllabus or substances analogous to them, you must be able to simply recall the answers. Next, you must develop some general rules for drawing dot-and-cross diagrams to handle the more complicated situations.

#### General rules for drawing dot-and-cross diagrams

When drawing dot-and-cross diagrams for covalent compounds, note the following.

Show all the valence electrons, including those valence electrons not involved in bonding.

The element's symbol represents the nucleus _and_ the inner shell electrons.

Use only dots (\(\bullet\)) and crosses (\(\times\)) to represent valence electrons. Do not use other symbols like circles, triangles or squares, unless otherwise stated.

Between any two bonded atoms, use different electron symbols (but \(\bullet\) and \(\times\) only). By doing so, a legend for the electrons is not necessary.

Following the octet rule, compounds should be bonded such that each atom has eight elections in its valence shell.

Let us look at the simple examples first.

#### Lecture Exercise 4.1

Draw the dot-and-cross diagrams for the following molecules.

### Co-ordinate bonding (also called dative bonding)

So far, we have looked at covalent bonds in which each of the two bonding atoms provides one electron to form the bond. It is possible for just one of the atoms to provide both bonding electrons. This atom is called the **donor atom**, and it must have a **lone pair**. The other atom in the bond is called the **acceptor atom**, and it must contain an **empty orbital in its valence shell**. This kind of bonding is called **dative bonding** or **co-ordinate bonding**.

You should also know that donor atoms, containing a lone pair of electrons, is also known as a _Lewis base_. While an **acceptor atom**, which has an empty orbital in its valence shell, is known as a _Lewis acid_. This definition of acids and bases is very general, very useful, and will recur in later topics. For each of the following three examples, can you identify which molecule is acting as the Lewis acid, and which molecule is acting as the Lewis base?

**Example 1: NH\({}_{3}\)BFs**

When gaseous NH\({}_{3}\) and gaseous BF\({}_{3}\) react together, white solid NH\({}_{3}\)BF\({}_{3}\) forms. The nitrogen atom in NH\({}_{3}\) has a lone pair; As a Period 2 element, the boron atom can accommodate a maximum of 8 electrons. However, in BF\({}_{3}\), the boron atom has only 6 electrons in its outermost shell and is electron deficient. It has an empty 2p orbital, which can overlap with nitrogen's orbital containing the lone pair.

**Example 2: AzCl\({}_{6}\).**

Just below its melting point, aluminium chloride exists as covalent \(Al_{2}Cl_{6}\) molecules. This is because aluminium, like boron, has only 6 electrons in its outermost shell in the monomer A/Cl\({}_{3}\) and is electron deficient. It has an empty 3p orbital which can accept a lone pair of electrons from the chlorine atom of another A/Cl\({}_{3}\) monomer, to form a dimer as shown in Figure 16. This persists in the gas phase but if the temperature is raised to 800 \({}^{\circ}\)C, the dimer breaks down to monomeric A/Cl\({}_{3}\).

Figure 16: Dot-and-cross diagrams and drawings of Al\({}_{3}\)Cl\({}_{6}\) dimer

Figure 17: Dot-and-cross diagrams and drawings of Al\({}_{3}\) monomerA dative bond, once formed, is no different from an ordinary covalent bond.

For example, in the NH\({}_{4}\)\({}^{+}\) cation, all four N\(-\)H bonds are exactly the same.

A dative bond can be a bond or a \(\pi\) bond.

### Exceptions to the octet rule

In his studies of chemical bonding, Lewis generalised much of bonding behavior into the octet rule: when atoms bond, they lose, gain or share electrons to attain a filled outer electron shell of eight electrons. So the atom attains the noble gas electronic configuration, ns\({}^{2}\) np\({}^{6}\). The octet rule is obeyed by nearly all of the compounds of Period 2 elements and also for a large number of compounds of elements in other periods as well.

However, the octet rule is based on empirical observation: it could be used to identify structures which are likely to be stable but it cannot be used to explain the stability of chemical bonds.

Hence we will cite several exceptions to the octet rule.

Electron deficient species (usually the central atom) BF\({}_{3}\) and A/Cl\({}_{3}\) molecules, given in the earlier examples, can exist even though the central atom has yet to achieve octet and is electron deficient. Two more examples are given below.

[FIGURE

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:26]

### Radicals

In some molecules, there are unpaired electrons in the outermost shell, Such species are called **radicals**, and they are usually very reactive. Most radical molecules have a central atom that has an unpaired electron, and that central atom is usually a Group 15 or Group 17 element. So certainly, that central atom does not have an octet structure.

e.g. C/O\({}_{2}\) in which the C/ atom has a total of 11 electrons in its outermost shell.

Another example is nitrogen monoxide, NO.

What about cations?

There are far more cations which do not have noble gas electronic configuration than those which do!

e.g. \(\mathrm{Fe^{3+}}\) \(\mathrm{Cu^{2+}}\) \(\mathrm{1s^{2}}\)\(\mathrm{2s^{2}}\)\(\mathrm{2p^{6}}\)\(\mathrm{3s^{2}}\)\(\mathrm{2p^{6}}\)\(\mathrm{3d^{9}}\) \(\mathrm{Zn^{2+}}\) \(\mathrm{1s^{2}}\)\(\mathrm{2s^{2}}\)\(\mathrm{2p^{6}}\)\(\mathrm{3s^{2}}\)\(\mathrm{3p^{6}}\)\(\mathrm{3d^{10}}\) \(\mathrm{Ag^{+}}\) \(\mathrm{1s^{2}}\)\(\mathrm{2s^{2}}\)\(\mathrm{2p^{6}}\)\(\mathrm{3s^{2}}\)\(\mathrm{3p^{6}}\)\(\mathrm{3d^{10}}\)\(\mathrm{4s^{2}}\)\(\mathrm{4p^{6}}\)\(\mathrm{4d^{10}}\) \(\mathrm{Pb^{2+}}\) \(\mathrm{[Xe]}\)\(\mathrm{4f^{14}}\)\(\mathrm{5d^{10}}\)\(\mathrm{6s^{2}}\) \(\mathrm{H^{+}}\) \(\mathrm{1s^{0}}\) The only elements that form cations with noble gas electronic configuration are those in Group 1, Group 2, scandium, and aluminium in Group 13.

What about anions?

Anions are tidier. The non-metal elements in Groups 15, 16 and 17, and hydrogen which form simple anions all attain noble gas electronic configuration \(\mathrm{ns^{2}}\)\(\mathrm{np^{6}}\), and \(\mathrm{1s^{2}}\) for the H- anion.

### Dot-and-cross diagrams for covalent molecules or polyatomic ions

In Section 4.4, you have learnt to draw dot-and-cross diagrams for simple covalent molecules, many of which you may have encountered in O Level Chemistry. In this section, you will be dealing with covalent molecules or polyatomic ions where the situation may be more complex and requires practice before you master this skill.

Now let us develop some skills and strategies for drawing such dot-and-cross diagrams.

**General guidelines for drawing dot-and-cross diagrams for covalent molecules or polyatomic ions**

1. Decide on the central atom, and the terminal atoms. The central atom is usually the one with lowest electronegativity (carbon in CO\({}_{2}\)) or the one that can form more covalent bonds (carbon in CH\({}_{4}\)). The notion of 'central' and 'terminal' atoms is only of concern if the molecule or ion has three or more atoms. If there are only two atoms, e.g. CO and OH-, one atom is just _next_ to the other!
2. When dealing with polyatomic anions or cations:

if it is an anion, for each (-) charge, add one electron to the more electronegative atom. E.g. fluorine is assigned the extra electron, not chlorine, in CF\({}_{4}\).

if it is a cation, for each (+) charge, remove one electron from the less electronegative atom. E.g. the electron is removed from hydrogen, not nitrogen, in NH\({}_{4}\).

Remember to draw square brackets around the ion and label its charge.
3. Draw dot-cross pairs to make terminal atoms achieve octet by assigning single, double or triple bonds accordingly.

Do this by using the periodic table to locate the group number, and hence determine the number of valence electrons of the element. By considering the number of outer shell electrons already present for each surrounding atom, we will know how many covalent bonds it must form to achieve octet. Draw in the remaining valence electrons of the atom in pairs.
4. Finally, check the central atom:

1. Are there any valence electrons yet to be accounted? These are non-bonding valence electrons and should be drawn as pairs. These are termed 'lone pairs' (see Section 5.2).
2. Count the total number of outer shell electrons, Only elements from period 3 onwards can expand octet, if a central atom cannot expand octet, change a double bond to a device bond (see Lecture Exercise 4.3 (iv)).

Sometimes, the central atom may be electron deficient or turn out to be a radical.

Let us practice.

**Lecture Exercise 4.3**

Draw the dot-and-cross diagrams for the following substances. Some are covalent molecules, some are ionic compounds containing polyatomic ions.

## 5 Shapes of molecules & polyatomic ions

### Introduction to molecular geometry

Jacobus Henricus van't Hoff, Jr. (1852 - 1911), Dutch physical and organic chemist and the first winner of the Nobel Prize in Chemistry. He is best known for his discoveries in chemical kinetics, chemical equilibrium, osmotic pressure and stereochemistry. His work in these subjects helped found the discipline of physical chemistry as it is today. In 1874, van't Hoff suggested for the first time that molecules possessed three-dimensional shapes. The shapes are determined by the angles between the bonds which are in turn determined by the arrangement of electrons around each central atom.

Why study the shapes of molecules (molecular geometry)? In any molecule, each atom and electron pair has its own position in space relative to one another, determined by attractive and repulsive forces. With definite angles between bonds (bond angles) and distances between any two nuclei (bond length), a molecule is a fine little unit of architecture.

Whether we consider the details of simple reactions, the properties of synthetic materials, or the intricate life-sustaining processes of living cells, molecular geometry is a crucial factor,

Geometry is a branch of Mathematics that deals with the measurement, properties, and relationships of points, lines, angles and shapes. Transferring these concepts to Chemistry - "points' would be the atoms, "lines' would be the covalent bonds, 'angle' would be the bond angle (an angle between two covalent bonds around a central atom) and'shapes' would refer to the three-dimensional shapes of molecules and polyatomic ions about the central atom.

Dot-and-cross diagrams are not used to represent the shapes of molecules and ions. We may use them to count the number of electron pairs around a central atom, and hence deduce the shape and bond angles using the **Valence Shell Electron Pair Repulsion (VSEPR) theory**.

Figure 19. _‘Ball-and-stick’ model of the sulfuric acid (H\({}_{4}\)SO\({}_{4}\)) molecule_

### Valence shell electron pair repulsion (VSEPR) theory

There are two main principles of the VSEPR theory:

1. The electron pairs (or electron groups) around the central atom of a molecule (or ion) arrange themselves as far apart as possible so as to minimise their mutual repulsion.
2. The repulsion between electron pairs decreases in strength in the following order: lone pair-lone pair repulsion > lone pair-bond pair repulsion > bond pair-bond pair repulsion

An electron pair that is shared between bonded atoms is called a bond pair. An electron pair that is part of an atom's valence shell but not shared with another atom is called a lone pair.

The five arrangements of electron pairsWe mainly deal with molecules or ions containing 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6 electron pairs (bond pairs and lone pairs) around the central atom. Using VSEPR main principle no. 1, these total numbers of electron pairs give the following five types of electron-pair arrangements:

The five basic shapes of molecules (or polyatomic ions) without lone pairsIf there are only bond pairs and no lone pairs around the central atom, the name given to the shape of the molecule (or ion) is the same as that given to the arrangement of the electron pairs. So we have the five basic shapes of molecules (or ions) without lone pairs:

e.g. Be\(C_{l}\) contains two bond pairs and no lone pair around the central atom. The two bond pairs arrange themselves as far apart as possible so as to minimise their mutual repulsion, thus giving a linear molecular shape with a bond angle of 180\({}^{\circ}\).

Figure 21: The five basic shapes of molecules (or ions) in which there are only bond pairs and no lone pairs around the central atom; and their bond angles

Figure 20: Five types of electron-pair arrangements depending on the total no. of electron pairs present, the balloons represent electron clouds (of the electron pairs); where do you think is the location of the nucleus of the central atom?\(\mathrm{BF_{3}}\) and gaseous/\(\mathrm{ACI_{3}}\) are examples of trigonal planar molecules. The word "planar" means that all the atoms of that molecule lie on the same plane. And since the three surrounding atoms occupy the corners of a triangle, we have the name "trigonal planar".

Figure 23: Models of tetrahedral, trigonal bipyramidal and octahedral molecules, bond angles and examples

Figure 22: Structures of the trigonal planar \(BF_{3}\) and \(\mathrm{ACI_{3}}\) molecules, and their molecular model

Figure 23: Models of tetrahedral, trigonal bipyramidal and octahedral molecules, bond angles and examples

**What happens to the molecular shape if there are lone pairs?**

Although lone pairs are important in determining the shape of a molecule, they are 'ignored' when the molecule's shape is described. The shape is named based on relative positions of atoms. And so we have another eight shapes if there are lone pairs. See Table 6.

**What happens to the bond angle if there are lone pairs?**

Let us refer to VSEPR main principle no. 2.:

The repulsion between electron pairs decreases in strength in the following order;

I lone pair-lone pair repulsion > lone pair-bond pair repulsion > bond pair-bond pair repulsion

A lone pair is attracted by only one nucleus while a bond pair is attracted by two nuclei. So a lone pair electron cloud is less 'elongated' than a bond pair. A lone pair takes up more space around the central atom and its electrons are, on average, closer to the nucleus of the central atom. Thus, a lone pair repels other electron pairs around it more than a bond pair would.

Consider CH4, NH3 and H2O. All three molecules have four electron pairs around the central atom, which arrange themselves in a tetrahedral fashion. The tetrahedral 109.5\({}^{\circ}\) bond angle is found in CH4. NH3 and H2O contain one and two lone pairs respectively, which give stronger repulsion than the bond pairs. The bond pairs in NH3 and H2O are pushed more closely together resulting in slightly smaller bond angles, 107\({}^{\circ}\) and 104.5\({}^{\circ}\) respectively.

Figure 25: Drawings of the shapes of CH4 (tetrahedral), NH3 (trigonal pyramidal) and H2O (bent) with lone pairs on the central atom indicated (may be drawn like an ‘electron cloud’ or simply indicated as two dots)

**General considerations for predicting molecular shapes and bond angles using VSEPR theory 1**: Determine the total number of electron pairs (or electron groups) around the central atom. To do this, we use the dot-and-cross diagram. With experience, you may not need to draw the dot-and-cross diagram to determine the number of pairs of electrons around the central atom.
2. Use VSEPR main principle no. 1 to determine the electron-pair arrangement.
* The number of bond pairs equals the number of terminal atoms.
* If there are only bond pairs, no lone pairs, the name of the molecule's shape is the same as that given to the electron-pair arrangement.
* If there are lone pairs, the molecule's shape is named based only on the relative positions of the atoms.
3. After deducing the shape of the molecule or ion, bond angles 180\({}^{\circ}\), 120\({}^{\circ}\) and 90\({}^{\circ}\) are easily recognised by visualising the molecule in three-dimensions. Bond angles 109.5\({}^{\circ}\), 107\({}^{\circ}\) and 104.5\({}^{\circ}\) - for tetrahedral, trigonal pyramidal and bent -- we memorise them, and we must be able to explain why the angles for trigonal pyramidal and bent are smaller than that for tetrahedral using VSEPR main principle no. 2.

The shape is only of concern if the molecule or ion has three or more atoms. If there are only two atoms e.g. CO, O\({}_{2}\), N\({}_{2}\), the halogens and OH\({}^{-}\), one atom is just _next_ to the other! Also, the notion of 'bond angle' will not be relevant.

If there is more than one central atom e.g. H\({}_{2}\)SO\({}_{4}\) (Figure 19), H\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{2}\), N\({}_{2}\)H\({}_{4}\), propane, CH\({}_{3}\)CO\({}_{2}\)H etc, state the shape with respect to each central atom.

With experience gained from lots of conscientious practice, plus organised memory work and some imagination; we can easily deduce the shape after counting the numbers of bond pairs and lone pairs; Develop your own skills so that you can work quickly when solving MCQs during an exam.

Let us practice.

Remember to draw square brackets around an ion and label its charge.

**Lecture Exercise 5.1**: For each of the following species, draw its structure showing the shape and indicate the lone pairs (if any) on the central atom. State the shape about the central atom and suggest the bond angle.

**IV) H\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{2}\)**:

### Hybridisation of Atomic Orbitals

To account for the bonding in diatomic molecules like HF, we picture the direct overlap of s and p orbitals of isolated H and F atoms. But how can we account for the shapes of so many molecules and polyatomic ions through the overlap of spherical s orbitals, dumbbell-shaped p orbitals and cloverleaf-shaped d orbitals? After all, the s, p or d orbitals aren't oriented toward the corners of a tetrahedron or a trigonal bipyramid!

For example consider the methane molecule, CH\({}_{4}\). As accounted by the VSEPR model and measured by an X-ray study of the molecule, CH\({}_{4}\) has a tetrahedral shape and a bond angle of 109.5\({}^{\circ}\). Its tetrahedral shape suggests that its C atom should 'provide' four orbitals oriented in a tetrahedral geometry, each containing one electron, and each orbital forms a \(\sigma\) bond with the 1s orbital of a H atom (Figure 26).

Now look at an isolated ground-state carbon atom's valence shell electronic configuration (2s\({}^{2}\)-2p\({}^{2}\)), and the shapes of its 2s and 2p orbitals:

There is a mismatch between the expected orientation of the orbitals involved in bonding for the C atom in CH\({}_{4}\) compared to those of an isolated C atom; and also in terms of the numbers of single unpaired electrons that can be used for \(\sigma\) bonding.

Linus Pauling proposed that valence atomic orbitals of atoms in a molecule are _different_ from those of isolated atoms. In his **hybridisation theory**, **atomic orbitals (s and p, and sometimes d) mix to form new orbitals called hybrid orbitals** which may then involve in \(\sigma\) bonding. Using this theory, we can explain **how molecular shapes arise from interactions of atomic hybrid orbitals.** For the A-levels, we focus on the learning of sp\({}^{3}\), sp\({}^{2}\) and sp hybridisation of carbon. In the following pages, we will study these concepts with reference to the examples of methane (CH\({}_{4}\)), ethene (CH\({}_{2}\)=CH\({}_{2}\)) and, ethyne (H-C=C-H).

Figure 27: Electron-in-box diagram and shapes of valence atomic orbitals of an isolated ground-state C atomThe VSEPR and orbital hybridisation theories are different models to account for molecular shapes; Well, don't be concerned if we need more than one model to explain a complex phenomenon like bonding. All scientific models have limitations because they are simplifications of reality. In every science, one model or theory often accounts for some aspect of a topic better than another. Scientific theories are based on evidence, scientific knowledge is reliable and durable but never absolute.

#### 5.3.1 sp3 hybridisation of carbon

Mixing one's orbital and three p orbitals gives four sp3 hybrid orbitals. These four hybrid orbitals point towards the corners of a regular tetrahedron and are directed at 109.5\({}^{\circ}\) to each other so as to minimize repulsion with one another. All four hybrid orbitals are identical in shape. They are also identical in energy which is intermediate between the energies of the s and p orbitals, (The naming of the new hybrid orbitals follows the original numbers of s and p orbitals that made them.)

The carbon atom in methane, CH4, is sp3 hybridised.

Figure 28: Mixing of an s orbital and three p orbitals to form four sp3 hybrid orbitals for a carbon atom

Indeed, the hybridisation theory helps to explain in terms of orbitals, why methane is tetrahedral in shape with a bond angle of 109.5\({}^{\circ}\). It also explains why the four C-H bonds are equal in length and strength. It is important to understand, however, that hybridization is not a physical process which consists of electron promotion, orbital hybridization, and then bonding. Rather, it is a mathematical model which combines atomic orbitals in a way which is consistent with the observed shape and bond angle of the molecule.

Figure 29: Overlapping of orbitals in methane, CH\({}_{4}\) (small lobes of the hybrid orbitals are omitted)

How about ethane, CH\({}_{3}\)CH\({}_{3}\)?

In ethane, both carbon atoms are sp\({}^{3}\) hybridised.

The C-C bond is an sp3-sp\({}^{3}\)\(\sigma\) bond, formed from a head-on overlap of orbitals.

There are six C–H bonds, each bond is s-sp\({}^{3}\)\(\sigma\) bond, formed from a head-on overlap of orbitals.

Ethane is tetrahedral around each C atom and the bond angle around each C atom is 109.5\({}^{\circ}\).

#### 5.3.3 sp hybridisation of carbon

Mixing one s orbital and one p orbital gives two sp hybrid orbitals, directed at 180\({}^{\circ}\) to each other to minimize repulsion with one another.

Both carbon atoms in ethyne, H-C=C-H, are sp hybridised.

## 6 Bonding as a continuum - polar covalent bonds & ionic bonding with covalent character

We have discussed typical examples of ionic bonding, e.g. NaCl, and covalent bonding, H\({}_{2}\). But there are exceptions to these _idealised_ bonding models in the world of real substances. You have already seen two examples, BeCl\({}_{2}\) and gaseous AlCl\({}_{3}\), they are typical examples of covalent molecules formed by a metal and a non-metal.

Ionic bonding arises from electron transfer, while covalent bonding involves electron sharing. As mentioned in Section 1.4, _complete_ electron transfer and _equal_ sharing of electrons are the _extremes_, between which most actual cases of bonding fall. The electronegativity difference between two atoms is the best predictor of the degree of ionic or covalent character.

The term _ionic bonding_ is used for bonding which is _predominantly_ ionic.

The term _covalent bond_ is used for non-polar covalent bonds _as well as_ polar covalent bonds.

In this section, we will examine other segments of the continuum of chemical bonding - the polar covalent bond and ionic bonding with covalent character.

### Factors affecting the strength of dispersion forces

1. **The number of electrons or size of electron cloud.** The electron cloud of the molecule or atom is distorted when an instantaneous dipole or induced dipole is set up. The ease with which the electron cloud of a particle can be distorted is called its **polarisability**. The larger the number of electrons in a molecule or atom, the larger the size of the electron cloud and the more polarisable it is, as the electrons are further from the nucleus and are therefore held less tightly. So instantaneous dipoles and induced dipoles can form more easily, resulting in stronger dispersion forces. Dispersion forces are very weak for small particles like H\({}_{2}\) and He, but much stronger for larger particles like I\({}_{2}\) (thus it is a solid at room temperature). In Figure 50, the strength of dispersion forces increases with number of electrons when we go down Group 17 and down Group 18. As a result, boiling point increases.
2. **The molecular shape - surface area of contact between adjacent molecules.** For non-polar substances with similar number of electrons, the strength of dispersion forces is influenced by molecular shapes. Shapes that allow more points of contact have more surface area over which electron clouds can be distorted, so induced dipoles can form more easily, resulting in stronger dispersion forces. This factor is usually considered when we compare two structural isomers, usually a straight-chain isomer vs. a branched-chain isomer, e.g. pentane vs. 2,2-dimethylpropane (Figure 51). They have the same molecular formula (C\({}_{5}\)H\({}_{12}\)) and therefore the same number of electrons, but different shapes. The straight-chain pentane molecule has a cylindrical shape whereas the branched-chain 2,2-dimethylpropane has a more spherical shape. A cylindrical shape has a larger surface area than a sphere, thus, the surface area of contact between adjacent molecules is greater for pentane than for 2,2-dimethylpropane. Greater contact means induced dipoles can form more easily and dispersion forces can act at more points. Hence, more energy is needed to overcome stronger dispersion forces between pentane molecules and pentane has the higher boiling point.

### Hydrogen bonding

The name "hydrogen bond" is somewhat a misnomer as it is not a true _bond_ but a stronger type of permanent dipole-permanent dipole attraction, and must not be confused with a covalent _bond_.

When a hydrogen atom bonds to another atom, its sole electron is used up in the covalent bonding. In the F-H, O-H and N-H bonds, the bonding electrons are pulled strongly towards the highly electronegative fluorine, oxygen and nitrogen atoms. This gives the hydrogen atom a \(\delta\)+ charge. In fact, the hydrogen atom which has no inner electrons, is practically left with its nucleus which contains only one proton, and so it carries a really significant \(\delta\)+ charge.

The highly electron deficient hydrogen atom (with a \(\delta\)+) experiences a particularly strong attraction from the lone pair of electrons on the highly electronegative fluorine, oxygen or nitrogen atom of an adjacent molecule. This force of attraction is called **hydrogen bonding**.

#### Formation of hydrogen bonding

There are two requirements for hydrogen bonding to occur between two molecules:

One molecule must contain a hydrogen atom bonded to a highly electronegative fluorine or oxygen or nitrogen atom:

The other molecule must contain an atom with a lone pair of electrons, on a fluorine or oxygen or nitrogen atom.

[See **N2007/Ill/5(a)(i)**]

HF, H\({}_{2}\)O and NH\({}_{3}\) are typical examples of molecules which form intermolecular hydrogen bonding.

When asked to draw a diagram to illustrate hydrogen bonding, note the following:

* label the dipole for the covalent bond (F-H, O-H or N-H) carrying the acceptor hydrogen atom with '\(\delta\)+' and '\(\delta\)-' symbols
* draw in the lone pair of electrons for the fluorine, oxygen or nitrogen atom involved in the hydrogen bonding
* Indicate the hydrogen bonding using a dotted/dashed line together with a label

Figure 53: Intermolecular hydrogen bondingFigure 54: Intracramolecular hydrogen bonding bonding in salicylic acid

The structures of two molecules, \(A\) and \(B\), are shown below (they are structural isomers). In molecule \(A\), the -OH and -NO\({}_{2}\) groups can form intramolecular hydrogen bonding, so there is less extensive intermolecular hydrogen bonding in a sample of \(A\) compared to a sample of \(B\). Therefore, less energy is needed to overcome the intermolecular hydrogen bonding when \(A\) boils, hence its lower boiling point. (You may treat the words "less extensive" as referring to lower average number of hydrogen bonds present in the same mass of molecules \(A\) vs. \(B\).)

Figure 55: The proximity of the two functional groups in \(A\) allows intramolecular hydrogen bonding and that has an effect on its boiling point compared to its structural isomer \(B\)

## 9 Physical properties of covalent compounds

### Physical properties of simple covalent compounds

#### Melting and boiling points

The melting and boiling points of simple covalent compounds are usually lower than those of metals, ionic compounds or giant molecular compounds. This is because less energy is needed to overcome the weaker intermolecular attractions between the discrete molecules (dispersion forces, permanent dipole-permanent dipole attractions or hydrogen bonding), compared to the stronger metallic bonding, ionic bonding or covalent bonds.

#### Electrical conductivity C1O2O3

Simple covalent compounds are unable to conduct electricity in the solid or liquid state as there are no mobile charge carriers. This is because in the molecules, all electrons are either held in the covalent bonds or held by the nuclei and are not free to move throughout a sample of that substance. Also, no mobile ions are present. Simple covalent molecules are electrically neutral and cannot act as charge carriers.

However, some simple covalent substances are able to react with water to give aqueous ions. This allows the resulting solution to conduct electricity. Example; HC(g) + H2O(l) + Cr(aq) + H3O^(aq)

#### Solubility

Many simple covalent compounds are soluble in organic solvents like propanone [CH_gCOCH_3), tetrachloromethane (CC_l_a) and benzene (C6H6). Some are soluble in water (e.g. ethanol, ethanolic acid, glucose). See Section 11 for a detailed explanation on the solubility of covalent compounds.

### Physical properties of giant molecular compounds

Giant molecular compounds are also known as network covalent solids, They do not consist of separate or discrete molecules. Instead, the atoms in the compounds are held together by covalent bonds that extend in three dimensions throughout the sample. This type of covalent compound is said to have a giant molecular lattice structure. Their physical properties reflect the strength of covalent bonds.

In diamond, each C atom is tetrahedrally bonded to four other C atoms, an arrangement that extends throughout the giant lattice. With its giant lattice and strong covalent bonds connecting all the C atoms, diamond is very hard (the hardest natural substance known), has an extremely high melting point (3550 \({}^{\circ}\)C) and is insoluble in any solvent. (A single crystal of diamond or quartz is in fact a _single_ molecule containing maybe \(1\times 10^{28}\) atoms.)

The diamond molecule is electrically neutral, no ions are present. All electrons are either held in the covalent bonds or held by the nuclei and are not free to move. Without mobile charge carriers, diamond is a non-conductor of electricity.

In quartz (SiO\({}_{2}\)), each Si atom is covalently bonded to four O atoms, and each O atom is bonded to two Si atoms in a pattern that extends throughout the giant lattice. No separate SiO\({}_{2}\) molecules exist. Hence the formula SiO\({}_{2}\) is an empirical formula, not a molecular formula. Quartz is also very hard and has a very high melting point (1610 \({}^{\circ}\)C).

(A single crystal of diamond or quartz is in fact a _single_ molecule containing maybe \(1\times 10^{28}\) atoms.)

The diamond molecule is electrically neutral, no ions are present. All electrons are either held in the covalent bonds or held by the nuclei and are not free to move. Without mobile charge carriers, diamond is a non-conductor of electricity.

In quartz (SiO\({}_{2}\)), each Si atom is covalently bonded to four O atoms, and each O atom is bonded to two Si atoms in a pattern that extends throughout the giant lattice. No separate SiO\({}_{2}\) molecules exist. Hence the formula SiO\({}_{2}\) is an empirical formula, not a molecular formula. Quartz is also very hard and has a very high melting point (1610 \({}^{\circ}\)C).

### Physical properties of giant molecular compounds

Giant molecular compounds are also known as network covalent solids, They do not consist of separate or discrete molecules. Instead, the atoms in the compounds are held together by covalent bonds that extend in three dimensions throughout the sample. This type of covalent compound is said to have a giant molecular lattice structure. Their physical properties reflect the strength of covalent bonds.

In graphite, all the C atoms are sp hybridized and each C atom is covalently bonded to three other C atoms. A two-dimensional sheet of C atoms is formed (unlike diamond’s three-dimensional network). Each C atom has a 2p orbital containing one electron that is not used in the formation of C–C bonds. The 2p orbitals can overlap with each other to form a two-dimensional delocalised \(\pi\) bonding system spreading throughout the whole sheet of atoms. A graphite crystal is composed of many sheets or layers of atoms, stacked one on top of another. Each sheet is actually a single molecule.

## 10 Lattice Structures of Crystalline Solids

### Types of lattice structures

In crystalline solids, particles are arranged in a regular three-dimensional pattern or array. This is called a lattice.

There are a few types of lattice:

* giant metallic lattice e.g. in copper, iron and all other solid metals
* giant ionic lattice e.g. in NaCl, MgO, CaCO\({}_{3}\)
* simple atomic lattice e.g. in solid argon and the other noble gases
* simple molecular lattice e.g. in ice, solid HCI, solid iodine
* giant molecular lattice e.g. in diamond, Si, SiO\({}_{2}\), boron nitride

Each type confers different physical properties upon the substance that contains it. The features of each lattice structure and its associated physical properties have already been explained in earlier sections, with the exception of the simple atomic and simple molecular lattices,which is illustrated in Figure 61.

In this course, we are required to know how to describe in simple terms, the different types of lattice structures of the following crystalline solids:

* metallic, as in copper
* ionic, as in NaCl\({}_{i}\) MgO
* simple molecular, as in iodine
* hydrogen-bonded, as in ice
* giant molecular, as in graphite; diamond

Figure 61: Lattice structures of solid Ar, solid HCI, solid \(I_{2}\)

### Covalent radius and van der Waals radius (Refer to the _Data Booklet_)

Consider the example of solid iodine, which has a simple molecular lattice structure. When we measure the distances between two iodine nuclei in a sample of solid I\({}_{2}\), we obtain two different values.

The shorter distance is between two bonded iodine atoms in the same molecule. That is the I-I **bond length** and half of this distance is called the **covalent radius**, and is listed in the _Data Booklet_ under the label'single covalent'.

The longer distance is between two non-bonded iodine atoms in adjacent molecules. It is called the van der Waals distance. Half of this distance is called the **van der Waals radius**, and is listed in the _Data Booklet_ under the label 'van der Waals'.

The van der Waals radius of an atom is always larger than its covalent radius, but the van der Waals radii decreases across a period and increases down a group, just as the covalent radii does.

## 11 Explaining the solubility/miscibility of a substance in a given solvent

All intermolecular forces of attraction discussed in Section 8 for pure substances can be used to explain the solubility or miscibility of a substance in a given solvent. We also need to define several other intermolecular forces of attraction that was not discussed in Section 8.

1. **Ion-dipole attractions** occur between an ion and the oppositely charged end of a dipole. This attraction is weaker than ionic bonding but stronger than hydrogen bonding, permanent dipole-permanent dipole interactions and dispersion forces. However, because it is very extensive, it releases a lot of heat when formed.
2. **Permanent dipole-induced dipole interactions** occur when a polar molecule distorts the electron cloud of a nearby atom or non-polar molecule. This form of attraction is generally weak and releases little heat when formed. This form of interaction is very similar to dispersion forces, and is comparable to dispersion forces in terms of strength.

Previously, you have learnt that energy is released during bond forming and energy is required for bond breaking. Similarly, when intermolecular attractions are formed, energy is released, while energy is required to overcome intermolecular attractions.

The process of dissolutionWhen a solute dissolves in a solvent, the particles of the solute mix freely with the particles of the solvent. For this to happen, the interaction between the particles of the solute must be overcome and the same must occur for the solvent particles. Then, the particles of the solute need to form favourable interactions with the particles of the solvent.

The energetic aspect of dissolutionIn terms of energy changes, a solute is soluble in a solvent if the energy released from solute-solvent interactions is greater than or comparable to the energy needed to overcome solute-solute interactions and solvent-solvent interactions.

Explaining the solubility/miscibility of two substancesWhen explaining the solubility/miscibility of two substances, it is helpful to:

* identify the type of interactions holding solute particles together
* identify the type of interactions holding solvent particles together
* identify the type of interaction that can occur between the solute and the solvent particles
* compare the relative strength of the new interactions (solute-solvent) against the existing interactions (solute-solute and solvent-solvent).
