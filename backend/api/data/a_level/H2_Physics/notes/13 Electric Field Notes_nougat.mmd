A charge produces an electric field in the space around it, and a second charge placed in this field experiences a force due to this field. The electric force between two isolated point charges is governed by Coulomb's law, which is mathematically similar to Newton's law of gravitation for isolated point masses. We can use the concepts of work done and energy in the context of electrical interactions as well, and these ideas provide another route to solving problems that can in certain cases bring out the simplicity of the situation. Terms like electric potential and electric potential energy are defined similarly as with gravitational potential and gravitational potential energy.

Practical use of electricity often occurs in circuits rather than in free space. Circuits provide a means of conveying energy and information from one place to another. Within a circuit, the complicated effects of forces and electric fields at the microscopic level result in a macroscopic description where consideration of energy and electric potentials mostly suffices. The collective movement of charges results in electrical current, driven by potential differences (also known as voltages). Both current and potential difference can be experimentally measured. Applying the principles of charge and energy conservation provide powerful tools to analyse a variety of electrical circuits.

The mystery of magnetism was first discovered in magnetic stones by the ancients. Today, we understand magnetism as an effect inseparable from electricity, summarised by Maxwell's laws of electromagnetism. Unlike electric forces, which act on electric charges whether moving or stationary, magnetic forces act only on moving charges. Moving charges produce a magnetic field, and another moving charge or current placed in this magnetic field experiences a force. This apparent asymmetry in electromagnetic phenomena contributed to the development of the theory of relativity.

Technologies harnessing electrical and magnetic properties pervade modern society. Converting energy into electrical energy traditionally involves the induced electromotive force and current produced by a changing magnetic flux or a time-varying magnetic field. Transmitting electrical energy over long distances is made feasible by the use of alternating current and voltage transformers. Semiconductor devices in computers and smartphones are the product of our deep understanding of the physics of electricity and magnetism in solid state materials. Innovations are also pushing on the quantum frontier.

Even more fundamentally, elastic forces in springs and contact forces between surfaces arise from electrical forces at the atomic level. In biology, electricity is also important in signalling and control. The heart rhythms are maintained by waves of electrical excitation, from nerve impulses that spread through special tissue in the heart muscles.

The electric field strength at a point is defined as the electric force exerted per unit positive charge placed at that point.

Mathematically, it is written as

where \(E\) is the electric field strength and \(F\) is the force acting on the charge \(q\).

_Note:_

Electric field strength is a vector quantity.

Its direction is that of the force acting on a positive charge.

It points from a region of higher electric potential to a region of lower electric potential (see later section 13.4).

Its unit is N C\({}^{-1}\) or V m\({}^{-1}\).

Some A-Level questions refer to it as just "electric field".

A charge of -2.0 mC experiences a force of 8.0 N when placed at a point in an electric field. Determine the electric field strength at the point.

_Solution_

The magnitude of the electric field strength is \(E=\frac{F}{q}=\frac{8.0}{2.0\times 10^{4}}=4.0\times 10^{6}\) N C\({}^{-1}\)

The direction of the electric field strength is opposite to that of the force acting on the negative charge.

_Note:_

A positive point charge \(q\) is placed a distance \(r\) from another positive point charge \(Q\).

The charge \(q\) will experience a force \(F\) given by Coulomb's law: \(F=\frac{1}{4\pi\varepsilon_{0}}\frac{Q\times q}{r^{2}}\)

From the definition of electric field strength \(E=\frac{F}{q}\), the electric field strength \(E\) due to charge \(Q\) at a distance \(r\) from it is

Note that an electric field exists around any charged object and its field strength does not require the presence of another charge such as \(q\), which can be viewed as a test charge.

The concept of a field is useful in understanding gravitational, electric and magnetic forces. The field lines we draw around masses, charges and magnets are used to denote the direction of the force that will be experienced by a body (that interacts with the field) placed within the region. It must be emphasised that the electric field is a three-dimensional pattern, but on paper it is represented by a two-dimensional slice of the pattern. Below is a qualitative description of electric field.

1. The [direction of an electric field line indicates the direction of the electric force acting on a small positive test charge placed at that point. The direction of the electric field strength at any point is obtained by drawing a tangent to the electric field line at that point.
2. The density of the field lines (represented by the spacing between the field lines) of a region indicates the relative magnitude of the field strength. The closer the [spacing of the field lines, the stronger the field at that region, and vice versa. Also, the field lines do not cross one another.

Since the density of field lines at A is higher than at B, the electric field strength at A has a larger magnitude than that at B.
3. Electric field lines originate from positive charges and terminate on negative charges (these lines will reach infinity in the absence of another charge).

### 13.6 Importance factoring

\begin{tabular}{c c} \hline \hline Between \(E\) \& \& \(V\) & From the definition of potential, \\  & \(V=\frac{W}{q}=\frac{1}{q}\int_{a}^{r}F_{ext}dr=\frac{1}{q}\int_{a}^{r}\left(-F \right)\ dr\) \\ \end{tabular} Since the electric field strength \(E=\frac{F}{q}\), the expression becomes \(\cdot\). \(V=\int_{a}^{r}\left(-E\right)\ dr\). This implies that electric field strength \(E\) can be obtained from the derivative of electric potential \(V\) with respect to \(r\). Mathematically, this is expressed as \(E=-\frac{dV}{dr}\) \\ \end{tabular} Therefore: The **electric field strength ata point is numerically equal to the potential gradient at that point**. The negative sign indicates that the electric field points in the direction of decreasing potential. (The gradient of a \(V\)-\(r\) graph gives the magnitude of the electric field strength.) Similarly, from the definition of potential energy, \(U=\int_{a}^{r}F_{ext}dr=\int_{a}^{r}\left(-F\right)\ dr\), or \(qE=-q\frac{dV}{dr}\), we have \(F=-\frac{dU}{dr}\) \\ \end{tabular}

### 13.7 Comparison between Electric Field and Experimental Field

From the table, it is evident that there are similarities between the expressions for electric and gravitational fields.

### 13.8 Uniform electric field

Within a region of uniform electric field:

(a) the electric field strength at any point has the same magnitude and direction;

(b) the electric field lines are parallel and equally spaced.

Two equally but oppositely charged parallel plates of infinite dimensions can produce a uniform electric field between them. However in the laboratory, the plates used have finite dimensions and the field at the ends of the plates will not be uniform due to fringing effects. In the subsequent discussion, we will only consider the region near the centre of the two plates where the field is uniform.

Since the electric field between the parallel plates is uniform, the potential gradient at any point within the plates is given by

\[\frac{dV}{\alpha x}=\frac{\Delta V}{\Delta x}=-E=\mbox{constant}\]

where \(x\) is the perpendicular distance from the plate with the higher potential.

Therefore, if we know the potential difference \(\Delta V\) between the two plates and the separation \(d\) of the plates, the magnitude of the electric field strength \(E\) between the parallel plates is

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:19]

It can be seen from this example that the effect of electric field on a charged particle is similar to that of gravitational field on a mass.

An atomizer is used to produce tiny oil droplets which fall through a hole in the upper plate P. Frictional effects in the atomizer caused the oil droplets to be charged; some positively and others negatively. The droplets are illuminated by a light source and observed using a microscope.

First, we can determine the radius \(r\) and hence the weight \(W\) of an observed oil droplet by allowing it to fall with terminal speed. The drag force \(F_{q}\) acting on the oil droplet is given by Stokes' law: \(F_{e}=6\pi\eta\nu\), where \(\nu\) is the terminal speed and \(\eta\) is the viscosity of air.

When the oil droplet is failing with terminal speed \(\nu_{1}\), \(\frac{4}{3}\pi r^{3}\rho_{\alpha}g=\frac{4}{3}\pi r^{3}\rho_{\alpha}g+6\pi\eta \nu_{1}\)

\(\therefore\)\(r=\sqrt{\frac{9\eta\nu_{1}}{2g\left(\rho_{\alpha}-\rho_{\alpha}\right)}}\).

Fig. (c): **With an electric field**, the oil droplet rises with terminal speed \(\nu_{2}\). A uniform electric field is set up between plates P and Q by adjusting the potential difference \(V\) between the plates using a potentiometer circuit (not shown). The electric field strength \(E\) between the plates is \(E=\frac{V}{d}\), where \(d\) is the plate separation.

The potential difference \(V\) causes the oil droplet to rise with a terminal speed \(\nu_{2}\), such that

\(\frac{4}{3}\pi r^{3}\rho_{\alpha}g+6\pi\eta\nu_{2}=\frac{4}{3}\pi r^{3}\rho_{ \alpha}g+qE\)

The electric charge \(q\) on the oil droplet can then be found by measuring \(\nu_{2}\).

By repeating the procedure for different oil droplets carrying different charges, Robert Millikan was able to prove that

* the fundamental unit of electric charge \(e\) is \(1.60\times 10^{-18}\) C;
* any charge \(q\) is always an integer multiple of \(e\), i.e., electric charge is quantized;
* an electron is negatively charged.
