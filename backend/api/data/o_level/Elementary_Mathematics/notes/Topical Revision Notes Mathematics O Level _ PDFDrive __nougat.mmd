25. In a decimal, zeros before the first non-zero digit are not significant, e.g. 0.006 09 = 0.006 (to 1 s.f.) 0.006 09 = 0.0061 (to 2 s.f.) 6.009 = 6.01 (to 3 s.f.)
26. In a decimal, zeros after the last non-zero digit are significant.

Example 12 (a) Express 2.0367 correct to 3 significant figures. (b) Express 0.222 03 correct to 4 significant figures.

Solution (a) 2.0367 = 2.04 (b) 0.222 03 = 0.2220 4 s.f.

Decimal Places
27. Include one extra figure for consideration. Simply drop the extra figure if it is less than 5. If it is 5 or more, add 1 to the previous figure before dropping the extra figure, e.g. 0.7374 = 0.737 (to 3 d.p.) 5.0306 = 5.031 (to 3 d.p.)

Standard Form
28. Very large or small numbers are usually written in standard form \(A\times 10^{n}\), where \(1\leq A<10\) and \(n\) is an integer, e.g. 1 350 000 = 1.35 \(\times 10^{6}\) 0.000 875 = 8.75 \(\times 10^{-4}\)Example 13: The population of a country in 2012 was 4.05 million. In 2013, the population increased by \(1.1\times 10^{5}\). Find the population in 2013.

Solution

4.05 million = 4.05 \(\times\) 10\({}^{6}\)

Population in 2013 = 4.05 \(\times\) 10\({}^{6}\) + 1.1 \(\times\) 10\({}^{5}\)

\(=4.05\times\) 10\({}^{6}\) + 0.11 \(\times\) 10\({}^{6}\)

\(=(4.05+0.11)\times\) 10\({}^{6}\)

\(=4.16\times\) 10\({}^{6}\)

Estimation

29. We can estimate the answer to a complex calculation by replacing numbers with approximate values for simpler calculation.

Example 14: Estimate the value of \(\dfrac{3.49\times\sqrt{35.7}}{35.1}\) correct to 1 significant figure.

Solution

\(\dfrac{3.49\times\sqrt{35.7}}{35.1}\) \(\approx\dfrac{3.5\times\sqrt{36}}{35}\) (Express each value to at least 2 s.f.)

\(=\dfrac{3.5}{35}\times\sqrt{36}\)

\(=0.1\times 6\)

Light rays travel at a speed of \(3\times 10^{8}\) m/s. The distance between Earth and the sun is 32 million km. Calculate the amount of time (in seconds) for light rays to reach Earth. Express your answer to the nearest minute.

Solution

48 million km = 48 x 1 000 000 km

\(=48\times 1\,000\,000\times 1000\) m (\(1\) km = 1000 m)

\(=48\times 000\,000\times 000\) m

In the map of a town, 10 km is represented by 5 cm.

**(a)**: What is the actual distance if it is represented by a line of length 2 cm on the map?
**(b)**: Express the map scale in the ratio 1 : \(n\).
**(c)**: Find the area of a plot of land that is represented by 10 cm\({}^{2}\).

Solution
**(a)**: Given that the scale is 5 cm : 10 km

Therefore, 2 cm : 4 km
**(b)**: Since 1 cm : 2 km,

1 cm : 2000 m

Therefore, the map scale is 1 : 200 000.
**(c)**: 1 cm : 2 km

1 cm\({}^{2}\) : 4 km\({}^{2}\)

10 cm\({}^{2}\) : 10 x 4 = 40 km\({}^{2}\)

Therefore, the area of the plot of land is 40 km\({}^{2}\).

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:23]

Example 4: Given that \(y\) is directly proportional to \(x\), and \(y=5\) when \(x=10\), find \(y\) in terms of \(x\).

Solution: Since \(y\) is directly proportional to \(x\), we have \(y=kx\).

When \(x=10\) and \(y=5\),

\(5=k(10)\)

\(k=\frac{1}{2}\)

Hence, \(y=\frac{1}{2}\ x\).

Example 5: 2 m of wire costs $10. Find the cost of a wire with a length of \(h\) m.

Solution: Let the length of the wire be \(x\) and the cost of the wire be \(y\).

\(y=kx\)

\(10=k(2)\)

\(k=5\)

i.e. \(y=5x\)

When \(x=h\),

\(y=5h\)

. The cost of a wire with a length of \(h\) m is $5\(h\).

Inverse Proportion

**6.** If \(y\) is inversely proportional to \(x\), then \(y=\frac{k}{x}\), where \(k\) is a constant and \(k\neq 0\).

Example 6

Given that \(y\) is inversely proportional to \(x\), and \(y=5\) when \(x=10\), find \(y\) in terms of \(x\).

Solution

Since \(y\) is inversely proportional to \(x\), we have

\[y=\frac{k}{x}\]

When \(x=10\) and \(y=5\),

\[5 =\frac{k}{10}\] \[k =50\] \[\text{Hence},y=\frac{50}{x}.\]

Example 7

7 men can dig a trench in 5 hours. How long will it take 3 men to dig the same trench?

Solution

Let the number of men be \(x\) and the number of hours be \(y\).

\(y=\frac{k}{x}\)

\(5=\frac{k}{7}\)

\(k=35\)

i.e. \(y=\frac{35}{x}\)

When \(x=3\),

\(y=\frac{35}{3}\)

\(=11\frac{2}{3}\)

\(\therefore\) It will take \(11\frac{2}{3}\) hours.

**1.**: A percentage is a fraction with denominator 100, i.e. \(x\%\) means \(\frac{x}{100}\).
**2.**: To convert a fraction to a percentage, multiply the fraction by 100%, e.g. \(\frac{3}{4}\times 100\%=75\%\).
**3.**: To convert a percentage to a fraction, divide the percentage by 100%, e.g. \(75\%=\frac{75}{100}=\frac{3}{4}\).
**4.**: New value = Final percentage \(\times\) Original value
**5.**: Increase (or decrease) = Percentage increase (or decrease) \(\times\) Original value
**6.**: Percentage increase = \(\frac{\text{Increase in quantity}}{\text{Original quantity}}\times 100\%\)
**Percentage decrease = \(\frac{\text{Decrease in quantity}}{\text{Original quantity}}\times 100\%\)Example 1: A car petrol tank which can hold 60 \(l\) of petrol is spoilt and it leaks about 5% of petrol every 8 hours. What is the volume of petrol left in the tank after a whole full day?

Solution

There are 24 hours in a full day.

After the first 8 hours,

Amount of petrol left \[=\frac{95}{100}\ \times 60\] \[=57\ l\] After the next 8 hours,

Amount of petrol left \[=\frac{95}{100}\ \times 57\] \[=54.15\ l\] After the last 8 hours,

Amount of petrol left \[=\frac{95}{100}\ \times 54.15\] \[=51.4\ l\ (\text{to 3 s.f.})\]

Example 2: Mr Wong is a salesman. He is paid a basic salary and a year-end bonus of 1.5% of the value of the sales that he had made during the year.

**(a)**: In 2011, his basic salary was $2550 per month and the value of his sales was $234 000. Calculate the total income that he received in 2011.
**(b)**: His basic salary in 2011 was an increase of 2% of his basic salary in 2010.
**(c)**: In 2012, his total basic salary was increased to $33 600 and his total income was $39 870.
**(i)**: Calculate the percentage increase in his basic salary from 2011 to 2012.
**(ii)**: Find the value of the sales that he made in 2012.
**(d)**: In 2013, his basic salary was unchanged as $33 600 but the percentage used to calculate his bonus was changed. The value of his sales was $256 000 and his total income was $38 720. Find the percentage used to calculate his bonus in 2013.

**Solution**

**(a)**: Annual basic salary in 2011 = $2550 x 12

 = $30 600

Bonus in 2011 = \(\frac{1.5}{100}\)\(\times\) $234 000

 = $3510

Total income in 2011 = $30 600 + $3510

 = $34 110
**(b)**: Annual basic salary in 2010 = \(\frac{100}{102}\)\(\times\) $2550 x 12

 = $30 000
**(c)**: **(i)**: Percentage increase = \(\frac{\$33\ 600-\$30\ 600}{\$30\ 600}\)\(\times\) 100%

 = 9.80% (to 3 s.f.)
**(ii)**: Bonus in 2012 = $39 870 - $33 600

 = $6270

Sales made in 2012 = \(\frac{\$6270}{1.5}\)\(\times\) 100

 = $418 000
**(d)**: Bonus in 2013 = $38 720 - $33 600

 = $5120

Percentage used = \(\frac{\$5120}{\$256\ 000}\)\(\times\) 100

 = 2%* 1. Speed is defined as the amount of distance travelled per unit time. Speed = \(\dfrac{\text{Distance Travelled}}{\text{Time}}\)
* 2. If the speed of an object does not change throughout the journey, it is said to be travelling at a constant speed.

* 3. To calculate the average speed of an object, use the formula Average speed = \(\dfrac{\text{Total distance travelled}}{\text{Total time taken}}\).

## Example 2

Tom travelled 105 km in 2.5 hours before stopping for lunch for half an hour.

He then continued another 55 km for an hour. What was the average speed of his journey in km/h?

### Solution

Average speed = \(\frac{105+55}{(2.5+0.5+1)}\)

= 40 km/h

### Example 3

Calculate the average speed of a spider which travels 250 m in \(1\frac{1}{2}\) minutes.

Give your answer in metres per second.

### Solution

\(1\frac{1}{2}\) min = 90 s

Average speed = \(\frac{250}{90}\)

= 2.78 m/s (to 3 s.f.)

### Conversion of Units

* Distance: 1 m = 100 cm
* 1 km = 1000 m
* Time: 1 h = 60 min
* 1 min = 60 s
* Speed: 1 m/s = 3.6 km/hExample 4

Convert 100 km/h to m/s.

Solution

100 km/h = \(\frac{100\ 000}{3600}\) m/s (1 km = 1000 m)

= 27.8 m/s (to 3 s.f.)

7. Area:

1 m\({}^{2}\) = 10 000 cm\({}^{2}\)

1 km\({}^{2}\) = 1 000 000 m\({}^{2}\)

1 hectare = 10 000 m\({}^{2}\)

Example 5

Convert 2 hectares to cm\({}^{2}\).

Solution

2 hectares = 2 \(\times\) 10 000 m\({}^{2}\) (Convert to m\({}^{2}\))

= 20 000 \(\times\) 10 000 cm\({}^{2}\) (Convert to cm\({}^{2}\))

= 200 000 000 cm\({}^{2}\)

8. Volume:

1 m\({}^{3}\) = 1 000 000 cm\({}^{3}\)

1 \(l\) = 1000 m\(l\)

= 1000 cm\({}^{3}\)Example 6

Convert 2000 cm\({}^{3}\) to m\({}^{3}\).

Solution

Since 1 000 000 cm\({}^{3}\) = 1 m\({}^{3}\),

2000 cm\({}^{3}\) = \(\frac{2000}{1\ 000\ 000}\)

= 0.002 cm\({}^{3}\)

9. Mass:

1 kg = 1000 g

1 g = 1000 mg

1 tonne = 1000 kg

Example 7

Convert 50 mg to kg.

Solution

Since 1000 mg = 1 g,

50 mg = \(\frac{50}{1000}\) g (Convert to g first)

= 0.05 g

Since 1000 g = 1 kg,

0.05 g = \(\frac{0.05}{1000}\) kg

= 0.000 05 kg

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:34]

Example 1

How many squares are there on a \(8\times 8\) chess board?

Solution

A chess board is made up of \(8\times 8\) squares.

We can solve the problem by reducing it to a simpler problem.

There is 1 square in a

1 \(\times\) 1 square.

There are 4 + 1 squares in a

2 \(\times\) 2 square.

There are \(9+4+1\) squares in a

3 \(\times\) 3 square.

There are \(16+9+4+1\) squares in a

4 \(\times\) 4 square.

Study the pattern in the table.

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|} \hline Size of square & Number of squares \\ \hline \(1\times 1\) & \(1=1^{2}\) \\ \hline \(2\times 2\) & \(4+1=2^{2}+1^{2}\) \\ \hline \(3\times 3\) & \(9+4+1=3^{2}+2^{2}+1^{2}\) \\ \hline \(4\times 4\) & \(16+9+4+1=4^{2}+3^{2}+2^{2}+1^{2}\) \\ \hline \(\vdots\) & \(\vdots\) \\ \hline \(8\times 8\) & \(8^{2}+7^{2}+6^{2}+...+1^{2}\) \\ \hline \end{tabular}

\(\therefore\) The chess board has \(8^{2}+7^{2}+6^{2}+...+1^{2}=204\) squares.

\begin{tabular}{l} \end{tabular}

We can solve this problem by drawing a diagram.

Draw a square of side 1 unit and let its area, i.e. 1 unit\({}^{2}\), represent the first number in the pattern. Do the same for the rest of the numbers in the pattern by drawing another square and dividing it into the fractions accordingly.

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|} \hline  & & \(\frac{1}{4}\) \\ \hline \(1\) & \(\frac{1}{2}\) & & \\ \hline \(\frac{1}{8}\) & \(\frac{1}{16}\) \\ \hline \end{tabular}

From the diagram, we can see that \(1+\frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{4}+\frac{1}{8}+\frac{1}{16}+...\) is the total area of

the two squares, i.e. 2 units\({}^{2}\).

\(\therefore\) \(1+\frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{4}+\frac{1}{8}+\frac{1}{16}+...=2\)Number patterns may have a combination of common difference and common ratio. e.g. This sequence involves both a common difference and a common ratio. \(\begin{array}{c}\includegraphics[width=14.226378pt, width=14.226378pt]{ \(2,\ 5,\ 10,\ 13,\ 26,\ 29\...}\) \\ \end{array}\)
6. Number patterns may involve other sequences. e.g. This number pattern involves the Fibonacci sequence. \(\begin{array}{c}\includegraphics[width=14.226378pt, width=14.226378pt]{ \(0,\ 1,\ 1,\ 2,\ 3,\ 5,\ 8,\ 13\,\ 21\,\ 34\,\ \ \ldots}\) \\ \end{array}\)

The first five terms of a number pattern are 4, 7, 10, 13 and 16.

**(a)**: What is the next term?
**(b)**: Write down the \(n\)th term of the sequence.

\(\begin{array}{c}\includegraphics[width=14.226378pt, width=14.226378pt]{ \(a)}\) & 19 (b) \(3n+1\) \\ \end{array}\)

Example 4: (a) Write down the \(4^{\text{th}}\) term in the sequence

2, 5, 10, 17,...

(b) Write down an expression, in terms of \(n\), for the \(n^{\text{th}}\) term in the sequence.

Solution

**(a)**: \(4^{\text{th}}\) term = 26

Addition and Subtraction of Fractions

8. To add or subtract algebraic fractions, we have to convert all the denominators to a common denominator.

Example 7

Express each of the following as a single fraction.

**(a)**: \(\frac{x}{3}+\frac{y}{5}\)
**(b)**: \(\frac{3}{ab^{3}}+\frac{5}{a^{2}b}\)
**(c)**: \(\frac{3}{x-y}+\frac{5}{y-x}\)
**(d)**: \(\frac{6}{x^{2}-9}+\frac{3}{x-3}\)

Solution
**(a)**: \(\frac{x}{3}+\frac{y}{5}=\frac{5x}{15}+\frac{3y}{15}\)  (Common denominator = 15)

\[=\frac{5x+3y}{15}\] (b) \(\frac{3}{ab^{3}}+\frac{5}{a^{2}b}=\frac{3a}{a^{2}b^{3}}+\frac{5b^{2}}{a^{2}b ^{3}}\)  (Common denominator = \(a^{2}b^{3}\))

\[=\frac{3a+5b^{2}}{a^{2}b^{3}}\] (c) \(\frac{3}{x-y}+\frac{5}{y-x}=\frac{3}{x-y}-\frac{5}{x-y}\)  (Common denominator = \(x-y\))

\[=\frac{3-5}{x-y}\] (d) \(\frac{6}{x^{2}-9}+\frac{3}{x-3}=\frac{6}{(x+3)(x-3)}+\frac{3}{x-3}\)

\[=\frac{6+3(x+3)}{(x+3)(x-3)}\] (Common denominator = \((x+3)(x-3)\))

\[=\frac{6+3x+9}{(x+3)(x-3)}\] \[=\frac{3x+15}{(x+3)(x-3)}\]Example 8

\[\begin{array}{l}\mbox{Solve }\frac{4}{3b-6}\,+\,\frac{5}{4b-8}\,=\,2. \end{array}\]

Solution

\[\begin{array}{l}\frac{4}{3b-6}\,+\,\frac{5}{4b-8}\,=2\quad\mbox{ (Common denominator }=12(b-2))\\ \frac{4}{3(b-2)}\,+\,\frac{5}{4(b-2)}\,=2\\ \frac{4(4)+5(3)}{12(b-2)}\,=2\\ \frac{31}{12(b-2)}\,=2\\ 31\,=24(b-2)\\ 24b\,=31+48\\ b\,=\,\frac{79}{24}\\ =3\frac{7}{24}\end{array}\]

Multiplication and Division of Fractions

9. To multiply algebraic fractions, we have to factorise the expression before cancelling the common terms. To divide algebraic fractions, we have to invert the divisor and change the sign from \(+\) to \(\times\).

Example 9

Simplify.

**(a)**: \(\frac{x+y}{3x-3y}\,\times\,\frac{2x-2y}{5x+5y}\)

**(b)**: \(\frac{6p^{3}}{7qr}\,\div\,\frac{12\,p}{21q^{2}}\)

**(c)**: \(\frac{x+y}{2x-y}\,\div\,\frac{2x+2y}{4x-2y}\)

Linear Graphs

**1.** The equation of a straight line is given by \(y=mx+c\), where \(m=\) gradient of the straight line and \(c=y\)-intercept.

**2.** The gradient of the line (usually represented by \(m\)) is given as

\(m=\frac{\mbox{vertical change}}{\mbox{horizontal change}}\) or \(\frac{\mbox{rise}}{\mbox{run}}\).

Find the \(m\) (gradient), \(c\) (y-intercept) and equations of the following lines.

For Line \(A\):

The line cuts the \(y\)-axis at \(y=3\). \(\therefore c=3\).

Since Line \(A\) is a horizontal line, the vertical change \(=0\). \(\therefore\)\(m=0\).

For Line \(B\):

The line cuts the \(y\)-axis at \(y=0\). \(\therefore\)\(c=0\).

Vertical change \(=1\), horizontal change \(=1\).

\(\therefore\)\(m=\frac{1}{1}=1\)

For Line \(C\):

The line cuts the \(y\)-axis at \(y=2\). \(\therefore\)\(c=2\).

Vertical change \(=2\), horizontal change \(=4\).

\(\therefore\)\(m=\frac{2}{4}=\frac{1}{2}\)

For Line \(D\):

The line cuts the \(y\)-axis at \(y=1\). \(\therefore\)\(c=1\).

Vertical change \(=1\), horizontal change \(=-2\).

Quadratic Formula

1. To solve the quadratic equation \(ax^{2}+bx+c=0\), where \(a\neq 0\), use the formula

\[x=\frac{-b\pm\sqrt{b^{2}-4ac}}{2a}\.\]

Solve the equation \(3x^{2}-3x-2=0\).

Solution

Determine the values of \(a,b\) and \(c\).

\(a=3\), \(b=-3\), \(c=-2\)

\[x = \frac{-(-3)\pm\sqrt{(-3)^{2}-4(3)(-2)}}{2(3)}\] \[= \frac{3\pm\sqrt{9-(-24)}}{6}\] \[= \frac{3\pm\sqrt{33}}{6}\] \[= 1.46\text{ or }-0.457\text{ (to 3 s. f.)}\]Example 2: Using the quadratic formula, solve the equation \(5x^{2}+9x-4=0\).

Solution

In \(5x^{2}+9x-4=0\), \(a=5\), \(b=9\), \(c=-4\).

\(x=\dfrac{-9\pm\sqrt{9^{2}-4(5)(-4)}}{2(5)}\)

\(=\dfrac{-9\pm\sqrt{161}}{10}\)

\(=0.369\) or \(-2.17\) (to \(3\) s.f.)

Example 3: Solve the equation \(6x^{2}+3x-8=0\).

Solution

In \(6x^{2}+3x-8=0\), \(a=6\), \(b=3\), \(c=-8\).

\(x=\dfrac{-3\pm\sqrt{3^{2}-4(6)(-8)}}{2(6)}\)

\(=\dfrac{-3\pm\sqrt{201}}{12}\)

\(=0.931\) or \(-1.43\) (to \(3\) s.f.)Example 4:

Solve the equation \(\ \frac{1}{x+8}\ +\ \frac{3}{x-6}\ =10\).

Solution

\[\frac{1}{x+8}\ +\ \frac{3}{x-6} = 10\] \[\frac{(x-6)+3(x+8)}{(x+8)(x-6)} = 10\] \[\frac{x-6+3x+24}{(x+8)(x-6)} = 10\] \[\frac{4x+18}{(x+8)(x-6)} = 10\] \[4x+18 = 10(x+8)(x-6)\] \[4x+18 = 10(x^{2}+2x-48)\] \[2x+9 = 10x^{2}+20x-480\] \[2x+9 = 5(x^{2}+2x-48)\] \[2x+9 = 5x^{2}+10x-240\] \[5x^{2}+8x-249 = 0\] \[x = \frac{-8\pm\sqrt{8^{2}-4(5)(-249)}}{2(5)}\] \[= \frac{-8\pm\sqrt{5044}}{10}\] \[= 6.30\ \text{or}\ -7.90\ (\text{to}\ 3\ \text{s.f.})\]Example 5: A cuboid has a total surface area of 250 cm\({}^{2}\). Its width is 1 cm shorter than its length, and its height is 3 cm longer than the length. What is the length of the cuboid?

Solution

Let \(x\) represent the length of the cuboid.

Let \(x-1\) represent the width of the cuboid.

Let \(x+3\) represent the height of the cuboid.

Total surface area \(=2(x)(x+3)+2(x)(x-1)+2(x+3)(x-1)\)

\(250\) \(=2(x^{2}+3x)+2(x^{2}-x)+2(x^{2}+2x-3)\) (Divide the equation by 2)

\(125\) \(=x^{2}+3x+x^{2}-x+x^{2}+2x-3\)

\(3x^{2}+4x-128\) \(=0\)

\(x\) \(=\)\(\frac{-4\pm\sqrt{4^{2}-4(3)(-128)}}{2(3)}\)

\(=5.90\) (to 3 s.f.) or \(-7.23\) (rejected) (Reject \(-7.23\) since the length cannot be less than 0)

\(\therefore\) The length of the cuboid is 5.90 cm.

Completing the Square

**2.**: To solve the quadratic equation \(ax^{2}+bx+c=0\), where \(a\neq 0\):

**Step 1:**: Change the coefficient of \(x^{2}\) to 1,

i.e. \(x^{2}+\frac{b}{a}\,x+\frac{c}{a}=0\)

**Step 2:**: Bring \(\frac{c}{a}\) to the right side of the equation,

i.e. \(x^{2}+\frac{b}{a}\,x=-\frac{c}{a}\)

**Step 3:**: Divide the coefficient of \(x\) by 2 and add the square of the result to both sides of the equation,

i.e. \(x^{2}+\frac{b}{a}\,x+\left(\frac{b}{2a}\right)^{2}=-\frac{c}{a}\,+\left(\frac{ b}{2a}\right)^{2}\)

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:61]

Example 7: Using the method of completing the square, solve the equation \(2x^{2}+x-6=0\).

Solution

\[2x^{2}+x-6 = 0\] \[x^{2}+\frac{1}{2}x-3 = 0\] \[x^{2}+\frac{1}{2}x = 3\] \[x^{2}+\frac{1}{2}x+\left(\frac{1}{4}\right)^{2} = 3+\left(\frac{1}{4}\right)^{2}\] \[\left(x+\frac{1}{4}\right)^{2} = \frac{49}{16}\] \[x+\frac{1}{4} = \pm\frac{7}{4}\] \[x = -\frac{1}{4}\,\pm\,\frac{7}{4}\] \[= 1.5\text{ or }-2\]

Example 8: Solve the equation \(2x^{2}-8x-24\) by completing the square.

Solution

\[2x^{2}-8x-24 = 0\] \[x^{2}-4x-12 = 0\] \[x^{2}-2(2)x+2^{2} = 12+2^{2}\] \[(x-2)^{2} = 16\] \[x-2 = \pm 4\] \[x = 6\text{ or }-2\]Solving Simultaneous Equations
* 3. Elimination method is used by making the coefficient of one of the variables in the two equations the same. Either add or subtract to form a single linear equation of only one unknown variable.

Substitute \(x=4\) into (2):

\(4(4)+3y=1\)

\(16+3y=1\)

\(3y=-15\)

\(y=-5\)

\(\therefore x=4\), \(y=-5\)

* 5. To solve an inequality, we multiply or divide both sides by a positive number without having to reverse the inequality sign, i.e. if \(x\geq y\) and \(c>0\), then \(cx\geq cy\) and \(\,\frac{x}{c}\,\,\geq\,\frac{y}{c}\) and if \(x>y\) and \(c>0\), then \(cx>cy\) and \(\,\frac{x}{c}\,\,>\,\frac{y}{c}\,\).
* 6. To solve an inequality, we reverse the inequality sign if we multiply or divide both sides by a negative number, i.e. if \(x\geq y\) and \(d<0\), then \(dx\leq dy\) and \(\,\frac{x}{d}\,\,\leq\,\frac{y}{d}\) and if \(x>y\) and \(d<0\), then \(dx<dy\) and \(\,\frac{x}{d}\,\,<\,\frac{y}{d}\,\).

## Appendix A Applications of Mathematics

In Practice Students

### Hire Purchase

1. Expensive items may be paid through hire purchase, where the full cost is paid over a given period of time. The hire purchase price is usually greater than the actual cost of the item. Hire purchase price comprises an initial deposit and regular instalments. Interest is charged along with these instalments.

### Example 1

A sofa set costs $4800 and can be bought under a hire purchase plan. A 15% deposit is required and the remaining amount is to be paid in 24 monthly instalments at a simple interest rate of 3% per annum. Find

**(i)**: the amount to be paid in instalment per month,
**(ii)**: the percentage difference in the hire purchase price and the cash price.

### S0|Uition\(\cap\)

**(i)**: Deposit = \(\frac{15}{100}\times\$4800\)

= $720

Remaining amount = $4800 - $720

= $4080

Amount of interest to be paid in 2 years = \(\frac{3}{100}\times\$4080\times 2\) (24 months

= $244.80 = 2 years)

Total amount to be paid in monthly instalments = $4080 + $244.80

= $4324.80

Amount to be paid in instalment per month = $4324.80 \(\div\) 24

= $180.20

$180.20 has to be paid in instalment per month.

**(ii)**: Hire purchase price \(=\) $720 + $4324.80

\[=\$5044.80\]

Percentage difference \(=\)\(\dfrac{\text{Hire purchase price}-\text{Cash price}}{\text{Cash price}}\)\(\times\) 100%

\[=\dfrac{5044.80-4800}{4800}\times 100\%\]

\(=5.1\%\)

\(\therefore\) The percentage difference in the hire purchase price and cash price is 5.1%.

### Simple Interest

**2.**: To calculate simple interest, we use the formula

\[I\,=\,\dfrac{PRT}{100},\]

where \(I\,=\,\text{simple interest}\),

\[P\,=\,\text{principal amount},\]

\[R\,=\,\text{rate of interest per}\,\text{annum},\]

\(T\,=\,\text{period of time in years}\).

### Example 2

A sum of $500 was invested in an account which pays simple interest per annum. After 4 years, the amount of money increased to $550. Calculate the interest rate per annum.

### Solutiion

\(\dfrac{500(R)4}{100}=50\)

\(R=2.5\)

The interest rate per annum is 2.5%.

Compound Interest
* 3. Compound interest is the interest accumulated over a given period of time at a given rate when each successive interest payment is added to the principal amount.
* 4. To calculate compound interest, we use the formula \(A=P\bigg{(}1+\frac{R}{100}\bigg{)}^{n}\), where \(A=\text{total amount after $n$ units of time}\), \(P=\text{principal amount}\), \(R=\text{rate of interest per unit time}\), \(n=\text{number of units of time}\).

Yvonne deposits $5000 in a bank account which pays 4% per annum compound interest. Calculate the total interest earned in 5 years, correct to the nearest dollar.

Solution Interest earned \(=P\bigg{(}1+\frac{R}{100}\bigg{)}^{n}-P\) \(=5000\bigg{(}1+\frac{4}{100}\bigg{)}^{5}-5000\) \(=\$1083\)Brian wants to place $10 000 into a fixed deposit account for 3 years. Bank \(X\) offers a simple interest rate of 1.2% per annum and Bank \(Y\) offers an interest rate of 1.1% compounded annually. Which bank should Brian choose to yield a better interest?

Solution

Interest offered by Bank \(X\): \(I=\frac{PRT}{100}\)

\(=\frac{(10\ 000)(1.2)(3)}{100}\)

\(=\$360\)

Interest offered by Bank \(Y\): \(I=P\bigg{(}1+\frac{R}{100}\bigg{)}^{n}-P\)

\(=10\ 000\bigg{(}1+\frac{1.1}{100}\bigg{)}^{3}-10\ 000\)

\(=\$333.64\) (to 2 d.p.)

\(\therefore\). Brian should choose Bank \(X\).

Money Exchange

5. To change local currency to foreign currency, a given unit of the local currency is multiplied by the exchange rate.

e.g. To change Singapore dollars to foreign currency,

Foreign currency = Singapore dollars \(\times\) Exchange rate

Example 5

Mr Lim exchanged S$800 for Australian dollars. Given S$1 = A$0.9611, how much did he receive in Australian dollars?

Solution

800 \(\times\) 0.9611 = 768.88

Mr Lim received A$768.88.

Applications of Mathematics in Practical SituationsExample 6: A tourist wanted to change S$500 into Japanese Yen. The exchange rate at that time was Y100 = S$1.0918. How much will he receive in Japanese Yen? Solution \(\frac{500}{1.0918}\times 100=45\) 795.933 \(\approx 45\) 795.93 (Always leave answers involving money to the nearest cent unless stated otherwise) He will receive Y45 795.93.
6. To convert foreign currency to local currency, a given unit of the foreign currency is divided by the exchange rate. e.g. To change foreign currency to Singapore dollars, Singapore dollars = Foreign currency Exchange rate

Example 7: Sarah buys a dress in Thailand for 200 Baht. Given that S$1 = 25 Thai baht, how much does the dress cost in Singapore dollars? Solution \(200\div 25=8\) The dress costs S$8.

### Distance-Time Graphs

9. The gradient of a distance-time graph gives the speed of the object.

10. A straight line indicates motion with uniform speed.

A curve indicates motion with varying speed.

A straight line parallel to the time-axis indicates that the object is stationary.

11. Average speed = \(\frac{\text{Total distance travelled}}{\text{Total time taken}}\)
Example 9: The following diagram shows the distance-time graph for the journey of a motorcyclist.

Distance (km)

**(a)**: What was the distance covered in the first hour?
**(b)**: Find the speed in km/h during the last part of the journey.

Solution
**(a)**: Distance = 40 km
**(b)**: Speed = \(\frac{100-40}{1}\)

= 60 km/h12. The gradient of a speed-time graph gives the acceleration of the object.
13. A straight line indicates motion with uniform acceleration. A curve indicates motion with varying acceleration. A straight line parallel to the time-axis indicates that the object is moving with uniform speed.
14. Total distance covered in a given time = Area under the graph

Definitions

1. A set is a collection of objects such as letters of the alphabet, people, etc. The objects in a set are called members or elements of that set.
2. A finite set is a set which contains a countable number of elements.
3. An infinite set is a set which contains an uncountable number of elements.
4. A universal set \(\xi\) is a set which contains all the available elements.
5. The empty set \(\O\) or null set \(\{\}\) is a set which contains no elements.

Specifications of Sets

6. A set may be specified by listing all its members. This is only for finite sets. We list names of elements of a set, separate them by commas and enclose them in brackets, e.g. \(\{2,3,5,7\}\).
7. A set may be specified by stating a property of its elements, e.g. \(\{x.\,x\) is an even number greater than \(3\}\).

A set may be specified by the use of a Venn diagram.

e.g.

For example, the Venn diagram above represents

\(\xi=\{\)students in the class\(\}\),

\(P=\{\)students who study Physics\(\}\),

\(C=\{\)students who study Chemistry\(\}\).

From the Venn diagram,

10 students study Physics only,

14 students study Chemistry only,

11 students study both Physics and Chemistry,

5 students do not study either Physics or Chemistry.

Elements of a Set

\(\mathbf{9.}\)\(\mathbf{a}\in Q\) means that a is an element of \(Q\).

\(\mathbf{b}\notin Q\) means that b is not an element of \(Q\).

\(\mathbf{10.}\)\(\mathbf{n}(A)\) denotes the number of elements in set \(A\).

Example 1

\(\xi=\{x\colon x\) is an integer such that \(1\leq x\leq 15\}\)

\(P=\{x\colon x\) is a prime number\(\}\),

\(Q=\{x\colon x\) is divisible by \(2\}\),

\(R=\{x\colon x\) is a multiple of \(3\}\).

**(a)**: List the elements in \(P\) and \(R\).

\(R=\{3,6,9,12,15\}\)

**(b)**: \(Q=\{2,4,6,8,10,12,14\}\)

\(\mathbf{n}(Q)=7\)Equal Sets

**11.**: If two sets contain the exact same elements, we say that the two sets are equal sets. For example, if \(A=\{1,2,3\}\), \(B=\{3,1,2\}\) and \(C=\{\text{a},\text{b},\text{c}\}\), then \(A\) and \(B\) are equal sets but \(A\) and \(C\) are not equal sets.

Subsets

**12.**: \(A\subseteq B\) means that \(A\) is a subset of \(B\). Every element of set \(A\) is also an element of set \(B\).
**13.**: \(A\subset B\) means that \(A\) is a proper subset of \(B\). Every element of set \(A\) is also an element of set \(B\), but \(A\) cannot be equal to \(B\).
**14.**: \(A\not\subseteq B\) means \(A\) is not a subset of \(B\).
**15.**: \(A\not\subseteq B\) means \(A\) is not a proper subset of \(B\).

Complement Sets

**16.**: \(A^{\prime}\) denotes the complement of a set \(A\) relative to a universal set \(\xi\). It is the set of all elements in \(\xi\) except those in \(A\).

The shaded region in the diagram shows \(A^{\prime}\).

Union of Two Sets

**17.**: The union of two sets \(A\) and \(B\), denoted as \(A\cup B\), is the set of elements which belong to set \(A\) or set \(B\) or both.

The shaded region in the diagram shows \(A\cup B\).

Set Language and NotationIntersection of Two Sets

18. The intersection of two sets \(A\) and \(B\), denoted as \(A\cap B\), is the set of elements which belong to both set \(A\) and set \(B\).

18. Matrices can only be added or subtracted if they are of the same order.

19. If there are two matrices \(\mathbf{A}\) and \(\mathbf{B}\), both of order \(r\times c\), then the addition of \(\mathbf{A}\) and \(\mathbf{B}\) is the addition of each element of \(\mathbf{A}\) with its corresponding element of \(\mathbf{B}\), i.e. \(\left(\begin{array}{c}a\\ b\end{array}\right)+\left(\begin{array}{c}c\\ d\end{array}\right)=\left(\begin{array}{c}a+c\\ b+d\end{array}\right)\)

\[\text{and}\left(\begin{array}{cc}a&b\\ c&d\end{array}\right)-\left(\begin{array}{cc}e&f\\ g&h\end{array}\right)=\left(\begin{array}{cc}a-e&b-f\\ c-g&d-h\end{array}\right).\]

Similar Triangles

5. Two figures or objects are similar if:

**(a)**: the corresponding sides are proportional and,
**(b)**: the corresponding angles are equal.

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:111]

Scale Factor and Enlargement
* Scale factor = Length of image Length of object
* We multiply the distance between each point in an object by a scale factor to produce an image. When the scale factor is greater than 1, the image produced is greater than the object. When the scale factor is between 0 and 1, the image produced is smaller than the object. e.g. Taking \(\Delta PQR\) as the object and \(\Delta P^{\prime}Q^{\prime}R^{\prime}\) as the image, \(\Delta P^{\prime}Q^{\prime}R^{\prime}\) is an enlargement of \(\Delta PQR\) with a scale factor of 3.
* Scale factor = \(\frac{P^{\prime}R^{\prime}}{PR}\) = \(\frac{R^{\prime}Q^{\prime}}{RQ}\) = 3 If we take \(\Delta P^{\prime}Q^{\prime}R^{\prime}\) as the object and \(\Delta PQR\) as the image, \(\Delta PQR\) is an enlargement of \(\Delta P^{\prime}Q^{\prime}R^{\prime}\) with a scale factor of \(\frac{1}{3}\). Scale factor = \(\frac{PR}{P^{\prime}R^{\prime}}\) = \(\frac{RQ}{R^{\prime}Q^{\prime}}\) = \(\frac{1}{3}\)

Similar Plane Figures
* The ratio of the corresponding sides of two similar figures is \(l_{1}:l_{2}\). The ratio of the area of the two figures is then \(\,l_{1}^{2}:\,l_{2}^{2}\). e.g. \(\Delta ABC\) is similar to \(\Delta PQ\). \(\frac{AB}{AP}\) = \(\frac{AC}{AQ}\) = \(\frac{BC}{PQ}\) \(\frac{\text{Area of }\Delta ABC}{\text{Area of }\Delta APQ}\) = \(\frac{\left(\frac{AB}{AP}\right)^{2}}{\text{Area of }\Delta PQ}\) = \(\frac{\left(\frac{AC}{AQ}\right)^{2}}{\text{Area of }\Delta PQ}\) = \(\frac{\left(\frac{AC}{AQ}\right)^{2}}{\text{Area of }\Delta PQ}\) = \(\frac{\left(\frac{AC}{AQ}\right)^{2}}{\text{Area of }\Delta PQ}\) = \(\frac{\left(\frac{BC}{PQ}\right)^{2}}{\text{Area of }\Delta PQ}\) = \(\frac{\left(\frac{AB}{AP}\right)^{2}}{\text{Area of }\Delta PQ}\) = \(\frac{\left(\frac{AC}{AQ}\right)^{2}}{\text{Area of }\Delta PQ}\) =In the figure, \(NM\) is parallel to \(BC\) and \(LN\) is parallel to \(CA\).

**(iii)**: \(\dfrac{\text{Area of }\Delta ANM}{\text{Area of }\Delta ABC} = \left(\dfrac{NM}{BC}\right)^{2}\)

\[= \left(\dfrac{2}{5}\right)^{2}\] \[= \dfrac{4}{25}\] \[\dfrac{\text{Area of trapezium }BNMC}{\text{Area of }\Delta ABC} = \dfrac{\text{Area of }\Delta ABC-\text{Area of }\Delta ANM}{\text{Area of }\Delta ABC}\] \[= \dfrac{25-4}{25}\] \[= \dfrac{21}{25}\]

Cosine Rule

**9.** In any \(\Delta ABC\), the Cosine Rule states that \(a^{2}=b^{2}+c^{2}-2bc\,\cos\,A\)

\(b^{2}=a^{2}+c^{2}-2ac\,\cos\,B\)

\(c^{2}=a^{2}+b^{2}-2ab\,\cos\,C\)

or \(\cos\,A=\frac{b^{2}+c^{2}-a^{2}}{2bc}\)

\(\cos\,B=\frac{a^{2}+c^{2}-b^{2}}{2ac}\)

\(\cos\,C=\frac{a^{2}+b^{2}-c^{2}}{2ab}\).

Find

**(i)**: \(A\widehat{C}B\),
**(ii)**: the angle of elevation of \(T\) from \(A\).

Solution
**(i)**: Using cosine rule,

\[AB^{2} = AC^{2}+BC^{2}-2(AC)(BC)\ \text{cos}\ A\widehat{C}B\] \[65^{2} = 60^{2}+50^{2}-2(60)(50)\ \text{cos}\ A\widehat{C}B\] \[\text{cos}\ A\widehat{C}B = \frac{1875}{6000}\] \[A\widehat{C}B = 71.8^{\circ}\ \text{(to 1 d.p.)}\]
**(ii)**: In \(\Delta ATC\),

\[\tan\ T\widehat{A}C=\frac{30}{60}\]

\[T\widehat{A}C=26.6^{\circ}\ \text{(to 1 d.p.)}\]

Substitute \(x=3\) and \(y=-3\):

\[-3=-4+c\]

\[c=1\]

\[\therefore\]

Equation of line: \(y\,\,-\dfrac{4}{3}\,x+1\)

Key: 4 | 0 means 40 customersBack-to-Back Stem-and-Leaf Diagram
6. If we have two sets of data, we can use a back-to-back stem-and-leaf diagram with a common stem to represent the data. e.g. The scores for a quiz of two classes are shown in the table.

\begin{tabular}{|c|c c c c c c c c c c|} \hline
**Class \(A\)** & 55 & 98 & 67 & 84 & 85 & 92 & 75 & 78 & 89 & 64 \\  & 72 & 60 & 86 & 91 & 97 & 58 & 63 & 86 & 92 & 74 \\ \hline
**Class \(B\)** & 56 & 67 & 92 & 50 & 64 & 83 & 84 & 67 & 90 & 83 \\  & 68 & 75 & 81 & 93 & 99 & 76 & 87 & 80 & 64 & 58 \\ \hline \end{tabular}

A back-to-back stem-and-leaf diagram can be constructed based on the given data.

\begin{tabular}{|c c c c c|c|c c c c c c|} \hline \multicolumn{1}{c}{**Leaves for Class \(B\)**} & \multicolumn{3}{c|}{**Stem**} & \multicolumn{3}{c|}{**Leaves for Class \(A\)**} \\ \hline  & & 8 & 6 & 0 & 5 & 5 & 8 & & & \\ \hline
8 & 7 & 7 & 4 & 4 & 6 & 0 & 3 & 4 & 7 & \\ \hline  & & & 6 & 5 & 7 & 2 & 4 & 5 & 8 & \\ \hline
7 & 4 & 3 & 3 & 1 & 0 & 8 & 4 & 5 & 6 & 6 & 9 \\ \hline  & & 9 & 3 & 2 & 0 & 9 & 1 & 2 & 2 & 7 & 8 \\ \end{tabular}

Key: 58 means 58 marks

Note that the leaves for Class \(B\) are arranged in ascending order from the right to the left.

Measures of Central Tendency
7. The three common measures of central tendency are the mean, median and mode.

Mean
8. The mean of a set of \(n\) numbers \(x_{1},x_{2},x_{3},\,\ldots,x_{n}\) is denoted by \(\overleftarrow{x}\).

9. For ungrouped data, \(\overline{x}\ =\ \frac{x_{1}+x_{2}+x_{3}+...+x_{n}}{n}\ =\ \frac{\sum x}{n}\).

10. For grouped data, \(\overline{x}\ =\ \frac{\sum fx}{\sum f}\) where \(f\) is the frequency of data in each class interval and \(x\) is the mid-value of the interval.

Median
* The median is the value of the middle term of a set of numbers arranged in ascending order. Given a set of \(n\) terms, if \(n\) is odd, the median is the \(\left(\dfrac{n+1}{2}\right)^{\text{th}}\) term; if \(n\) is even, the median is the average of the two middle terms. e.g. Given the set of data: \(5,6,7,8,9\). There is an odd number of data. Hence, median is \(7\). e.g. Given a set of data \(5,6,7,8\). There is an even number of data. Hence, median is \(6.5\).

The table records the number of mistakes made by \(60\) students during an exam.

\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|c|c|c|} \hline
**Number of students** & \(24\) & \(x\) & \(13\) & \(y\) & \(5\) \\ \hline
**Number of mistakes** & \(5\) & \(6\) & \(7\) & \(8\) & \(9\) \\ \hline \end{tabular}

* Show that \(x+y=18\).
* Find an equation of the mean, given that the mean number of mistakes made is \(6.3\). Hence, find the values of \(x\) and \(y\).
* State the median number of mistakes made.

Solution
* Since there are \(60\) students in total, \(24+x+13+y+5=60\) \(x+y+42=60\) \(x+y=18\)

**(b)**: Since the mean number of mistakes made is 6.3,

\[\text{Mean}=\frac{\text{Total number of mistakes made by 60 students}}{\text{Number of students}}\]

\[6.3=\frac{24(5)+6x+13(7)+8y+5(9)}{60}\]

\[6.3(60)=120+6x+91+8y+45\]

\[378=256+6x+8y\]

\[6x+8y=122\]

\[3x+4y=61\]

To find the values of \(x\) and \(y\), solve the pair of simultaneous equations obtained above.

\(x+y=18\) -- (1)

\(3x+4y=61\) -- (2)

\(3\times(1)\):

\(3x+3y=54\) -- (3)

(2) - (3): \(y=7\)

When \(y=7\), \(x=11\).
**(c)**: Since there are 60 students, the 30\({}^{\text{th}}\) and 31\({}^{\text{st}}\) students are in the middle. The 30\({}^{\text{th}}\) and 31\({}^{\text{st}}\) students make 6 mistakes each. Therefore, the median number of mistakes made is 6.

### Mode

**12.**: The mode of a set of numbers is the number with the highest frequency.
**13.**: If a set of data has two values which occur the most number of times, we say that the distribution is bimodal.

e.g. Given a set of data: \(5,6,6,6,7,7,8,8,9\).

6 occurs the most number of times.

Hence, the mode is 6.

Standard Deviation

**14.**: The standard deviation, \(s\), measures the spread of a set of data from its mean.

**15.**: For ungrouped data,

\[s=\sqrt{\frac{\sum(x-\overline{x})^{2}}{n}}\qquad\text{or}\quad s=\sqrt{\frac{ \sum x^{2}}{n}-\overline{x}^{2}}\]
**16.**: For grouped data,

\[s=\sqrt{\frac{\sum f(x-\overline{x})^{2}}{\sum f}}\quad\text{or}\quad s=\sqrt{ \frac{\sum fx^{2}}{\sum f}-\left(\frac{\sum fx}{\sum f}\right)^{2}}\]

The following set of data shows the number of books borrowed by 20 children during their visit to the library.

\[\boxed{0,2,4,3,1,1,2,0,3,1}\]

Calculate the standard deviation.

Solution

Represent the set of data in the table below.

\[\boxed{\text{\bf Number of books borrowed}}\quad 0\quad\text{1}\quad\text{2}\quad\text{3} \quad\text{4}\]

\[\boxed{\text{\bf Number of children}}\quad 2\quad\text{7}\quad\text{7}\quad\text{3} \quad\text{1}\]

Standard deviation

\[=\sqrt{\frac{\sum fx^{2}-\left(\frac{\sum fx}{\sum f}\right)^{2}} {20}}\] \[=\sqrt{\frac{0^{2}(2)+1^{2}(7)+2^{2}(7)+3^{2}(3)+4^{2}(1)}{20}- \left(\frac{0(2)+1(7)+2(7)+3(3)+4(1)}{20}\right)^{2}}\] \[=\sqrt{\frac{78}{20}-\left(\frac{34}{20}\right)^{2}}\] \[=1.00\text{ (to 3 s.f.)}\]The mass, in grams, of 80 stones are given in the table.

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|} \hline
**Mass (\(m\)) in grams** & **Frequency** \\ \hline \(20<m\leq 30\) & 20 \\ \hline \(30<m\leq 40\) & 30 \\ \hline \(40<m\leq 50\) & 20 \\ \hline \(50<m\leq 60\) & 10 \\ \hline \end{tabular} Find the mean and the standard deviation of the above distribution.

Solution

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|} \hline

## 17 The following figure shows a cumulative frequency curve.

18. \(\mathrm{Q}_{1}\) is called the lower quartile or the 25\({}^{\mathrm{th}}\) percentile.
19. \(\mathrm{Q}_{2}\) is called the median or the 50\({}^{\mathrm{th}}\) percentile.
20. \(\mathrm{Q}_{3}\) is called the upper quartile or the 75\({}^{\mathrm{th}}\) percentile.
21. \(\mathrm{Q}_{3}-\mathrm{Q}_{1}\) is called the interquartile range.

The exam results of 40 students were recorded in the frequency table below.

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|} \hline
**Mass (\(m\)) in grams** & **Frequency** \\ \hline \(0<m\leq 20\) & 2 \\ \hline \(20<m\leq 40\) & 4 \\ \hline \(40<m\leq 60\) & 8 \\ \hline \(60<m\leq 80\) & 14 \\ \hline \(80<m\leq 100\) & 12 \\ \hline \end{tabular} Construct a cumulative frequency table and the draw a cumulative frequency curve. Hence, find the interquartile range.

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|} \hline
**Mass (\(m\)) in grams** & **Cumulative Frequency** \\ \hline \(x\)\(\leq\) 20 & 2 \\ \hline \(x\)\(\leq\) 40 & 6 \\ \hline \(x\)\(\leq\) 60 & 14 \\ \hline \(x\)\(\leq\) 80 & 28 \\ \hline \(x\)\(\leq\) 100 & 40 \\ \hline \end{tabular}

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:172]

1. Probability is a measure of chance.
2. A sample space is the collection of all the possible outcomes of a probability experiment.

A fair six-sided die is rolled. Write down the sample space and state the total number of possible outcomes.

\(\mathsf{Solution}\)

A die has the numbers \(1,2,3,4,5\) and \(6\) on its faces,

i.e. the sample space consists of the numbers \(1,2,3,4,5\) and \(6\).

Total number of possible outcomes = 6

3. In a probability experiment with \(m\) equally likely outcomes, if \(k\) of these outcomes favour the occurrence of an event \(E\), then the probability, \(\mathrm{P}(E)\), of the event happening is given by

\[\mathrm{P}(E)=\,\frac{\mathrm{Number\ of\ favourable\ outcomes\ for\ event\ }E}{\mathrm{Total\ number\ of\ possible\ outcomes}}\,=\,\frac{k}{m}\,.\]Example 2: A card is drawn at random from a standard pack of 52 playing cards.

Find the probability of drawing

**(i)**: a King,
**(ii)**: a spade.

Solution

Total number of possible outcomes = 52

**(i)**: P(drawing a King) = \(\frac{4}{52}\) (There are 4 Kings in a deck.)

= \(\frac{1}{13}\)
**(ii)**: P(drawing a Spade) = \(\frac{13}{52}\) (There are 13 spades in a deck.)

Properties of Probability

**4.**: For any event \(E,0\leq\) P(\(E\)) \(\leq\) 1.
**5.**: If \(E\) is an impossible event, then P(\(E\)) = 0, i.e. it will never occur.
**6.**: If \(E\) is a certain event, then P(\(E\)) = 1, i.e. it will definitely occur.
**7.**: If \(E\) is any event, then P(\(E^{\prime}\)) = 1 - P(\(E\)), where P(\(E^{\prime}\)) is the probability that event \(E\) does not occur.

Mutually Exclusive Events
**8.**: If events \(A\) and \(B\) cannot occur together, we say that they are mutually exclusive.
**9.**: If \(A\) and \(B\) are mutually exclusive events, their sets of sample spaces are disjoint, i.e. P(\(A\cup B\)) = P(\(A\) or \(B\)) = P(\(A\)) + P(\(B\)).

Example 3: A card is drawn at random from a standard pack of 52 playing cards. Find the probability of drawing a Queen or an ace.

Solution

Total number of possible outcomes = 52

P(drawing a Queen or an ace) = P(drawing a Queen) + P(drawing an ace)

\[= \ \frac{4}{52}\ +\ \frac{4}{52}\] \[= \ \frac{2}{13}\]

Independent Events

**10.**: If \(A\) and \(B\) are independent events, the occurrence of \(A\) does not affect that of \(B\),

i.e. P(\(A\ \cap\ B\)) = P(\(A\) and \(B\)) = P(\(A\)) \(\times\) P(\(B\)).

Possibility Diagrams and Tree Diagrams

**11.**: Possibility diagrams and tree diagrams are useful in solving probability problems.

The diagrams are used to list all possible outcomes of an experiment.

**12.**: The sum of probabilities on the branches from the same point is 1.

**Example 4**:

A red fair six-sided die and a blue fair six-sided die are rolled at the same time.

**(a)**: Using a possibility diagram, show all the possible outcomes.
**(b)**: Hence, find the probability that
**(i)**: the sum of the numbers shown is 6,
**(ii)**: the sum of the numbers shown is 10,
**(iii)**: the red die shows a '3' and the blue die shows a '5'.

**(a)**: Total number of possible outcomes \(=6\times 6=36\)
**(i)**: There are 5 ways of obtaining a sum of 6, as shown by the squares on the diagram.

\(\therefore\) P(sum of the numbers shown is 6) \(=\dfrac{5}{36}\)
**(ii)**: There are 3 ways of obtaining a sum of 10, as shown by the triangles on the diagram.

\(\therefore\) P(sum of the numbers shown is 10) \(=\dfrac{3}{36}\)

\(=\dfrac{1}{12}\)
**(iii)**: P(red die shows a '3') \(=\dfrac{1}{6}\)

P(blue die shows a '5') \(=\dfrac{1}{6}\)

P(red die shows a '3' and blue die shows a '5') \(=\dfrac{1}{6}\)

**(iii)**: The number of possible outcomes \(=6\times 6=36\)
**(i)**: There are 5 ways of obtaining a sum of 6, as shown by the squares on the diagram.

\(\therefore\) P(sum of the numbers shown is 6) \(=\dfrac{5}{36}\)
**(ii)**: There are 3 ways of obtaining a sum of 10, as shown by the triangles on the diagram.

\(\therefore\) P(sum of the numbers shown is 10) \(=\dfrac{3}{36}\)

**(iii)**: P(red die shows a '3') \(=\dfrac{1}{6}\)

P(blue die shows a '5') \(=\dfrac{1}{6}\)

P(red die shows a '3' and blue die shows a '5') \(=\dfrac{1}{6}\)

**(iii)**: The number of possible outcomes \(=6\times 6=36\)
**(i)**: There are 5 ways of obtaining a sum of 6, as shown by the squares on the diagram.

\(\therefore\) P(sum of the numbers shown is

Example 6: A box contains 20 similar marbles. 8 marbles are white and the remaining

12 marbles are red. A marble is picked out at random and not replaced. A second

marble is then picked out at random.

Calculate the probability that

**(i)** both marbles will be red,

**(ii)** there will be one red marble and one white marble.

Solution

Use a tree diagram to represent the possible outcomes.

**(i)** P(two red marbles) \(=\)\(\frac{12}{20}\)\(\times\)\(\frac{11}{19}\)

\(=\)\(\frac{33}{95}\)

**(ii)** P(one red marble and one white marble)

\(=\)\(\left(\frac{12}{20}\)\(\times\)\(\frac{8}{19}\)\(\right)+\left(\frac{8}{20}\)\(\times\)\(\frac{12}{19}\)\(\right)\). (A red marble may be chosen first, followed by

a white marble, and vice versa)

\(=\)\(\frac{48}{95}\)

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:179]

Example 8: A box contains 15 identical plates. There are \(8\) red, \(4\) blue and \(3\) white plates. A plate is selected at random and not replaced. A second plate is then selected at random and not replaced. The tree diagram shows the possible outcomes and some of their probabilities.

**(a)**: Find the values of \(p,q,r\) and \(s\).
**(b)**: Expressing each of your answers as a fraction in its lowest terms, find the probability that
**(i)**: both plates are red,
**(ii)**: one plate is red and one plate is blue.
**(c)**: A third plate is now selected at random. Find the probability that none of the three plates is white.

Solution

**(a)**: \(p=1-\frac{8}{15}\,-\,\frac{4}{15}\)

\[=\frac{1}{5}\] \[q=1-\frac{7}{14}\,-\,\frac{4}{14}\] \[=\frac{3}{14}\] \[r=\frac{4}{14}\] \[=\frac{2}{7}\] \[s=1-\,\frac{8}{14}\,-\,\frac{2}{7}\] \[=\frac{1}{7}\] **(b)**: **(i)**: P(both plates are red) \[=\frac{8}{15}\,\times\,\frac{7}{14}\] \[=\frac{4}{15}\] **(ii)**: P(one plate is red and one plate is blue) \[=\frac{8}{15}\,\times\,\frac{4}{14}\,+\,\frac{4}{15}\,\times\, \frac{8}{14}\] \[=\frac{32}{105}\] **(c)**: P(none of the three plates is white) \[=\frac{8}{15}\,\times\,\frac{11}{14}\,\times\,\frac{10}{13}\,+\, \frac{4}{15}\,\times\,\frac{11}{14}\,\times\frac{10}{13}\] \[=\frac{44}{91}\]
