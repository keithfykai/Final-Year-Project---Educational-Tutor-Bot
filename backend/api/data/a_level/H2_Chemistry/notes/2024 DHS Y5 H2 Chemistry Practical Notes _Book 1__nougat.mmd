### 1 Introduction

Volumetric analysis (VA) is a method of quantitative analysis which depends essentially on the **accurate measurements** of the **volumes** of two solutions which react together completely.

This is done through a titration process which involves gradual addition of one solution (known as the _titrant_) to a fixed volume of another (known as the _analyte_) until equivalence is reached i.e. stoichiometric amounts of the two reactants have reacted.

* A standard solution is used in the titration process to determine the concentration of other solution. A **standard solution is one with a known concentration** i.e. a known amount of solute in a given volume of solution (typically 1 dm\({}^{3}\)).
* Four types of reactions that can be analysed during titration include:

1. Acid-base reaction (more details under _Acid-Base Equilibria_ in Y6)

2. Redox reaction

3. Precipitation (covered in _Solubility Equilibria_ in Y6)

4. Complexation (covered in _Chemistry of Transition Elements_ in Y6)

This handbook will focus primarily on acid-base and redox reactions.

### Acid-Base Titration

* In an acid-base titration, the equivalence point corresponds to the point when stoichiometric amounts of acid and base have been reacted. It generally involves a **rapid pH change** over this point.
* The pH changes during an acid-base titration may be monitored using a pH meter and a datalogger, following which a titration curve can be plotted to determine the equivalence point.

* Alternatively, a pH indicator can be used in an acid-base titration. An indicator is a solution which undergoes a distinct colour change. When the indicator first changes colour permanently, it marks the **end-point** of the titration process.
* Each pH indicator changes colour over its characteristic pH transition range in solution. Some common indicators are given below.

* The choice of pH indicator is considered appropriate if its pH transition range lies within the range of rapid pH change over the equivalence point of the titration (shown as a'step' in the titration curve). It will give a **sharp end-point** in which a colour change occurs distinctly when one drop of titrant is added.

The table below lists some common indicators used for different types of acid-base titration.

* strong base** **methyl orange, screened methyl orange, methyl red, thymolphthalein** **strong acid
- weak base** **methyl orange, screened methyl orange, methyl red** **weak acid
- strong base** **thymolphthalein, thymol blue** **no suitable indicator**

### 4 Experimental Techniques in Volumetric Analysis & Data Presentation

#### Use of Pipette and Pipette Filter

Filina a Pipette using a Pipette Filter

_Tip: When using a pipette filter, do not push it too far onto the pipette as it will fail to suck up efficiently._

* Rinse pipette with deionised water followed by the solution it is to be filled with.
* Squeeze the bulb of the pipette filler and valve **A** to let air out.
* Immerse the tip of pipette into the solution. Squeeze valve **S** to suck up the solution to a level **above** the graduation mark.
* Raise the pipette such that the tip is above the surface of the solution. Squeeze valve **E** under control to expel solution until the meniscus just touches the graduation mark.

Delivering Solution into a Conical Flask

* Remove the pipette filler and allow the solution to run out into a clean conical flask. Rinse dirty conical flasks only with deionised water if needed.
* When almost all the solution has drained out of the pipette, tilt the conical flask, and **gently** tap the tip of the pipette against its base.

**For your close attention: Do not attempt to force out the last drop in the pipette** as this is part of its calibration during manufacture to give the required volume. Doing so will result in more solution transferred than required.
* Clamp the pipette to the retort stand after use.

#### Use of Buret

* Rinse buret with deionised water followed by the solution it is to be filled with.
* Ensure that the buret is clamped vertically.
* Place filter funnel and fill the buret with solution above the zero mark.
* Remove the filter funnel. Open the stopcock (tap) to fill the buret jet with solution and remove any trapped air bubbles in the buret.
* Adjust the meniscus level to zero or any other convenient mark.

Take the burette reading at eye level with the bottom of the meniscus. If the solution has an intense colouration, e.g. potassium manganate(VII) which is dark purple, you may instead take the burette reading the top of the meniscus.

#### Performing Titration

Before Titration

* Ensure filter funnel is removed from the burette.
* Check that the **burette jet is filled** with the required solution with no air bubbles.
* Obtain the **Initial burette reading** and record to 2 decimal places (d.p.).
* Ensure that the **appropriate indicator** (where required) is added into the conical flask. _Just one to two drops will suffice. Do not add excessively._
* Place a **white tile** below the burette and place the conical flask on it.

During Titration

* Add the solution from the burette into the conical flask **with continuous swirling** to ensure even mixing. Note: If small quantities of solution from the burette remain as droplets on the sides of the conical flask, rinse these droplets down with deionised water.
* When nearing the end-point, **add the solution** from the burette **dropwise** into the conical flask. Swirl the flask right after adding each drop of solution.
* Stop titration when the **first drop** of solution from the burette causes a **permanent colour change** in the conical flask.

After Titration

* Obtain the **final burette reading** and record to 2 d.p..
* Calculate the volume of solution used (i.e. titre value) to 2 d.p..
* Repeat the titration process until you obtain two titre values which are consistent i.e. within \(\pm\) 0.10 cm\({}^{3}\) of each other.
* Calculate the average titre value based the consistent results of two accurate titrations. If a rough titration was performed, the titre value obtained **cannot** be included in the average calculation.

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:8]

_Example 2:_

_Remarks:_

A 3rd titration was required as the first two titre volumes were not consistent i.e. within \(\pm\) 0.10 cm\({}^{3}\) of each other.

Only the last two titre volumes are selected since results are consistent i.e. within \(\pm\) 0.10 cm\({}^{3}\) of each other.

\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|c|} \hline  & 1 & 2 & 3 \\ \hline Final buret reading / cm\({}^{3}\) & 13.00 & 13.20 & 13.25 \\ \hline Initial buret reading / cm\({}^{3}\) & 0.00 & 0.00 & 0.00 \\ \hline Volume of **FA 3** / cm\({}^{3}\) & 13.00 & 13.20 & 13.25 \\ \hline Average volume of **FA 3** required = \(\frac{(13.20+13.25)}{2}\) = 13.23 cm\({}^{3}\) \\ \hline \end{tabular}

_Remarks:_

The last decimal place for the average titre volume need not be 0 or 5.

#### 1.4.4 Using an Electronic Balance

The electronic balance in the laboratory is capable of reading to \(\pm\)0.001 g. Hence, mass readings are to be recorded to 3 decimal places.

A weighing bottle is used to contain the sample to be weighed. It should be placed on the centre of the weighing pan.

The draught-protection shields will ensure that the reading is not affected by wind or movement.

The 'tare' function resets the balance reading to zero and thus the tare facility allows the mass of the sample to be read directly i.e. excluding the mass of the weighing bottle.

_Note: The 'tare' function cannot be used in some cases, such as if we need to determine the mass of residue after transferring the solid or in a gravimetry experiment._

Weighing a Solid Sample into the Weighing Bottle

1. Ensure all the doors of the shield are fully closed. Press the 'tare' function to set the balance reading to zero.
2. Place a **dry and clean** empty weighing bottle on the centre of the weighing pan and close the door of the shield. Once the reading stabilises, record the mass of the empty weighing bottle.
3. With the empty weighing bottle on the weighing pan, press the 'tare' function to set the balance reading to zero.
4. Remove the weighing bottle from the weighing pan. Add the required mass of solid sample into the weighing bottle and put it back on the weighing pan. Close the door of the shield. _(Do not add solid to the weighing bottle when it is on the weighing pan. This is to ensure that no solid will spill onto the pan.)_
5. Once the reading stabilises, record the mass of the solid sample.
6. To obtain the mass of the solid sample and weighing bottle, add up the mass readings obtained in steps 2 and 5.

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:11]

#### Using a Volumetric (or Standard) Flask

The volumetric flask is a calibrated piece of glassware that can be used to prepare a fixed volume of solution. A typical volumetric flask in the laboratory has a capacity of 250 cm\({}^{3}\). It is often used for dilution and preparation of standard solutions from a solid.

Preparing Standard Solution from Solids

1. Transfer the weighed solid sample into a clean small beaker containing a little deionised water or other specified solvents.
2. Rinse out the remaining solid from the weighing bottle with some deionised water and transfer the washings into the small beaker. Rinse the weighing bottle a second time and transfer the washings into the small beaker.
3. Use a glass rod to stir the solution until all solids have completely dissolved. Add more deionised water if necessary.
4. Pour the concentrated solution into the volumetric flask via a filter funnel, using a glass rod to direct the solution into the flask.
5. Using deionised water, rinse the beaker, glass rod followed by the filter funnel and ensure that all the washings go into the volumetric flask. Always keep track of the solution level during rinsing. Rinse slowly and sparingly to ensure that the solution level does not exceed the graduation mark.
6. Remove the filter funnel from the volumetric flask. Continue to add deionised water until the level is about 1 cm below the graduation mark.
7. Pour some deionised water into a clean small beaker. Using a dropper (_pre-rinsed with deionised water_), add deionised water dropwise to bring the bottom of the meniscus to the mark.
8. Insert the stopper of the volumetric flask (_ensure it is tightly fitted_), invert and shake thoroughly (_~10 times_) to obtain a homogeneous solution.

## 2 ERRORS IN EXPERIMENTAL CHEMISTRY

This section covers some basic knowledge about handling errors in chemical experiments. The content covered here will be applicable to other types of chemistry experiments not covered in this handbook. Sections 2.1 and 2.2 are not directly examinable but underpins the remaining sections.

### Classes of Errors

* An error refers to the difference between a measured value and the true value of a physical quantity being measured. Experimental errors are inevitable, and the known errors are corrected where possible.
* In general, errors associated with a measurement can be classified as systematic errors and random errors.

* A constant error in all measured readings
* Cannot be analysed statistically
* Cannot be eliminated by averaging
* Cannot be reduced by averaging over many measurements or data

Examples:
* faulty calibrations, usage under inappropriate conditions
* non-ideal chemical or physical behaviour, such as slowness of reaction, side reactions, instability of species

### Accuracy vs. Precision

* The terms _accuracy_ and _precision_ need to be distinguished when discussing errors.
* Accuracy refers to the closeness of a measured or derived data value is to its 'true' value. The 'true' value of a measurement is the value that would be obtained by a perfect measurement, i.e. in an ideal world. Hence, the true value is not known. Good accuracy is associated with small systematic errors.
* Precision refers to the closeness of agreement among repeated measurements of a given sample. Good precision is associated with small random errors.

* For example, an uncalibrated electronic balance will give precise but inaccurate results. This means that the random errors associated with the mass measurement is small (little scattering among mass readings) but has a large systematic error (constantly deviates from the 'true' value).

### Error Calculations

* Every measuring apparatus or equipment has an uncertainty and error associated with its use. (Uncertainty is the range of values on both sides of a measurement in which the 'true' value of the measurement is expected to lie.) _Example:_ A 50 cm\({}^{3}\) measuring cylinder has an uncertainty of \(\pm 0.5\) cm\({}^{3}\). When it is used to measure 10 cm\({}^{3}\) of water, it will give a volume ranging between 9.5 cm\({}^{3}\) and 10.5 cm\({}^{3}\).
* Percentage (%) error can be calculated using the general formula: \(\%\) error = \(\pm\) uncertainty of apparatus \(\times\) no. of readings taken using apparatus measured quantity \(\times 100\%\)

_Food for thought: How many readings on a burette are taken to measure 10 cm\({}^{3}\) of water?_

While the uncertainty associated with a calibrated apparatus is the same, the percentage error is larger when it is used to measure a smaller quantity.

_Example:_ A 50 cm\({}^{3}\) measuring cylinder to measure 10 cm\({}^{3}\) of water gives a larger percentage error than compared to measuring 40 cm\({}^{3}\) of water.

Uncertainty of 50 cm\({}^{3}\) measuring cylinder = \(\pm 0.5\) cm\({}^{3}\)

**for 10 cm\({}^{3}\) of water**

**for 40 cm\({}^{3}\) of water**

\(\%\) error = \(\frac{0.5}{10}\times 100\%=\pm 5\) % \(\%\) error = \(\frac{0.5}{40}\times 100\%=\pm 1.25\) %

To obtain more accurate measurementfor 10 cm\({}^{3}\) of water, an apparatus with a higher precision could be used, such as 10 cm\({}^{3}\) measuring cylinder or a 50 cm\({}^{3}\) burette. (The term _precision_ here is used to describe the range of uncertainty in an instrument's scale.)

The total apparatus error is the sum of the percentage errors associated with each piece of apparatus.

_Example:_ To prepare a solution from a solid sample, a 50 cm\({}^{3}\) burette was used to measure 20.00 cm\({}^{3}\) of water and an electronic balance precise to 2 decimal places was used to weigh 0.50 g of solid.

**% error using 50 cm\({}^{3}\) burette**

**% error using electronic balance**

\(\%\) error = \(\frac{0.05\times 2}{20.00}\times 100\%=\pm 0.50\) % \(\%\) error = \(\frac{0.01}{0.5}\times 100\%=\pm 2\) %

Total apparatus error = \(\pm(0.50+2)\) % = \(\pm 2.5\) %

The electronic balance has a larger contribution to the total apparatus error. An improvement to the process could be to use an electronic balance that is more precise i.e. to \(\pm 0.001\) g.

### Instrument Precision & Uncertainty

* The uncertainty in a single scale reading of an instrument is typically taken as half the smallest division. (Exceptions apply, such as digital meters.)
* The table below summarises the uncertainties for apparatus commonly used in H2 Chemistry.

\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|c|} \hline
**apparatus** & **smallest** & **uncertainty** & **remarks** \\  & **division** & & \\ \hline electronic balance & 0.001 g & \(\pm\)0.001 g & record to 3 d.p. \\ \hline
10 cm\({}^{3}\) pipette & - & \(\pm\)0.02 cm\({}^{3}\) & record to 1 d.p. \\ \hline
25 cm\({}^{3}\) pipette & - & \(\pm\)0.03 cm\({}^{3}\) & record to 2 d.p., \\ \hline
50 cm\({}^{3}\) burette & 0.1 cm\({}^{3}\) & \(\pm\)0.05 cm\({}^{3}\) & record to 2 d.p., \\  & & & last decimal either 0 or 5 \\ \hline
10 cm\({}^{3}\) measuring cylinder & 0.2 cm\({}^{3}\) & \(\pm\)0.1 cm\({}^{3}\) & record to 1 d.p. \\ \hline
25 cm\({}^{3}\) measuring cylinder & 0.5 cm\({}^{3}\) & \(\pm\)0.25 cm\({}^{3}\) & record to 2 d.p. \\ \hline
50 cm\({}^{3}\) measuring cylinder & 1 cm\({}^{3}\) & \(\pm\)0.5 cm\({}^{3}\) & record to 1 d.p. \\  & & & last decimal either 0 or 5 \\ \hline
0.2\({}^{\circ}\)C thermometer & 0.2 \({}^{\circ}\)C & \(\pm\)0.1 \({}^{\circ}\)C & record to 1 d.p., \\
1 \({}^{\circ}\)C thermometer & 1 \({}^{\circ}\)C & \(\pm\)0.5 \({}^{\circ}\)C & record to 1 d.p., \\  & & & last decimal either 0 or 5 \\ \hline stopwatch & 0.01s & 1 s (human reaction time) & Format for recording depends on context. \\  & & & \\  & & & \\  & & & \\  & & & \\  & & & \\  & & & \\  & & & \\ \end{tabular}

_Example_:

135s (nearest second)

= 2 min and 15 s (in min and s)

= 2.25 min (in decimal place)

### Anomalous Results

* Anomalous results refer to data which are inconsistent or irregular. Anomalous results are likely to be present when readings do not fall within a certain range or that the distribution of measurements do not follow a certain trend.
* For the case of volumetric analysis, anomalous results occur when titre values are not consistent i.e. not within \(\pm\)0.10 cm\({}^{3}\).

_Possible reasons_:

1. The titrant was not added dropwise near the end-point, making end-point determination difficult to ascertain.
2. Solution in the conical flask was not swirled continuously to ensure complete mixing.
3. The standard solution prepared was not mixed thoroughly to ensure a homogeneous mixture.

## 3 QUALITATIVE ANALYSIS (QA)

_Prerequisite Knowledge from O Level Chemistry or equivalent (non-exhaustive):_

Colour and Solubility of Sats

Identification of Cations, Anions and Test for Gases

### 3.1 Introduction

Qualitative Analysis (QA) is an experimental method used to identify unknown chemical samples. Chemical tests involving a set of chemical reagents are systematically and sequentially conducted on the unknown samples. By comparing the observations of each test, the possible identities of the unknown samples are deduced and narrowed down methodically to reach a conclusion.

This section of the handbook focuses primarily on the analysis of _inorganic_ compounds. Nevertheless, the experimental techniques covered here are also applicable to analysis of organic compounds.

### 3.2 General Experimental Techniques in Qualitative Analysis

#### 3.2.1 Quantity of Chemicals

The following quantities should be used unless the given procedure specifies otherwise.

For Solids

Sufficient to fill the hemisphere at the bottom of a **cleanand**drytest-tube**.

For Solutions

Sufficient to fill one-fifth the length (~1 cm depth, unless otherwise specified) of a **clean** test-tube.

In cases where test on a gas evolved is required, a larger volume of solution may be required for significant observation.

_Note_: Do not waste chemicals, litmus papers, aluminium foil, filter papers, etc. Use sufficient quantities but not in excess.

#### Handling Reagents

_Safety:_

_Do not touch chemicals with your bare hands. In case of skin contact with chemicals, wash off immediately under running water._

_Concentrated acids or alkalis should be diluted before disposal. Flush the sink with plenty of water after disposal. Follow the instructions given to you for disposal of these solutions._

_Use a test-tube holder when handling concentrated acids, alkalis and flammable reagents. Carry out the experiments in a fume cupboard._

Handling Solids

Transfer solid from stock bottle into a test-tube using a **clean and dry** spatula.

If more than one solid sample is involved, use one spatula only for one type of solid. Do not cross-contaminate the stock bottles!

Dispose solids into the waste bin. Do not throw into the sink.

Handling Solutions

To avoid contamination of the given reagent bottles, do not allow the tip of the bottle to touch the sides of the test-tubes! The tip of bottle should be held just above the mouth of the test-tube.

When adding reagents using a dropper (or teat pipette), the dropper should be held just above the mouth of the test-tube. The tip of dropper should not touch the sides of the test-tube.

Use one dropper for only one type of reagent to avoid contamination. Do not leave the dropper on the bench or allow the tip to touch anything else except the intended reagent.

_adding reagent from bottle:_

_adding reagent from dropper (teat pipette):_

_How to use a dropper (teat pipette) correctly?_

Squeeze the bulb of the dropper BEFORE immersing the tip into the solution. Release to draw up the solution into the dropper. Squeeze the bulb again to dispense the solution.

Solutions should always be added dropwise. Shake the test-tube to mix the chemicals and observe the mixture. Repeat the process until no further change is observed.

Mibing Solids and Solutions

For small volumes of mixture in a test-tube

Hold the test-tube near its mouth with one hand.

Tap the bottom of the test-tube against your palm OR use your index finger to tap near the bottom of the test-tube.

For large volumes of mixture in a test-tube

Stir the contents gently using a clean glass rod.

#### 3.2.4 Filtration

* Gravity filtration is used to separate a mixture consisting of liquids and insoluble solids. The mixture is passed through a filter funnel that is lined with filter paper. The filter paper is semi-permeable i.e. only particles whose sizes fit into the pores of the paper can pass through it. Hence, the larger solid particles are trapped in the filter paper as residue. The smaller liquid particles are collected as the filtrate.
* Before pouring the mixture into the filter funnel, wet the filter paper with some deionised water. This is typically done to reduce the loss of liquid mixture as some of it will be absorbed by the filter paper.
* When almost all of liquid has been filtered, wash the residue with some deionised water to remove any trace amounts of filtrate from the residue. For organic experiments which require dry conditions i.e. no water present, the residue obtained is washed with an appropriate solvent.
* A fluted filter paper may quicken the process of filtration as it allows for faster equilibration of air pressure through the folded sides. Scan the QR code to watch how to fold a fluted filter paper.

### Tests in Qualitative Analysis

The following list of chemical reagents (or bench reagents) are typically used for qualitative analysis:

* aqueous sodium hydroxide, NaOH(aq)
* aqueous ammonia, NH\({}_{3}\)(aq)
* hydrochloric acid, HC(aq)
* nitric acid, HNO\({}_{3}\)(aq)
* sulfuric acid, H\({}_{2}\)SO\({}_{4}\)(aq)
* aqueous silver nitrate, AgNO\({}_{3}\)(aq)
* aqueous barium nitrate, Ba(NO\({}_{3}\))\({}_{2}\)(aq)
* limewater (a saturated solution of calcium hydroxide, Ca(OH)\({}_{2}\)(aq))
* aqueous potassium manganate(VII), KMnO\({}_{4}\)(aq)
* aqueous potassium iodide, KI(aq)
* aluminium foil, Al(s)
* red and blue litmus paper or Universal Indicator (UI) paper

It is imperative that you understand the purpose behind the use of each chemical reagent listed above. In other words, what kind of information can you gain when conducting chemical tests using each reagent? What is the type of reaction expected when using each reagent?

Points to Note for Practical Assessment

* Candidates should be familiar with Qualitative inorganic analysis involving an element, a compound or a mixture. Systematic analysis will **not** be required.
* Candidates should be familiar with the reactions of cations, reactions of anions and test for gases as detailed in the Qualitative Analysis Notes.
* Candidates would **not** be required to carry out tests involving hexane, sulfur dioxide gas, nitrite ions or sulfite ions.
* Reactions involving ions not included in the Qualitative Analysis Notes may be tested: in such cases, candidates will **not** be expected to identify the ions but only to draw conclusions of a general nature.
* Candidates should **not** attempt tests, other than those specified, on substances, except when it is appropriate to test for a gas.

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:23]

_Example_:

Addition of Na\({}_{2}\)CO\({}_{3}\) to solution containing \(A\)\(P^{*}\) results in an **acid-base reaction** with effervescence of CO\({}_{2}\) gas and formation of a white precipitate, A(OH)\({}_{3}\)(s).

\[[A\)(H\({}_{2}\)O)\({}_{6}]^{3+}(aq)+H\({}_{2}\)O(l)\(\rightleftharpoons[A\)(H\({}_{2}\)O)\({}_{8}\)(OH)]^{2+}(aq)+H\({}_{3}\)O^{+}(aq)\quad\text{---} \tag{1}\]

\[\text{CO}_{3}{}^{2-}(aq)+2H\({}_{3}\)O^{+}(aq)\to\text{CO}_{2}(g)+3H\({}_{2}\)O(l)\]

_In case you are wondering: Why is the precipitate \(A\)(OH)\({}_{3}\) and not \(A\)\(H\)\({}_{2}\)(CO\({}_{3}\))\({}_{3}\)?_

By Le Chatelier's Principle, the removal of H\({}_{3}\)O\({}^{+}\) by CO\({}_{3}\)\({}^{2-}\) causes the position of equilibrium (1) to shift to the right, producing more H\({}_{3}\)O\({}^{+}\) and [A(H\({}_{2}\)O)\({}_{8}\)(OH)]^{2+}. Continual removal of H\({}_{3}\)O\({}^{+}\) results in positions of equilibrium (2) and (3) to shift to the right, eventually forming \(A\)(H\({}_{2}\)O)\({}_{8}\)(OH)\({}_{3}\), which is equivalent to A(OH)\({}_{3}\).

\[[A\)(H\({}_{2}\)O)\({}_{8}\)(OH)]^{2+}(aq)+H\({}_{2}\)O(l)\(\rightleftharpoons[A\)(H\({}_{2}\)O)\({}_{4}\)(OH)]^{+}(aq)+H\({}_{3}\)O^{+}(aq)\quad\text{---} \tag{2}\]

\[[A\)(H\({}_{2}\)O)\({}_{4}\)(OH)]^{+}(aq)+H\({}_{2}\)O(l)\(\rightleftharpoons[A\)(H\({}_{2}\)O)\({}_{3}\)(OH)\({}_{3}\)](s)+H\({}_{3}\)O^{+}(aq)\quad\text{---} \tag{3}\]

_Note: The above explanation can also be extended to Cr\({}^{3+}\) and Fe\({}^{3+}\). For all other metal cations listed in the QA note, metal carbonates are formed as the precipitate._

* \(A\)\(P^{*}\), Cr\({}^{3+}\) and Zn\({}^{2+}\) ions form **ambroteric metal hydroxides** with OH\({}^{+}\). The metal hydroxides can dissolve further in excess NaOH to form soluble complex ions. They can also undergo acid-base reactions with acids.

Ligand exchange reaction occurs where NH\({}_{3}\) displaces H\({}_{2}\)O, forming soluble Cu\({}^{2+}\) and Zn\({}^{2+}\) complex ions. Details about ligands and ligand exchange reactions will be covered under _Chemistry of Transition Elements_ in Y6.

#### 3.3.2 Precipitate Reformation from Soluble Complex Ions [To be covered in Y6]

Precipitate reformation is a test in QA that is typically performed on colourless filtrates after filtering a mixture. The reformation of a precipitate in the filtrate enables one to ascertain whether specific cations, such as A/\({}^{\bullet}\), Zn\({}^{2+}\) and Ba\({}^{2+}\), are present or absent.

**Dilute acid is usually used** in precipitate reformation from soluble complex ions such as [A/(OH)\({}_{4}\)]-, [Zn(OH)\({}_{4}\)]-, [Cr(OH)\({}_{8}\)]\({}^{3-}\) and [Cu(NH)\({}_{4}\)(H\({}_{2}\)O)\({}_{2}\)]\({}^{2+}\).

Experimental Technique for Precipitate Reformation

_Example_: Reforming Zn(OH)\({}_{2}\) from [Zn(OH)\({}_{4}\)]\({}^{2-}\)

Given procedure:

To 2 cm depth of the filtrate in a test-tube, add dilute nitric acid dropwise until no further change.

**steps**

**explanation**

Place test-tube containing filtrate on test-tube rack.

This avoids the test-tube from shaking and allows observation of any precipitate reformed.

Adding nitric acid provides H\({}^{+}\) which removes OH\({}^{-}\). By Lake Chatelier's Principle, position of equilibrium shifts left, reforming Zn(OH)\({}_{2}\)(s).

\[\text{Zn(OH)}_{2}\text{(s)}+2\text{OH}^{-}\text{(aq)}\rightleftharpoons[\text{Zn(OH)}_{4}] ^{2-}\text{(aq)}\]

Shaking the test-tube initially will prevent clear observation of the reformed precipitate since there is excess OH\({}^{-}\) present which will dissolve the reformed precipitate.

As more nitric acid is added, excess OH\({}^{-}\) present will be removed (neutralisation occurs). More Zn(OH)\({}_{2}\)(s) will be reformed.

In excess volumes of nitric acid, Zn(OH)\({}_{2}\)(s), being amphoteric, undergoes **acid-base reaction** to form Zn(NO\({}_{3}\))\({}_{2}\)(aq), which is colourless.

Zn(OH)\({}_{2}\)(s) + 2HNO\({}_{3}\)(aq) \(\rightarrow\) Zn(NO\({}_{3}\))\({}_{2}\)(aq) + 2H\({}_{2}\)O(I)

#### Test for Anions

The following aqueous anions are listed in the QA notes used for practical examinations:

\[\text{CO}_{3}{}^{2-}\quad\text{C}\Gamma\quad\text{Br}^{-}\quad\text{I}^{-}\quad \text{NO}_{3}{}^{-}\quad\text{NO}_{2}{}^{-}\quad\text{SO}_{4}{}^{2-}\quad\text{SO }_{3}{}^{2-}\]

* Dilute acids, HC_I_(aq), H\({}_{2}\)SO\({}_{4}\)(aq) and HNO\({}_{3}\)(aq) are typically used to test for CO\({}_{3}{}^{2-}\)(aq), NO\({}_{2}{}^{-}\)(aq) and SO\({}_{3}{}^{2-}\)(aq).
* You will **not** be required to test for NO\({}_{2}{}^{-}\) (nitrite) and SO\({}_{3}{}^{2-}\) (sulfite) ions during practical examinations.

What to look out for: **effervescence (of CO\({}_{2}\))**

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|} \hline
**anion** & **equation** \\ \hline CO\({}_{3}{}^{2-}\) & CO\({}_{3}{}^{2-}\)(aq) + 2H\({}^{+}\)(aq) \(\rightarrow\) CO\({}_{2}\)(g) + H\({}_{2}\)O(l) \\ \hline NO\({}_{2}{}^{-}\) & 2NO\({}_{2}\)(aq) + 2H\({}^{+}\)(aq) \(\rightarrow\) NO\({}_{2}\)(g) + NO\({}_{2}\)(g) + H\({}_{2}\)O(l) \\ \hline SO\({}_{3}{}^{2-}\) & SO\({}_{3}{}^{2-}\)(aq) + 2H\({}^{+}\)(aq) \(\rightarrow\) SO\({}_{2}\)(g) + H\({}_{2}\)O(l) \\ \hline \end{tabular}

* Aqueous silver nitrate, AgNO\({}_{3}\)(aq), together with NH\({}_{3}\)(aq), is typically used to test for the halides, C\(\Gamma\), Br\({}^{-}\) and I\({}^{-}\).

What to look out for: **precipitate and solubility in NH\({}_{3}\)(aq)**

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|} \hline
**anion** & **precipitate** & **colour** & **equation** & **solubility in NH\({}_{3}\)(aq)** \\ \hline C\(\Gamma\) & AgC\(\Gamma\) & white & Ag\({}^{+}\)(aq) + \(C\Gamma\)(aq) \(\rightleftharpoons\) AgC\(\Gamma\)(s) & soluble \\ \hline Br\({}^{-}\) & AgBr & pale cream & Ag\({}^{+}\)(aq) + Br\({}^{-}\)(aq) \(\rightleftharpoons\) AgBr(s) & partially soluble \\ \hline I\({}^{-}\) & AgI & yellow & Ag\({}^{+}\)(aq) + I\({}^{-}\)(aq) \(\rightleftharpoons\) AgI(s) & insoluble \\ \hline \end{tabular}

AgC\(\Gamma\) and AgBr can be distinguished more easily by adding NH\({}_{3}\)(aq) as the colour of these two precipitates may be difficult to differentiate during practical.

NH\({}_{3}\)(aq) forms a soluble complex ion with Ag\({}^{+}\).

\[\text{Ag}^{+}\text{(aq)}+2\text{NH}_{3}\text{(aq)}\rightleftharpoons[\text{Ag(NH }_{3})_{2}]{}^{+}\text{(aq)}\]

Note: The explanation for the different solubilities of the precipitates in NH\({}_{3}\)(aq) can be found in _Solubility Equilibria_ lecture notes (Y6).

* Aqueous barium nitrate, Ba(NO\({}_{3}\))\({}_{2}\)(aq), is typically used to test for SO\({}_{4}{}^{2-}\) and SO\({}_{3}{}^{2-}\).

What to look out for: **white precipitate**

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|} \hline
**anion** & **precipitate** & **equation** \\ \hline SO\({}_{4}{}^{2-}\) & BaSO\({}_{4}\) & Ba\({}^{2+}\)(aq) + SO\({}_{4}{}^{2-}\)(aq) \(\rightleftharpoons\) BaSO\({}_{4}\)(s) \\ \hline SO\({}_{3}{}^{2-}\) & BaSO\({}_{3}\) & Ba\({}^{2+}\)(aq) + SO\({}_{3}{}^{2-}\)(aq) \(\rightleftharpoons\) BaSO\({}_{3}\)(s) \\ \hline \end{tabular}

BaSO\({}_{3}\) and BaSO\({}_{4}\) can be distinguished by adding dilute strong acids. No reaction occurs for BaSO\({}_{4}\) while BaSO\({}_{3}\) undergoes acid-base reaction.

\[\text{BaSO}_{3}\text{(s)}+2\text{H}^{+}\text{(aq)}\rightarrow\text{Ba}^{2+}\text{ (aq)}+\text{SO}_{2}\text{(g)}+\text{H}_{2}\text{O(l)}\]2024 DHS Year 5 H2 Chemistry

Aluminium foil (AJ) and NaOH(aq) are used to test for NO\({}_{3}\)- and NO\({}_{2}\)-. Warming the mixture is required. NH\({}_{3}\)(g) is evolved, and its presence is confirmed by using moist red litmus paper which will turn blue.

Two reactions occur during the test:

1. Reduction of NO\({}_{3}\)- and NO\({}_{2}\)- by AI to NH\({}_{4}\)-(aq)

2. Acid-base reaction between NH\({}_{4}\)-(aq) and OH-(aq) to form NH\({}_{3}\)(g)

Overall equation:

\[3\text{NO}_{3}\text{(aq)}+8\text{A}\text{(s)}+5\text{OH}\text{(aq)}+1\text{B} \text{H}_{2}\text{O}\text{(l)}\rightarrow3\text{NH}_{3}\text{(g)}+8\text{[A} \text{(OH)}\text{4]}\text{-(aq)}\]

\[\text{NO}_{2}\text{-}\text{(aq)}+2\text{A}\text{(s)}+\text{OH}\text{(aq)}+5\text{ H}_{2}\text{O}\text{(l)}\rightarrow\text{NH}_{3}\text{(g)}+2\text{[A} \text{(OH)}\text{4]}\text{-(aq)}\]

_Practical Tip_:

While effervescence is observed during heating, do **not** record your observation as 'effervescence seen'. The effervescence observed is H\({}_{2}\)(g) that is produced from the reaction between A\(\text{(s)}\) and NaOH(aq).

\[2\text{A}\text{(s)}+2\text{OH}\text{-(aq)}+6\text{H}_{2}\text{O}\text{(l)} \rightarrow2\text{[A}\text{(OH)}\text{4]}\text{-(aq)}+3\text{H}_{2}\text{(g)}\]

The gas to be tested here is NH\({}_{3}\)(g) which is soluble in water. Hence, warming the mixture will reduce the solubility of NH\({}_{3}\)(g), causing it to be evolved. The expected observation is 'Gas evolved turns moist red litmus paper blue. Gas is ammonia'.

Acidified aqueous potassium manganate(VII), KMnO\({}_{4}\)(aq), can oxidise with the following anions listed in the QA notes: NO\({}_{2}\)-, SO\({}_{3}\)\({}^{2}\), \(C\Gamma\), Br- and \(\Gamma\).

Note that in the laboratory, the KMnO\({}_{4}\) solution provided in the set of bench reagents is **not** acidified. An equal depth of dilute sulfuric acid must be added to acidify the solution.

#### 3.3.4 Test for Gases

The following gases can be found in the QA notes used for practical examinations:

NH3 \(CO_{2}\) \(Cb\) \(H_{2}\) \(O_{2}\) \(SO_{2}\)

* You will note be required to test for SO2 gas during practical examinations.
* Testing for each gas in QA typically requires multiple steps with the use of a few reagents and apparatus. Conducting tests for gas blindly can be inefficient, potentially frustrating, and misleading when performing QA.

Hence, it is important to understand the given procedure and infer possible types of reactions occurring from the given reagents before deciding the appropriate test for gas. If more than one possible test is considered, it may help to conduct the simpler test first.

_Examples (non-exhaustive):_

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|c|} \hline
**reagents and procedure** & **purpose of test** & **gas to be tested** \\ \hline NaOH(aq) and warm & acid-base reaction, test for NH4* & NH3(g) \\ \hline A(s) and NaOH(aq), heat & test for NO2- and NO3- & NH3(g) \\ \hline dilute acid & acid-base reaction, & \\ (may include warming) & test for CO3-2, NO2- and SO3-2- & CO2(g) \\ \hline solid and heat & thermal decomposition of & 1. NH3(g) \\  & ammonium, nitrate or carbonate & 2. CO2(g) \\  & salt & 3. O2(g) (with brown NO2) \\ \hline solid (dull-looking) and acid & acid-metal (redox) reaction & H2(g) \\ \hline H2O2(aq) & redox reaction / oxidation & O2(g) \\ \hline HC1 and oxidising agent & redox reaction & Cb(g) \\ \hline \end{tabular}

Some Remarks (good to know)

NH3 is the only alkaline gas in the list. CO2, Cb and SO2 are acidic while O2 and H2 are neutral.

CO2(g) forms a white precipitate of CaCO3 when bubbled into limewater. If excess CO2 is bubbled into limewater, CaCO3 will dissolve to form calcium hydrogencarbonate, Ca(HCO3)2.

CO2(g) + Ca(OH)2(aq) \(\rightarrow\) CaCO3(s) + H2O(l)

CO2(g) + CaCO3(s) + H2O(l) \(\rightarrow\) Ca(HCO3)2(aq)

H2(g) burns with oxygen in air explosively with a lighted splint, resulting in a 'pop' sound.

2H2(g) + O2(g) \(\rightarrow\) 2H2O(l)

O2(g) supports combustion and hence can relight a glowing splint.

SO2 is a reducing agent. It undergoes redox reaction with acidified KMnO4(aq).

2MnO4(aq) + SSO2(g) + 2H2O(l) \(\rightarrow\) 2Mn2*(aq) + SSO4-2(aq) + 4H*(aq)* If a gas is expected to be produced, prepare the necessary reagents and apparatus BEFORE starting the test!

### Performing QA Tests, Recording Observations and Making Deductions

Before performing any tests during QA, it is important to first understand the intent of the test based on the given procedure. In other words, **analyse the chemical reagent added**. What does the specified reagent test for? What should one be looking out when performing the test?

Knowing the intent of test will provide guidance as to what observations should be recorded, which will in turn enable one to make the correct deductions in QA.

A list of reagents commonly used in Qualitative Analysis is summarised in _Section 3.5_.

#### 3.4.1 Recording Observations for Different Tests in QA

* As covered in Section 3.3, tests in QA generally include those for cations, anions and gases.
* Record observations in ink immediately after each test, alongside the given procedures to indicate clearly at which stage a change occurs during the tests.
* Chemical equations are not required for observations.
* In general, observations in QA include details such as:
* Colour of precipitate (abbreviated as 'ppt') and its solubility in excess reagent
* Colour change of solution and/or solid (include ppt)
* Test for gas (exact details depend on the specific gas tested)
* Colour of residue and filtrate (if filtration is performed)
* For negative results i.e. tests with no observable changes, record observation as the negative statement of the expected observations.
* No ppt formed. No NH\({}_{3}\) gas evolved.
* You are to write "no observable change" instead of the negative result if the question requires you to do so.

## 4 Gravimetric Analysis (Ga)

### _Introduction_

Gravimetric analysis (GA) is used to accurately quantify the masses of solid samples formed via thermal decomposition or precipitation. It enables the determination of information such as relative molecular mass (\(M_{\mathrm{r}}\)) and amount of water of crystallisation of a salt.

### _Common Substances involved in Thermal Decomposition_

The table below shows common solid compounds which decompose upon heating.

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|} \hline
**substance** & **effect upon heating** \\ \hline bicarbonate & Some bicarbonates thermally decompose to metal carbonates, water and carbon dioxide gas. \\ \hline  & \begin{tabular}{c} \(2\)NaHCO\({}_{3}\)(s) \(\rightarrow\) Na\({}_{2}\)CO\({}_{3}\)(s) + H\({}_{2}\)O(g) + CO\({}_{2}\)(g) \\ \end{tabular} \\ \hline carbonate & \begin{tabular}{c} Some carbonates thermally decompose to metal oxides and carbon dioxide \\ \end{tabular} \\ \hline  & \begin{tabular}{c} Some sulfides thermally decompose to oxides and sulfur dioxide gas. \\ \end{tabular} \\ \hline  & \begin{tabular}{c} Group I nitrates thermally decompose to nitrite and oxygen gas. \\ \end{tabular} \\ \hline nitrate & \begin{tabular}{c} Group II nitrates thermally decompose to give metal oxides, nitrogen dioxide and oxygen gas. \\ \end{tabular} \\ \hline  & \begin{tabular}{c} Group II hydroxides thermally decompose (dehydrates) to oxides and water. \\ \end{tabular} \\ \hline hydroxide & \begin{tabular}{c} \(2\)Mg(NO\({}_{3}\))\({}_{2}\)(s) \(\rightarrow\) 2MgO(s) + 4NO\({}_{2}\)(g) + O\({}_{2}\)(g) \\ \end{tabular} \\ \hline salts with & \begin{tabular}{c} Water molecules are lost from a salt with water of crystallisation. The anhydrous salt itself is stable to heating. \\ \end{tabular} \\ \hline crystallisation (hydrates) &

### General Procedure for Thermal Decomposition

* A crucible is typically used and is supported on a pipe-clay triangle and tripod.

General steps

1. Weigh a dry empty crucible using an electronic balance and record its mass.
2. Add a fixed mass of solid sample to the crucible. Weigh and record the total mass and mass of solid sample used.
3. **Heat** the crucible and its contents **gently** for one minute and then **strongly** for three minutes.
4. Allow to the crucible and its contents to **cool to room temperature**.
5. **Reweigh** the crucible and its contents using an electronic balance and record the mass.
6. **Repeat the heat-cool-reweigh** process (steps 3 to 5) until three **constant** mass readings are obtained. Record this final mass.

## 5 Introduction to Planning

This section will cover some basic guidelines when planning a scientific investigation in H2 Chemistry. Content related to planning experiments for Volumetric Analysis, Qualitative Analysis and Gravimetric Analysis will be also covered.

### 5.1 Introduction

The Planning skill area requires one to apply and integrate knowledge and understanding from different sections of the H2 Chemistry syllabus. As such, it is one of the most difficult skills to master.

The following competencies are expected in this skill area:

* define the question/problem using appropriate knowledge and understanding
* give a clear logical account of the experimental procedure to be followed
* describe how the data should be used in order to reach a conclusion
* assess the risks of the experiment and describe precautions that should be taken to keep risks to a minimum

Unlike the other skill areas (MMO, PDO and ACE) which typically require students to execute a defined procedure, the Planning skill area requires students to _design_ a procedure. Students also need to propose how the expected data can be evaluated to achieve the aim of the investigation.

In some ways, designing a procedure to complete a scientific investigation is like designing a recipe for a new dish. Whether writing a recipe or procedure, there are three big questions to consider:

\begin{tabular}{|p{142.3pt}|p{142.3pt}|p{142.3pt}|} \hline  & Recipe for Cooking & Procedure for Experiment \\ \hline Q1: **Regarding Method** (_March HBL: intro to Planning 1_) & What is the main method to cook this dish? Steam, deep fry, bake etc.? & What is the main method to achieve the aim of the experiment? Titration, gas collection, etc.? \\ \hline Q2: **Regarding Quantities** (_March HBL: intro to Planning 2_) & How much of each ingredient should I use? & How much of each starting reagent should I use? \\ \hline Q3: **Regarding Procedure** (_March HBL: intro to Planning 3_) & What are the steps needed to cook this dish? What are the details to be mindful about? & What is the logical flow of steps needed? What are the details required? \\ \hline \end{tabular}

Consider the following actions to improve your concept of designing experimental procedures:

* Look back at the procedure given in the practical work you have done in the laboratory.
* Understand the intent of each step and the sequence of the steps in the procedure.
* How should the procedure be changed if the given reagents were changed?
* Visualise in your mind how the experiment will look like based on your proposed procedure during planning. Will there be any loopholes or gaps that will limit the validity of your procedure?

#### 5.1.1 Suiting Questions for Planning an Experiment

The table below lists some guiding questions which need to be considered when planning a scientific investigation. A detailed application of the guiding questions will be covered in _Introduction to Planning: Much items-based Learning (HSL)_.

#### General Format of Writing Procedures

* Number and write each step on a new line.
* Do not show calculation steps in the procedure unless required by the question.
* Phrase your steps as instructions i.e. use imperatives (command words).

Example:

1. Using a 50.00 cm\({}^{3}\) burette, add 50.00 cm\({}^{3}\) of 0.5 mol dm\({}^{-3}\) HC\(\mathit{l}\) to a 100 cm\({}^{3}\) volumetric flask.

* At times, it may be necessary to specify the **purpose** (e.g. "to ensure solids dissolve completely") or **expected outcome/observation** (e.g. "until solution changes from yellow to orange").
* For time-based procedures, indicate the time at which the required action is to be executed (e.g. "At \(t\) = 5 min, pipette...").
* A list of verbs (action word) and adverbs typically used in chemical procedures are shown below for your reference. This list is non-exhaustive.

### Planning Volumetric Analysis (VA) Experiments

#### 5.2.1 Approaching VA Planning Questions

Planning VA experiments typically involve the following components:

Preparation of standard solution (from solid sample or dilution of liquid sample)

Trifation

The following are some considerations when planning VA experiments.

description

Identify from the information given whether the reaction is acid-base, redox, precipitation or complexation, etc.

Write chemical equations to help you if not given.

If a pH indicator is given in the list of chemicals and apparatus, it typically hints the use of acid-base titration.

Ensure you remember the colour of typical pH indicators under acidic, neutral and alkaline conditions.

If a pH indicator is not provided and you have determined the reaction to be acid-base by nature, decide on your own pH indicator.

Redox titrations are typically self-indicating, except for iodometric titration which requires the use of starch indicator.

In short, if a colour change is not obvious at end-point, then an indicator is necessary.

A standard solution preparation requires a volumetric flask with a capacity of 100 cm\({}^{3}\) or 250 cm\({}^{3}\) typically.

As titration involves the reaction between two solutions, solid samples, if given, need to be dissolved or reacted first.

For solid compounds which are **soluble** in water:

A standard solution is directly prepared by dissolving the solid and are used in fixed portions for titration.

For solid compounds which are **insoluble** in water:

Back (or indirect) titration is required.

The solid is typically reacted with another compound to form an aqueous solution.

Transfer the aqueous solution into a volumetric flask to achieve an appropriate concentration. Use fixed portions of the diluted solution for titration.

If the concentration of a solution given in the question is relatively too high for appropriate use in titration, perform dilution by preparing a standard solution.

Use \(C_{0}V_{0}=C_{0}V_{0}\) to calculate the volume of original solution (\(V_{0}\)) required. (\(V_{0}\) = capacity of volumetric flask)

Use a buret or pipette to transfer the solution as they are more accurate than a measuring cylinder.

Accuracy of titre volume

The volume ratio between the titrant and analyte in a titration is typically about 1 : 1 to ensure minimum error of the titre volume.

If the volume of analyte (in conical flask) used is 25 cm\({}^{3}\), a suitable titre volume to assume will be between 20 - 25 cm\({}^{3}\) for pre-calculations.

A titre volume that is too small (e.g. 5.00 cm\({}^{3}\)) will result in large percentage error.

A titre volume that is too large (e.g. 60.00 cm\({}^{3}\)) necessitates refilling the buret, which is inefficient and increases error.
