### _Cis-trans_ isomerism in alkenes

In Topic 9 isomerism, you have learnt that _cis-trans_ isomerism arises in alkenes due to restricted rotation about the C=C bond and 2 different groups attached to each C=C carbon atom.

## 2 Physical properties of alkenes

### Boiling and melting points within the homologous series

The trend in the boiling and melting points within the homologous series indicate that as the number of carbon atoms increases, the boiling points increase correspondingly. This is due to the increase in number of electrons and hence the size of the electron cloud, leading to stronger dispersion forces between the molecules.

The trend in melting points is not as clear as the trend in boiling points as melting point also depends on how the molecules are packed in the solid lattice.

### Physical properties of _cis-trans_ isomers

#### Boiling point of _cis-trans_ isomers

There can be differences in the boiling and melting points between the _cis_ and _trans_ isomers of alkenes e.g. 1,2-dichloroethene CHONC

Figure 3: Boiling and melting points of _cis-_ and _trans-_ isomers of 1,2-dichloroethene

You will notice that:

the _cis_-isomer has the higher boiling point;

the _trans_-isomer has the higher melting point.

Between the _cis_ and the _trans_ isomer of disubstituted alkenes, the _cis_ isomer tend to have higher boiling points. The reason for this is that _cis_ isomers tend to be more polar. We shall use 1,2-dichloroethene as an example below:

In the _cis_ isomer, the polar C-C bonds result in dipole moments that do not cancel out, hence producing an overall dipole moment for the molecule. Thus, the _cis_ isomer is polar and permanent dipole-permanent dipole interactions (on top of dispersion forces) exist between molecules.

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:7]

### Melting point of _cis-trans_ isomers

Between the _cis_ and the _trans_ isomer of alkenes, the _trans_ isomer tend to have higher melting point.

In order for the intermolecular forces of attraction to work well in a solid, the molecules must be able to pack together efficiently in the solid state.

* The _trans_ isomer pack better than the _cis_ isomer due to the _higher_ symmetry of the trans isomer. The "_U_" shape of the _cis_ isomer does not pack well compared to the straighter shape of the _trans_ isomer.
* The better packing of the _trans_ isomer in the solid state means that the dispersion forces work more effectively in holding the molecules together when compared to the _cis_ isomer.
* Hence more energy is required to overcome the forces of attraction between _trans_ isomer, leading to a higher melting point.

### Solubility Action

In order for dissolution to occur, the solute molecules and the solvent molecules should have favourable intermolecular forces of attraction.

Non-substituted alkenes can form favourable dispersion forces with non-polar solvents such as benzene and tetrachloromethane. Hence they are soluble in non-polar solvents.

Non-substituted alkenes can only form permanent dipole-induced dipole intermolecular forces with water, which are much weaker than the hydrogen bonding between water molecules themselves (as well as the dispersion forces between non-substituted alkenes molecules). Hence they are insoluble in water.

### Density

liquid alkenes are less dense than water and form an immiscible layer above water. Their densities increase slightly with increasing number of carbon atoms present. This is because the increase in the strength of intermolecular dispersion forces causes the alkene molecules to attract more closely together, resulting in a slightly smaller volume of the liquid. Since \(p\equiv\) m/V, with a larger relative molecular mass, the density of the liquid increases.

### Viscosity

The viscosity of liquid alkenes increases with increasing number of carbon atoms present as the strength of dispersion forces between the molecules increases. In addition, straight-chain alkenes have higher viscosity as compared to branched alkenes.

## 4 REACTIONS OF ALKENES

### Reactivity of alkenes in terms of electrophilic reagents

Even though C=C bond is stronger than C-C bond, alkenes are more reactive than alkanes. This is due to the electron-rich C=C. The \(\pi\) bond (electron cloud), which lies on the surface of the molecules, attracts electrophiles.

During reaction, the weaker \(\pi\) bond is broken instead of the \(\alpha\) bond in the C=C bond. In place, two strong bonds (C=A and C=B) are formed in the product, leaving the carbon atoms joined by a single bond. This typical reaction of alkenes is known as electrophilic addition.

The overall reaction for electrophilic addition of alkenes can be represented as:

### Electrophilic addition

#### 4.1.1 General mechanism of electrophilic addition

Step 1: Initial attack by the \(\pi\) electrons of the C=C bond on the electrophile, forming a positively-charged carbonation intermediate.

Step 2: Subsequent attack of the unstable carbocation intermediate by nucleophile to generate a stable product.

#### 4.1.2 Carbonation intermediate

In electrophilic addition to alkenes, the carbocation is an important intermediate. Before studying the reactions of alkenes, we need to learn more about the structure and factors affecting the stability of carbocations.

The central carbon atom is positively charged and \(sp^{2}\) hybridised. The 3 substituents are arranged in a trigonal planar geometry around the central carbon atom. As the carbon atom has lost an electron, the unhybridised \(p\) orbital is empty.

Due to the positive charge on the carbon atom, the carbon atom is electron-deficient and strongly attracts any nucleophile towards it. And because the geometry around the carbon atom is **planar**, the nucleophiles may **attack from either side of the plane**.

Alkyl groups e.g. methyl (-CH\({}_{3}\)) are considered **electron donating groups**. Therefore, the **more alkyl substituents the carbocation has, the **more stable it would be**, as the **electron donating groups disperse the positive charge on the central carbon atom**.

#### 4.1.3 Electrophilic addition of hydrogen halides (H-X)

The general reaction mechanism of electrophilic addition applied to the reaction between ethene and HBr is illustrated as follows:

* This is the rate-determining step (involves breaking of the \(\pi\) bond).
* As the polar HBr molecule approaches the \(\pi\) electron cloud of ethene in the correct orientation, the high electron density of the \(\pi\) electron cloud "attacks" the electron deficient H atom on the HBr molecule. (*Note: arrow must show the direction of electron movement.)
* The \(\pi\) bond in the C=C bond breaks, forming a new C-H bond. The H-Br bond undergoes heterolytic fission producing a carbocation intermediate and a bromide ion.

### Addition to an unsymmetrical alkene

When a hydrogen halide adds across the double bond of an unsymmetrical alkene, there are two possible products. One of them is preferred over the other. Why is this so?

To explain this observation, we need to look at the 2 possible intermediates that generate each product.

### Markovnikov's rule

The Markovnikov's rule states that in the addition of HX to an alkene, the H atom adds to the C atom of the double bond that holds the greater number of H atoms. Reactions that follow this rule are said to follow Markovnikov orientation and give the Markovnikov product.

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:15]

When a hydrogen halide adds across the double bond of an alkene that produces an intermediate carbocation with 3 different groups attached to it, it produces equal amounts of 2 enantiomers, forming a racemic mixture.

This occurs because the geometry about the positively charged carbon is planar, hence it has equal chances of being attacked from the top or bottom by the bromide ion in the second step, thereby producing the two enantiomers in equimolar ratio.

#### 4.1.4 Electrophilic addition of halogens (X\({}_{2}\))

Alkenes also readily react with chlorine or bromine to form halogenoalkanes with two atoms of halogens attached to adjacent carbon atoms. The reaction with fluorine is very violent while iodine does not react with most alkenes.

Electrophilic addition of halogens can occur in the presence of UV light but the reaction is usually carried out in the absence of UV light to prevent free radical substitution of the alkyl substituents on the alkene or of the product.

For the mechanism, we will use the electrophilic addition of Br\({}_{2}\) to ethene as an example. The mechanism takes place in two steps.

As the non-polar Br\({}_{2}\) molecule approaches the \(\pi\) electron cloud of ethene, the high electron density of the \(\pi\) electron cloud polarises the electron cloud of the Br\({}_{2}\) molecule.

The Br-Br bond undergoes heterolytic fission resulting in a bromide anion with the other bromine atom bonded to the alkene to form a positively charged carbocation intermediate.

This is the rate-determining step as it involves breaking the \(\pi\) bond in ethene and Br-Br bond.

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:18]

This is because the carbocation intermediate is susceptible to attack by any nucleophile present in the reaction mixture.

In the case of bromine water, after forming the carbocation intermediate in the rate-determining step, the carbocation intermediate can be attacked by any nucleophilic in the reaction mixture. So, both water and bromide ion can act as nucleophiles to attack the carbocation. The major product generally depends on which nucleophilic is present in excess.

#### 4.1.6 Electrophilic addition of water/steam

Alkenes react with steam (H\({}_{2}\)O) to form alcohols. The addition of steam to alkenes is similar to that of hydrogen halides. Phosphoric acid is added as a catalyst.

## Appendix A Electronic addition of water/steam mechanism:

Using ethene as an example, the mechanism for the acid-catalysed hydration of ethene is as follows:

_Step 1:_ Protonation of the double bond to form a carbocation.

The hydrogensulfate is then added to cold water. Water acts as a nucleophilic to attack the hydrogensulfate. The -OSO3H group is substituted with -OH group, producing the alcohol and regenerating the sulfuric acid catalyst.
