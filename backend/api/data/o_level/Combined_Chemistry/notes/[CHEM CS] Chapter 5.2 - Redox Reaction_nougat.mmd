IONIC-HALF-EQUATIONS

Steps:

1) Write out the balanced chemical equation for the reaction.

Mg (s) + CuSO\({}_{4}\)(aq) MgSO\({}_{4}\)(aq) + Cu (s)

2) Convert the chemical equation to its ionic equation.

Mg (s) + Cu\({}^{2}\)(aq) + Mg\({}^{2}\)(aq) + Cu (s)

3) identify the substance that undergoes oxidation and reduction respectively.

Ovidation: Mg (s) + Mg\({}^{2}\)(aq)

Reduction: Cu\({}^{2}\)(aq) + Cu (s)

4) Balance the number of charges on both sides of each half-equation using electrons.

Oxidation: Mg (s) + Mg\({}^{2}\)(aq) + 2e\({}^{2}\)

Reduction: Cu\({}^{2}\)(aq) + 2e\({}^{2}\) Cu (s)
