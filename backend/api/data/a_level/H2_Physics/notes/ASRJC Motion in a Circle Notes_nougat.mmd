## 6A Kinematics of Uniform Circular Motion

#### 6.a.1 Angular Displacement \(\theta\)

Consider an object going round a circular path of radius \(r\) from point A to B.

The angular displacement \(\theta\) is the angle the radius sweeps through in a specific direction from a reference line.

\(\theta=\frac{S}{r}\)

Note:

\(\bullet\) Since \(\theta\) is a ratio of a length to another length, it is dimensionless.

\(\theta\) is a vector quantity since it has direction (clockwise / anti-clockwise).

**Definition of a radian:** 1 radian is the angle subtended by an arc of equal length to

the radius.

**Check Your Understanding 3**

What is the relationship between linear velocity \(\nu\), radius of rotation \(r\) and angular velocity \(\omega\)?

#### 6.4.4 Uniform Circular Motion

An object is undergoing uniform circular motion if it moves round a circle with constant speed.

The time it takes to go one revolution is called the period \(T\).

For 1 period \(T\), the angular displacement \(\Delta\theta=2\pi\) rad.

\[\omega=\frac{\Delta\theta}{\Delta t}=\frac{2\pi}{T}\]

The number of **revolutions per unit time** is called the frequency \(f\), with unit Hertz (Hz). Since it takes time \(T\) to make one revolution,

\[f=\frac{1}{T}=\frac{\omega}{2\pi}\quad\text{or}\quad\boxed{\omega=2\pi f}\]

**Check Your Understanding 4**

An object moving with uniform circular motion has a constant velocity. TRUE / FALSE

**Example 1**: Consider the second hand of a clock. Three points A, B and C lie on the second hand.

(a) State and explain the point which has the largest

(i) angular velocity \(\omega\),

(ii) linear speed \(\nu\).

(a) State and explain the point which has the largest

(i) angular velocity \(\omega\),

(ii) linear speed \(\nu\).

(a) **Key questions on objective**

**Do the 3 points experience the same change in angular displacement over time?**

Yes. The 3 points lie along the same radius as they move. Hence their change in angular displacement per unit time is the same.

**Do the 3 points experience the same change in linear displacement over time?**

No. C experiences the largest change in linear displacement since it traces a larger circular arc as it moves. Conversely, A experiences the smallest change in displacement.

(b) Point C is 2.0 cm from the centre of the circle, calculate the

(i) angular velocity of point C,

(ii) linear velocity of point C.

(i) Key question to solve question

What general knowledge do we know about the rotation of the second hand of a clock?

It takes 60 s to go through one round, i.e.

For \(t=T=60\) s, \(\Delta\theta=2\pi\)

**Example 2**

Singapore lies approximately on the Earth's equator. The radius of the Earth is about 6370 km. Calculate the

(i) angular velocity and [\(7.27\times 10^{-5}\) rad s\({}^{-1}\)]

(ii) linear speed, of Singapore. [\(463\) m s\({}^{-1}\)]

(i) _Key question to solve question_

**What general knowledge do we know about the rotation of the Earth about its axis?**

It takes 24 hours for Earth to spin 1 round about its own axis, i.e.

For \(t=T=24\) hours, \(\Delta\theta=2\pi\)

**For a uniform circular motion**

The speed of an object can be constant, but its velocity is changing, if the object's motion changes direction.

The object thus has an acceleration. By Newton's second law, it must have a resultant force acted on it.

## 6C Uniform horizontal circular motion

1) Draw a free body diagram showing all the forces acting on the body.
2) Determine the centre of the circular path.
3) Resolve the forces along two axes:

(i) towards the direction of the centre of the circle

(ii) in a direction perpendicular to the direction in (i)
4) For 3(i), write down a statement for the net force towards the centre of the circular path. **This net force provides the centripetal force**, i.e.

\[F_{net}=\ m\nu\omega^{2}=\ m\nu\omega=\frac{m\nu^{2}}{r}\]
5) For 3(ii), the net force is zero.

**Example 4 (Conical Pendulum)**

In a conical pendulum, a 0.50 kg mass is made to go round a horizontal circle at constant speed. The string is of length 25.0 cm and makes an angle of 30\({}^{\circ}\) with the vertical. Neglect air resistance.

(a) Draw the forces acting on the mass.

(b) Determine

(i) the tension \(T\) in string

[5.66 N]

(ii) the linear speed of the mass [0.841 m s-1]

(iii) the period of oscillation of the mass. [0.934 s]

_Key question on objective:_

**Why doesn't the pendulum move higher up or lower down?**

There must be an equilibrium of forces in the vertical direction.

_Key question to solve the question:_

**The pendulum's motion is subtended by an angle, is there a reason for it?**

With the angle, the tension can be resolved into the vertical and horizontal direction. And since it is in vertical equilibrium, a component of the tension can be equated to weight.

* (d) Calculate the minimum speed of the pair and stone such that the stone will not fall off from the pair. [2.21 m s-1]

_Key questions on solving problem:_

(d) At which position would the stone fall off? What does it mean when the stone will not fall off?

If the stone does not fall off, i.e. stays in contact with pair, the normal reaction force of the pair on the stone must be larger than or equal to zero. The normal reaction force is smallest that the top. \(N\) = 0 when the stone does not fall off.

(a) The pair and stone lose GPE and gains KE when descending, thus speed will increase. On ascending, it gains GPE but loses KE, thus speed will decrease. Hence, its speed is not constant and will not maintain uniform circular motion.

(a) On the diagram of the car below, draw all forces acting on the car. Use symbols to represent the forces. Name the forces.

(b) For the car, write an equation to represent Newton's 2\({}^{\text{nd}}\) law that governs its motion at the top of the circle.

### Cyclist going round a corner

Just like a car, when a cyclist goes round a corner, the friction between the road and the tyre provides the centripetal force.

For dynamic equilibrium, the net moment about the centre of mass must be zero. In this case, the cyclist has an unbalanced clockwise moment about the centre of mass \(G\). The cyclist will topple outwards.

In order for the cyclist to negotiate a bend, he must tilt his bicycle. In the diagram below, the normal contact force \(N\) provides the anti-clockwise moment that balances the clockwise moment due to friction \(f\) about the centre of mass \(G\).

For vertical equilibrium \(N=mg\)

For horizontal motion, by Newton's \(2^{\text{nd}}\) law: \(f=m\frac{\nu^{2}}{r}\)

Also, taking moment about \(G\)\(f\times h\cos\theta=N\times h\sin\theta\)

i.e. \(\tan\theta=\frac{f}{N}=\frac{\nu^{2}}{rg}\)

**Vertical circular motion**

An object is fixed to one end of a light rod which rotates in a vertical circle at constant speed.

Consider the free body diagram of the object when the rod makes an angle \(\theta\) with the vertical.

\[T-mg\cos\theta=\frac{m\nu^{2}}{r}\]

\[\Rightarrow T=m\frac{\nu^{2}}{r}+mg\cos\theta\]

At the bottom (\(\theta\) = 0 and 2\(\pi\) rad), the tension is the greatest:

\[T=m\frac{\nu^{2}}{r}+mg\]

At the top (\(\theta\) = \(\pi\) rad), the tension is the smallest:

\[T=m\frac{\nu^{2}}{r}-mg\]

At the side, \(T=m\frac{\nu^{2}}{r}\)

A graph that represents the variation with angle \(\theta\) of the tension \(T\) in the rod:
