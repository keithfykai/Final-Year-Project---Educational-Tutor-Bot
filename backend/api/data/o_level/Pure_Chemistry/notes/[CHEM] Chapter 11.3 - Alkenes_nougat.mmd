## PHYSICAL PROPERTIES

**Physical frequency**

**As the number of carbon atoms in the alkene increases, the melting and boiling points of alkenes increases as well.**

**Melting and boiling points**

**At the number of carbon atoms in an alkene increases, the size of the molecules are bigger and have stronger intermolecular forces of attraction between each other. As such, more heat energy is needed to overcome the intermolecular forces of attraction between the alkene molecules. Hence, larger alkenes containing more carbon atoms will have higher melting and boiling points.**

**As the number of carbon atoms in the alkene increases, the volatility of alkenes decreases.** (similar to m,p. & b.p.)

**Volatility**

**With a higher relative molecular mass, there would be stronger intermolecular forces of attraction between the alkene molecules. As such, more energy is needed to overcome the intermolecular forces of attraction between the alkene molecules.**

**Hence, larger alkene molecules are less likely to evaporate in room temperature.**

**Density**

**As the number of carbon atoms in the alkene increases, the density of alkenes increases.**

**Viscosity**

**Alkenes with longer hydrocarbon chains flow less easily as they tend to get stuck together.**

**Flammability**

**The larger alkenes contain a higher percentage mass of carbon atoms and would undergo incomplete combustion which results in a smokier flame.**

**Solubility**

**The lower alkanes contain a higher percentage mass of carbon atoms and would undergo incomplete combustion which results in a smokier flame.**

## 11. Combustion

In the presence of excess oxygen, an alkene would undergo

**complete combustion**, producing carbon dioxide and water.

\(2\) C\({}_{3}\)H\({}_{4}+9\)O\({}_{2}\)\(6\) CO\({}_{2}+6\) H\({}_{2}\)O

If there is insufficient oxygen for complete combustion, the alkene would undergo **incomplete combustion**, producing water and carbon monoxide. (similar to alkanes)

\(2\). HYDROGENATION(addition of hydrogen)

\(C\)\(=\)\(C\)\(+\)\(H\)\({}_{2}\)\(H\)\(-\)\(C\)\(-\)H

\(H\)H

\(200^{\circ}\)C and nickel catalyst.

Through the process of hydrogenation, alkenes are converted to alkanes. (E.g. vegetable oils can be converted to margarine.)

**Margarine** is considered a **saturated compound** as it undergoes hydrogenation process and contains no C=C bonds.

3). BROMINATION (addition of aqueous bromine)

**Conditions: Aqueous bromine, room temperature**

When aqueous bromine reacts with alkenes occurs, the reddish-brown solution decolourises to become colourless.

Aqueous bromine is used as a test to distinguish alkanes and alkenes as only alkenes would react with aqueous bromine in the absence of ultraviolet light.

C\({}_{\textbf{{}^{1}}}\)H\({}_{\textbf{{}^{2}}}\)(g) + Br\({}_{\textbf{{}^{2}}}\)(aq) \(\circ\)C\({}_{\textbf{{}^{3}}}\)H\({}_{\textbf{{}^{2}}}\)(l)

**(add aqueous bromine)**

Addition of steam under the right conditions can cause a reaction with the C\(\leq\)C double bond to produce an alcohol containing the -OH functional group.

* 28. What is the structure of the product of the reaction between butene, CH\({}_{3}\)-CH\({}_{2}\)-CH=CH\({}_{2}\), and bromine, Br\({}_{2}\)? (N2016/P1/Q36)
* 1 A CH\({}_{2}\)Br-CH\({}_{2}\)-CH\({}_{2}\)Br-CH\({}_{2}\)H, Br CH\({}_{2}\)-CHBr-CH\({}_{2}\)H, Br CH\({}_{3}\)-CH\({}_{2}\)-CHBr-CH\({}_{2}\)Br ( )
* 51. Which statements about the cracking of hydrocarbons are correct? (N2020/P1/Q36)
* 1 Cracking involves breaking down hydrocarbon molecules.
* 2 One of the products of cracking is always unsaturated.
* 3 Cracking is essential because of the demand for fractions containing smaller molecules.
* A 1 and 2 only **B** 2 and 3 only **D** 1, 2 and 3 ( )

## Answer:

* 51. **D** Statement 1: Cracking involves breaking down of large, saturated hydrocarbon molecules. Statement 2: Cracking produces at least one unsaturated hydrocarbon. Statement 3: One advantage of cracking is that the process produces smaller and more useful molecules which are in demand.
