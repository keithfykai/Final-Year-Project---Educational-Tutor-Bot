## Chapter Analysis

**Key Concept**

Xylem

Phloem

**Translocation**

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:4]

**Vascular Bundle**

**Phloem**

A phloem is made up sieve tube elements and companion cells

Function: **Transport sugars and amino acids** from the leaves to other parts of the plant.

Structure

**Sieve tube elements** have degenerate protoplasm, they have no organelles such as the nucleus or vacuole

There are porous walls between sieve tube elements called sieve plates

**one companion cell** is closely associated with each sieve tube element, which contains organelles and support the the metabolic functions of the sieve tube elements.

Companion cells have many **mitochondria**

Companion cells contain mitochondria that can carry out respiration and release energy for active transport of manufactured food substances from photosynthesis

**Key Concept**

**Root Hair**

**Transpiration**

**Root Hair**

**Water uptake**

1. Soil particles are usually coated with water and dissolved mineral salts.
2. The cell sap in the root hair cells contains sugars and ions thus it has a lower water potential than soil solution
3. Water enter root hair cells from the soil by osmosis.
4. The cell sap of the root hair cell now has a higher water potential than the cell sap in the adjacent cells, thus water moves across to the adjacent cell by osmosis
5. This process continues until the water enters the xylem vessels and moves up the plant.

**Ions and mineral salts uptake**

1. When the concentration of ions and mineral salts in the soil solution is lower than that in the root hair cell sap, they are absorbed by active transport
2. when the concentration of certain ions in the soil solution is higher than that in the root hair cell, they move into the root hair cells by diffusion

## Root Pressure

Water travels from the roots to the leaves against gravity through 3 primary mechanisms:

1. **Root pressure**

Root hair cells pump mineral salts into the xylem vessels using active transport. This lowers the water potential of the xylem vessels, thus water moves from the surrounding cells into the xylem vessels by osmosis, creating a pressure that forces water to move upwards

Not the main mechanism for movement of water in most plants as it can only force water to travel a short distance.

Transpiration

transpiration pull

Transpiration is the **loss of water vapour** from the **stomata** of the leaves **through diffusion**

Transpiration is a consequence of gaseous exchange in plants for photosynthesis to occur

1. For photosynthesis to occur, the **stomata are open for carbon dioxide intake**.
2. Water continuously moves out of the mesophyll cells to form a **thin film of moisture**
3. **Water evaporates** from this thin film of moisture and **moves into the intercellular air spaces**
4. This leads to the **loss of water vapour** from the intercellular air spaces in the leaves as the air **diffuse outside** that has a lower water vapour concentration via the stomata
5. As water evaporates from the mesophyll cells, the **water potential of the cell sap decreases**, thus they **absorb water by osmosis from the xylem vessels**.
6. This results in **transpiration pull**, which is the main force that causes water to travel upwards in plants.

Transpiration pull is important as

* It **draws water and mineral salts from the roots** to the stems and leaves, which is needed for photosynthesis and to keep plants turigl
* **Cooling of the plants** as evaporation of water from the cells in the leaves removes latent heat of vaporisation.

Transpiration

effect on transpiration

1. Effects of **variation of air movement:** if wind is present, it removes the water vapour that accumulates outside the stomata due to transpiration. This leads to **steep concentration gradient** between intracellular air spaces and atmospheric air, thus increasing the rate of transpiration.
2. Effect of **temperature:** Higher surrounding temperature increases the **rate of evaporation** of the thin film of moisture and and also increases the **movement of water molecules**, thus increases the rate of transpiration
3. Effect of **humidity:** Humidity refers to the concentration of water vapour present in the air. A lower humidity means a lower water vapour concentration, thus a steeper concentration gradient between the atmospheric air and intracellular air spaces. This increases the rate of water vapour diffusing out of the leaves thus the rate of transpiration
4. Effect of **light intensity:** Higher light intensity leads to increased **rate of photosynthesis in guard cells** thus causes stomatal opening. When stomata is open, the rate of transpiration will increase Effect of transpiration

wilting

Water lost via transpiration has to be replaced by absorption from the roots to the leaves by xylems

When the rate of water absorption exceeds the rate of transpiration, plant cells become turgid and plant becomes firm and upright.

When the rate of transpiration exceeds the rate of water absorption, plant cells become flaccid and plant wilts.

**Advantages:** When the leaves fold up, the leaves droop and less leaf surface is exposed to the sun thus reducing water loss. Guard cells are flaccid, closing the stroma, further reducing water loss.

**Disadvantages:** When the plant wilts, the leaves droop and less leaf surface is exposed to the sun and thus rate of photosynthesis decreases.
