### Introduction

Physics is an experimental science. Precise and accurate measurements enable the collection of useful experimental data that can be tested against theoretical predictions to refine the development of physical theories. Experimental evidence is the ultimate authority in discriminating between competing physical theories. Scientific knowledge continues to evolve as data from new or improved measurements helps us to better understand and explain physical phenomena.

Measurements are subject to uncertainties, and it is important to estimate these to understand the reliability of the measurements. Error analysis involves estimating the uncertainties in measurements and finding ways to reduce them if necessary. In an experiment, the record of measurements made should include the estimated uncertainties and an analysis of the possible sources of errors with a discussion of steps taken to reduce the uncertainties should be documented. Doing this enables better conclusions to be drawn from the experimental data.

The act of measurement affects the object being measured due to the interaction between the measuring device and the object. Common examples of this include measurements made using a thermometer, voltmeter or ammeter. Thus, improving the accuracy of measurements often requires the use of better instruments and enhanced experimental techniques.

Physicists are very serious about measurements, and the other sciences and society as a whole have benefitted from the spill-over effects of the invention of many amazing measuring devices and techniques. Modern engineering also depends heavily on accurate measurements in areas such as design, construction, optimization and communication. Precise measurements have made many advanced technological applications possible; examples include the study and manipulation of materials, and breakthroughs in fields as diverse as geophysics and biology. Measurements using sophisticated devices like magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanners are important in the medical industry as it provides a wealth of data that aids in clinical diagnosis and influences decisions with regards to treatment.

### Quantities and Units

The laws of Physics are commonly expressed as mathematical relationships among physical quantities and are verified by conducting experiments which involved the measurements of these quantities.

The magnitude of a physical quantity is expressed as a value together with a unit of measurement.

All physical quantities consist of a numerical value and a unit. For "a force of five newtons", force 'F' is the physical quantity, '5 N' is the magnitude with newtons 'N' being the unit.

## S.I. Base Quantities and Units

**Base quantities** are physical quantities that are the most fundamental and they are used to define other physical quantities. Scientists, in the interest of simplicity, chose seven base quantities that give a full description of the physical world.

The _Systeme Internationale d'Unites_ (International System of Units or SI units) is based on the seven base quantities, and their corresponding base units are listed below. In 2019, some of SI base units were redefined. (Use the Internet to find out what they are.)

Derived units are obtained from the base units according to a **defining equation** that relates the physical quantities.

For example, the defining equation for speed \(\nu\) is given by \(\nu=\frac{\kappa}{\nu}\), where \(s\) is distance and \(t\) is time. Hence, the unit of speed is metre per second, i.e. m s\({}^{-1}\).

There is a space between the m and the s\({}^{-1}\). Otherwise, it may be misread as per millisecond (ms\({}^{-1}\)). Units should always be expressed in indices form, e.g. m s\({}^{-2}\) instead of m/s\({}^{2}\).

Other examples of derived units are given below.

\begin{tabular}{c c c c} \hline \hline Derived & Defining equation & Base units & Conrived & Symbol for \\ quantity & & & unit & delayed unit \\ \hline force & force & & (kg) \(\times\) (m \(\times\) s + s) & newton & N \\  & = mass \(\times\) acceleration & = kg m s\({}^{-2}\) & \\ work done & work done & (kg m s\({}^{-2}\)) \(\times\) (m) & joule & J \\  & = force \(\times\) displacement & = kg m\({}^{2}\) s\({}^{-2}\) & \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}

## 4 Homogeneity of Equations

For a physical equation to be operational or meaningful, each term in the equation must have the **same base units** (or _dimensions_). Only quantities with the same base units can be added, subtracted or equated. In other words, each term separated by "+", "-" or "=" sign must have the same base units.

When each of the terms in a physical equation has the same base units, the equation is said to be **homogeneous** or _dimensionally consistent_.

**Example 1**

Analyse whether the equation \(\nu=u+\alpha t\) is homogeneous.

**Example 2**

Analyse whether the equation \(\nu^{2}=u^{2}+2\alpha s^{2}\) is homogeneous.

Checking the homogeneity of an equation using base units is \(\alpha\)-

powerful way of establishing if the physical equation is **plausible**. See Example 4.

**Example 3**

Analyse whether the equation \(s=ut+at^{2}\) is homogeneous.

However, we know that the correct equation that describes how the displacement of an object moving with constant acceleration varies with time is \(s=ut+\frac{1}{2}at^{2}\). Hence, the equation \(s=ut+at^{2}\) is homogenous but is **physically wrong**.

**Note:** An equation which is found to be homogenous **need not be physically correct due to either (i) wrong coefficients/signs, or (ii) missing/additional terms.

**Example 4**

The period \(T\) of a simple pendulum is thought to depend on its length \(L\), its mass \(m\) and the acceleration due to gravity \(g\) according to the equation:

\(T=KL^{x}m^{y}g^{z}\)

where \(k\) is a dimensionless constant (i.e. a constant with no unit).

Deduce the relation between \(T,L,m\) and \(g\) by finding the indices \(x,y\) and \(z\).

**Note:** It is not possible to deduce the value of any constant such as \(k\) through this analysis. Constants can only be determined through more rigorous derivations or experimentations.

### Prefixes, Standard Form and Significant Figures

* Decimal, Sub-multiples or Multiples The following prefixes and their symbols can be used to indicate decimal sub-multiples or multiples of both base and derived units.

### Measuring Instruments and Methods of Measurements

* Resolution

The resolution of an instrument is the smallest graduation on the scale. As the resolution of an instrument increases, the number of significant figures of a measurement increases. For example, the diameter of a coin measured with a micrometer screw gauge (e.g. 2.500 cm) has more s.f. than if it is measured with a metre rule (e.g. 2.5 cm).

For the same instrument, the d.p. of a measurement depends on the unit used. For example, the diameter of the above coin measured with a metre rule can stated as 25 mm (0 d.p.), 2.5 cm (1 d.p.) or 0.025 m (3 d.p.).

* Physical quantity: Measuring Instrument: Resolution

* Length: Metre rule: 0.4 cm [1mm] Vernier calipers: 0.01 cm [0.1 mm] Micrometer screw gauge: 0.001 cm [0.01 mm] Time: 0.01 Digital stopwatch: 0.01 s

* Mass: 0.01 g

* Voltage or current: 0.01 Digital multimeter: 0.01 s

* For digital/electronic meters, measurements are recorded as displayed on the meters.

* Uncertainty: In experiments, uncertainty of a measurement is likely to be larger than the resolution of the instrument used. Uncertainty of a measurement takes into account of factors such as limitations of the methods of measurements and imperfections of objects to be measured.

### Systematic and Random Errors

In the process of taking measurements, we may encounter errors that give rise to incorrect readings. Errors are generally classified as either systematic or random.

* Systematic Errors: Systematic errors: 0.01 [0.01]_Systematic errors_result in all readings or measurements being either always above or always below the true value by a fixed amount.

A systematic error can be **eliminated** if the source of the error is known and accounted for. It cannot be eliminated by repeating the measurements and averaging them.

**Example 8**: A metal cube of side \(L\) has mass \(M\). Its density \(\rho\) can be calculated from \(M=\rho L^{3}\). If \(M=\left(0.065\pm 0.001\right)\) kg and \(L=\left(0.200\pm 0.001\right)\) m, express \(\rho\) with its associated uncertainty.

The simplest way to determine the uncertainty of derived quantity is to use the **upper-lower bound method** of uncertainty propagation.

This method uses the uncertainty ranges of each measurement to calculate the maximum \(Q_{\mathrm{max}}\) and minimum \(Q_{\mathrm{min}}\) values of the derived quantity \(Q\), and then using them to determine the absolute uncertainty \(\Delta Q\) of the derived quantity:

**Worked Example: An angle \(\theta\) is measured using a protractor, where \(\theta=\left(25\pm 1\right)^{\circ}\), and you need to calculate \(Q=\cos\theta\) and its absolute uncertainty \(\Delta Q\). Hence,**

\(Q=\cos 25^{\circ}=0.90631\)

\(Q_{\mathrm{min}}=\cos(25+1)^{\circ}=0.89879\)

\(Q_{\mathrm{max}}=\cos(25-1)^{\circ}=0.91355\)

\(\Delta Q=\frac{Q_{\mathrm{max}}-Q_{\mathrm{min}}}{2}=0.91355-0.89879\)

\(\therefore Q=0.906\pm 0.007\) (both numbers must have the same d.p.).

**Note: This method is especially useful when the relationship between the variables is complex.**

**Example 7(ii) Using Upper-Lower Bound Method**

**Example 9**: The equation connecting object distance \(u\), image distance \(\nu\) and focal length \(f\) for a lens is

\[\frac{1}{u}+\frac{1}{\nu}=\frac{1}{f}.\]

A student measures values of \(u\) and \(\nu\), with their associated uncertainties, which are

\[\begin{array}{l}u=50\ \mathrm{mm}\pm 3\ \mathrm{mm},\\ \nu=200\ \mathrm{mm}\pm 5\ \mathrm{mm}.\end{array}\]

Determine the value \(f\) and its associated uncertainty \(\Delta f\).

**Example 10**: A boat is travelling due north with a velocity \(v_{\rm SW}\) of 4.00 m s\({}^{-1}\) relative to the water. The current in the water is flowing at a velocity \(v_{\rm ws}\) of 2.00 m s\({}^{-1}\) in an easterly direction relative to the shore. Determine the velocity \(V_{\rm SS}\) of the boat relative to the shore.

**Example 11**: An object was initially moving with a constant speed of 20 m s\({}^{-1}\) towards the east. It changed direction and moved with a constant speed of 10 m s\({}^{-1}\) in the north-easterly direction. Calculate the change in velocity.

## 5 Resolution of Vectors

Any vector can be resolved into two components that are perpendicular to each other.

The orientation of the axes are usually

(i) _vertical_ and _horizontal_, or

(ii) _parallel_ and _perpendicular_ to a slope.

The magnitude of a component is smaller than that of the vector (unless the vector lies along an axis).

The original vector forms the hypotenuse of the right-angle triangle.

Just as a vector can be "broken" into two components, these components can be "recombined" to give the magnitude and direction of the vector.

## 3 Strategies For Adding Multiple Vectors

When two or more vectors are added, the following procedures can be applied to determine the resultant vector:

1. Choose a convenient orientation of the \(x\)-\(y\) coordinate system.
2. Draw all vectors starting from the origin with the appropriate lengths and directions.
3. Determine the \(x\)- and \(y\)-components of all vectors.
4. Determine the resultant components along the \(x\)- and \(y\)-axis.
5. Apply Pythagoras theorem to find the magnitude of the resultant vector.
6. Apply trigonometry to find the angle that the resultant vector makes with the \(x\)- or \(y\)-axis, or any other reference line.

**Note:**

The resultant vector is independent of the orientation of the \(x\)-\(y\) axes.

**Example 13**:

The figure below shows four forces acting at a point P. Calculate the resultant force on P by resolving each force in two perpendicular directions.

The resultant force is 9.01 N, acting at an angle 63.6 clockwise from the 3.0 N force.

### Summary

* S.I. Units

The seven **base units** are: metre (m), kilogram (kg), second (s), ampere (A), kelvin (K), mole (mol) and candela (cd).

Derived units are defined in terms of base units. They are expressed as products or quotients of base units.

An equation is said to be **homogeneous** or **dimensionally consistent** if every term on both sides of the equation has the same base units.

A homogeneous equation may not be physically correct.

* Errors and Uncertainties

Systematic errors result in all readings or measurements being either always above or always below the true value by a fixed amount.

Random errors result in readings or measurements being scattered about a mean value. These errors have equal probability of being positive or negative.

Accuracy is the degree of closeness of the mean value of the measurements to the true value. It is affected by systematic error.

Precision is the degree of agreement between repeated measurements of the same quantity. It is affected by random error.

* Calculating Uncertainties of Derived Quantities

* The absolute uncertainty is expressed to 1 s.f. and the quantity is expressed to the same d.p. as that of the absolute uncertainty.

Fractional and percentage uncertainty can be expressed to 2 s.f.

* Scalars and Vectors

A scalar quantity has a magnitude only.

A vector quantity has both a magnitude and a direction.
