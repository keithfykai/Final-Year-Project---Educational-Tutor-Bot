## Introduction

* In the previous topic on Current of Electricity, physical quantities such as electromotive force (e.m.f.), potential difference (p.d), current (_l_), resistance (_R_) and internal resistance (_r_) in electric circuits were discussed.
* This topic on Direct Current (D.C.) Circuits involves electric circuits with current that flows in one direction.

_Candidates should be able to solve problems using the formula for the combined resistance of two or more resistors in parallel._

### Resistors in parallel

Consider 2 resistors, \(R_{i}\) and \(R_{2}\), connected in parallel, as shown in Fig. 3,

The p.d. \(V\) across both resistors is the same because they are across the same 2 points A and B. Hence,

\(I_{1}=\dfrac{V}{R_{1}}\) (3)

\(I_{2}=\dfrac{V}{R_{2}}\) (4)

To find the combined resistance of \(R_{i}\) and \(R_{2}\), re-draw Fig. 3 using a single combined resistance \(R\) between the points A and B. If the total current \(I\) is flowing between the points A and B, then the effective resistance \(R\) is given by

\(I=\dfrac{V}{R}\) (5)

In the parallel circuit, the total current is the sum of the individual currents

\(I=I_{1}+I_{2}\) (6)

Combining equations (3), (4), (5) into (6),

\(\dfrac{V}{R}\)=\(\dfrac{V}{R_{1}}+\dfrac{V}{R_{2}}\)

Cancelling \(V\), we can easily calculate the combined resistance using:

\(\dfrac{1}{R}\)=\(\dfrac{1}{R_{1}}+\dfrac{1}{R_{2}}\) (7)

This equation can be extended to as many resistors as there are in parallel.

\(\dfrac{1}{R}\)=\(\dfrac{1}{R_{1}}+\dfrac{1}{R_{2}}+\)... + \(\dfrac{1}{R_{N}}\) (8)

(where \(N\) is number of resistors connected in parallel)

Note: The effective resistance is always less than the smallest resistance in the parallel network.

Figure 3: Resistors in parallel

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:5]

For circuits involving many resistors connected in a combination of series and parallel network, more steps are required to determine the effective resistance of the overall circuit.

**Example 2**

The circuit diagram shows a network of five identical resistors, each of resistance \(R\).

Calculate the effective resistance between points X and Y in terms of \(R\).

**Solution:**

Some circuits are not easy to understand, and must be redrawn to see the series or parallel relationship between the resistors. Example 3 is an illustration:

**Example 3**

Three resistors are connected as shown in the diagram using connecting wires of negligible resistance. Calculate the resistance between points P and Q.

**Solution:**

Hints: 1) Consider the three paths which a current from P can flow to Q.

2) Current flows from higher potential to lower potential.

The above circuit can be arranged as three resistors in parallel.

**2.3 Variable resistors**

1. Rheostat A rheostat consists of a coil of resistance wire wound around an insulator cylinder. There are 3 terminals. A sliding contact varies the length of resistance wire which the current passes through. Recall that the resistance of a wire \(R\) can be written as: \(R=\frac{\rho l}{A}\)\(l\): length, \(A\): cross-sectional area, \(\rho\): resistivity of the material
2. Light dependent resistor (LDR) or photoconductive cell A LDR is a semiconductor whose resistance decreases as light intensity (illumination) falling on it increases. This is because electromagnetic radiation energy of light is absorbed to break the bonds between atoms and bound electrons. With more mobile charge carriers (negatively-charged electrons and positively-charged holes), the resistance of the semiconductor decreases.
3. Thermistor A thermistor is made of a semiconductor material which has resistance that changes according to the surrounding temperature. Commonly used thermistors have a negative temperature coefficient, i.e. the resistance decreases as temperature increases.

_(e)_: _Candidates should be able to solve problems involving series and parallel circuits for one source of e.m.f._

Examples 1 to 3 are partial circuit diagrams which show only the resistors and not the e.m.f. sources. Partial diagrams are used mainly for calculating the combined or effective resistance between 2 points in the circuit. If we need to calculate more details such as the current or potential difference across parts of the circuit, the circuit diagram needs to be drawn with the e.m.f. source.

**Example 4**

In the circuit shown, each of the resistors X and Y has resistance 6.0 \(\Omega\). The cell C has e.m.f. 12 V and internal resistance 1.0 \(\Omega\).

Calculate

**(a)**: the total resistance of the circuit,

**(b)**: the current through cell C and the current though resistor Y.

**Solution:**

**(a)**: Since X and Y are parallel to each other.

Effective resistance of X and Y = \(\dfrac{6}{2}\)

= 3.0 \(\Omega\)

Total resistance of circuit = 3.0 + 1.0 = 4.0 \(\Omega\)

**(b)**: Current through cell C = \(\dfrac{12}{4}\) = 3.0 A

Since current splits equally at the junction before flowing through X and Y,

current through Y is 1.5 A.

**Example 5**

The diagram shows a bulb and ammeter connected to a cell with an e.m.f. of 2.0 V and negligible internal resistance.

If the bulb and ammeter has a resistance of 5.0 \(\Omega\) each, determine the ammeter reading.

**Solution:**

Combined resistance = 5.0 + 5.0 = 10.0 \(\Omega\)

Ammeter reading = \(\dfrac{2.0}{10.0}\)

= 0.20 A * _Candidates should be able to show an understanding of the use of a potential divider circuit as a source of variable p.d._ An e.m.f. source usually provides an e.m.f. supply of a fixed value. A potential divider can be used to supply a variable p.d. across 2 points in a circuit. It is frequently used to control the temperature in a freezer, monitor changes in light in a room or as audio volume controls,

### The Potential divider principle

By connecting 2 wires with 2 terminals across one of the 2 resistors, say \(R_{i}\), the p.d. across \(R_{i}\) can be obtained. This p.d. \(V_{i}\) can be easily adjusted by varying the ratio of \(R_{i}\) and \(R_{2}\). \(V_{i}\) therefore becomes a variable source of p.d. The circuit above is call the potential divider as it divides the e.m.f. source \(E\) across resistors \(R_{i}\) and \(R_{2}\). Apply \(V=IR\) to obtain the following 2 equations:

\(E=I\left(R_{i}+R_{2}\right)\) (1) \(V_{i}=IR_{i}\) (2) \(\frac{(2)}{(1)}\) \(\Rightarrow\)\(\frac{V_{i}}{E}=\frac{R_{i}}{R_{i}+R_{2}}\)

Hence we get \(V_{i}=\frac{R_{i}}{R_{i}+R_{2}}\times E\)

Note that \(V_{i}\) depends on the ratio \(\frac{R_{i}}{R_{i}+R_{2}}\).

Figure 4: Potential divider

**Example 6**

The diagram shows two resistors connected in a circuit with a power supply and voltmeter.

What range of voltages can be obtained between points X and Y?

**A**: zero to 1.0 V

**B**: zero to 6.0 V

**C**: 1.0 V to 5.0 V

**D**: 1.0 V to 6.0 V

**Solution:**

When variable resistor is set to zero, p.d. across 15 k\(\Omega\) is \(\left(\dfrac{15}{15+0}\right)6.0=6.0\) V.

When variable resistor is set to 75 k\(\Omega\), p.d. across 15 k\(\Omega\) is \(\left(\dfrac{15}{15+75}\right)6.0=1.0\) V.

Answer: **D**

**Example 7**

The diagram below shows a potential divider circuit involving a fixed 1.0 k\(\Omega\) resistor and a rheostat with a maximum resistance of 4.0 k\(\Omega\). By adjusting the position of contact X, the circuit can be used to provide a variable potential difference between the terminals P and Q. Calculate the limits (minimum and maximum) of this variable potential difference between P and Q.

**Solution:**

When contact X is moved to the top end of the rheostat, the resistance between PQ is max, at 4.0 k\(\Omega\), therefore p.d. between PQ, \(V_{\text{PQ}}=\dfrac{4}{1+4}(25)=20\) V.

When contact X is moved to the bottom end of the rheostat, the resistance between PQ is min, at 0.0 k\(\Omega\), therefore p.d. between PQ, \(V_{\text{PQ}}=\dfrac{0}{1+4}(25)=0\) V.

The limits of potential difference between P and Q are 0 V and 20 V.

**Example 8**: A potential divider has a constant supply of 6.0 V as shown in the diagrams.

Which circuit will provide a potential difference between X and Y that can be varied between zero and 3.0 V?

**Solution:**

In option B, when the movable contact X is at the highest position, the p.d. between X and Y is zero. When the movable contact X is at the lowest position, the p.d. between X and Y is \(\left(\dfrac{R}{R+R}\right)\)6.0 = 3.0 V.

In options A, C and D, the range is between 3.0 V and 6.0 V.

Answer: **B**

**Example 9**: A rheostat with a length of 4\(L\) and maximum resistance of 4.0 k\(\Omega\) is connected in series to a 8.0 V supply. With contact X at the position shown below, calculate

**(a)** the potential difference across points P and Q,

**(b)** the potential at point P.

**Solution:**

**(a)**\(V_{\text{PO}}\) = \(\left(\dfrac{3}{1+3}\right)\)(8.0) = 6.0 V

**(b)** Let the negative terminal of the 8.0 V supply be a reference of potential of 0 V.

Therefore \(V_{\text{O}}\) = +8.0 V

\(V_{\text{P}}\) = +8.0 - 6.0

\(=\) +2.0 V

### Variable p.d. using light dependent resistors and thermistors

* _Candidates should be able to explain the use of thermistors and light dependent resistors in potential divider circuits to provide a potential difference which is dependent on temperature and illumination respectively._ In Example 7, a rheostat is used to provide a variable output p.d. Devices like LDRs and thermistors can also provide variable output p.d. This is because the resistance of the LDR changes with light intensity, and the resistance of the thermistor changes with temperature.

#### 3.2.1 Light dependent resistor (LDR) or photoconductive cell

Recall that the resistance of a LDR decreases as light intensity (illumination) falling on it increases.

Fig. 5 and Fig. 6 show 2 ways of using a LDR to obtain a variable p.d. which varies according to light intensity. Each circuit serves a different purpose.

Burdar Alarm

In Fig. 5, two wires connected across the fixed resistor give a \(V_{\text{output}}\) of

\[V_{\text{output}}=\frac{R}{R_{\text{L}}+R}\times E\]

During a break in at night, if the burglar's torch shines light on the LDR, \(R_{\text{L}}\) decreases. Hence \(V_{\text{output}}\) increases. If this \(V_{\text{output}}\) is applied across a siren, the siren will be activated when \(V_{\text{output}}\) reaches a certain value.

Auto-ON night light

Fig. 6, two wires connected across the LDR give a \(V_{\text{output}}\) of

\[V_{\text{output}}=\frac{R_{\text{L}}}{R_{\text{L}}+R}\times E\]

As the sun sets, light intensity decreases and \(R_{\text{L}}\) increases. Hence \(V_{\text{output}}\) across the LDR increases. If this \(V_{\text{output}}\) is applied across a lamp, it will light up when \(V_{\text{output}}\) reaches a certain value.

#### 3.2.2 Thermistors

Recall that a thermistor (or thermally sensitive resistor) is made of a semiconductor material which has resistance that changes according to the surrounding temperature.

For a thermistor with a negative temperature coefficient, its resistance \(R_{\mathrm{T}}\) decreases as temperature increases.

Fig. 7 and Fig. 8 show 2 ways of using a thermistor to obtain a variable p.d. which varies according to temperature. Each circuit serves a different purpose.

Temperature detection fire alarm

Fig. 7, two wires connected across the fixed resistor give a \(V_{\mathrm{output}}\) of

\[V_{\mathrm{output}}=\frac{R}{R_{\mathrm{T}}+R}\times E\]

During a fire, the temperature increases and \(R_{\mathrm{T}}\) decreases. Hence \(V_{\mathrm{output}}\) across the fixed resistor increases. If this \(V_{\mathrm{output}}\) is applied across a siren, the siren will be activated when \(V_{\mathrm{output}}\) reaches a certain value.

Ice and snow melting device for frost protection

Fig. 8, two wires connected across the thermistor give a \(V_{\mathrm{output}}\) of

\[V_{\mathrm{output}}=\frac{R_{\mathrm{T}}}{R_{\mathrm{T}}+R}\times E\]

During winter, the temperature decreases and \(R_{\mathrm{T}}\) increases. Hence \(V_{\mathrm{output}}\) across the thermistor increases. If this \(V_{\mathrm{output}}\) is applied across a heater, the heater will turn on when \(V_{\mathrm{output}}\) reaches a certain value.

**Example 11**:

**(a)** Determine the ammeter reading shown in the diagram.

**Solution:**

Let the negative terminal of the 3.0 V cell

be a reference of potential of 0 V.

p.d.across 1.0 \(\Omega\) resistor

=\(\left(\frac{1.0}{1.0+2.0}\right)\)(3.0) = 1.0 V

p.d.across 4.0 \(\Omega\) resistor

=\(\left(\frac{4.0}{4.0+8.0}\right)\)(3.0) = 1.0 V

Since the potential at X and Y are both +2.0 V, no current flows through the ammeter.

Therefore the ammeter reading is zero.
**(b)** AB is a uniform resistance wire with a length of 100 cm. It is attached on a metre rule with one end at the 0 cm mark and the other at the 100 cm mark.

In the following diagram, which point of wire AB should the galvanometer be connected to so as to give a zero reading?

**Solution:**

p.d.across the 1.0 \(\Omega\) resistor = \(\left(\frac{1.0}{1.0+2.0}\right)\)(3.0) = 1.0 V

If the galvanometer reading is zero,

p.d.across AY = p.d across the 1.0 \(\Omega\) resistor

\(\left(\frac{R_{\text{AY}}}{R_{\text{AB}}}\right)\)(3.0) = 1.0 V

\(\left(\frac{\rho L_{\text{AY}}}{A}\right)\)(3.0) = 1.0 V

\(\left(\frac{L_{\text{AY}}}{L_{\text{AB}}}\right)\)(3.0) = 1.0 V

\(\left(\frac{L_{\text{AY}}}{100}\right)\)(3.0) = 1.0 V

\(L_{\text{AY}}=33\) cm

Hence point Y should be connected to the 33 cm mark.

**Example 12**

A potentiometer consists of a dry cell (e.m.f. of 4.0 V and internal resistance of 0.4 \(\Omega\)) connected to a 1.0 \(\Omega\) resistor, and a uniform wire AB of length 100 cm and resistance 3.4 \(\Omega\).

The circuit to be investigated consists of a dry cell of e.m.f \(E\), connected in series to a 1.0 \(\Omega\) resistor and a switch S.

**(a)** Complete the diagram by drawing 2 wires, a jockey and a galvanometer to show how the potentiometer can be used to balance the dry cell.
**(b)** The balanced length (measured from point A) is 53 cm, when switch S is opened, and 50 cm when S is closed.

Determine the e.m.f. \(E\) and the terminal potential \(V_{\tau}\), when S is closed.

**Solution:**

**(b)** Applying the potentiometer equation,

\[\begin{split} V_{AC}=&\left(\frac{L_{AC}}{L_{AB}} \right)V_{AB}\hskip 28.452756pt\text{where}\hskip 8.535827ptV_{AB}=& \left(\frac{3.4}{0.4+1.0+3.4}\right)\times 4.0\\ =&\frac{L_{AC}}{100}\times&\left(\frac{3.4}{0.4+1.0+3.4}\right)\times 4.0\\ \end{split}\]

When S is opened, \(V_{AC}=\frac{53}{100}\times&\left(\frac{3.4}{0.4+1.0+3.4}\right) \times 4.0=1.5\) V

When S is closed, \(V_{AC}^{\prime}=\frac{50}{100}\times&\left(\frac{3.4}{0.4+1.0+3.4}\right)\times 4.0=1.4\) V

Therefore \(E\) = 1.5 V and \(V_{\tau}\)=1.4 V

**Example 13**: A potentiometer consists of a 2.0 V dry cell with negligible internal resistance, a 5.0 \(\Omega\) resistor, and a uniform wire AB of length 1.00 m and resistance 10.0 \(\Omega\). The potentiometer is used to measure the e.m.f \(E\), and internal resistance \(r\), of a dry cell.

**(a) Complete the diagram by drawing 2 wires, a jockey and a galvanometer to show how the potentiometer can be used to balance the dry cell.**

**(b) If the balanced length (measured from point A) is 23.0 cm, calculate the value of \(E\).**

**Solution:**

**(a)**

**(b) Applying the potentiometer equation,**

\[V_{AC} =\frac{L_{AC}}{L_{AB}}\times\left(\frac{R_{AB}}{R_{AB}+R}\right) \times E_{other}\] \[=\frac{23}{100}\times\left(\frac{10}{10+5}\right)\times 2.0=0.31\ \text{V}\]

**In this setup, no current flows through the external circuit when it is balanced.**

**Hence,** \(V_{AC}=E\)

**Therefore** \(E\) **= 0.31 V**

**(c)** The external circuit is modified to include a 0.5 \(\Omega\) resistor connected to the dry cell in **(a)**.

If the new balance length (measured from point A) is 12.6 cm, calculate \(r\), the internal resistance of the dry cell.

**Solution :**

Applying the potentiometer equation,

\(V_{\text{AC}}=\dfrac{L_{\text{AC}}}{L_{\text{AB}}}\times\left(\dfrac{R_{\text{ AB}}}{R_{\text{AB}}+R}\right)\times E\)

\(V_{\text{AC}}=\dfrac{12.6}{100}\times\left(\dfrac{10}{10+5}\right)\times 2.0=0.168\) V

Consider the external circuit,

\(V_{\text{MN}}=\left(\dfrac{0.5}{0.5+r}\right)\times E=\left(\dfrac{0.5}{0.5+r} \right)\times 0.31\)

When the setup is balanced, \(V_{\text{AC}}=V_{\text{MN}}\),

\(0.168=\left(\dfrac{0.5}{0.5+r}\right)\times 0.31\)

\(r=0.423\)\(\Omega\)Important points to note when using the potentiometer:

When connecting the potentiometer to the external circuit,

1. the higher potential ends of the e.m.f. sources of both the potentiometer and the external circuit must be jointed to the same end of the potentiometer wire.
2. the driver cell e.m.f. \(E_{driver}\) must be larger than the e.m.f. source of the external circuit.
3. to find the balanced point, the jockey is lightly tapped (and not slide or pressed) along the potentiometer wire. This is to ensure that the wire's circular cross sectional area is kept uniform.
4. If the driver e.m.f. is much larger than the potential difference to be measured, for example: \[E_{driver}=5\;\mathrm{V}\;\mathrm{but}\;V_{AC}=5\;\mathrm{mV},\] Then the **balanced length**\(L_{AC}\) will be very small : \[\frac{V_{AC}}{V_{AB}}=\frac{L_{AC}}{L_{AB}}\] \[\frac{5\times 10^{-3}}{5}=\frac{L_{AC}}{100\;\mathrm{cm}}\] \[L_{AC}=0.1\;\mathrm{cm}\] The percentage error in the measurement of \(L_{AC}\) = \(\frac{0.2\;\mathrm{cm}}{0.1\;\mathrm{cm}}\times 100\%=200\%\) To reduce this percentage error, a fixed resistor of high resistance can be connected in series so that the potential difference across wire AB is greatly reduced.

For example, if \(R=100\;\Omega\), \(R_{AB}=1\;\Omega\), then \(V_{AB}=\left(\frac{1}{1+100}\right)\times 5.0=0.05\;\mathrm{V}\) The balanced length will be shorter: \(\frac{V_{AC}}{V_{AB}}=\frac{L_{AC}^{\prime}}{L_{AB}}\)

\[\frac{5\times 10^{-3}}{0.05}=\frac{L_{AC}^{\prime}}{100\;\mathrm{cm}}\] \[L_{AC}^{\prime}=10\;\mathrm{cm}\]

The percentage error in the balanced length \(L_{AC}\) is reduced to, \(\frac{0.2\;\mathrm{cm}}{10\;\mathrm{cm}}\times 100\%=2\%\)

### Applications of potentiometer: To measure very small e.m.f.

A thermocouple is a device for measuring temperature. Fig. 12 shows the 2 ends of the thermocouple placed in two beakers at different temperatures. A very small e.m.f. of a few millivolts is produced in the thermocouple.

To measure the small e.m.f. using a potentiometer, a large resistance \(R\) is connected in series with the potentiometer wire.

**Example 14**

The diagram shows a simple potentiometer circuit to measure a small e.m.f. produced by a thermocouple. The meter wire PQ has a resistance of 5.0 \(\Omega\) and length of 1.00 m. The driver cell has an e.m.f. of 2.0 V. If the balance point is obtained 0.60 m along PQ when measuring an e.m.f. of 6.0 mV, calculate the value of resistance \(R\).

**Solution:**

Applying the potentiometer equation,

\[V_{\text{thermocouple}}=\frac{L_{\text{PC}}}{L_{\text{PQ}}}\times\left(\frac{ R_{\text{PQ}}}{R_{\text{PQ}}+R}\right)\times E_{\text{driver}}\]

\[6.0\times 10^{-3}=\frac{60}{100}\times\left(\frac{5.0}{5.0+R}\right)\times 2.0\]

\[R=995\;\Omega\]

Figure 12: Potentiometer connected to a thermocouple

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:23]

**Example 15**

The figure below shows a circuit used to compare the resistance \(R\) of an unknown resistor with a 100 \(\Omega\) standard resistor. A galvanometer is used to obtain the balance length, \(l\). The balance lengths \(l\) are 400 mm and 588 mm when the galvanometer is connected to Y and to Z respectively. The length of the wire is 1.00 m.

Calculate the value of resistance \(R\).

**Solution:**

Using the concept \(\frac{l_{\mathrm{Y}}}{l_{\mathrm{Z}}}=\frac{R_{\mathrm{Y}}}{R_{\mathrm{Z}}}\),

When galvanometer is connected to Y, \(l_{\mathrm{Y}}\) = 400 mm and \(R_{\mathrm{Y}}\) = 100 \(\Omega\),

When galvanometer is connected to Z, \(l_{\mathrm{Z}}\) = 588 mm and \(R_{\mathrm{Z}}\) = 100 \(\Omega+R\),

Taking ratio, we get \(\frac{400}{588}=\frac{100}{100+R}\)

Hence, \(R=47\)\(\Omega\)
