## 6. Conjugate Acid-Base Pair

The **product formed from an acid** is known as the **conjugate base** of the acid and the **product formed from a base** is known as the **conjugate acid** of the base.

The **stronger the acid**, the **weaker its conjugate base** is **The stronger the base**, the **weaker its conjugate acid** is **TYPES OF ACID**

**Monoprotic or **monobasic acids** can **denote only one H+ per molecule**.

**Polyprotic acids have more than one H+ per molecule. They dissociate in water to form H+ in a stepwise manner.**

## 7. Types of Base

**Monoprotic or **monocatalytic bases** can **accept only one H+ per molecule.

**Polyprotic base** can **accept more than one H+ per molecule. They accepts H+ in a stepwise manner.

## Variation of K with Temperature

H\({}_{2}\)O + H\({}_{2}\)O \(\rightleftharpoons\) H\({}_{3}\)O\({}^{+}\) + OH ; \(\Delta\)H\(>\)0

* When **temperature increase**, the equilibrium will shift to the right to absorb heat, **producing more H\({}_{3}\)O\({}^{+}\)** and OH 'ions**.
* Hence both [H\({}_{3}\)O\({}^{+}\)] and [OH\(+\)] increases, which result in an increase in K\({}_{w}\).
* **pH of water also decreases** when **temperature increase**, however this does not mean that water is becoming more acidic.
* **Water remains neutral** as there is still an equal concentration of H\({}_{3}\)O\({}^{+}\) and OH ions.

_Note: Linking K\({}_{w}\) with Chapter 9: Chemical Equilibria_

## Dissociation Constant of Acid & Base* **Strong Acid/Base dissociates completely in aqueous solution. For a strong monoptic acid, [acid] = [H\({}_{3}\)O\({}^{+}\)] For a strong **diprotietic acid**, [2x(acid) = [H\({}_{3}\)O\({}^{+}\)] For a strong **monoptic** acid, [base] = [OH\({}^{+}\)] For a strong **diprotietic base**, [2x(base) = [H\({}_{3}\)O\({}^{+}\)]
* **Weak Acid/Base dissociates partially in aqueous solution. We need to make use of K\({}_{3}\)/K\({}_{6}\) Step 2a: Write the reaction equation for the dissociation of the weak acid/base Step 2b: Complete the I.C.E Table

_Note: Recap the writing of I.C.E Table in Chapter 9: Chemical Equilibria_

Step 2c: Obtain the [H\({}_{3}\)O\({}^{+}\)] (OH) from K\({}_{6}\)/K\({}_{6}\)

_Note: For polyprototic acid/base, there will be more than one K\({}_{3}\)/K\({}_{6}\). To determine which K\({}_{3}\)/K\({}_{6}\) to use, always refer back to the starting reagent in the reaction equation._Buffer Solution

A buffer solution is a solution in which its pH remains

**almost unchanged** on the **addition of a small**

**amount** of acid or base.

It consist of a weak acid/base and its conjugate

base/acid

**ACIDIC BUFFER**

An **acidic buffer** solution is made up of a **weak acid**

and its **conjugate base**.

**BASIC BUFFER**

A **basic buffer** solution is made up of a **weak base**

and its **conjugate acid**.

## Using of Equations to Illustrate the Buffering Effects

**Acidic buffer (HA, A)**

When small amount of acid is added: A + H3O* \(\rightarrow\) HA + H2O

When small amount of base is added: HA + OH \(\rightarrow\) A + H2O

**Basic buffer (B, BH+)**

When small amount of acid is added: B + H3O* \(\rightarrow\) BH+ + H2O

When small amount of base is added: BH+ + OH \(\rightarrow\) B + H2O

_Note: when writing equations, make sure that the products formed from the reaction must already be present in the buffer solution_
When small amount of acid is added: The **addition of H\({}_{3}\)O\({}^{*}\)** to the buffer solution will **react with the basic conjugate base**, **A**, that is present in the solution. The **formation of H\({}^{*}\)** is **negligible** as compared to the **large reservoir of H\({}^{*}\)** already present in the solution. Hence the [H\({}_{3}\)O\({}^{*}\)] in the buffer solution does not increase much and the pH of the solution is maintained.

When small amount of base is added: The **addition of OH\({}_{3}\)O\({}^{*}\)** to the buffer solution will **react with the acid**, H\({}_{3}\)O\({}^{*}\)** to the buffer solution will **react with the acid**, H\({}^{*}\)**, present in the solution. The **regligible** as compared to the **large reservoir of H\({}^{*}\)** already present in the solution. Hence the [H\({}_{3}\)O\({}^{*}\)] in the buffer solution does not increase much and the pH of the solution is maintained.

When small amount of acid is added: The **addition of OH\({}_{3}\)O\({}^{*}\)** to the buffer solution will **react with the acid** conjugate acid**, **BH\({}^{*}\)**, present in the solution. The **formation of B\({}^{*}\)** is **negligible** as compared to the **large reservoir of B\({}^{*}\)** already present in the solution. Hence the [OH] in the buffer solution does not increase much and the pH of the solution is maintained.

## 5 Titration with polyprotic acid/base:

Courses

Neutralisation takes place in more than one step as the polyprotic acid/base dissociate in water to form H\({}^{\prime}\)/ accepts H\({}^{\prime}\) in a stepwise manner

For a dibasic weak acid or diadic weak base, the titration curve will have two equivalence point and two buffering regions.

Two different indicator will be required depending on the pH of the two equivalence points.
