WAVE MOTION

WAVE MOTION

A wave motion is a method of transferring energy from one point to another, without any physical transfer of material.

The hand generates kinetic energy, hence it is the source.

The kinetic energy is transferred in the form of a wave motion to the other end of the rope.

Kinetic energy is transferred but the rope is unchanged.

There are two types of waves: **transverse waves & longitudinal waves.**

## 6 Bonus killer question review

The diagram show a water wave moving from a deep region to a shallow region. Why does the wavelength, \(\mathbf{\lambda}\), changes?

## 7 Explanation

As water waves moves from a deeper region to a shallower region, the wavelength changes.

As the water waves approach the **shallower region**, it experiences **more friction**.

As a result, the **wave speed, \(\mathbf{v}\), is reduced**.

Since,

\[\mathbf{v}=\mathbf{\beta}\]

When \(\mathbf{v}\) is lowered, the wavelength, \(\mathbf{\lambda}\), is also lowered.

Hence, **as water waves moves from a deep region to a shallower region, its wavelength shortens.**

*Please note that the frequency is unchanged as the frequency is dependable only on the source of the wave motion.
