## Chapter 5 Work, Energy and Power

_"There is a fact, or if you wish, a law governing all natural phenomena that are known to date. There is no known exception to this law - it is exact so far as we know. The law is called the conservation of energy._

_It states that there is a certain quantity, which we call "energy" that does not change in the manifold changes that nature undergoes. That is a most abstract idea, because it is a mathematical principle; it says there is a numerical quantity which does not change when something happens._

_It is not a description of a mechanism, or anything concrete; it is a strange fact that when we calculate some number and when we finish watching nature go through her tricks and calculate the number again, it is the same._

_It is important to realize that in physics today, we have no knowledge of what energy "is." We do not have a picture that energy comes in little blobs of a definite amount. It is not that way. It is an abstract thing in that it does not tell us the mechanism or the reason for the various formulas."_

### Work

The meaning of 'work' in physics differs from everyday usage. Work done by a force acting on a body refers to the amount of energy that was transferred to the body by the agent that exerts the force.

A person holding a heavy book at rest may feel that he is doing work as he feels tired after a while but, although he is exerting a force on the book, there is no energy transferred to the book as a result and hence the work done on the book by him is zero.

#### 5.1.1 Work done by a constant force

Consider a constant force \(F\) acting on a body over a period of time, during which the object has a displacement \(s\) in the direction of the force.

The work done BY the force ON the body is defined as the **product of the magnitude of the force \(F\) and the displacement \(s\) in the direction of the force.**

For the general case when the displacement is not in the direction of the constant force, the work done by the force is the product of the displacement and the component of the force in the direction of the displacement, or, equivalently, the product of the force and the component of the displacement that is in the direction of the force. As can be seen below, both have the same mathematical expression.

\[W=F\ s_{i^{\prime}}=F\ (s\cos\ \theta)\]

Alternatively \(W=F_{i^{\prime}}s=(F\cos\ \theta)\ s\)

where \(F\) is the magnitude of constant force \(s\) is the displacement \(\theta\) is the angle between the force and displacement \(\cdot\)_subscript_\(\varepsilon\) refers to its vector component parallel with respect to some other vectors_

**Notes:**

* Work is a **scalar** quantity. The unit of work is the **joule** (J).
* It is assumed that the object is _not rotating_, or _changing shape_ (i.e. it is rigid), so all parts of the object move with the same displacement. In this case, the work done by a force can be calculated by using a point to represent the object, with the force acting on that point
* Where there are more than one force acting on a body, work done by the individual forces can be calculated separately.

**Concept Check 1**

As the man is walking around at a constant speed and holding up the load, is any work being done on the load? Explain why.

_Since F and s are perpendicular._

_Work done by Man exerting force F on the load = F s cos 90\({}^{\circ}\) = 0 J_

_Similarly work done by gravitational force is also zero._

**Concept Check 2**

Under what circumstance is the work done by a force acting on a body negative?

_W = F_scos\(\theta\)

Work \(W\) is negative

when 180\({}^{\circ}\) > \(\theta\) > 90\({}^{\circ}\), cos \(\theta\) is negative.

_e.g. When \(\theta\) = 180\({}^{\circ}\), cos \(\theta\) = -1_

**Qn: What does this mean physically?** The force is resisting the motion and doing negative work to reduce the kinetic energy of the body.

**Example 1**

A lawn mower is pushed by a force \(P\) of 20.0 N at 30\({}^{\circ}\) to the horizontal, against a horizontal resistive force \(D\) of 8.0 N. It moves a horizontal distance of 10.0 m. Calculate

(i) the work done by the force \(P\) on the lawn mower.

(ii) the work done by the resistive force \(D\).

(iii) the work done by the normal contact force from the ground and the weight of the lawn mower.

(iv) the change in kinetic energy of the mower.

#### 5.1.2 Work done by a variable force

Suppose an object is being displaced along the \(x\)-axis under the action of a variable force \(F_{x}\) that acts in the \(x\) direction. The object is displaced in the direction of increasing \(x\) from \(x=x_{i}\) to \(x=x_{r}\)

In order to calculate work done by the _variable force_\(F_{x}\), we first need to know how the force \(F_{x}\) vary with displacement. Let's imagine we were able to use a force sensor and a data logger to measure this variation and that we were able to get the plot shown below.

The total displacement \(x\) can be regarded as the sum of many very small steps \(\Delta x\). During each small step, the force is practically constant.

The total work done = sum of work done for each step

\[W =\Delta W_{i}+\Delta W_{2}+\Delta W_{3}+......\] \[=F_{i}\Delta x+F_{2}\Delta x+F_{3}\Delta x+......\]

As the width of the small steps, \(\Delta x\), gets really small, the sum of area of these strips will just be the area under the graph of \(F_{x}\) against \(x\).

\[W=\int\limits_{x_{i}}^{x_{i}}F_{x}dx\]

In other words, **the work done by variable force acting on an object that undergoes a displacement is equal to the area under the force-displacement graph**.

### Energy

Suppose a ball is allowed to roll down a hill and we would like to calculate its speed by the time it reaches the bottom of the hill. The ball does not follow a straight path as it is not a straight slope. It will be very tiresome to try and calculate the speed of the ball using what we learnt in kinematics.

An alternative and fast approach to solving this problem is to apply the principle of conservation of energy. If we ignore friction, there are only two forms of energy we need to concern ourselves with, the kinetic energy of the ball by virtue of its motion and the gravitational potential energy stored in the ball-earth system.

The ball might gain or lose some of its kinetic energy as it rolls down the slope but if we realise that all its kinetic energy gained must be balanced by a corresponding decrease in the gravitational potential energy of the ball-earth system (assuming the earth is stationary), we could easily find the kinetic energy it had at the bottom of the slope by simply comparing the change in the gravitational potential energy of the ball-earth system.

#### 5.2.1 Kinetic energy, \(E_{k}\)

Kinetic energy of a body is a measure of the energy possessed by the body **by virtue of its motion.**

**Derivation of \(E_{k}=\frac{1}{2}\,mv^{2}\)**

Consider an object, initially at rest, is being displaced along the \(x\)-axis under the action of a constant force,

We can infer the formula for kinetic energy from the amount of work that is done by an external force to bring a body from rest to its state of motion.

\[E_{k}=F\,s\]

By Newton's second law:

\[E_{k}=(m\,\mathrm{a})s\]

Using the equation of motion for uniform acceleration: \(\nu^{2}=\nu^{2}+2\,\mathrm{a}\mathrm{s}\),

Re-arrange: \(\quad\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,

**Work- Energy Theorem (good to know)**

* More generally, if the object does not start from rest (\(u\neq 0\)), and is acted by several forces,
* then the net work done on the object (i.e. the work done by the net force),
* \[W_{net}=mas=m\times\frac{1}{2}\big{(}v^{2}-u^{2}\big{)}=E_{k\ final}-E_{k\ initial}\]

* When there is no net work done on an object (i.e. work done by net force is zero), the object's change in kinetic energy is zero. Referring back to Concept Check 1 (p.5), no work is done on the load, so its kinetic energy remains constant. In Fig.(a), A diver's kinetic energy increases as she springs upward because positive work is done on her, since normal contact force **N** is greater than her weight **w**. In Fig. (b), a baseball player's kinetic energy decreases as he slides because friction does negative work on him.
* Work-energy theorem is valid even for varying net force. One useful example is when an object at rest is pushed from one position to another position, back to rest, we conclude that the net work done is zero since there is no change in kinetic energy in the process.

### Potential energy

We know that two bodies will tend to attract each other due to gravity. This means that if we want to separate the two bodies, we need to exert forces on them. The energy we use to do this is stored in the two-body system as gravitational potential energy. If we now release the two bodies, they will begin to move towards each other. The gain in the kinetic energies of the two bodies comes from the gravitational potential energy that was stored earlier.

Similarly, we know that two positively charged bodies tend to repel each other due to electrostatic forces. We can try to force them together, and in so doing, we need to exert forces on them and the energy we expend is stored in the form of electrical potential energy of the two-body system. If we now release the two bodies, they will repel each other and move apart at increasing speed. The gain in their kinetic energies comes from the electrical potential energy that is stored earlier.

The same principle applies to a spring. When loading a spring gun, we expend energy in compressing the spring. This energy is stored in the form of elastic potential energy and when fired, the spring exerts a force on the bullet and the work done by this force, which is the gain in the bullet's kinetic energy, came from the stored elastic potential energy.

In all these examples, the amount of stored potential energy in the system came from the work done by an external agent who set up the system in the first place.

There are three kinds of potential energy (PE) you will commonly encounter. They are summarized in the table below.

\begin{tabular}{|p{142.3pt}|p{142.3pt}|p{142.3pt}|} \hline
**Elastic PE** & **Gravitational PE (GPE)** & **Electrical PE** \\ \hline The amount of elastic PE stored in a spring depends on the extent to which the spring is stretched or compressed. & The amount of GPE stored in a system depends on the relative position of the masses in the system. & The amount of EPE stored in a system depends on the relative position of electrical charges in the system. \\ \hline When a spring is stretched, attractive forces act to pull the parts of the spring together and when the spring is compressed, repulsive forces act to push the parts of the spring apart. & Attractive forces act between any two masses. & Attractive forces act on two bodies of opposite charges and repulsive forces act on two bodies of like charges. \\ \hline Elastic PE increases when the spring is stretched or compressed. & In a two-mass system, GPE increases when two masses are separated. & In a two charged body system, EPE increases when two opposite charges are separated or when two like charges are brought closer together \\ \hline \end{tabular}

#### 5.3.1 Gravitational Potential Energy (GPE), \(E_{p}\) or \(U\)

Derivation of \(E_{p}=mgh\)

Consider a person lifting a box of mass \(m\) at constant speed to a height \(h\).

Since the box is moving at constant speed, there is no change in its kinetic energy. Net work done on the box must be zero. In the process, however, the person exerting a constant upward force on the box does positive work on the box while the gravitational force acting downwards does negative work. The work done by the person on the box is stored in the form of gravitational potential energy (GPE), \(E_{p}\).

Since velocity is constant,

there is no acceleration \(F_{net}=m\dot{a}=0\), thus \(F_{ext}=F_{0}=mg\).

We can form an equation as follows.

Increase in \(E_{p}=\) Work done by external force on the box by person, \(W\)\(F_{ext}\)\(h\)\(F_{ext}\)\(h\)\(mgh\)

Hence, Increase in \(E_{p}=mgh\)

Note:
* This derivation applies only to objects that stay near to the surface of the Earth during the motion, and \(h\) is small relative to the diameter of the Earth, so that the gravitational acceleration \(g\) on the body is practically constant during the motion. (
* The potential energy is associated with the gravitational force between the Earth and the mass \(m\). Hence the gravitational potential energy \(E_{p}\) belongs to the mass-Earth system and not simply to the mass \(m\) alone. It is a property of the system as a whole. In general, a system is one or more objects that we choose to study.
* \(E_{p}\) is a relative and not an absolute quantity. It is always taken in relation to a reference level which can be chosen arbitrarily. What is more important is the change in the \(E_{p}\) with reference to this level (as shown in the figure below). Consider the change in potential energy \(\Delta E_{p}\) of a 1.0 kg mass along path 1 and 2.

* The _work done on the mass_ in moving it between two positions _is dependent only on the initial and final positions_ and _independent of the path taken by the mass_. \(\Delta E_{p}\) remains the same for path 1 and 2. When the starting and ending points are the same, the total work is zero, and there is no change in the gravitational potential energy.

**Example 2**

[FIGURE:S4.F1][ENDFI

#### 5.3.2 Relationship between Gravitational Force and Gravitational Potential Energy

Consider the same box on p.10, we define the change in GPE as the work done by the external force on the box. The change in GPE can also be expressed as _the negative of the work done on the mass by gravitational force._

\[\Delta E_{p}=-\,W_{G}\]

Consider a small downward displacement, \(\Delta x\), at constant velocity so that \(F_{\mathrm{sat}}=F_{\mathrm{G}}\).

\[F_{\mathrm{sat}}\]

the work done by the gravitational force, \(W_{G}=F_{\mathrm{G}}\,\Delta x\) is positive.

Thus \(\Delta E_{p}=-\,W_{G}=-\,F_{\mathrm{G}}\,\Delta x\Rightarrow\,F_{\mathrm{G}}= -\,\frac{\Delta E_{p}}{\Delta x}\)

When we take the limit as \(\Delta x\to 0\),

\[F_{\mathrm{G}}=-\,\frac{dE_{p}}{\Delta x}\]

_the gravitational force is the negative of the gradient of the potential energy - position graph._

The magnitude of gradient gives the magnitude of the gravitational force, while the negative sign suggests that the gravitational force always acts in the direction towards lower potential energy.

Let us now apply the above relationship in _the uniform gravitational field_ near the surface of Earth, where gravitational acceleration is \(g\).

Consider a mass \(m\) at a height \(x_{0}\) from the ground, taking GPE = 0 J at the ground level.

Since GPE, \(E_{p}=mgx\), the \(E_{p}\) - \(x\) graph is a straight line graph passing through the origin, with gradient \(mg\).

The gravitational force at \(x_{0}\) is the negative of the gradient of \(E_{0}\) - \(x\) graph, or \(F_{\mathrm{G}}=-\,\frac{dE_{p}}{\Delta x}=-mg\).

In general, the force-potential energy relationship is applicable in any conservative1 system.

Footnote 1: See Appendix 1 for more details regarding conservative system and conservative force

Conservative force, \(F=-\,\frac{dE_{p}}{\Delta x}\) is the negative of the gradient of the \(E_{p}\) - \(x\) graph.

We will re-visit this relationship when we study the chapters on Gravitational Field and Electric Field later. In those chapters, potential energy is often denoted by the symbol \(U\). You will encounter situations in which you are given a potential energy - distance graph and you can use this general relationship to find the corresponding force.

#### 5.3.3 Elastic Potential Energy

In order to stretch a spring, we must exert an increasingly larger force to pull both ends of the spring apart as we stretch the spring. This is because the force we exert must at least be equal to if not larger than the resistive spring force that the rest of the spring exerts on the ends of the spring. Indeed, the resistive spring force gets stronger the more the spring is extended or compressed.

In fact, in most situations the resistive spring force needed to stretch the spring **increases in proportion to the extension**. Whenever this is true, we say that **the spring obeys Hooke's law**, i.e. **the spring force \(F_{spring}\) is proportional to the spring's extension \(x\)**, i.e. \(F_{spring}\) = -\(J\alpha\) where \(k\) is the spring constant. The negative sign appears because \(F_{spring}\) is in the direction opposite to the displacement \(x\). A stiffer spring that requires a larger force to stretch it has a larger spring constant. A stiffer spring also means that more elastic potential energy is stored per unit of extension.

Let a light spring be stretched through an extension \(x\), very slowly (at practically zero velocity) by applying an external force \(F_{ext}\).

To just overcome the spring force, the external force \(F_{ext}\)= - \(F_{spring}\).

\(W\)\(=\int\limits_{0}^{x}F_{ext}\ dx\ =\) Area under the _force-extension graph_

\(=\int_{0}^{x}Fx\)

\(=\int_{2}(k\ x)(x)\)

\(E_{\text{elastic}}\ =\int_{2}k\alpha^{2}\)

Hence, elastic potential energy \(E_{\text{elastic}}=\frac{1}{2}Fx=\frac{1}{2}k\alpha^{2}\)

**Example 3 (mod J99/l/23)**

A sample is placed in a tensile testing machine. It is extended by known amounts and the tension is measured. (i) What is the work done in stretching the sample to the first point where it no longer obeys Hooke's Law. (ii) What is the work done on the sample when it is given a total extension of 9.0 mm?

[0.15 J, 0.43 J]

#### 5.3.4 Work done by External Force on a Deformed Material

An elastic material (e.g. a wire) usually obey Hooke's Law closely unless the deformation is excessively large. If the material is stretched beyond its proportionality limit, it will no longer obey Hooke's Law and the force-extension graph will not be a straight line from that point onwards. If an elastic material (e.g. a wire) is stretched further **beyond its elastic limit** (also known as yield point), it will **suffer a permanent deformation** and not snap back to its original length when the external force is removed. If the wire is stretched even further, it will eventually hit fracture point and the wire will simply snap. The force-extension graph will look like the one shown in the figure below.

In such cases, to determine work done by external force on wire, one cannot simply use the equation \(E=\gamma_{2}\ \kappa\alpha^{2}\) since Hooke's Law is no longer obeyed. Instead, the work done can simply be worked out by estimating the area under the force-extension graph (shaded area).

When the wire is **stretched beyond its elastic limit** and the external force is subsequently removed, the extension is only partially recovered. Work done by external force on wire will be more than the elastic potential energy. Energy is therefore lost as heat.

Try this out I The effect of hysteresis is usually very small for metals, but is noticeable for polythene, glass and rubber. You can easily investigate this using a rubber band. By simply stretching it and then holding it against your lips you can detect a rise in temperature!

### Principle of Conservation2 of Energy

When solving problems via the energy approach, remember that this approach is based on the principle of conservation of energy:

Energy can be **converted from one form to another** but **cannot be created or destroyed**.

In other words, the total energy is neither increased nor decreased in any process.

* **When the only force that does work is gravitational force in the system, the total mechanical energy \(E\) (i.e. sum of kinetic energy and potential energy) is constant. Mathematically, \((E_{k}+E_{p})_{\rm initial}=(E_{k}+E_{p})_{\rm final}\) or \(\Delta E_{k}+\Delta E_{p}\) = 0**

Example: Consider the motion of a 1.0 kg mass projected vertically upwards from the ground with an initial speed of 4.43 m s\({}^{-1}\). Given that air resistance is negligible, the kinetic energy of the mass is converted to gravitational potential energy as it rises from 0 to A. As it falls back to 0, potential energy is converted into kinetic energy.

* **When there is presence of external forces doing work in the system, change in mechanical energy = net work done by external forces, \(W_{\rm ext}\). Mathematically, \((E_{k}+E_{p})_{\rm initial}+W_{\rm ext}=(E_{k}+E_{p})_{\rm final}\) or \(\Delta E_{k}+\Delta E_{p}\) = \(W_{\rm ext}\)**

Note that an external force can be doing positive work, adding to the total mechanical energy, or negative work, reducing the total mechanical energy of the system.

* [2] A. Attorcyclist drives horizontally off a cliff at a speed of 38.0 m s\({}^{\text{-1}}\). Ignoring air resistance, find the speed of the motorcycle just before it reaches the ground. [46.2 m s\({}^{\text{-1}}\)]
* [3] Would your answer in (a) change if the motorcyclist leaps across at the same 35 m height with an initial upward angle while maintaining the same initial speed of 38.0 m s\({}^{\text{-1}}\)?

```
Example 5 (external force present, mechanical energy is lost) A car of mass 800 kg moving at 30 km h\({}^{\text{-1}}\) along a horizontal road is brought to rest by a constant retarding force of 5000 N. Calculate the distance the car moves before coming to rest. [5.6 m]
```

**Example 6 (external force present, mechanical energy is lost)**

A block of mass 4.0 kg is released at point P on a curved frictionless track as shown. The block slides down a vertical distance of 80 cm and enters a sand pit. Determine the distance the block can move along the sand pit before coming to rest if the friction acting on the block is 85 N. [0.37 m]

```
Example 7 (external force present, mechanical energy is lost) A block of mass 4.0 kg is released at point P on a curved frictionless track as shown. The block slides down a vertical distance of 80 cm and enters a sand pit. Determine the distance the block can move along the sand pit before coming to rest if the friction acting on the block is 85 N. [0.37 m]
```

### Power

The same amount of work is done in raising a given body through a given height, regardless whether it takes one second or one year to do so. However, _the rate at which work is done_ is greater if less time is taken.

Power is defined as the rate at which work is done.

Instantaneous power, \(P=\dfrac{dW}{dt}\)

Average power, \(<P>=\dfrac{\Delta W}{\Delta t}\)

Notes:
* The SI unit of power is the **watt** (W). Power is a **scalar** quantity.
* Work can also be expressed in units of (power x time). This is the origin of the term _kilowatt-hour_. One _kilo-watt hour_ is the work done in 1 hour by an agent working at a constant rate of 1 kW.

Example 7 (Average Power)

A 1.10 x 10\({}^{3}\) kg car, starting from rest, accelerates for 5.00 s. The magnitude of the acceleration is 4.60 m s\({}^{2}\). Determine the average power generated by the net force that accelerates the vehicle. [5.82 x 10\({}^{4}\) W]

#### 5.5.1 Relationship between Power, Force and Velocity

Consider a force \(F\) that acts on a body for a small time interval \(\Delta t\). The body moves a small displacement \(\Delta x\) in the direction of the force.

Work done by the force \(F\) during \(\Delta t\), \(\Delta W\ =\ F\Delta x\)

Power delivered by that force \(F\) during \(P\ =\ \Delta W/\Delta t\)

the time interval \(\Delta t\) = \((F\Delta x)/\Delta t\)

= \(F\Delta x/\Delta t\)

= \(F\nu\)

where \(\nu\) is the instantaneous velocity of the body.

When a force \(F\) acts on a body that is moving with velocity \(\nu\), in the direction of the force, work is done on the body at the rate given by \(P\) = \(F\nu\)

Notes:
* A force \(F\) that acts in the direction of the displacement \(\Delta x\), does positive work on the body. It transfers energy to the body at a rate proportional to the speed of the body.
* If \(F\) or \(\nu\) varies with time, then \(P\) may not be constant. However, the product \(F\nu\) at any moment will gives the instantaneous power of \(F\) at that instant.
* Where \(F\) acts against the motion of the body, it does negative work on the body. It extracts energy out of the body at a rate equal to the magnitude of \(F\nu\).

Example 8: A 1000 kg car experiences a total resistive force of 2000 N moving with a constant velocity of 20.0 m s\({}^{\text{-1}}\) along a straight horizontal road.

What is the power developed by the engine of the car when it travels at 20.0 m s\({}^{\text{-1}}\)

(a) horizontally, and

(b) up a slope with gradient of 5\({}^{\circ}\)?

[40 kW; 57.1 kW]

### Efficiency (of energy conversion), \(\eta\)

No practical engine can transform energy from one form to another without some energy going to internal energy and other non-useful forms of energy.

The efficiency of any energy conversion process is the ratio of

* the useful energy output to the total energy input, or
* the useful power output to the power input

\[\text{efficiency }=\frac{\text{useful energy output}}{\text{total energy input}}\quad,\quad\eta=\frac{E_{output}}{E_{input}}=\frac{P_{output}}{P_{input}}\]

**Note:**

\(\eta\) (Greek small letter, Eta) is a ratio between two quantities of the same type. It has no unit.

**Example 9**

A small motor is used to raise a weight of 2.0 N at constant speed through a vertical height of 80 cm in 4.0 s. The efficiency of the motor is 20 %. What is the electrical power supplied to the motor? [2.0 W]

## Appendix 1 Potential Energy (_U_) and Conservative Force (Good to know)

From the derivation on p. 10, the _gain in gravitational potential energy_, \(\Delta U\) can be taken as:

the positive work done on the mass by an external force

when the mass moves (a distance _h_) to higher position.

\(\Delta U=F_{ext}\)_h_

or:

the negative of the negative work done on the mass by gravitational force

when the mass moves to a higher position.

\(F_{0}=mg\)

The above is applicable only to a conservative system, or a system that involves a conservative force, such as gravitational force, electric force and spring force. An essential feature of conservative forces is that their work is always reversible. Another important aspect of conservative forces is that a body may move from point 1 to point 2 by various paths, but the work done by a conservative force is the same for all of these paths. Thus, if a body stays close to the surface of the earth, the gravitational force _mg_ is independent of height, and the work done by this force depends only on the change in height. If the body moves around a closed path, ending at the same point where it started, the total work done by the gravitational force is always zero.

The work done by a conservative force always has four properties:

1. It can be expressed as the difference between the initial and final values of a potential-energy
2. It is reversible.
3. It is independent of the path of the body and depends only on the starting and ending points.
4. When the starting and ending points are the same, the total work is zero.

When the only forces that do work are conservative forces, the total mechanical energy \(E=E_{k}+E_{p}\) is constant.

**Not all forces are conservative.** Consider the friction force acting on the crate sliding on a ramp. When the body slides up and then back down to the starting point, the total work done on it by the friction force is not zero. When the direction of motion reverses, so does the friction force, and friction does negative work in both directions. The lost kinetic energy cannot be recovered by reversing the motion or in any other way, and mechanical energy is not conserved. There is no potential-energy function for the friction force.

Friction is a non-conservative force that acts to reduce the mechanical energy in a system.

However, non-conservative forces do not always reduce the mechanical energy; a non-conservative force changes the mechanical energy, so a force that increases the total mechanical energy, like the force provided by a motor or engine, is also a non-conservative force.

In general,

When there are only conservative forces,

**Change in total mechanical energy of the system = 0**

When there are presence of conservative forces and non-conservative forces,

**Change in total mechanical energy of the system*** [35] Hwa Chong Institution (College) H2 Physics C1 2023
