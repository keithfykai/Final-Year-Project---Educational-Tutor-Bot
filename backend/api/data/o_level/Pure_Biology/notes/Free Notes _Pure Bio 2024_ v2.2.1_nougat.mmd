**Topical Notes**
* **Helps you Revise Efficiently**
* **Textbook and school notes are too thick, making it hard to know what's important. That's why l made simple, concise notes for my students to cut through the clutter. The stuff in here is what you need to focus on in your syllabus, so use this if you want to study efficiently.**
* **Learning outcomes are not word for word as l've made them more concise/understandable. Rest assured though, content is same as the syllabus.*** **Memory Hacks**
* In here, you'll see: _[Memory Shortcut] / [Memory Hack]_. These are my own acronyms/mnemonics/memory hacks, so you can memorise content faster AND recall easier in exams.

### Why I give these notes for FREE

* I get tons of messages requesting for my notes, so this must be a big need in the community. A lot of you are needlessly struggling in this subject, and I don't want you to be one of them.
* Maybe you're not getting the quality of teaching and materials you need. It shouldn't be this way, because bio is an easy subject. You deserve to score well.
* I was in your place before, and I wished someone gave me notes like these to make my life easier. Now I get to make it a reality for you.
* **Hold up. This sounds too good to be true. What's the catch?**
* I do this because I'd like to earn your trust, by giving you results in advance. Many students who aren't even in my tuition class have already told me how their grades have improved from my free notes.
* I want you to know that ThatBioTutor is the **real deal**. It's my hope that those of you who need O level Pure Bio tuition will choose me as your tutor :)

## 6 OC. CAQ Notes (READ ME)

### Commonly Asked Questions

* Why are CAQs so powerful for improving your Open-ended questions? Watch the timestamp 10:55 of this vid: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?) v=LVlbRInt-88t=655s
* I've looked through many papers, TYS, and assessment books to draw out the **commonly asked questions.** You'll find them under each topic's notes.
* Following the 80/20 rule, 20% of OEQs will account for 80% of OEQs tested. These are the 20% most common OEQs examiners always test you on.bet
* Get good at these and instantly score well for 80% of the paper. **This is how you study smart.**
* _NEW_: l've added an asterisk in front of those questions which are the most common in TYS. These are the ones you must know how to write out very well.
* _Each bullet point in the CAQ answers = 1m!_!
* DISCLAIMER: Mark allocations in the CAQ notes are **conservative**.
* Meaning, I'm assuming markers are strict and won't give out marks leniently.
* However, in exams, you might see questions allocating more marks than you might expect. (_E_._ Describe transpiration_ instead of only 4m, they allocate 5m. In these scenarios, it is likely that the mark scheme is "nice" and giving you 5m marks for the exact same 4m answer that I suggest in the CAQ answers).

## Chapter 1 Cells CAQs

### 1.1. Cells CAQs

#### 1.1.1 RBC vs RHC

Q: The table shows comparisons between a human red blood cell and a root hair cell.

\begin{tabular}{|p{113.8pt}|p{113.8pt}|p{113.8pt}|} \hline Feature number & Feature & Red blood cell & Root hair cell \\ \hline
1 & takes in oxygen & yes & yes \\ \hline
2 & cytoplasm present & no & yes \\ \hline
3 & large surface area to volume ratio & yes & yes \\ \hline
4 & nucleus present & no & yes \\ \hline \end{tabular}

Which comparisons are correct?

A) 1, 2 and 3 only

B) 1, 3 and 4 only

C) 1 and 2 only

D) 3 and 4 only

(B)

* 1 correct: RBC takes in O2 to transport it around. **RHC also needs O2 for aerobic respiration.** O2 diffuses from the air pockets in the soil into RHCs.
* Both RBC and RHC have **cytoplasm**, since they are **living** cells.
* RBC has biconcave shape, RHC has an elongated protrusion, increasing the SA:V for both of them respectively.
* RBC no nucleus, in order to pack in more haemoglobin. **Only RHC has nucleus.**

Q: Which organelle produces proteins and which organelle provides the energy for this process?

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|} \hline  & organelle produces proteins & organelle provides energy \\ \hline A & 1 & 4 \\ \hline B & 2 & 3 \\ \hline C & 3 & 2 \\ \hline D & 4 & 1 \\ \hline \end{tabular}

(D)

* Organelle that produces proteins: Proteins are produced by **ribosomes**, which are either **free ribosomes** in the cytoplasm or studded onto the **Rough Endoplasmic Reticulum (RER)**. Only the RER is labelled as 4 in the diagram.
* Organelle that provides energy: Aerobic respiration occurs in **mitochondria** to release energy, and a mitochondrion is labelled as 1 in the diagram.
* _Pro Tip: These questions often test on which organelles synthesise proteins (RER and free ribosomes)_* **Related Questions:*
* Q: Which part of the living cell is the oxygen concentration lowest? (Using the same cell diagram as above)
* O2 is spread out quite equally throughout the cell due to diffusion, except around mitochondria,
* because mitochondria use up O2 for aerobic respiration, so the regions around mitochondria have less O2.

### Pathway Out Of Cell

Q: Describe how proteins made in the cell are released to the outside of the cell. [3]

* The proteins are synthesised by the **Rough Endoplasmic Reticulum**, then sent via **vesicles** to the **Golgi body**.
* Here, they are **modified**, **sorted and packaged** into vesicles that pinch off the Golgi body.
* The secretory vesicles move to and **fuse** with the **plasma membrane** to release the proteins outside the cell.

### Many Mitochondria

*Q: Suggest why root hair cells [cell type] have many mitochondria. [2]
* Root hair cells [cell type] need to pump in mineral salts from the surrounding soil into their **large central vacuoles** via **active transport** [energy-consuming activity].
* Hence they need many mitochondria to generate **energy** via **aerobic respiration**, where **digested food substances** are broken down into **carbon dioxide** and **water**, releasing a **large amount of energy.*** _Pro Tip: This kind of question could be asked about any cell type that has many mitochondria, e.g. muscle cell, companion cell, etc. You will have to replace [cell type] and [energy-consuming activity] accordingly._

## Cells With High SA:V

*Q: What is the advantage of epithelial cells [cell type] having such a shape (having microvilli)? [2]

* An epithelial cell [cell type] has many microvilli, which increases its **surface** area to volume ratio,
* for faster **diffusion** and **active transport** [type of movement process] of digested food substances from the lumen of the small intestine into the cell [substance moved].

*_Pro Tip: This kind of question could be asked about any cell that has high SA:V, e.g. root hair cell, red blood cell, etc. You will have to replace [cell type], [type of movement process] and [substance moved] accordingly._

## Animal vs Plant cells

*Q: State 3 ways in which the structure of a plant cell differs from an animal cell. [3]

* Plant cells (A), while animal cells (B).

* A
* B
* may have **chloroplasts** do not have **chloroplasts** have **cell walls** do not have **cell walls** have a permanent **large central vacuole** have **small** and **temporary vacuoles**.

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:25]

## Chapter 2 Movement of Substances

### 2.1 Defining

The **net** movement of particles from a region of higher concentration to a region of lower concentration, **down a concentration gradient**.

1. **Osmosis:** The **net** movement of **water molecules** from a region of higher **water potential** to a region of lower **water potential**, through a **partially permeable** membrane.

1. **Active Transport:** The movement of particles, using **energy**, from a region of lower concentration to a region of higher concentration, **against a concentration gradient**, through a **partially permeable** membrane.

*_Pro Tip: When explaining these processes in contexts of questions, replace_' _substances' with the molecule in the question, e.g. CO2_

\begin{tabular}{p{113.8pt} p{113.8pt} p{113.8pt} p{113.8pt}}
**Process** & **Diffusion** & **Osmosis** & **Active transport** \\ \hline Type of molecule & Any & Water & Any \\ Partially permeable & No & Yes & Yes \\ membrane needed? & No & No & Yes \\ Energy needed? & No & No & Yes \\ Direction w.r.t. & Down (higher & Down (higher & Against (lower \\ Concentration gradient & to lower) & to lower) & to higher) \\ \end{tabular}

## 2 Movement of substances in nutrient uptake and gas exchange

\begin{tabular}{p{113.8pt} p{113.8pt}}
**Example** & **How substances are moving** \\ \end{tabular}

* Digested food substances such as glucose, and amino acids **diffuse*
* into epithelial cells of villi in the small intestine
* After **diffusion*
* no longer occurs, these substances are transported in via **active transport**
* Mineral salts are transported from the soil into root hair cells **via active transport**, to maintain a high concentration of mineral salts in their vacuoles
* This creates a region of lower **water potential** than the surrounding soil, so that water flows in by **osmosis*** O2 **dissolves** into the thin film of moisture lining the **alveolar air space**, then **diffuses** into the **blood plasma**
* Conversely, CO2 **diffuses** from the **blood plasma** into the **alveoli air space**
* O2 **diffuses** from the **intercellular air spaces** of the leaf to the surrounding air, through the **stomata**
* CO2 **diffuses** from the surrounding air into the **intercellular air spaces** of the leaf, through the **stomata**

## 3 Effects of osmosis on plant and animal tissues

**How plasmolysed is different from flaccid:**

* During **plasmolysis**, as a lot of water molecules have left the **cell sap** from the **large central vacuole** to the outside of the cell by **osmosis**,
* **cytoplasm** of the plant cell **shrinks** so much that the **plasma membrane** pulls away from the **cell wall**.

* **Pro Tip: Turgidity in plant cells is important as it allows the plant to remain upright and reach for sunlight, especially if it has a non-woody stem.**

## 4 Bonus: Factors affecting rate of diffusion

* **Surface area to volume ratio:** The higher the SA:V, the higher the diffusion rate
* **Temperature:** Higher temperature, molecules have more **kinetic energy**, hence move faster and diffuse down the concentration gradient faster
* **Steepness of concentration gradient:** The steeper the gradient, the higher the diffusion rate
* **Distance:** The shorter the distance that molecules need to travel/diffusion distance, the higher the diffusion rate
* **Molecule size:** Smaller molecules diffuse faster (e.g. glucose diffuses faster than sucrose)

## Chapter 2 Movement of Substances CAQs

### 2.1 Important Definitions

*Q: Define the term diffusion.

* The net movement of particles from a region of higher concentration to a region of lower concentration, down a concentration gradient.

*Q: Define the term osmosis.

* The net movement of water molecules from a region of higher water potential to a region of lower water potential, through a partially permeable membrane.

*Q: Define the term active transport.

* The movement of particles, using energy, from a region of lower concentration to a region of higher concentration, against a concentration gradient, through a partially permeable membrane.

### 2.2 Plant Cell Osmosis

Q: The diagram shows a plant cell in a 5% glucose solution.

The concentration of the solution in the vacuole is equivalent to a 10% glucose solution.

Which row states where osmosis occurs and the direction of water movement?

where osmosis occurs direction of water movement

(C)

* Where osmosis occurs: Cannot be the cell wall, as **cell wall is fully permeable**, whereas **osmosis requires a partially permeable** membrane (by definition).
* In the diagram, the only places for osmosis to occur would be the plasma membrane or the vacuole's membrane (vacuolar membrane). Since there only is an option for vacuolar membrane, has to be C or D.
* 5% glucose solution has higher water potential than 10% glucose solution, so water will move into the cell, has to be A or C.
* _Pro Tip: For movement of substances questions, knowing the definitions well is very advantageous._

### Which Shows Active Transport

Q: The diagrams show four identical plant cells.

The dots show the concentration of a chemical. The arrows represent the direction of movement of the chemical.

Which diagram(s) show a cell where active transport is taking place?

A) 1 and 2

B) 2 and 3

C) 2 and 4

D) 3 only

(D)

* active transport requires substances to move **against** the concentration gradient.
* active transport requires a **partially permeable** membrane.
* against concentration gradient and through a partially permeable membrane.
* does not show particles moving from low to high concentration.

**Applying Definitions**

*_Pro Tip: For certain questions, you may need to weave in the definition of these terms into your answer._

* Eg. Describe the movement of water into a root hair cell. [1]
* Water moves by osmosis from a region of higher water potential in the soil to a region of lower water potential in the root hair cell, through a **partially permeable** membrane.

**Strip of Cut Stem Bending**

Q: A leek stem was cut into small strips and placed into 0.1% salt solution. After 20 minutes, it looked like this:Explain the bent appearance of the strip. [4]

* 0.1% salt solution has a higher **water potential** than the **cell sap** of the cells in the stem.
* Hence, water moved into the cells via **osmosis**, causing them to **swell** and become **turgid**.
* The **epidermal cells/cells of the outermost layer of the stem are lined with a **waxy**, **inflexible cuticle** which restricts their expansion, so they cannot expand as much as the inner cells.
* The **difference in expansion** causes the stem to curl further outwards.

* _Pro Tip: 0.1% salt solution is still quite high water potential, it's higher than that of plant cells, hence water flows in. We get confirmation with the fact that the cuticle is on the 'bent inwards' side, showing the cells of the plant have expanded due to becoming turgid._

_1%, 5%, 10% are the numbers where it likely is lower water potential than the cells placed in the solution, though the question will give clues on whether it indeed is._

* How to remember what the 3 disaccharides are made of?
* The 3 disaccharides are all made of glucose + 1 of the 3 monosaccharides
* Lactose = Glucose + Galactose (galactose has lactose in the name!)
* Sucrose = Glucose + Fructose (Fructose is found in Fruits, which are from plants. Plants also convert glucose into sucrose before transporting it in phloem. Therefore, associate sucrose with fructose as they are both linked to plants.)
* Maltose = Glucose + Glucose (once you know the other 2, glucose is the only blank option left for maltose) *Pro Tip: There are 2'c's in -saccharides, be careful when spelling Reducing sugars All monosaccharides and disaccharides in our syllabus are reducing sugars, except sucrose.

**Learning Outcomes:**

1. Explain the mode of action of enzymes using 'lock and key' hypothesis, including active site, activation energy, enzyme specificity
2. Effect of pH and temperature on enzyme-catalysed reaction
3. Bonus: Benefits of using enzymes

**Keywords:**

* Biological catalysts, alternative pathway, activation energy, chemically unchanged
* Substrates, active site, specific three-dimensional structure, complementary
* Lock and key hypothesis, enzyme-substrate complex, optimum temperature/pH
* Kinetic energy, chance of collision
* Weak bonds, denature

**if you're our student: Enzymes Crash Course Clips**

### 1. Mode of action

* Enzymes: Biological catalysts that speed up chemical reactions by providing an **alternative pathway** of **lower activation energy**, and remain
* **Activation energy:** The energy needed to start a chemical reaction.

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:46]

* **L**: products Leave active site
* **U**: enzyme remains chemically Unchanged

**Characteristics of Enzymes**

* **Protein** in nature
* Have a **specific three-dimensional (3D) structure**, only catalyse one type of reaction
* Has an **active site** that the substrate is complementary to
* Has an **optimum temperature** and **optim pH** where rate of activity is highest

* **Pro Tip: Each enzyme has its own preferred optimum temperature and pH, depending on its function.**

## 2 Effect of Temperature and pH

**Effect of increasing temperature on enzyme activity*** As temperature increases from low until the **optimum temperature**, **kinetic energy** of enzyme and substrate molecules increases, increasing their **chances of collision**.
* **Enzyme-substrate complexes** form faster, and rate of reaction increases until the **optimum temperature**, where rate is highest.
* As temperature increases beyond **optimum temperature**, **weak bonds** within enzymes are broken, causing the enzyme to lose the shape of its **active site** and become **denatured**.
* The substrate can **no longer fit** into the **active site**, hence rate of reaction decreases sharply to 0.

**Effect of pH on enzyme activity*** At pH 7, reaction rate is maximum as this is the enzyme's **optimum pH**.
* As pH moves further from pH 7, reaction rate decreases sharply. When pH moves too far from 7, weak bonds within the enzyme are broken,
* the enzyme loses the shape of its **active site** and becomes **denatured**.
* The substrate can **no longer fit** into the **active site**, hence rate decreases sharply until 0.

## 3 Bonus: Benefits of using enzymes

* As **catalysts**, they speed up reactions that would otherwise take a long time (saves time)
* Since enzymes remain **chemically unchanged** after reaction, only a small amount of them is needed (saves money/resources)
* Enzymes can **catalyse** reactions at lower temperatures than if they were to be done without enzymes (saves energy)
* Enzymes are **specific**, hence only the intended reaction will occur *_Pro Tip: Each of these are actually linking a characteristic of enzymes to a benefit_

## Chapter 4 Enzymes CAQs

### 4.1 Important Definitions

*Q: Define the term enzyme.
* Enzymes are biological catalysts that speed up chemical reactions by providing an alternative pathway of lower activation energy, and remain chemically unchanged after the reaction.

*Q: Define the term activation energy.
* The energy needed to start a chemical reaction.

Q: Define the term optimum/pH temperature.
* The temperature/pH where enzyme's rate of reaction is the highest (and where rate of enzyme-substrate complexes forming is fastest).

### 4.2 Activation Energy

Q: The two curves below show energy levels as a reaction progresses, with and without an enzyme. Which arrow represents the total activation energy of the reaction without the enzyme?* Concept: **Enzymes lower the activation energy** of a reaction, so the taller curve is the one without the enzyme.
* Activation energy without energy must be **A**.

### Enzyme Mode of Action

*Q: Using the lock and key hypothesis, explain the mode of action of an enzyme. [5]

* Mode of action of enzymes [Be Careful Red Light Unchanged]
* B: enzyme and substrate Binds
* C: forming an enzyme-substrate Complex
* R: Reaction is catalysed
* L: products Leave active site
* U: enzyme remains chemically Unchanged
* According to the **lock and key hypothesis**, a specific **substrate** is the 'key'. It is **complementary** to the **active site** of the enzyme, which is the 'lock',
* And **binds** to it, forming an **enzyme-substrate complex**.
* The enzyme then **catalyses** the reaction.
* After the reaction, the **products** are **no longer complementary** to the **active site**, hence they leave the **active site**.
* The enzyme remains **chemically unchanged** and can accept a new substrate.

_*Pro Tip: For the above question, you are required to make reference to the lock and key hypothesis._

* **Related Questions:*
* Q: Explain the mode of action of sucrase. [5]
* _Pro Tip: For questions like the above that specify the enzyme, use the specific names of the enzymes and substrates in your answer. i.e. For this case, sucrose and sucrose._

### Enzyme Activity and Temperature

*Q: Explain how the rate of an enzyme-catalysed reaction may be affected by increasing temperature. [4]

* As temperature increases from low until the **optimum temperature**, **kinetic energy of enzyme and substrate molecules increases, increasing their chances of collision**.
* Enzyme-substrate complexes form faster, and reaction rate increases until the **optimum temperature**, where rate is the highest.
* As temperature increases beyond **optimum temperature**, **weak bonds** within enzymes are broken, the enzyme loses the shape of its **active site** and is **denatured**.
* The substrate is **no longer complementary** to the **active site**, hence reaction rate decreases sharply to 0.
* **Related Questions:*
* Q: The temperature of the water bath for an enzyme-catalysed reaction was maintained carefully at 37\({}^{\circ}\)C. Explain why (assuming the enzyme is a human enzyme). [3]
* _Pro Tip: You would answer that this temperature is near the optimum temperature of this enzyme, and it is not too low (enzyme would be inactive), neither is it too high (enzyme would denature)_.

### Enzyme Activity and pH

*Q: Explain how the rate of an enzyme-catalysed reaction may be affected by changes in pH (assuming the optimum pH of the enzyme in question is 7). [4]

* At pH 7, reaction rate is maximum as this is the enzyme's **optimum pH**.
* As pH moves further from pH 7, reaction rate decreases sharply. When pH moves too far from 7, **weak bonds** within the enzyme are **broken**,* the enzyme loses the shape of its **active site** and becomes **denatured**.
* The substrate is **no longer complementary** to the **active site**, hence rate decreases sharply to 0.

### Limiting Factor Questions

Q: Explain why the rate of reaction does not increase after point X, despite the substrate concentration increasing. [1]

* After point X, **substrate concentration** is no longer the limiting factor, hence increasing it does not increase reaction rate.

### Biological Washing Powders

Q: Biological washing powders (detergents) contain one or more enzymes. Suggest the advantages of using biological washing powders compared to those without enzymes. [4]

* As biological **catalysts**, they speed up reactions for breaking down stains that would otherwise take a long time, saving time.
* Since enzymes remain **chemically unchanged** after the reaction, only a **small amount** of them is needed, saving money and resources.

* Enzymes can **catalyse** reactions at lower temperatures than if they were to be done without enzymes, saving energy needed to **heat** clothes up to higher temperatures.
* Enzymes are **specific**, hence only the intended reaction of breaking down the stains will occur, instead of any unintended reactions, such as breaking down of the dyes of clothes.

## Chapter 5 Nutrition in Humans

### 5.1 Main parts of the aimentary canal

Definitions of processes

1. **Ingestion:** The intake of food through the mouth.
2. **Digestion:** The physical or chemical breakdown of larger food molecules into smaller and soluble molecules that can be absorbed by body cells.
3. **Absorption:** The uptake of digested food substances into body cells.

4. **Assimilation:** Digested food substances are used to make new cell parts or used for energy.
5. **Egestion:** The removal of undigested food waste from the body.

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:58]

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:59]

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:60]

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:61]

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:62]

**Definition (in digestion):** Rhythmic, wave-like muscular contractions in the wall of the alimentary canal that moves food forward

* Peristalsis propels food forward ensuring it moves in the right direction,
* also mixes food with digestive juices

**How it works:**

* At the region before the food mass, **circular muscles** contract while **longitudinal muscles** relax, narrowing the **lumen** and pushing food forward
* At the food mass, **circular muscles** relax while **longitudinal muscles** contract, widening the **lumen**, allowing food to pass through easily
* The above also applies for the region just in front of the food mass
* **Circular muscles** and **longitudinal muscles** are **antagonistic** (i.e. when one contracts, the other relaxes)

***_Pro Tip: Peristalsis occurs throughout the alimentary canal, not just in the oesophagus_

_[Memory Hack]_

* How to remember what circular muscles are doing in peristalsis
* Think of circular muscles as 'controlling' the lumen size. At the point where you see it squeezing (contracting), the circular muscles are therefore contracting too.
* If lumen is widening (relaxing) at an area, circular muscles are relaxing too.

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:64]

* Absorbed substances that enter the **lactal** and **blood capillaries** are constantly transported away, maintaining a steep **concentration gradient** between the **lumen** and **villi** to maximise **diffusion** rate of digested substances into villi.

* _Pro Tip: After diffusion has reached equilibrium, active transport is needed to further absorb digested substances_

## 5 The Liver

**What happens to absorbed digested food substances:**

* **Hepatic portal vein** transports **glucose** and **amino acids** from small intestine to the **liver**
* **Glucose** is converted to **glycogen** and stored in the **liver** and **muscles**, or transported around the body for cells to uptake and use for energy
* **Amino acids** are transported around the body and taken up by cells during **assimilation**, to build new cell parts/**protoplasm**
* **Deamination:** The process where **amino groups** are removed from **excess amino acids** and converted into **urea**, in the liver.
* **Hence hepatic vein** has high **urea**.
* **Fats** are transported around the body to be stored/used for energy 

**Functions of liver** **Description**

**Detoxification** **is the process where harmful substances**

**Detoxification** **(e.g. hydrogen peroxide, alcohol) are converted into harmless ones.**

**Breakdown of Hormones** **Hormones are broken down at the liver after they have caused target organs to carry out the response.**

**Bile production** **The liver produces bile, which is stored in the gall bladder.**

**Amino acids (Deamination)** **The process where amino groups are removed from excess amino acids and converted into urea, in the liver.**

**When blood glucose concentration is too high, liver converts glucose to glycogen in response to insulin.When blood glucose concentration is too low, liver converts glycogen to glucose in response to glucagon.**

**[Memory Shortcut]**

**Dun Have BAG for functions of the liver**

**Detoxification**

**Hormone breakdown**

**Bile production**

**Amino acids** **Urea (Deamination)**

**Glucose regulation**

**6. Effects of excessive alcohol consumption**

**Short term effects:**

**Alcohol is a depressant, meaning it slows brain functions, increases reaction time**

**Reduces self-control, increasing tendency to make irrational decisions**

**Long term effects:*** **Addictive**, leading to neglect of **social responsibilities**
* Stimulates acid secretion in stomach, increasing risk of **stomach ulcers**
* Liver is overworked, cells start dying, which can lead to liver damage:
* E.g. Liver **cirrhosis*
* (formation of fibrous tissue), liver **failure**
* Causes brain damage:
* E.g. **Dementia**, high consumption during **pregnancy*
* may impair **foetus' brain development**

## Peristalsis Muscles

Q: The diagram shows a food bolus moving down the oesophagus.

Which row identifies the muscles and their actions at region W?

(D)

* \(X=\) longitudinal muscles (as seen from the horizontal muscle fibres within it)
* Y = circular muscles. When **circular muscles contract, lumen also narrows**, so Y is contracting.
* Since X and Y are **antagonistic**, X is relaxing.
* ***Pro Tip: Think in terms of circular muscles. When circular muscles contract, the lumen also "contracts".

A) 1 and 2

B) 1 and 4

C) 2 and 3

D) 3 and 4

(B)

* Refer to the functions of the liver memory shortcut, Dun Have BAG.
* 1 & 4 are correct.
* 2 is wrong as animals don't store starch, we store glycogen.
* 3 is wrong, formation of urea occurs in liver, but formation of urine occurs in kidneys.

### Alcohol Effects

Q: Which section of the diagram represents the effects of excessive alcohol consumption on the body?

**Digestion of Various Biomolecules**

*Q: Describe the digestion of protein in the body.[2]
* Protein is broken down into **short polypeptides** by **protease** in the **stomach** and **small intestine**.
* **Short polypeptides** are further broken down into **amino acids** by **protease** in the **small intestine**.

*Q: Describe the digestion of carbohydrates in the body.[3]
* **Starch** is broken down into **maltose** by **salivary amylase** in the mouth,
* And by **pancreatic amylase** in the small intestine.
* In the small intestine, **maltose** is further broken down by **maltase** into **glucose**.

*Q: Describe the digestion of fats in the body.[3]
* During digestion, **bile** is secreted from the **gall bladder** into the **duodenum**, through the **bile duct**.

* Bile salts in bile emulsify large fat droplets into smaller ones,
* increasing the surface area to volume ratio for pancreatic lipase and intestinal lipase to digest fats into glycerol and fatty acids.
* Related Questions:
* Q: Describe how bile aids in fat digestion. [2]
* Q: Describe the roles of enzymes in human digestion. Give examples in your answer. [5]
* *_Pro Tip: For such a question, use examples of digestion of some macromolecules, such as protein (pepsin + trypsin + peptidases involved) and starch (amylase + maltase involved). You don't have to talk about every single enzyme, just include enough points to hit the mark allocation._

### Adaptations of Villi

*Q: Villi are found in the digestive system. Describe the structure and function of a villus. [6]
* Villi are finger-like projections in the small intestine, which increase surface area to volume ratio for faster absorption.
* Glucose and amino acids diffuse into blood capillaries of villi to be transported to the liver.
* Glycerol and fatty acids diffuse into the epithelial cells of villi, where they reform into triglycerides, then enter the **lacetal** as **fat globules**.
* Are lined with a **one-cell-thick** layer of **epithelial cells**, minimising **distance** digested food substances have to travel, increasing absorption rate.
* Epithelial cells have **microvilli**, further increasing **surface area to volume ratio** for faster absorption.
* Absorbed substances that enter the **lacetal** and **blood capillaries** are constantly transported away, maintaining a **steep concentration gradient**between the lumen and villi to maximise diffusion rate of digested substances into villi.
* **Related Questions:**
* Q: Describe how villi are adapted to absorb digested food. [4] *_Pro Tip: For this question, just go straight to describing the adaptations._
* Q: Describe how the small intestine is adapted for absorption of digested food substances. [4]
* It is very long, allowing more time for more digested food substances to be absorbed as they travel through.
* Has many folds to increase surface area to volume ratio for faster absorption. *_Pro Tip: For the remaining 2 marks, use any 2 points about villi adaptations._

## Functions of Liver

* Q: Describe the functions of the liver. [5]
* Functions of the liver [Dun Have BAG]
* D: Detoxification
* H: Hormone breakdown
* B: Bile production
* A: Amino acids \(\rightarrow\) Urea (Deamination)
* G: blood Glucose regulation
* The liver carries out detoxification, where harmful substances such as alcohol are converted into harmless ones.
* The liver breaks down hormones after they have served their purpose.

* The liver **produces bile**, which is then stored in the **gal bladder.** Bile aids in fat digestion.
* The liver carries out **deamination**, where **amino groups** are removed from **excess amino acids** and converted into **urea**.
* The liver aids in **blood glucose regulation**, converting **glucose** to **glycogen** when **blood glucose concentration** is too high, and vice versa when glucose levels are too low.

## Effects of Alcohol

*Q: State the short term and long term effects of excessive alcohol consumption. [4] Short term:
* It is a **depressant**, which slows **brain functions** and increases **reaction time**, increasing chances of driving accidents.
* It reduces **self-control**, increasing the chances a person makes **irrational/reckless decisions**.

## Long term (Choose 2):

* It stimulates excessive **acid secretion** in the stomach, which could lead to **peptic ulcers**.
* It could lead to death of liver cells and eventually **liver failure/liver cirrhosis**.
* It could lead to **addiction**, and thus leading to overspending on alcohol/neglect of **social responsibilities**.
* It could lead to **dementia** due to alcohol **damage**, a condition known as '**wet brain**'.
* High consumption during **pregnancy** may impair the **foetus' brain development**.

### Drinking and driving

Q: Alcohol is a depressant. Explain why it is dangerous to drive under the influence of alcohol. [3]

* While driving, the driver needs to **react quickly** by pressing the brakes or steering to safety when a collision is about to occur.
* Alcohol is a **depressant**, which slows **brain functions** and increases **reaction time.**
* Someone under the influence of alcohol may not be able to react in time, increasing the chances of a road accident.

and the **high blood pressure** exerted by the heart
* **Elastic and muscular walls stretch** and **recoil**, maintaining high blood pressure and pushing blood forward in **sparts**
* Arteries branch out into **arterioles**, then into capillaries
* Are present near almost every cell in the body
* Made of a wall of **one-cell-thick** cells, minimising **diffusion distance**, increasing **diffusion** rate
* Capillaries **branch repeatedly**, increasing **SA:V**, hence increasing rate of **diffusion** of substances in and out of them
* Capillaries converge into **venues**, then into veins
* Veins carry blood **back to** the heart
* Usually carry **deoxygenated** blood, except for ** Pulmonary vein**
* Have **semi-lunar valves** to prevent **backflow** of blood, which is likely due to low **blood pressure** in veins
* Larger **lumen** to reduce **resistance** to bloodflow
* Thin **elastic and muscular** walls as **blood pressure** is lower
* Contraction of **skeletal muscles** exerts pressure on veins, moving blood along more quickly 

**Graph of Blood pressure against location**

* The further from the **aorta**, the lower the blood pressure due to **loss of energy**
* In **arteries*
* and **arterioles**, blood pressure **fluctuates*
* Arteries have thick **elastic*
* and **muscular*
* walls that **stretch*
* and **recoil**, and are directly connected to the **left ventricle**.
* Hence, blood pressure increases during **ventricular systole*
* as left ventricle **contracts**, and decreases during **ventricular diastole*
* as left ventricle **relaxes**.

**5. Transfer of materials between capillaries, tissue fluid and cells**

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:83]

* How to remember bicuspid valve is on the left side of the heart, tricuspid is on the right
* We always read words from Left to Right
* Bicuspid valve has **2** flaps (hence "bi-"), tricuspid valve has **3** flaps (hence "tri-")
* So remember Left \(\rightarrow\) 2, Right \(\rightarrow\) 3.

* **Parts of the heart** Function
* Have thinner walls then ventricles
* Left ventricle has thicker muscular walls as it has to generate high pressure to quickly pump blood around entire body
* Right ventricle has thinner muscular walls, as it does not need to generate as high of a pressure to pump blood to lungs
* **Pro Tip: Use ventricle wall thickness to identify which side of the diagram is right/left. Usually, heart diagrams are mirror imaged, meaning the left side of the picture is the right side of the heart.**
* Attaches valves to the heart walls

(4) Atrioventricular valves open

* **Systole** = contraction
* **Diastole** = relaxation
* **RA** = **Right atrium**, **LA** = **Left atrium**, **RV** = **Right ventricle**, **LV** = **Left ventricle

**Atrial systole** (+Ventricular diastole)

* Both atria contract, pushing blood past the **atrioventricular valves** into the ventricles
* **LA** pumps blood past the **mitral/bicuspid valve** to the **LV**
* **RA** pumps blood past the **tricuspid valve** to the **RV**

* **Pro Tip:** _AV valves were already open before atrial systole_, _as they opened_

_near the end of ventricular diastole_.

**Ventricular systole** (+Atrial diastole)

* Ventricles contract
* **Pulmonary semi-lunar valve** is forced open, blood moves from **RV** to the **pulmonary artery**, and is sent to the lungs.
* **Aortic semi-lunar valve** is forced open, blood moves from **LV** to the **aorta**, and is sent to the rest of the body.
* At the same time, **atrioventricular valves** close, preventing **backflow** of blood from ventricles to the atria.
* This causes the first '**lub**' sound.
* Meanwhile, atria relax,* Blood from **pulmonary vein** flows into **LA**
* Blood from **vena cava** flows into **RA**

**Ventricular diastole** (+Atrial diastole)
* Ventricles relax
* **Semi-lunar valves** close, preventing **backflow** of blood from the **pulmonary artery** and **aorta** back into the ventricles.
* This causes the second '**dub**' sound.
* Blood fills the relaxed atria and ventricles again
* Typical duration of each cardiac cycle: 0.8s = 75 beats per min
* ***_Pro Tip: When the heart pumps faster, such as during exercise, the duration of each cardiac cycle will be shorter._**

## 8 Coronary artery disease

**Atherosclerosis:** The disease where fatty deposits accumulate on the inner walls of arteries, narrowing the lumen.

**Coronary artery:** An artery that branches out of the aorta, sending oxygen and nutrients to the heart muscles.
* **Coronary artery disease:** When atherosclerosis occurs in a coronary artery.

**Heart attack**

* If a **faty deposit** ruptures in a **coronary artery**, a **blood clot** could form, blocking the **artery.**
* Blood with **oxygen** and **nutrients** cannot reach the **heart muscles** for them to release **energy** via **aerobic respiration**, hence they die, resulting in a **heart attack**.

**Preventive measures**

* Adopt a diet low in **saturated fats** and **cholesterol**

## Chapter 6 Transport in Humans CAQs

### 6.1 Important Definitions

Q: Define the term atherosclerosis.

* The disease where fatty deposits accumulate on the inner walls of arteries, narrowing the lumen.

### 6.2 Tissue Fluid

Q: The diagram shows a capillary and some tissue cells.

A) Diffusion of substances occurs at W and Y.

B) Diffusion of substances occurs at Y only.

C) Fluid only passes out of the capillary at X.

D) Tissue fluid passes into the capillary at Z.

(A)

* A: Diffusion occurs at W, X, Y, Z. This includes both W and Y, although it is incomplete, it is technically correct.

* B: Wrong, see above point.
* C: Wrong, fluid can exit along any part of the capillary (W, X, Z).
* D: Looking at **direction of bloodflow**, fluid will **exit the capillary at Z** to provide nutrients to cells, and then **re-enter at X**, removing waste products from cells.
* **Related Questions:*
* Q: What is present in the tissue fluid formed from the plasma? (Using the same diagram as above)
* This is testing on which substances can pass through the capillary walls.
* Can pass through (all the **small*
* molecules): Glucose, amino acids, water, mineral salts, urea, O2, CO2
* Cannot pass through (**large*
* substances): Blood cells, platelets, proteins (e.g. haemoglobin, fibrin, ADH, insulin)

### Circulatory System Diagram

Q: The diagrams represent the circulatory system. Which diagram is correct for an adult human?D
* Diagrams are usually mirror imaged, heart is flipped (left part in this diagram is the right side of the heart in real life, vice versa).
* Blood is pumped from **RV to lungs**, so **B is out** as it shows LV to lungs.
* Blood then goes from **lungs to LA**, so **C is out**.
* Between A and D, A is inaccurate as it shows a **vein connecting intestines back to the heart (this does not exist!)**. Hence D is the answer.

### Substance Concentrations Along Circulatory System

Q: The diagram represents part of the human circulatory system.

A) 1, 2, 3 and 4 B) 1, 3 and 4 only C) 1 and 4 only D) 2 and 3 only

(B)

* The further blood moves from the heart/more tissues it passes through, the lower the O2 and higher the CO2. So **lowest to highest CO2 concentration: V, W, X, Y, Z**.
* 1 correct, since W < X.
* 2 likely wrong, since Y has blood that passed through **intestines + liver**, probably has more CO2 than X which has only passed through kidneys.
* 3 correct since X < Z, since Z is blood just before entering lungs, has highest CO2.
* 4 correct since V < Z.
* **Related Questions:*
* Which comparisons of urea concentration are correct? (Using the same diagram as above)
* Urea will be highest in Y, as urea is produced via deamination in the liver.
* Urea will be lowest in X, as urea is filtered out of the blood by the kidneys.

### Cardiac Cycle Valves

Q: The graph shows pressure changes in the left atrium, the left ventricle and the aorta during one complete cardiac cycle.

### Blood Movement (blood pressure explanation)

*Q: Describe and explain how blood is pumped from the left atrium to the aorta. [4]
* During **atrial systole**, the left atrium **contracts**, **blood pressure** rises above that of the left ventricle.
* Blood moves past the **bicuspid valve**, entering the left ventricle.
* During **ventricular systole**, the left ventricle **contracts**, **blood pressure** rises above that of the aorta.
* Blood pushes past the aortic **semi-lunar valve** and **opens** it, entering the aorta.

* *_Pro Tip: When question asks "describe and explain", must explain how blood moves using blood pressure differences._
* **Related Questions:**
* Q: Describe **and** explain how blood entering the heart from the body organs reaches the lungs. [4]

### Route Taken By Blood

*Q: Describe the route taken by the blood from the intestine to the kidney. List the major blood vessels and organs involved. [4]
* Blood travels from the intestine to the liver via the hepatic portal vein, then exits the liver via the hepatic vein.
* It returns to the **right atrium** of the heart via the **vena cava**, and is pumped by the **right ventricle** to the **lungs** via the **pulmonary artery**.
* It returns to the **left atrium** via the **pulmonary vein**, and is pumped by the **left ventricle**, out the **aorta** to the kidneys.
* Finally, it enters the kidney via the **renal artery**.
* **Related Questions:**
* Q: Explain how a drug injected into rats was transported to the heart muscle. [4]
* Q: Describe how blood from the lungs is forced through the heart into the aorta. [4]

### Blood Vessel Structures

*Q: Explain the differences in the structures of arteries and veins, with reference to their functions. [6]
* Arteries have (A), while veins have (B).

### Capillary Adaptations

Q: Explain how capillaries are adapted for their function. [4]

* Capillaries are made of a one-cell-thick layer of endothelial cells, minimising the diffusion distance, increasing the rate substances diffuse in and out of capillaries.
* They branch repeatedly, increasing their surface area to volume ratio, increasing the diffusion rate of substances.
* The capillary wall is partially permeable, allowing small substances such as glucose and CO2 to diffuse in and out, while ensuring big ones such as blood proteins stay within.
* They have very large total cross-sectional surface area, lowering blood pressure and slowing blood down, for substances to have more time to diffuse in and out.
Q: Describe how substances move between capillaries and cells. [3]
* Capillaries bring nutrients and oxygen, which diffuse from the blood plasma to the tissue fluid.
* These then diffuse from tissue fluid into cells.
* Conversely, waste products and carbon dioxide diffuse out of the cells into the tissue fluid, then into the blood plasma of capillaries.

### Blood Flow in Veins

Q: Blood has near zero pressure when it reaches veins. Explain how blood returns to the heart from the veins. [2]

* Contraction of skeletal muscles exerts pressure on veins, forcing blood to move along.
* Semi-lunar valves in veins prevent backflow of blood, ensuring blood moves to heart in the right direction.

### Red Blood Cells

Q: Explain how red blood cells are adapted to their function. [3]

* They have a biconcave shape, increasing their surface area to volume ratio for faster diffusion of oxygen in and out of them.
* They lack a nucleus, for more space to pack in more haemoglobin, increasing their capacity for oxygen transport.
* They are flexible, allowing them to squeeze through tiny capillaries, in which they may become bell-shaped, further increasing their surface area to volume ratio.

### White Blood Cells

Q: Describe the role of white blood cells in protecting the body from disease. [3]* **Phagocytes** engulf **foreign particles** which can cause disease and destroy them.
* **Lymphocytes** produce **antibodies** that cause **foreign particles** to **agglutinate**, promoting **phagocytosis.**
* **Antibodies** also bind to and **neutralise** any harmful **toxins** produced by pathogens.

### Blood Clotting (Coagulation)

* Q: Explain how a blood clot is formed. [2]
* When blood vessels are damaged, **platelets** are activated, which trigger the conversion of **soluble fibrinogen** into **insoluble fibrin**,
* Forming **long insoluble Fibrin threads** which trap **red blood cells**, forming a **clot** at the site of injury.

### Blood Type Incompatibility

Q: What will happen if a patient with blood group O is given a transfusion of blood type AB? [3]

* The red blood cells transfused have **A** and **B** **antigens** on their **plasma membranes.**
* However, the blood group O patient has **anti-A** and **anti-B** **antibodies** in their **blood plasma**,
* Which bind to the transfused red blood cells, causing them to clump together and **agglutinate.**
* (This is dangerous as it could lead to the blockage of arteries.)
* **Related Questions:*
* Q: Explain what causes the incompatibility of blood between certain donors and recipients.
* Q: Describe and explain the undesirable consequence to the recipient when the blood type is not compatible.

### Valve Opening/Closing

Q: Explain how the (bicuspid) valve opens. [2]

* During ventricular diastole, the blood pressure of the left ventricle falls below that of the left atrium,
* resulting in blood flowing from the atrium to ventricle, forcing open the bicuspid valve.
* *_Pro Tip: For questions on explaining how valves open/close, explain in terms of pressure difference_
* **Related Questions:*
* Q: State what happens when the pressure in the atrium in higher than the pressure in the ventricle. [1]
* Q: Describe how blood from the lungs is forced through the heart into the aorta. [3]

### Fluctuation of Blood Pressure

Q: Explain why blood pressure fluctuates in arteries. [3]

* In arteries and arterioles, blood pressure fluctuates as arteries have thick elastic and muscular walls that stretch and recoil,
* and are directly connected to the aorta, which is connected to the left ventricle.
* Hence, blood pressure increases during ventricular systole as left ventricle contracts, and decreases during ventricular diastole as left ventricle relaxes.

### Coronary Artery Disease/Heart Attack

* Fatty deposits accumulate on the inner wall of a **coronary artery**, narrowing the **lumen**, **atherosclerosis*
* has occurred.
* If the fatty deposit ruptures, a **blood clot*
* could form, blocking the artery.
* Blood with **oxygen*
* and **nutrients*
* cannot reach the heart muscles for them to release **energy*
* via **aerobic respiration**, hence they die, resulting in a heart attack.
* **Related Questions:*
* Q: Sometimes blood clots can form inside a blood vessel and can be carried in the blood to the brain. The arteries in the brain may become blocked by the clot. Suggest how this blockage may affect the brain. [2] *Pro Tip: In the above case, would lead to the death of brain cells stroke

## 4. Harmful effects of tobacco smoke

**blood pressure* and **heart rate**

* Increases

**ease of blood clotting**, increasing the risk of **heart attacks**

*_Pro Tip: This increases 'wear and tear' of arteries, hence increasing the rate that fatty deposits accumulate._

* **Binds irreversibly with haemoglobin** such that it cannot transport O2 anymore, reducing the ability of blood to transport O2

* **Damages the**

**Carbon Monoxide**

**inermost layer** of blood vessels, increasing the rate that

**fatty deposits** accumulate in **arteries**, increasing

the risk of

**heart attacks**

* **Paralyses cilia, dust particles and pathogens cannot be expelled, which can result in:**

-

**Chronic bronchitis** (where the **epithelium** lining the airways are **inflamed** + persistent coughing)

- Persistent and violent coughing can lead to

**Emphysema** (when **partition walls** between **alveoli** break down, making it hard to breathe. The alveoli have lost

**elasticity**, resulting in the lungs being **inflated** with air.)

- Tar is a

**carcin***, increasing chances of **lung cancer**

*_Pro Tip: Carcinogen = something that causes cancer_

**5. Aerobic and anaerobic respiration*** Living things need **cellular respiration*
* to **release energy*
* for **cellular activities**, such as:
* Muscular contractions, cell division, active transport, etc.
* **Aerobic respiration:*
* The process where food substances are broken down into carbon dioxide and water, in the presence of oxygen, releasing a large amount of energy.
* Glucose + oxygen \(\rightarrow\) carbon dioxide + water + large amount of energy
* **C**6H12O6 + **6**O2 \(\rightarrow\) **6**CO2 + **6**H2O + large amount of energy
* **Anaerobic respiration (yeasts):*
* The process where food substances are broken down into carbon dioxide and ethanol, in the absence of oxygen, releasing a small amount of energy.
* Glucose \(\rightarrow\) carbon dioxide + ethanol + small amount of energy
* **This process is also called **alcoholic fermentation**
* **Anaerobic respiration (mammals):*
* The process where food substances are broken down into lactic acid, in the absence of oxygen, releasing a small amount of energy.
* Glucose \(\rightarrow\) lactic acid + small amount of energy
* **Oxygen debt:*
* The amount of oxygen needed to remove lactic acid from the body.
* During **vigorous*
* exercise, muscles demand more **energy*
* than can be generated by **aerobic respiration**.
* **Additional energy*
* is generated by **anaerobic respiration**, resulting in **lactic acid*
* An **oxygen debt*
* is incurred.
* **Lactic acid*
* is transported to the **liver**, where it is **removed**, which requires **oxygen*
* (this amount of oxygen = **oxygen debt**)
* Immediately after exercise, the person needs to consume more oxygen compared to at rest, to repay the **oxygen debt**, by:
* Fast **heart rate**: Carries oxygen around the body quickly
* and **faster breathing**: Intake large amounts of oxygen quickly _Need personalised guidance for O Level Pure Bio? Learn more here: www.thtbiotutor.com_

## Chapter 8 Excretion

**Learning Outcomes:**

1. Importance of excretion

2. Structure of kidneys and nephrons

3. Dialysis

**Keywords:**

* Afferent/efferent arteriole, ultrafiltration, high blood pressure
* Selective reabsorption, filtrate
* Kidney failure, partially permeable, long narrow and coiled, opposite direction

**if you're our student:** Excretion in Humans Crash Course Clips

**1. Importance of excretion**

**Excretion:** The process whereby metabolic waste products and toxic substances are removed from the body

* Our **metabolism** (chemical activities within cells) results in **metabolic waste products**.
* **Importance:** They must be excreted as they can harm the body if they accumulate to high concentrations.

**Examples of excretion in humans**

* Unicellular organisms use **diffusion** for excretion, multicellular organisms need organs* **Lungs** excrete CO2 during **expiration**
* **Urea** (product of deamination) is filtered out by **kidneys** and excreted in **urine**
* **Excess water** excreted by **sweating**, **expiration** and in **urine**
* **Bile pigment** excreted through **faeces**

**2. Structure of kidneys and nephrons**

* **Renal artery** brings blood to kidney, **renal vein** carries blood away
* **Kidneys** act as filters, removing unwanted substances
* **Ureter** carries urine to **bladder** where it is temporarily stored
* **Urethra** carries urine outside of body

_[Memory hack]_

How not to mix up ureter and urethra When you've been holding your pee in for very long and finally go toilet, you say "aaaaaaa"

Urethraaaa is the one through which urine leaves your body

**Parts of a nephron**

**Formation of urine**

* A **nephron** is the **basic functional unit** of the kidney that filters and removes waste substances from the blood to form urine.
* The processes involved that make this possible are **ultrafiltration** and **selective reabsorption.**

**Ultrafiltration:** The process where most of the blood plasma and dissolved substances are forced out of the glomerulus into the bowman's capsule by high blood pressure.
* Blood enters the **glomerulus** through the **afferent arteriole** and leaves through the **efferent arteriole**
* **Lumen** of **efferent arteriole** is smaller, generates **high blood pressure** which forces out most of the **blood plasma** and its **dissolved substances** (glucose, amino acids, mineral salts, urea, toxins, medicine, etc.)
* These substances enter the **Bowman's capsule**
* Large molecules such as **blood cells**, **platelets** and **proteins** cannot pass through the **basement membrane** that lines the glomerular capillaries

**Selective reabsorption:** The process where certain substances are reabsorbed from the filtrate back into the blood as they pass through nephrons.

* Useful substances are **selectively reabsorbed** while unwanted substances (or substances in excess) stay in the **filtrate** and become urine
* Water is reabsorbed* via **osmosis**
* ***_Pro Tip: Since water is not reabsorbed using energy, do not say it is_ *_**
* _selectively reabsorbed_, _only "reabsorbed"_.
* Glucose, amino acids, and some mineral salts are reabsorbed via **diffusion** and **active transport**

* Substances reabsorbed along nephron
* some water, some mineral salts, all glucose and all amino acids.
- some water, some mineral salts
* some water, some mineral salts
* only water

## 3. Dialysis

* Patients with **kidney failure** need to use a **dialysis machine** to filter waste products out of their blood

**Procedure**
* Blood is drawn from the **vein** in patient's arm into a **partially permeable** tube
* ***_Pro Tip:_ _Veins are safer as they are closer to the surface unlike arteries which are deeper in the arm. Veins also have low pressure_making it easier to stop the bleeding after dialysis._
* Tube does not allow large substances such as blood cells and platelets to pass through, but allows small substances such as waste products to diffuse out.
* Tube enters machine where it is bathed in **dialysis fluid/dialysate**.
* **Features of machine that increase efficiency**:
* Dialysate contains zero waste products, hence waste products from blood **diffuse*
* out down their **concentration gradients**.
* Dialysate has an equal concentration of useful substances (glucose, amino acids, mineral salts) as healthy blood, so there is no **diffusion**.
* Tubing is **long**, **narrow*
* and **coiled**, increases **SA:V**, increasing **diffusion*
* Dialysate flows **opposite direction*
* to blood, maintaining a **concentration gradient*
* along the entire length of the tubing for more waste products to **diffuse*
* Cleaned blood is returned via the **vein*
* in patient's forearm.

*FYI: There are actually 2 different types of cells of the islets of Langerhans that secrete insulin and glucagon respectively._

[Memory hack]

How to remember what insulin and glucagon do:

INulin is released to make glucose go INto the target cells when blood glucose is too high (hence reducing blood glucose)

Glucagon is the opposite - makes glucose come out of liver cells

[Memory hack]

How to not mix up Glycogen and Glucagon

GlycoGEN is a very GENerous storage of glucose, when the body needs glucose it "donates" it by being broken down to release glucose into the bloodstream

Diabetes mellitus: The condition where the body is unable to maintain blood glucose level within normal range.

Type I

Pancreas cannot produce insulin/enough insulin

Develops at a young age

Type II

Target organs (liver and muscles) lose sensitivity to insulin

Develops at an older age, linked to unhealthy lifestyle

[Memory hack]

How to differentiate Type I and Type II diabetes:

I comes before II* Type I comes earlier in life, as it is genetic hence the person has issues producing insulin since young
* Type II comes later in life, due to unhealthy lifestyle

**Symptoms**

* Persistent high blood glucose
* Glucose found in urine
* Frequent urination
* Frequently feeling dizzy, fatigue
* Unexpected weight loss
* Wounds take longer to heal

**Risk factors**

* Obesity/overweight
* Age
* Family history (diabetes can be inherited)
* Unhealthy blood lipid levels
* Sedentary lifestyle

**Prevention**

* Exercise regularly, maintain healthy bodyweight
* Eat a balanced, healthy diet, low in calories, high in fibre
* Doing the above improves blood lipid levels.

**Treatment**

* There is currently no cure for diabetes
* Type 1: Insulin injections* Type 2: Control blood glucose level
* Diet lower in carbohydrates
* Exercise regularly
* If condition worsens, have to inject insulin/take medication to improve body's sensitivity to insulin

## 3 Osmoregulation and ADH

**Osmoregulation:** The process where the amount of water and concentrations of solutes in blood are controlled to maintain constant water potential in the body.

* **Osmoregulation** works by **negative feedback**, and attempts to restore the set-point of blood **water potential**
* **Osmoreceptors** are cells in the **hypothalamus** that detect changes in blood **water potential**
* More/less **Antidiuretic Hormone (ADH)*** is secreted by the pituitary gland in response to a change detected
* **"Pro Tip: A diuretic is something that makes you pee more. Therefore Anti-diuretic means anti-pee, so you pee less and urine becomes more concentrated.**

_[Memory Hack]_

* Think of ADH as the "water conservation hormone" (I like to visualise ADH as the water wally mascot)
* When you don't have enough water, more of it is secreted to conserve water in your body 

## 4 Parts of skin

**Sweat**

* Contains water, salts (mainly sodium chloride) and small amounts of urea
* Hence sweating is a means of **excretion**

**Adipose (fat) tissues**

* **Adipose** cells = Fat cells
* Fat is a **poor conductor** of heat, reducing heat loss through the skin

## 5 Temperature regulation

**Negative feedback is involved**

* Changes in internal temperature are the **stimulus*** Detected by **thermoreceptors** in **hypothalamus**, hypothalamus sends **nerve impulses to effectors** that carry out **corrective mechanisms** to counteract the change in internal temperature
* Once **set-point** is restored, thermoreceptors detect this and send nerve impulses to hypothalamus to **stop** the **corrective mechanisms**

Responses to changes in internal temperature [MASS]

When sweat glands secrete more sweat, more water in sweat **evaporates**, hence more **latent heat** is lost.

Shivering, the **rapid**

**contraction of skeletal muscles, further increases the rate of aerobic respiration, releasing more heat energy.**

## 3 Reflex actions

**Reflex action:** An immediate response to a specific stimulus without conscious control.

* Involves a **reflex centre** (either brain or spinal cord).
* **Spinal reflexes** use spinal cord as reflex centre, e.g. knee jerk reflex, withdrawal reflex when touching a hot object
* **Cranial reflexes** use the brain as reflex centre, e.g. blink reflex, accommodation reflex, pupil reflex, sneezing, coughing
* **Reflex arc:** The shortest pathway for nerve impulses to travel from receptor to effector during a reflex action.

* **Examples of reflex actions: Knee jerk reflex*, pupil reflex, touching hot/sharp object, blink reflex, grasp reflex, cough reflex, sneeze reflex, production of gastric juice, production of saliva, secretion of adrenaline** *_Pro Tip: For the knee jerk reflex, this is a stretch reflex. When there is a tap on the tendon below the knee, stretch receptors detect this and result in the contraction of the quadriceps muscle (to prevent the muscle from overstretching and being injured)_
* **Receptors you should be familiar with in syllabus:*
* **Pain receptors*
* **Stretch receptors*

**Pathway of nerve impulses questions:** * When (incident), (receptors) detect this, nerve impulses are generated and travel along a sensory neurone.** * They are **transmitted to a relay neurone, in the (either brain/spinal cord), which is the reflex centre.** * **Nerve impulses** are then **transmitted to a motor neurone,** then to the (thing that does the action), which is the **effector**,** * Triggering it to (response triggered), so that (where possible, the purpose for the reflex action).

* **Avoid touching** nose, eyes, mouth
* **Use a mask** (prevents **droplets** from travelling/other's **droplets** from reaching you)
* **Cover** nose and mouth when coughing/sneezing (prevents **droplets** from travelling)
* **Note: Not applicable for pneumococcal disease,** since it doesn't spread via contaminated surfaces.**

Treatment **Take antibiotics** as prescribed by a doctor prescribed by a doctor Prevention

* **Preumococcial vaccination**

* **Soap and water/hand sanitiser* don't Touch eyes, nose, mouth
* use a Mask
* Cover nose and mouth when coughing/sneezing

**Vaccine:** Contains an agent resembling a pathogen, and prevent infectious diseases by stimulating white blood cells to quickly produce antibodies when the pathogen invades.

* Pathogens have **antigens** (substances that trigger the production of antibodies), such as the **proteins** on the pathogens' surface
* The agent in the **vaccine** have an **antigen** that the real **pathogen** has, thus resembling the pathogen
* After vaccination, **white blood cells** recognise the specific **antigen** and produce **antibodies** against it
* How vaccines protect you from the real pathogen:

* Some of these **white blood cells** remain in the body for a long time
* When the real **pathogen** enters the person, these white blood cells **recognise** it and **quickly** produce **large amounts** of **antibodies** to destroy the pathogen.

**How antibodies help kill pathogens:**

* Cause pathogens to **clump** together **(agglutination)**, promoting phagocytosis
* Bind to and **neutralises** harmful **toxins** that pathogens produce

**Why there might still be cases of an infection even after a vaccine is introduced:**

* Not everyone may have taken the vaccine, hence were not **immune**
* The **pathogen mutated**, it is now no longer the same as the **agent** in the vaccine that the body has **immunity** against.

Vaccine's effects may not last a lifetime, as the **white blood cells** that were trained to **recognise** the **pathogen** died after some time/became too few in number

**Antibiotics:** Drugs that inhibit the growth of or kill bacteria.

Examples of how antibiotics could work:

Inhibiting **synthesis** of bacterial **cell wall** (cell wall weakens, water enters by osmosis, bacteria bursts)

Breaking up the bacterial **cell membrane**

Inhibiting **enzymes** in the **cytoplasm** which are required for **growth**

Inhibiting **protein synthesis** at **ribosomes**

Antibiotics do not work on viruses, due to the differences between their structures

Viruses do not have: **cell walls**, **cell membrane**, **ribosomes**

Many antibiotics work by inhibiting the growth of bacteria, but viruses do not **grow**

Viruses cannot be directly killed, instead has to be eradicated by the person's own **immune system**

**Antibiotic resistance**

Due to variation, some bacteria in a population are **less sensitive** to the antibiotic, hence lesser chance of being **killed**

If a **course of antibiotics** is not completed, some of the **less sensitive** bacteria may **survive and reproduce**

They multiply, resulting in a **strain** of **antibiotic resistant bacteria**, which are even harder to treat.

**1. Leaf structure**

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:145]

**Waterproof**, reduces water loss via **evaporation** from leaf surfaces

* Both layers are made of closely packed **epidermal cells** and produce the
* **waxy cuticle**
* Upper epidermis/Lower
* Upper epidermis does not have any
* **chloroplasts**
* Lower epidermis has
* **chloroplasts** only in the **guard cells**
* Tiny openings formed by two **guard cells**, which allow

**gaseous exchange** to occur
* **Stoma size is controlled by**
* **guard cells:** In the presence of
* light,
* **guard cells** open stomata. In the dark, **guard cells**

* close stomata.
* Just under upper epidermis, so they can receive as much

**sunlight** as possible for **photosynthesis**.
* **Contain**
* **many chloroplasts**, so more **photosynthesis** can be carried out per cell
* **Long, cylindrical and **vertically** arranged, so that many of them can be packed together, increasing the total amount of
* **photosynthesis** that is carried out by this layer.
* **Fewer chloroplasts than **palisade mesophyll** cells
* **Consists of**
* **irregularly** shaped cells that have **large intercellular air spaces**
* between cells
* Mesophyll cells are coated with a **thin film of moisture**, which allows
* **CO2 to dissolve** in it before **diffusing** into
* mesophyll cells.
* **Intercellular air spaces** have large **SA:V**, for **carbon dioxide**

and **oxygen** to quickly **diffuse** in and out of mesophyll cells

## 2 Photosynthesis

**Photosynthesis:** The process whereby carbon dioxide and water are converted into glucose and oxygen, in the presence of light energy and chlorophyll.

* **Light energy** is absorbed by **chlorophyll** and used in converting carbon dioxide and water into **glucose**
* **Oxygen** gas is produced as a **by-product**

**Word Equation:**

Carbon dioxide + Water Chlorophyll

**Chemical Equation:**

**Fate of glucose**

* Used in **aerobic respiration** to **release energy**
* Excess glucose stored as **starch** for **energy storage**
* Used to synthesise **cellulose** for **cell walls**
* Converted to **sucrose** to be transported in the **phloem** to other parts of the plant
* Converted to **amino acids**, which are then used to form **proteins** (to build new cell parts)
* Converted to **fats** for **energy storage** or to build new **cell parts**

**3. Factors affecting photosynthesis**

**Limiting factor**: A factor that directly affects the rate of the reaction if its quantity is increased.

**Light intensity**
* As light intensity increases, more **light energy** is absorbed by **chlorophyll**
* and converted into **chemical energy**, increasing **photosynthesis** rate.
* At very high light intensity, further increasing it has **no effect** on rate. Light intensity is **no longer a limiting factor** (some other factor is limiting).

**CO2 concentration**

* As CO2 concentration increases, there is more CO2 available to be converted into **glucose**, increasing ** photosynthesis** rate.
* At very high CO2 concentration, increasing it further has **no effect** on rate. CO2 concentration is **no longer a limiting factor** (some other factor is limiting).

*_Pro Tip: Atmospheric concentration is around 0.03%, while the concentration where CO2 no longer becomes limiting is **0.13%** and above._

**Temperature**

* Since **enzymes** are involved in photosynthesis, the photosynthesis-temperature graph looks the **same** as an enzyme-temperature graph.

## 4 Bonus: Procedure for leaf starch test in experiments (useful for practical)

* Place plant in dark room for 2 days, this **de-starches** the plant
* Carry out the experiment (e.g. whether photosynthesis works if leaf is placed in a sealed bag)
* Place the leaf in **boiling water** for 2min to kill the cells, **stopping further photosynthesis**.
* Place the leaf in a boiling tube with **ethanol** into boiling water bath,
* **removing chlorophyll** so that the green colour of chlorophyll does not affect any colour change later on
* Place leaf into **boiling water** for 1 min to **soften the leaf** (makes leaf more permeable for iodine to enter) and **remove alcohol**
* Add a few drops of **iodine** onto the leaf to **test for starch**

### 13.1 Transport in Plants

**Learning Outcomes:**

2. Xylem and phloem + their positions throughout a plant
3. Transpiration
4. Factors affecting transpiration

* Lignified, pits, collapse, end walls, unobstructed flow
* Translocation, manufactured food substances, sap
* Unidirectional, bidirectional, porous sieve plates
* Transpiration, transpiration pull
* Intercellular air spaces, thin film of moisture, evaporates, water vapour

* Wilting, turgidity, non-woody stem, total leaf surface area
* Sunken stomata, pits, succulent/fleshy, spines

**if you're our student:** Transport in Plants Crash Course Clips

**Role of root hair cells**

* **Mineral salts** are transported via **active transport** from the surrounding soil into the cell.
* This results in root hair cells having lower **water potential** than the surrounding soil, hence water flows in passively via **osmosis.**

**How water enters at the roots**

* Water enters root hair cells via **osmosis**\(\rightarrow\) root hair cells have higher **water potential** than the inner cells, water moves via **osmosis** to inner cells
* This process of osmosis repeats until water reaches the **xylem vessels**

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:154]

* How to remember position of xylem and phloem in stem
* Which is more crucial, food or water? Water. Since xylem carries water, it needs to be more protected, hence it's on the inside.

* Picture the stem's vascular bundle (you know that the xylem is on the inside), curling outwards to form the leaf's vascular bundle. That's why xylem would be on top, and phloem below

* Yes, deposited in No xylem walls to **strengthen** it, prevents xylem from **collapse**.
* Can be deposited in **rings/spiral** bands/entire wall except for **pits** Energy required? No, substances are **r**nsported passively **r**yes, **active transport**

Direction of transport **Unidirectional (upwards only) **u**p and down)

Alive? **Dead,** and has no cell parts except **cell wall** **r**yes, but **sieve tube elements** lack **nucleus, mitochondria**, and many other **organelles**

Companion cells - **Have**

**many mitochondria**, to provide a lot of **energy** needed for **sieve tube elements** to transport **manufactured food substances**

End walls (a.k.a cross **walls) None, to **m**low **unobstructed flow** of water + min. salts

**Transpiration:** The loss of water vapour from the aerial parts of a plant, mainly through the stomata in its leaves.

* In leaves, water moves out the **mesophyll** cells by **osmosis**, forming a **thin film of moisture** (1), which **evaporates** into **water vapour** in the **intercellular air spaces** (2)
* It **diffuses** out of leaves via **stomata**, down its **concentration gradient**. (3)
* **Water potential** of mesophyll cells has decreased, hence water moves from **xylem vessels** in leaves to **replace** water lost in mesophyll cells. (4)
* This causes a **whole column of water** to be pulled up xylem vessels from roots to leaves, by **transpiration pull**
* **Transpiration pull:** The suction force created due to transpiration that pulls water and mineral salts up the xylem

[frame]

Transpiration process [Fake Vampire Drinks Red Water]
* **F:** thin Film of moisture
* **V:** water **V**apour
* **D:** Diffuses out via stomata
* **R:** water in xylem **Replaces water lost from mesophyll cells
* **W:** causes **W**hole column of water to be pulled up

## 4 Factors affecting transpiration

* As temperature increases, kinetic energy of water molecules increases
* Water **evaporates** faster from the **thin film of moisture** into **intercellular air spaces**, more **water vapour diffuses** out of **stomata**, increasing transpiration rate
* **Light intensity**

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:160]

Just like a wet towel would dry faster in the wind compared to still air, plants "dry out" faster in the wind (a.k.a. higher transpiration rate)

## 5. Witting

* Transpiration is a **consequence** of **gaseous exchange**, in the presence of light **stomata** open wider to allow more CO2 to enter for **photosynthesis**, however this also increases the rate that **water vapour diffuses** out

**importance of Turgidity**

* Usually, **mesophyll cells** are **turgid**, keeping the leaves **firm** and **spread widely** for maximum **surface area** for higher rate of **photosynthesis**
* For plants with **non-woody** stems, **turgidity** keeps the plant **upright** to reach for sunlight

**When wilting occurs**

* Wilting occurs when **rate of transpiration > rate of water uptake**
* Due to a **net loss** of water to the plant, **central vacuoles** of cells shrink, **mesophyll cells** lose **turgor pressure** and become **flaccid**, resulting in the wilted look of the plant
* **"Pro Tip: Think of 'turgor pressure' as how turgid a plant cell is!**

**Causes of wilting**

* Too high light intensity
* Too high temperature
* Too much **fertil**, lowering soil **water potential** below that of root cells, resulting in water leaving the roots

**Advantages and disadvantages of wilting*** Advantages: Reduced **leaf surface area + flaccid** guard cells close **stomata** reduces **transpiration rate**, which helps conserve water
* Disadvantages: Due to closed **stomata**, less CO2 enters leaves. Due to reduced **total leaf surface area**, less light is captured, leading to reduced **photosynthesis** rate.
* ***_Pro Tip: Total leaf surface area is reduced, NOT leaf surface area to volume ratio_.

* Hairs and a curled/rolled leaf structure traps water vapour around sunken stomata
* Water vapour accumulates outside stomata + is trapped by hairs, increasing humidity, decreasing transpiration rate
* Few leaves/Small leaf surface area/Leaves reduced to spines
* Thick cuticle
* Succulent/fleshy leaves that store water _Need personalised guidance for O Level Pure Bio? Learn more here: www.thatbiotutor.com_14. Organisms and their Environment

**if you're our student:** Organisms and their Environment Crash Course Clips

## 1 Food chains and food webs

* **Population:** A group of organisms of the same species that live together in a habitat
* **Habitat:** The place an organism lives
* **Community:** Comprises all the populations living and interacting with one another in a habitat
* **Ecosystem:** A community of organisms interacting with one another and their physical environment

**Food Chain:** A series of organisms through which energy is transferred in the form of food

* **Herbivores:** Only eat plants (usually, **primary consumers** are herbivores)
* **Carnivores:** Only eat meat
* **Omnivores:** Eat both plants and meat
* Each step in the food chain is a **trophic level** (the diagram above has 4 trophic levels)

**Trophic level:** The feeding position that an organism occupies in a food chain.
* **Producers:** Organisms that take up the first trophic level, and make their own food from inorganic materials through photosynthesis.
* **Consumers:** Organisms that obtain food by feeding on other organisms.

**Food Webs:**

* Made of interlinked food chains
* Shows the feeding relationships in a community

**2. Non-cyclic energy flow**

* **Producers are photosynthesising** plants that obtain their energy from the Sun
* This energy is transferred up the food chain in the form of carbon compounds when producers are eaten by consumers
* Some energy is used by organisms for growth and repair**How energy is lost at each trophic level:
* As **heat** to the surroundings due to **cellular respiration**
* As chemical energy trapped within **exreted** and **egested** substances (eg. urine and faeces)
* As chemical energy trapped in the **uneaten parts** when an organism dies (e.g. bones)
* *_Pro Tip: Decomposers will use the above substances for cellular respiration, releasing energy as heat._
* Therefore, only **10%** of energy is actually passed on from one **trophic level** to the next
* Energy flow is thus **linear** and **non-cyclic** (energy can't be reused)
* Energy must be constantly provided by the **sun** to maintain ecosystems

## 3 Ecological pyramids

Pyramid of Biomass
* Biomass at each trophic level = total mass of all individuals of that organism type
* Biomass = Mass of 1 organism **X** number of that organism.

**Pyramid of Numbers**

* Usually, pyramid of numbers is upright (Since usually, the higher the trophic level, the fewer the number of organisms)
* However, whenever there is a parasitic relationship, the lower trophic level's organism can support many organisms of the trophic level above it (the parasite).
* E.g. Tree/Plant \(\rightarrow\) Insects
* E.g. Animal \(\rightarrow\) Fleas/Ticks

*Pro Tip: The pyramid of biomass is still upright for the above food chain.
How carbon enters food chains
* CO2 from the atmosphere is absorbed by **plants** and converted into **glucose** during ** photosynthesis**
* Glucose is also converted to other **carbon compounds** (starch, fats, proteins, etc.)
* When consumers eat plants, **carbon** is transferred up the **food chain**
* Allowing **energy** to passed from one organism to another in the form of **carbon compounds**

How carbon enters the non-living system
* CO2 is released into atmosphere during **aerobic respiration** by producers, consumers and decomposers
* This maintains CO2 concentration in the atmosphere, so there is a constant supply of CO2 for **photosynthesis*** **Fossil fuels** come from dead **organic matter** buried over long periods of time. When burnt for energy (**combustion**), it releases CO2 into the atmosphere

**Carbon Sink**: An area which stores carbon as carbon compounds indefinitely, and releases less carbon than it takes in.

* vs **Carbon source**: Releases more carbon than it takes in

* Forests
* Trees take in CO2 through **photosynthesis** and convert it into carbon compounds such as cellulose which they use for growth and repair
* Trees can be buried and become **fossil fuels** after they die
* Oceans
* During **photosynthesis**, **phytoplankton** take in CO2 from the air to form **carbon compounds** such as **glucose**,
* which is transferred to other organisms in the ocean which eat them up the **food chain**.
* As CO2 is **soluble in water**, it **dissolves** into the ocean
* Dead organisms may be buried at the **seabed** and become **fossil fuels**

[Memory shortcut] How oceans act as carbon sinks (PDF)

* Photosynthesis
* Dissolve
* Fossil fuels

**5. Impact of Man on the Ecosystem**

**Solution:** The addition of substances to the environment that damage it, making it unfit for life.

**Sewage**

* Should not be discharged into water bodies like rivers/lakes as:
* It may contain harmful bacteria that would cause diseases to those who drink it (e.g. Cholera)
* Could cause **europhication:** The process where a body of water receives excessive nutrients, leading to excessive growth of algae and floating water plants.
* Untreated sewage is dumped/fertilisers are washed by rain into a body of water
* **Nutrients (Nitrates and phosphates)** in the untreated sewage/fertilisers allow **algae**/floating water plants to grow rapidly across the water surface (algae bloom)
* They block **sunlight** from reaching below, **submerged plants** have insufficient light for **photosynthesis** and die
* Other animals also die due to the lack of **dissolved oxygen**.
* **Aerobic bacteria** decomposes the dead **organic matter**, further decreasing **dissolved oxygen**.
* Hence, many organisms in the river die due to the lack of **dissolved oxygen** in area.

**[Memory shortcut]**

* Eutrophication process [NASA]
* **N:** Nutrients (Nitrates and Phosphates)
* **A:** Algae bloom
* **S:** Submerged plants
* **A:** Aerobic bacteria

**Plastic Pollution**

* Plastic is **non-biodegradable** and **indigestible**. Wildlife that feed on plastic often die as it blocks their **stomachs** and **intestines**.
* Burning of plastic waste contributes to **global warming**
* Harmful chemicals from plastic waste in **landfills** can **leach** into rivers and seas, **poisoning** wildlife
* Plastic in the ocean can be broken into tiny pieces (**microplastics**), resulting in **bioaccumulation** and **biomagnification**.

**Bioaccumulation:** The process where certain substances are not excreted, and accumulate in the bodies of organisms over time.

* Toxic chemicals are taken up by organisms in contaminated water/when they eat food or prey containing these chemicals.
* Some toxic chemicals cannot be **exreted**, so they accumulate in organisms' bodies, **bioaccumulation** has occurred.
* These substances are usually non-biodegradable
* Biodegradable = capable of being decomposed by bacteria or other living organisms
* Common examples: Heavy metals like mercury, lead, insecticides like DDT, and microplastics.

**Biomagnification:** The process where a substance increases in concentration higher up the food chain.

* **Consumers** in each **trophic level** have to consume many organisms of the lower trophic level (due to inefficient energy transfer).
* Hence they ingest the toxic chemicals present in multiple organisms, and toxic chemicals accumulate in high concentrations within consumers. **Biomagnification** has occurred.

* The top consumer is most affected by the toxic chemicals as they are present in the highest concentrations, and could die if present in lethal concentrations.

**Deforestation**

* Loss of **biodiversity**
* Organisms lose their habitats and may become **extinct**
* Increased **global warming**
* With fewer trees to absorb CO2 via photosynthesis, more CO2 would remain in the atmosphere
* Cutting of trees also releases CO2 when the remains are decomposed
* **Soil erosion**
* Tree roots hold soil together, and the forest canopy protects topsoil from force of rain
* With less trees, soil is more likely to be washed away
* **Flooding**
* Eroded soil may be deposited in rivers, blocking the flow of water
* Water level rises and floods surrounding areas
* **Desertification**
* After topsoil is eroded, barren land cannot support plant life

**Global warming:** The rise in global average temperatures

* Caused by increased **greenhouse gas** emissions, especially CO2
* **Greenhouse gases** trap heat in earth's atmosphere, increasing global temperature
* Common **emissions** from **human activities**: **Deforestation**, **combustion** of **fossil fuels**, **combustion** of plastic waste, emitted from **petrol-based vehiclesHow we can reduce global warming:
* Reduce use of fossil fuels, use **renewable energy** sources like wind and solar instead
* Save electricity
* Switch from petrol-based to **electric vehicles**
* Conserve forests

## 6 Conservation

Reasons for conservation
* To preserve *
* (the range of species found in an ecosystem)
* of one species could affect the **balance*
* of the ecosystem
* Ecosystems have **scientific value**, as useful information can be obtained through scientific research of diverse organisms
* We rely on wild plants for certain medicines
* Economic purposes: To obtaining food and raw materials sustainably (eg. fish, timber)
* Our crops rely on natural **pollinators** to reproduce
* Conserving **biodiversity** maintains a large **gene pool**, allowing us to improve crops and livestock by **cross-breeding** different varieties of wild plants with **favourable traits**
* Preserve natural scenery, which also brings economic benefits through tourism

Conserving forests
* Cut trees selectively at a controlled rate
* Do not cut down young trees

**1. DNA (Deoxyribonucleic Acid)**

**Structure of DNA**

* DNA contains genetic information
* Made from two **anti-parallel** strands (facing opposite directions), wound together in a **double helix** shape
* Each strand is made of many **nucleotides**
* Is made of **nucleotides**, which have:
* **Phosphate group**
* **Nitrogenous/nitrogen-containing base** (Adenine/Thymine/Guanine/Cytosine)* The strands are held together by **complementary base pairing**, with **hydrogen bonds*
* and **Thymine*

* Therefore ratio of A:T and G:C must = 1:1

_[Memory hack]_

* Remembering which nitrogenous bases pair together
* Apple Tree: Adenine -- Thymine
* Car in a Gargage: Cytosine -- Guanine

**DNA vs Gene vs Allele vs Chromosome vs Chromatin**

* **DNA**: DNA is a type of molecule, just like carbohydrates, proteins and fats are types of molecules.
* DNA can be very short, or very long
* **Gene:** A sequence of DNA nucleotides that codes for a specific polypeptide
* A long DNA molecule can consist of many genes along it
* **Pro Tip: Gene has a more detailed definition in the topic Inheritance**.
* **Allele**: One of the alternative forms of a gene, that occupies the same gene locus on a pair of homologous chromosomes.

* Alleles usually have slight **nucleotide** differences, but are otherwise very similar.
* **Chromosome**: A very long, tightly packed DNA molecule that consists of many genes.
* In the nucleus, chromosomes are not yet condensed, and are in the loose form of chromatin. Chromosomes condense during cell division.
* **Chromatin**: The form of DNA found in the nucleus, where DNA is loosely-packed and coiled around proteins.

## 2 DNA to Protein

*_Pro Tip: The following details of transcription and translation are FYI. Only a brief understanding is needed to answer questions._

**Transcription:** The process where DNA is used as a template to synthesise a strand of mRNA.

* The message in the **gene** is copied onto a molecule called **messenger RNA (mRNA)**
* Every 3 **nucleotides** on the original DNA is a **codon**, and each **codon** determines an **amino acid** in the polypeptide

**Translation:** The process where mRNA is used as a template to synthesise a sequence of amino acids, forming a polypeptide.

* mRNA leaves the **nucleus** and enters the **cytoplasm**
* mRNA attaches to a **ribosome**, the ribosome **moves along** the mRNA, synthesising a **polypeptide**
* The **polypeptide** is released, and folds into a **protein**

**Genetic Engineering:** The technique used to transfer genes from one organism to another.

* Transferred gene can be expressed in the recipient organism
* Requires a **vector** (a vehicle that transfers genes)
* A commonly used vector is a **plasmid** (small, extrachromosomal circular DNA found in bacteria)
* **Transgenic organism:** An organism which contains **foreign genes** after gene transfer.

**Restriction enzymes**

* Naturally found in bacteria as defences against viruses
* Recognise a specific short nucleotide sequence, the **restriction site**
* They cut DNA there, resulting in **sticky ends** (where unpaired nucleotides can complementary base pair with another such strand to form double stranded DNA)

**Genetic Engineering of bacteria to produce human insulin**

**inserting gene into plasmid**

* A **restriction enzyme** is used to cut a section of DNA containing the human **insulin gene**, creating **sticky ends**
* The same **restriction enzyme** is used to cut a **plasmid**, creating **sticky ends**
* Plasmid and DNA are mixed, allowing them to **anneal*** via **complementary base pairing** at the sticky ends
* _*Writing "bind" is accepted_
* **DNA ligase** is added to **seal** them together, the result is a **recombinant plasmid** which carries the insulin gene

**inserting recombinant plasmid into bacteria**

* **Heat/electric shock** treatment is applied to the bacteria that create **pores** in their **membranes** so they can uptake the **recombinant plasmids**
* Those bacteria become **transgenic** bacteria, and will produce insulin as part of their **metabolic processes**

*_Pro Tip: Only a small percentage of bacteria will successfully uptake plasmids. They can be isolated by mixing with an antibiotic that the recombinant plasmids make them resistant to._[Memory Shortcut] Genetic engineering process [Really Talkative PALS] R: Restriction enzyme T:Target gene P: Plasmid A:Anneals via complementary base pairing L:DNA Ligase S:Shock treatment

* **Importance of reduction division:**
* Meiosis is a **reduction division**, as **gametes** produced have half the **number of chromosomes** as the **parent cell**.
* During **fertilisation**, nuclei of the **haploid gametes** fuse, forming a **diploid zygote**, restoring the **diploid number** in the **zygote**.
* This ensures that chromosome number stays **constant** and does not double with every successive generation.

**Used in:** Formation of **sex cells/gametes**

* Hence, meiosis only exists in **sexual** organisms
* **Daughter cells** are **genetically different** from **parent cell**, resulting in **variation** in the **offspring** of sexual reproduction (see section below on the advantages of sexual reproduction)

_[Memory hack]_

* How to not mix up Mitosis and Meiosis
* **M**tosis: **Make** Identical cells
* **ME**iosis: **Make** Eggs or sperm (sex cells)

**2. Sexual vs Asexual Reproduction**

**Asexual reproduction:** The process that produces genetically identical offspring from one parent, without the fusion of nuclei of male and female gametes.

* Examples: Binary fission (bacteria), budding (yeasts), reproducing by spores, vegetative propagation** *_Pro Tip: Vegetative propagation is when a fragment of a parent plant_

_regrows into an entire new plant_.

**Sexual reproduction:** The process that involves the fusion of nuclei of male and female gametes to form a diploid zygote, producing genetically different offspring.

* Examples: Humans, flowering plants, etc.

## 3 Bonus: Advantages of asexual and sexual reproduction

\begin{tabular}{p{142.3pt} p{142.3pt}} \hline
**Asexual reproduction** & **Sexual reproduction** \\ \hline  & As **genetic variation** exists, the species can adapt to **sudden environmental changes** (e.g. disease/climate change) faster. Their **population** is hence are less **susceptible** to being wiped out, increasing their chances of **survival**. \\ \hline No need to spend **energy** on **reproductive organs** & Offspring can **inherit favourable traits** from both parents* \\ \hline No need to wait for **fertilisation**, hence reproduction is **faster**, can **colonise** an area quickly \\ \hline \end{tabular}

*_Pro Tip: Think of this as getting the 'best of both worlds'._

The base of the flower where the other parts of the flower are attached

*Pro Tip: It "receives" all the parts of the flower, hence its name.

*Proects the flower during the bud stage

* Can be **colourful** to attract pollinators
* Can have

**nectar guides**

## 5 Pollination

* **Pollination:** The transfer of pollen grains from an anther to a stigma.

* **Type** **Self-pollination** **Cross-pollination** **Occurs within the same** **Occurs between different plants of the same species
* **[Memory shortcut]** **Features of flowers that favour self/cross pollination [MOP]** **M:** Bisexual flowers, both male and female parts mature at same time timings/flowers only either have male or female parts
* **O:** Flowers may not **O:** Flowers may not **O**pen** **P:** Position (anther higher than stigma so pollen can fall on stigma)
* **P:** Position (anther higher/lower than stigma)

* **Pro Tip: Self-pollination is NOT asexual reproduction.** It involves fertilisation = it is sexual reproduction, hence there is still genetic variation, just lesser variation than cross-pollination.

* **Pollinating Agent*** **Insects visit flowers to obtain nectar** **Anthers brush against insects, pollen grains stick onto their hairy bodies/hairy back and legs (more suitable for bees)
* **Pollen grains are transferred from the insect to stigma of the same/different flower

* **Stigma** **Small and sticky** **Large and feathery**

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:192]

* O: Odour
* A: Anthers
* P: Protruding reproductive parts
* G: Pollen Grains
* N: Nectar (and nectar guides)
* C: Colourful petals

## 6 Fertilisation

**Fertilisation:** The fusion of male and female sex nuclei, resulting in a diploid zygote.

**Process leading to fertilisation:**

* After pollination, stigma produces a **sugary fluid**, stimulating pollen grain to **germinate**.
* A **pollen tube** grows from the pollen grain, secreting **enzymes** to digest a path through **sigma**, **style** and **overy wall**.

* Pollen tube enters an **ovule** via the **micropyle**.
* The pollen tube **absorbs sap** and bursts, releasing the **male sex nucleus** which fuses with the **ovum,** forming a **diploid zygote**.
* *_Pro Tip: (FYI) The other nuclei helps form the endosperm, which will be the food reserves for the seedling._

_[Memory shortcut]_

* Fertilisation process in flowers [STEMA]
* **S:** Sugary fluid
* **T:** pollen Tube
* **E:** Enzymes secreted
* **M:** Micropyle
* **A:** Absorbs sap and bursts, releasing male sex nucleus, fertilisation

**After fertilisation**

* Flower withers
* Ovary turns into a fruit
* Ovules turn into seeds
* If fertilisation does not occur in an ovule, it degenerates when the ovary turns into a fruit
* At least 1 ovule must be fertilised for the ovary to turn into a fruit

**Paberty:** The stage where a person becomes physically mature and capable of sexual reproduction.

* Secondary sexual characteristics appear due to sex hormones (testosterone in males, oestrogen + progesterone in females):
* Sexual organs enlarge, and the person begins to produce **gametes*
* In females, menstrual cycles begin
* Public and armpit hair appears
* Includes other physical changes, e.g. Voice deepening in men, hips broaden in women.

## 2. **M**enstrual cycle

* Typical menstrual cycle = 28 days, but it varies. It could vary more or stop completely if the person is experiencing high stress/poor diet/poor sleep, etc.

## Chapter 4. Foetal development

### 4.1.1. **Placenta**

* After implantation, **finger-like projections** called **villi**, containing **blood vessels** from the **embryo**, grow into the uterine lining, forming the **placenta**.
* Placenta secretes **progesterone** to maintain thickness of the uterine lining, supporting pregnancy.
* **Oxygen** and **nutrients** such as glucose, amino acids **diffuse** from maternal to foetal capillaries
* **Metabolic waste products** such as urea and carbon dioxide **diffuse** from foetal to maternal capillaries
* Some **antibodies** diffuse from maternal to foetal capillaries, giving the **footus immunity** against some diseases
* Maternal and foetal blood do not mix, because:
* Mother's blood pressure > foetus, would kill foetus
* Mother and foetus may have incompatible **blood types**

**Amiotic sac**

Contains amniotic fluid and the foetus

Amiotic fluid

**Supports** and **cushions** foetus by absorbing shock

Allows some movement, promoting **muscular development**

**Lubricates** birth canal during childbirth

 maintains a steady **temperature** around foetus

*_Pro Tip: When a pregnant woman's 'water bag' bursts nearing labour, it means the amniotic sac broke, and childbirth is beginning soon._

[Memory Shortcut]

* **SALT** for functions of amniotic fluid

Shock absorption

Allows some movement for muscular development

Lubricates birth canal during childbirth

 maintains a steady **Temperature** around foetus

**Umbilical cord**

Carries nutrients and oxygen from **placenta** to **foetus**

Carries **metabolic waste products** from foetus to placenta

Umbilical cord has 2 arteries *(from foetus to placenta) and 1 vein (toward foetus)

*_Pro Tip: Umbilical arteries carry deoxygenated blood, because artery carries blood away from foetus' heart, to placenta_* HIV is a sexually transmitted infection (STI)
* HIV attacks a certain type of white blood cells, decreasing their number
* The resulting condition = **Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome** (AIDS) as the immune system is weakened, and body is susceptible to common infections that would otherwise not be as severe.

**Modes of HIV transmission:**

* Unprotected sexual intercourse with infected individual
* Sharing of contaminated needles
* **Blood transfusions** where the donor's blood has the virus
*_Pro Tip: This is why in professional/public health services, donated blood is always screened._
* Passed from mother to foetus during **pregnancy**

**STIs can be prevented by:**

* Abstinence (no sexual intercourse)
* Have only 1 sexual partner
* Using condoms (physical barrier prevents transmission)
* Not sharing needles/sterilising needles whenever used
* Do not share instruments that are likely to break the skin and be contaminated with blood (e.g. razors, toothbrushes)

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:208]

**Co-dominance*:** When two different alleles for a particular trait are both expressed in an organism and influence phenotype.

* Let allele for red flower be IR
* Let allele for white flower be IW
* In a **heterozygous** individual (IRIW), if the phenotype turns out to be flowers with both red and white petals, these alleles are **co-dominant**.

**incomplete dominance*:** When two different alleles are expressed resulting in phenotype being an intermediate between the two.

* Let allele for red flower be IR
* Let allele for white flower be IW
* In a **heterozygous** individual (IRIW), if the phenotype turns out to be pink flowers, these alleles show **incomplete dominance**.

* _Pro Tip: Co-dominance and incomplete dominance can only be observed if individual is heterozygous for the trait._

**Multiple alleles:** When three or more alleles exist for a gene.

* e.g. for blood type there are the alleles: IA IB IO
* IA IB are co-dominant
* IO is recessive to IA and IB*_Pro Tip: For co-dominance, incomplete dominance, multiple alleles and sex-linked inheritance, we represent alleles with superscripts, such as IR, IW._

## 2 Monohybrid cross

Monohybrid cross involves 1 trait, with 2 alleles

Genetic crosses can predict expected offspring ratios

Discrepancy between observed and expected ratios

As **fertilisation** is a **random** process, the **genotype** of each offspring is based on **chance**

The smaller the **sample size** of offspring, the greater the **discrepancy** would be

Cross #1: 2 homozygous parents (pure-bred) with different alleles

*_Pro Tip: Pure-bred means offspring are homozygous for certain traits_

Let T represent allele for tall plant (dominant)

Let t represent allele for dwarf plant (recessive)

*_Pro Tip: If letter used has capital and small letters which look very similar, (e.g. c and C), use c' for the recessive allele to avoid ambiguity_

L: Let... (define your alleles, unless question already did)

P: Parents phenotype and genotype

G: Gametes are formed from parents

F: Fertilisation

O: Offspring genotype and phenotypic ratio

Test Cross

Used to determine the **genotype** of an individual, as **heterozygous** and **homozygous dominant** individuals appear the same

The individual is crossed with a **homozygous recessive** individual, eg?? X

If individual is **homozygous dominant**, offspring would all express the dominant phenotype

If individual is **heterozygous**, offspring ratio would be 1:1

If individual is **homozygous recessive**, offspring would all express the recessive phenotype

## 3 Bonus: All monohybrid cross combinations (O levels)

* _Let A be the allele for Tall plant_
* _Let a be the allele for dwarf plant_

\begin{tabular}{l l l}
**Parents Crossed** & **Offspring Genotypes** & **Offspring Phenotypic Ratio** \\ AA x AA & All AA & All Tall \\ aa x aa & All aa & All Dwarf \\ AA x aa & All Aa & All Tall \\ \end{tabular}

## 4 Sex determination

**Sex determination**

* Sex chromosomes are either X or Y
* XX is female
* XY is male*
* Each chromosome comes from each parent
* The mother's ovum definitely contains an X chromosome, as the mother's diploid cells have XX
* The father's sperm can contain either an X or Y chromosomes, as the father's diploid cells have XY
* Therefore sex of the zygote formed depends on the sperm, and there is a 50% chance of the zygote being a boy or a girl.

## 5 Mutations

**Mutation:** A sudden change in the structure of a gene or chromosome number
* Mutations that occur in an individual can be passed down to **offspring**

**Mutagen:** An environmental agent that increases mutation rate
* **Ionising radiation:** e.g. ultraviolet **radiation**, nuclear **radiation**, gamma rays
* Certain toxic **chemicals:** e.g. **tar** in cigarette smoke*_Pro Tip: Mutagens simply cause more mutations in DNA. Carcinogens are a group of mutagens which cause mutations that increase chances of cancer._

**Sickle-cell anaemia**

* Due to a **single-base substitution** in the **haemoglobin gene**, the **codon** is changed

* A different **nucleotide** will be coded for in **mRNA** after **transcription**
* A different **amino acid** is coded for after **translation**
* Instead of normal **haemoglobin**, results in abnormal **haemoglobin**
* **Homozygous recessive** individuals:
* At **low oxygen concentrations**, abnormal haemoglobin **clumps** together, causing the cell to become **sickle-shaped**
* Results in **anaemia*
* (body cells get insufficient **oxygen**) because:
* Sickled RBCs are more **fragile**, break easily
* Cannot carry O2 efficiently
* Are actively destroyed by the **spleen**, leading to low RBC count
* Benefit to **heterozygous*
* Do not suffer the disease
* Are more resistant to **malaria***
* when the malaria parasite infects their RBCs to reproduce, it causes the RBC to sickle, killing both the RBC and malaria._
* Hence they **survive*
* and **reproduce*
* better (passing on the sickle-cell allele)
* Thus the **allele*
* is most abundant in malaria-stricken regions (e.g. sub-Saharan Africa)

**Down Syndrome*** During formation of sperm/egg, a **chromosomal mutation*
* results in the **gamete*
* having two copies of chromosome 21
* This can happen in either the mother or father, although most of the time in the mother*. *_Pro Tip: The older the mother, the higher the chance of this happening._

* with a normal **gamete*
* will result in **zygote*
* having three copies of chromosome 21 (trisomy 21), causing Down Syndrome.
* The person has total 47 chromosomes instead of 46

## 6. Discontinuous vs continuous variation

\begin{tabular}{p{113.8pt} p{113.8pt} p{113.8pt}} \hline
**Type of variation** & **Discontinuous** & **Continuous** \\ \hline Phenotypes & **Few** and **distinct** phenotypes & A **range** of phenotypes, with many intermediate forms \\ Number of genes involved & 1 or few & **Multiple genes**, which have an **additive effect** \\ Environment & No effect on phenotype & Affects phenotype \\ Examples & Sex, blood type, ability to roll tongue, lobed or attached ears, eye colour & Skin/hair colour, height, weight \\ \hline \end{tabular}

## 7. Natural Selection

**Natural selection:** The process whereby organisms better adapted to their environment tend to survive and reproduce.

* **Variation** exists between individuals
* Due to: **Mutation**, **meiosis**, **random fertilisation** (as each parent produces **genetically different** gametes, fertilisation of a random sperm and a random egg increases the number of possible **zygote** variants)
* Organisms face **selection pressures**
* eg. competition for limited resources, predators, disease outbreaksIndividuals with favourable traits have a **selective Advantage**

And are more likely to **Survive and reproduce**

Hence passing on their **favourable alleles** to their **offspring**

Over **Time**, more and more of the population have the favourable trait

[OR, if question says **evolution** occurred, replace the above statement with this]: Accumulation of new genes by **mutation** and **natural selection**

resulted in the evolution of the **species**.

* _"Pro Tip: Natural selection is needed for evolution to occur, but natural selection can occur without evolution._

[Memory shortcut] Explaining natural selection process [VAST] V: Variation exists between individuals

* **A:** selective **Advantage**

* **S:** Survive and reproduce, passing favourable alleles to offspring

* **T:** over **Time**, more and more of the population has the favourable trait

Examples

* Dark peppered moths in England, 1900: due to industrial revolution, soot coated trees, giving dark moths a **selective advantage** (camouflage) over white moths.
* **Antibiotic-resistant bacteria:** Those with resistance survive and reproduce, resulting in a strain of antibiotic-resistant **strain**
* Darwin's finches of the Galapagos islands: Have different beak shapes due to the type of diet they are suited for, e.g. nuts, insects, fruit, etc.
