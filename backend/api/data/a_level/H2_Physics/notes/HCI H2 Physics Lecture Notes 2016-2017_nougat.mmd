### 1 Introduction

Measuring our observations objectively is an important task that differentiates science from the arts. The scientific method involves making observations that are repeatable by another person. For this reason, the study of physical quantities and their units is the starting point of our learning of science.

### 2 Physical Quantities and Units

A physical quantity is a physical property that can be measured and/or calculated and expressed in numbers. For example, "length" is a physical quantity that can be expressed by stating a number of a measurement unit such as metres or inches, while "beauty" is a property that is difficult to describe with a number.

Hence _the value of a physical quantity_ is expressed as a _numerical value and a unit of measurement_.

For example,

the length of a football field = 100 m

This has a few implications:

1. Using the unit "metre" helps us to define a particular property of the football field - its length. Using other units could allow us to define other properties (for example, square metres describe the area) of a football field.
2. We can only compare properties of the same unit. Using the "metre" allows us to compare the length of one object with another. We cannot compare a "metre" with a "kilogram".
3. The numerical value of the physical quantity is dependent on the unit it is expressed in. The length of the football field will have a value of 330 when expressed in the unit "Toof".

#### Base Quantities and Units

Through the centuries, scientists in different parts of the world have used different units at different times to measure the same physical quantities. However standardised definitions and units are needed in the modern world.

The current International System of Units1, universally abbreviated SI (from the French _Le Systeme International d'Unites_), is the modern metric system of measurement:

Footnote 1: The SI was established in 1960 by the 11th General Conference on Weights and Measures (CGPM, Conference GÃ³mez des Poids et Mesures). ([http://www.bipm.org/en/si/](http://www.bipm.org/en/si/))

Seven well-defined and independent base quantities are chosen. Their corresponding SI base units are indicated:

\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|c|} \hline \multicolumn{2}{|c|}{**Base Quantity**} & \multicolumn{2}{|c|}{**Base Unit**} \\ \hline Name & Symbol & Name & Symbol \\ \hline Mass & \(m\) & kilogram & kg \\ \hline Length & \(I\) & metre & m \\ \hline Time & \(t\) & second & s \\ \hline Electric current & \(I\) & ampere & A \\ \hline Thermodynamic temperature & \(T\) & kelvin & K \\ \hline Amount of substance & \(n\) & mole & mol \\ \hline summous intensity & \(I\) & \(I\) & candle & scd \\ \hline \end{tabular}

Note:

1. The units, when written in full, are in small letters. Ampere and Kelvin are names of scientists.
2. The kilogram is the only SI unit with a prefix as part of its name and symbol.
3. Luminous intensity is not in the LO(a) of the Syllabus.
4. Definitions of the units are not required in the Syllabus but are provided in Appendix I at the end of the lecture notes for your reference.

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|} \hline IMPORTANT & SI base units were chosen based on their mutual independence. They are the simplest units that cannot be expressed in terms of other SI base units.

#### Derived Quantities and Units

There are a lot of other physical properties that we come across in our daily lives. These quantities and units used scientifically are included in the SI2 as derived quantities and units. Note that these derived units, such as newton and joule, are also SI units.

\begin{tabular}{|l|} \hline IMPORTANT & Derived quantities are related to the base quantities through mathematical and scientific equations. Derived units (the units of derived quantities) are defined in terms of the base units using the same equations. \\ \hline One simple example is the derived quantity of area. It is defined using the mathematical equation area = length \(x\)= breadth; where: both length and breadth are defined in terms of the base quantity, length. Hence the unit for area can be written in terms of base units as m3. \\ \hline \end{tabular}

Some derived units have special names and symbols. An example is the newton (symbol N), a unit for force. We can define this derived quantity - force, using formulae such as \(F\) = _ma_, where \(F\) is force, \(m\) is mass and \(a\) is acceleration. You may note that acceleration itself is also a derived quantity. Using such an equation, we can then find the representation of the newton (N) in terms of base units (kg m s\({}^{2}\)).

Study the examples in the following table and verify the **derive units** for the respective quantities.

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|} \hline
**Derived quantities, symbols** & **Formula** & **Derived units** & **Usual units** \\ \hline Volume, \(V\) & - & m\({}^{3}\) & - \\ \hline Density, \(\rho\) & \(\rho=m/V\) & kg m\({}^{3}\) & - \\ \hline Velocity, \(\nu\) & \(\nu=s\gamma t\) & m s\({}^{-1}\) & - \\ \hline Acceleration, \(\alpha\) & \(a=(\nu\cdot u)/\gamma t\) & m s\({}^{-2}\) & - \\ \hline Force, \(F\) & \(F=ma\) & kg m s\({}^{2}\) & N \\ \hline Momentum, \(p\) & \(p=mv\) & kg m s\({}^{-1}\) & N s \\ \hline Pressure, \(p\) & \(p=F/A\) & kg m\({}^{-1}\) s\({}^{-2}\) & Pa \\ \hline Energy, \(E\) & \(KE=\%\,m\nu^{2}\) & kg m\({}^{2}\) s\({}^{-2}\) & J \\ \hline Power, \(P\) & \(P=E/\lambda\) & kg m\({}^{2}\) s\({}^{-3}\) & W \\ \hline Electric charge, \(Q\) & \(Q=lt\) & A s & C \\ \hline Voltage, \(V\) & \(V=W/Q\) & kg m\({}^{2}\) s\({}^{3}\) A\({}^{-1}\) & V \\ \hline Resistance, \(R\) & \(R=V/\lambda\) & kg m\({}^{2}\) s\({}^{3}\) A\({}^{2}\) & \(\Omega\) \\ \hline Frequency, \(f\) & f = 1/T & s\({}^{-1}\) & Hz \\ \hline \end{tabular}

### Prefixes

The rationale for prefixes is simple. While it is alright to write your height as 1.65 m, it will be quite cumbersome to write the width of your hair as 0.00005 m, or the size of an atom as 0.000000001 m. In mathematics, you have learnt the use of standard form. The size of an atom can be rewritten more neatly as 1 x 10\({}^{\text{-10}}\) m but scientists often use prefixes instead of standard form for values between 10\({}^{\text{-12}}\) and 10\({}^{\text{-12}}\). Prefixes can be used with both base units and derived units.

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|r|r|} \hline
**Factor** & **Prefix** & **Symbol** & **Name** & **Decimal equivalent** & **Order of magnitude** \\ \hline
10\({}^{\text{-12}}\) & pico & p & Trillionth & 0.000,000,000,001 & -12 \\ \hline
10\({}^{\text{-1}}\) & nano & n & Billionth & 0.000,000,001 & -9 \\ \hline
10\({}^{\text{-6}}\) & micro & u & Millionth & 0.000,001 & -6 \\ \hline
10\({}^{\text{-3}}\) & milli & m & Thousandth & 0.001 & -3 \\ \hline
10\({}^{\text{-2}}\) & centi & c & Hundredth & 0.01 & -2 \\ \hline
10\({}^{\text{-1}}\) & deci & d & Tenth & 0.1 & -1 \\ \hline
10\({}^{\text{6}}\) & - & - & One & 1 & 0 \\ \hline
10\({}^{\text{3}}\) & kilo & k & Thousand & 1,000 & 3 \\ \hline
10\({}^{\text{6}}\) & mega & M & Million & 1,000,000 & 6 \\ \hline
10\({}^{\text{6}}\) & giga & G & Billion & 1,000,000,000 & 9 \\ \hline
10\({}^{\text{12}}\) & tera & T & Trillion & 1,000,000,000,000 & 12 \\ \hline \end{tabular}

The accepted convention is to use a prefix such that the quantity can be written as a whole number and of least significant figures (s.f.). For example the wavelength of red light would be written as 650 nm, rather than 0.65 \(\upmu\)m. Values larger than the ranges listed in the prefixes above should be written in standard form (The above list of prefixes are stipulated in LO(e). Do not use the other prefixes listed in Appendix 0.4).

You may notice that the symbol for the prefix mill (m) is the same as that for the base unit metre (m), leading to a confusion when we see, for example, "ms\({}^{\text{-1}}\)". It could mean "metre per second", or "per millisecond". To distinguish the units especially in print, the A-level standard is to **use "ms\({}^{\text{-1}}\)" for "per millisecond" and **leave a space "m s\({}^{\text{-1}}\)" for the derived unit "metre per second"**.

#### Estimation

When was the last time you estimated something? How much does that shirt at G2000 cost? How long does it take to travel by _public transport_ from Hwa Chong to Suntec City? If your 1-litre water bottle were to leak one drop of water at a time, how much time will it take for the water bottle to empty? There is a myriad of questions which we can answer by means of measurement and calculation. We could measure the average speed of a bus and the distance along the bus route and calculate the travelling time. We could also estimate.

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:9]

### Errors and Uncertainties

No measurement is perfectly accurate or exact. **Uncertainty of measurement is the doubt which exists about the result of any measurement.** You might think that well-made rulers, clocks and thermometers should be trustworthy, and give the right answers. However, for every measurement - even the most careful - there is always a margin of doubt.

Many instrumental and human limitations cause measurements to deviate from the actual or true value of the physical quantities being measured.

The _experimental error_ in measuring a physical quantity can be understood as the difference between the _measured value_ and the _true value_ of a physical quantity:

experimental error = measured value - true value

The tricky part of finding the experimental error is that we usually do not know what the true value is! (which is why we were measuring it in the first place.) While we can try to improve on the measurement process, we can never eliminate experimental errors entirely. Indeed a measurement is of little use if we do not know how large its experimental error is.

The true value of a quantity to be measured may never be known. The next best thing a physicist can do in order to know how close his measured value is to the true value, is to _estimate_ the experimental error in a measurement by determining the uncertainty of the measurements. The _uncertainty_ in measuring a physical quantity is reflected by the _variation or differences_ in the _measured values_ during the process of measurement.

For example, the length of the Ez-link card, \(l\), can be written as \(l\pm M=(8.5\pm 0.1)\) cm because the smallest division on the scale of the ruler is 0.1 cm.

Any position on the ruler can be read off to a position that is the closest half a division, (within 0.05 cm). Given that the length of the Ez-link card is in fact the difference in two measurements on the ruler (the left edge and right edge positions of the card),

the largest possible length is obtained by taking the largest possible reading of the right edge position minus the smallest possible reading of the left edge position.

For example, 8.55 cm - (- 0.05) cm = 8.60 cm.

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:12]

#### Combining Uncertainties

There are established statistical rules for calculation of consequential uncertainty from individual pieces of information. The A-level course only requires a simplified version of the statistical treatment.

(i) **Adding or Subtracting Measured Quantities**

When two measured quantities are added together or one subtracted from another, the actual uncertainty in the result is equal to the sum of the actual uncertainty of the two quantities.

We always add up the uncertainties even if the equation involves subtraction because we do not know the sign of the actual uncertainty and thus need to estimate the _largest_ possible uncertainty in our quantities.

**Rule 1**: For \(c=a+b\), the actual uncertainty in \(c\), \(\Delta c=\Delta a+\Delta b\)

For \(d=a\) - \(b\), the actual uncertainty in \(d\), \(\Delta d=\Delta a+\Delta b\)

(ii) **Multiplying or Dividing Measured Quantities**

When two measured quantities are multiplied together or one divided by the other, the fractional uncertainty in the result is equal to the sum of the fractional uncertainties of the two quantities.

**Rule 2**: For \(p=ab\), the fractional uncertainty in \(p\), \(\dfrac{\Delta p}{p}=\dfrac{\Delta a}{a}+\dfrac{\Delta b}{b}\)

For \(q=\dfrac{a}{b}\), the fractional uncertainty in \(q\), \(\dfrac{\Delta q}{q}=\dfrac{\Delta a}{a}+\dfrac{\Delta b}{b}\)

Here, percentage uncertainty can be used interchangeably with fractional uncertainty as they differ only by a factor of 100 which is multiplied equally to every term in the equation. The percentage uncertainty in \(p\) is equal to the sum of the percentage uncertainties in \(a\) and \(b\),

\[\dfrac{\Delta p}{p}\times 100\%=\dfrac{\Delta a}{a}\times 100\%+\dfrac{ \Delta b}{b}\times 100\%.\]

Let us use a simple equation to illustrate the analysis of most mathematical or scientific equations we will encounter. Consider the linear equation \(y=mx+c\), where \(m,\,x\) and \(c\) are all measurements with their associated uncertainties. Our experimental result, \(y\), will also have an uncertainty that depends on that of \(m\), \(x\) and \(c\).

The addition is simple: \(\Delta y=\Delta(mx)+\Delta c\) but for the product \(mx\), \(\dfrac{\Delta(mx)}{(mx)}=\dfrac{\Delta m}{m}+\dfrac{\Delta x}{x}\), Rearranging,

\[\Delta(mx)=\begin{pmatrix}\Delta m&\Delta x\\ \Delta m&\Delta x\\ \end{pmatrix}\begin{pmatrix}mx\end{pmatrix}\begin{pmatrix}mx\end{pmatrix}\begin{pmatrix}mx \end{pmatrix}\begin{pmatrix}mx\end{pmatrix}+\Delta c\,.\]

#### 1.3.3 Precision and Accuracy

These are two terms which we need to understand in our critical approach to measurements.

_Precision_ refers to the closeness of a set of measurements.

Measurements are said to be precise when _repeated_ measurements remain very close to one another. If a certain measurement which is done, repeated several times, produces widely varying readings, the precision is poor.

For example, three measurements of my height: 1.75 m, 1.76 m, 1.75 m are precise but 1.72 m, 1.78 m, 1.76 m are not precise.

_Accuracy_ refers to the agreement between the measured value and the true or accepted value of a quantity.

For example, if we are told that an object has a true mass 500 g, a measured value of 400 g is inaccurate.

Similarly, the measurement of the acceleration of free fall, \(g=9.40\) m s\({}^{2}\) is also inaccurate, compared to \(g\) = 9.70 m s\({}^{2}\).

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:18]

#### Systematic and Random Errors

We have asserted that the true and exact value of a physical quantity can never be known. This is because our measurement of a physical quantity will always be limited by experimental error. The causes of these experimental errors can be split into two broad categories - systematic errors and random errors.

#### Random Error

Suppose we take many measurements to determine the diameter of a thin piece of wire using a micrometer screw gauge and tabulate our measurements in a table.

The distribution of the measurements can be represented in the plot as shown.

Random errors occur as a _scattering_ (or _spreading_) of readings about the **average** or **mean** value of the measurements. The magnitude of random errors is not fixed and each reading has equal chance of being smaller or larger than the mean value. Random errors occur despite repeating the experiments under the same conditions. This means that each reading you take will likely be different from the previous one and you cannot predict what the next reading will be.

Random errors are caused by environmental conditions, irregularity of quantity being measured, and limitations of the measurement equipment or the observer.

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:20]

\begin{tabular}{|c|} \hline Example 1.13: Oscillations of a pendulum \\ The period of one oscillation of the pendulum \(T\) is related to the length of the pendulum \(L\) according to the equation \(\dot{T}\!=\!2\pi\sqrt{\frac{L}{g}}\), where \(g\) = 9.81 m s\({}^{2}\). A diagram of the experiment is shown on the right. \(T\) is measured for one oscillation with a stop watch and \(L\) is measured with a metre ruler held in hand. \\ \hline \end{tabular}

Using the given information,

a) identify a random error in this experiment and explain the source of the error

b) suggest an appropriate method to reduce the random error you have identified

a) The variation in T for a particular \(L\) is very

(age. The uncertainty in T is caused by the variation

in human judgement of when to start and when to stop timing the

oscillation. Note that the human reaction error is around 0.25

b) Time should be taken for a large number of oscillations. TF N oscillations were taken, the period is calculated as T=4/N. We usually take N such that

each \(t\) reading is more than 205, so that the percentage error contributed by human reaction time error is less than 10% (0.2/20).

#### 1.3.4b Systematic Error

Suppose now we discover that the micrometer screw gauge used has a _zero error_ of +0.02 mm. Every single measurement is off by 0.02 mm.

The distribution of the readings would look like this:

This shift of values from the real values is the result of a _systematic error_. Systematic errors are reproducible errors which cause a set of readings to deviate in a fixed direction from the true value. Systematic errors are caused by instrumental errors, environmental conditions, and poor experimental techniques. The source of systematic errors can be determined and eliminated by corrective action.

**Question: Distinguish random errors from systematic errors.**

**Answer: Random errors are deviations of the measured value from the mean value, with varying signs and magnitudes. Systematic errors are deviations of the measured value from the true value, with same sign and similar magnitude.**

### Eliminating Systematic Error

In some cases, systematic error can be accounted for and corrected after it has been detected. The easiest way to detect systematic error is to note the vertical-intercept of the graph that is plotted. For example the graph of \(y=mx+c\) when plotted gives a y-intercept of \(b\) instead of \(c\) as shown in the diagram below. The systematic error of \((c-b)\) results in an underestimation of the y- values.

The effects of random errors and of systematic errors appear in graphs as illustrated below.

[FIGURE:S1.F1][ENDFI

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:23]

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:24]

### Scalars and Vectors

Physical quantities that have _no direction_ associated with them are known as _scalars_. Scalars are specified completely by values and units. Examples of scalars include distance, speed, mass, time, temperature, energy, gravitational and electric potentials.

Physical quantities that have both a magnitude and a _direction_ are known as _vectors_. Examples of vectors include displacement, velocity, acceleration; force, gravitational and electric field strengths.

In books, a vector is often denoted in one of the following ways: \(F\), \(\overline{F}\) or \(\underline{f}\). The magnitude is indicated as \(|F|\) or simply \(F\).

The direction of vectors should always be clearly presented. In written form, we can express, for example, velocity as 5 m s\({}^{-1}\) towards the east, or acceleration of free fall as 9.81 m s\({}^{-2}\) downwards. This is somewhat troublesome to write when we come to diagonal motions.

Diagrams are always helpful in Physics when dealing with vector quantities. Each vector is represented by an arrow. The arrow is always drawn pointing in the direction of the vector quantity and the length of the arrow is proportional to the magnitude of the vector quantity. If more than one vector is drawn on a diagram, the lengths of the different arrows should be representative of the relative magnitudes of the vector quantities.

For example, a boat's engine can propel the boat to move at 6.0 m s\({}^{-1}\) to the east and the current in the river is flowing at 3.0 m s\({}^{-1}\) also to the east. The two vectors can be drawn as shown.

\begin{tabular}{c c} Velocity of boat & Velocity of current \\ = 6.0 m s\({}^{-1}\) & = 3.0 m s\({}^{-1}\) \\ \end{tabular}

Note the relative lengths of the arrows: the velocity of the boat is twice that of the current, hence its arrow's length is also twice as long.

Multiplication of a vector by a scalar simply scales the length of the arrow. Multiplication of a vector by \(-1\) (or a negative sign, "\(-\)") reverses the direction in which the vector points.

#### Adding and Subtracting Coplanar Vectors

It is obvious that the boat moves down the river faster with the presence of a current than without. In addition the boat will in fact move slower if it is moving upstream or against the flow of current. Hence there must be an additive and subtractive effect when there are two of more vector quantities present in one situation.

\begin{tabular}{c c} Velocity of boat flowing & Velocity of boat flowing \\ with current = 9.0 m s\({}^{-1}\) & against current = 3.0 m s\({}^{-1}\) \\ \end{tabular}

The sum of two or more vectors is called the _resultant_ vector. The resultant velocity vector of the boat is 9.0 m s\({}^{-1}\) when flowing with the current and 3.0 m s\({}^{-1}\) when flowing against the current.

As demonstrated in the diagram above, resultant vectors are always found by connecting one arrow-head to the tail of the next arrow. The resultant vector is then drawn from the tail of the very first arrow to the arrow-head of the last arrow. This summation process can be repeated step-by-step for any number of vectors.

#### Vectors in 1D

One dimensional vectors lie along a single line (collinear) and can be either pointing along or against that direction, like the current in a river. In mathematical form, we usually fix one of the directions as positive, and the opposite direction as negative.

In the direction of travel of the boat, its own velocity \(\vec{v}_{\text{ boat}}=+\,6.0\) m s\({}^{\text{-1}}\). The velocity of river current \(\vec{v}_{\text{ along}}=+\,3.0\) m s\({}^{\text{-1}}\) when it is flowing in the same direction as the boat's motion. If the river current is against the motion of the boat, it will be written as a negative quantity: \(\vec{v}_{\text{ against}}=-\,3.0\) m s\({}^{\text{-1}}\). These two vectors \(\vec{v}_{\text{ along}}\) and \(\vec{v}_{\text{ against}}\) are equal in magnitude but opposite in direction \(\Rightarrow\vec{v}_{\text{ against}}=-\vec{v}_{\text{ along}}\). The resultant velocity at which the boat travels is the _vector sum_ of its own velocity and the velocity of the river current.

\[\vec{v}_{\text{rosuutant}}=\vec{V}_{\text{ boat}}+\vec{V}_{\text{ along}}\qquad or\qquad\vec{V}_{\text{rosuutant}}=\vec{V}_{\text{boost}}+\vec{V}_{\text{ against}}\]

Vector values in physics

Vector values are most commonly written as numbers with a sign attached to it to indicate the direction. The **direction of the positive-value is predefined with an arrow.** For example, the vectors as shown below may be written as:

\[\begin{array}{c}\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{Fig3.eps}\\ \includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{Fig4.eps}\\ \includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{Fig5.eps}\\ \includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{Fig6.eps}\\ \includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{Fig6.eps}\\ \includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{Fig7.eps}\\ \includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{Fig8.eps}\\ \includegraphics[width=142.

#### 1.4.1b Vectors in 2D

Two dimensional vectors lie on the same plane (coplanar) but point in different directions that are not along a single straight line.

In the diagram below, \(\vec{a}\) and \(\vec{b}\) are two coplanar vectors lying on the plane of the paper but not along a single straight line.

The tail of each arrow indicates the position where a vector quantity is acting upon. In the diagram above, if both \(\vec{a}\) and \(\vec{b}\) are forces, they would be acting on the same point, or the same object.

Imagine if you were pulled by two friends, one at each arm, in different directions. In which direction would you move? Can you possibly move in both directions you are pulled? There only exists one resultant force that will determine the direction you will move.

Similarly, the resultant vector \(\vec{c}\) is obtained by adding vectors \(\vec{a}\) and \(\vec{b}\), or \(\vec{c}=\vec{a}+\vec{b}\).

**Addition of vectors:**\(\vec{c}=\vec{a}+\vec{b}\)

Methods of Determining the Resultant Vector

1. Parallelogram Method: By putting the vectors to be added 'tail to tail'. Complete the parallelogram. The resultant vector is the diagonal from the tail of the two vectors to the other vertex of the parallelogram.
2. Triangle Method: By joining the end of the next arrow onto the tip of the previous one to form a chain of arrows, the resultant vector is a straight arrow that goes from the tail of the chain directly to the head. The order of adding the vectors does not affect the resultant.
3. Component Method: The vectors are resolved into two perpendicular directions and then added. Please see section 1.4.2. This method is extremely important because it is the most convenient method to add three or more vectors.

In Physics, vector subtraction can come about when we want to determine the change in a certain physical vector quantity.

In general,

**A change in a physical quantity = final value - initial value**

Mathematically it is written as

\[\Delta\bar{Q}=\bar{Q_{i}}-\bar{Q_{i}}\]

Physical quantities that are often seen in A-level questions include:

Scalars: change in temperature, change in energy

Vectors: change in velocity, change in momentum

#### Resolution of Vectors

Since two vectors can be added to give a resultant vector, any vector can be broken up (or resolved) into two vectors or components. We will usually resolve a vector into two mutually-perpendicular components through the use of trigonometry and Pythagoras theorem. Mutually-perpendicular vectors are independent of each other.

**Practice**

For each vector below, draw the two perpendicular components in the direction given by the dotted lines and state their magnitudes in terms of the respective values and angles.

The examples on the left are done for you. Note that the dotted rectangle is an important working to account for the exact magnitudes of component vectors.

Each of the vectors above is resolved into two perpendicular components. A vector can be resolved into infinite pairs of perpendicular components. The choice of directions depends on the problem at hand.

Example 1.18

The diagram shows the top view of three motorbeats crossing a river (left bank to right bank). All three move at the same speed but in different directions, and all experience the same current flowing down the river.

Construct resultant vectors showing the speed and direction of, the boats.

a. Which boat takes the shortest path to the opposite shore?

b. Which boat reaches the opposite shore first?

c. Which boat provides the fastest ride?

## Appendix III Homogeneous Equation

A physically correct equation must be homogeneous. However, a homogeneous equation need not be physically correct.

There are two basic reasons:

1. The value of the coefficient may be incorrect. \[\text{e.g.}\quad\quad E=3mv^{2}\quad\quad\quad\quad\text{ where }E=\text{kinetic energy}\] _The coefficient 3 is incorrect. The value should be \(\frac{1}{2}\) instead._
2. Missing or extra terms that may have the same unit. \[\text{e.g.}\quad\quad E=\frac{1}{2}mv^{2}+mgh\quad\quad\text{ where }E=\text{kinetic energy}\] _There is an extra term mgh, which happens to have the same base unit as kinetic energy. This is an extra term._
For use in Information Technology, prefixes for binary multiples have been adopted by the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC).

## Appendix V Rules of Significant Figures in Mathematical Operations

The following set of rules for significant figures provide us a means to get reliable results from data even without uncertainty values.

**Rule 1**: When multiplying or dividing, the number of s.f. in the answer should be the same as the term with the least numbers of s.f.

e.g. multiplying:

\begin{tabular}{l l}  & 2.61 \\ \(\chi\) 1.2 & this has the smaller number of s.f. (2 s.f.) \\ \(3.132\) & rounds off to 3.1 (2 s. f.) \\ e.g. dividing: & 2.61 +1.2 = 2.2 (rounds off to 2 s.f.) \\ Practice: & 2.3 x 10.0 = \\  & 6.8907 + 1.23 = \\ \end{tabular}
**Rule 2**: When adding or subtracting, decimal places (d.p.) in the answer are determined by the term with the least number of d.p., regardless of the s.f. of any one term.

e.g. adding:

\begin{tabular}{l l}  & 26.46 \\ \(+\) 0.1234 \\ \(26.5834\) & rounds off to 26.58 (2 d.p.) \\ e.g. subtracting: & 26.46 - 4.123 = 22.34 (to 2 d.p.) \\ Practice: & 5.399 - 5.39 = \\  & 103.9 + 2.10 + 0.319 = \\ \end{tabular}
**More practices:**[http://lectureonline.cl.msu.edu/~mmp/apolist/sigfio/sig.htm](http://lectureonline.cl.msu.edu/~mmp/apolist/sigfio/sig.htm) (requires Java)

**Rule 3**: For any **logarithm**, the number to the left of the decimal point is called the **characteristic**, and the number to the right of the decimal point is called the **mantissa**.

e.g. lg 339 = 2.530

**The mantissa has as many significant figures as the number which we took logarithms.** The characteristic is not included when determining the number of significant figures.

e.g. lg (5.43 x 10\({}^{10}\)) = 10.735 lg (2.7 x 10\({}^{4}\)) = -7.57 ln (3.95 x 10\({}^{6}\)) = 15.189

#### 2.1.3 Acceleration

**Acceleration, _a_**

The **acceleration** of an object is its **rate of change of velocity** with respect to time.

Mathematically, average and instantaneous acceleration can be calculated as follow:

\[\begin{split}\text{Average acceleration,}\quad<\underline{a}>& =\frac{\text{Total change in velocity}}{\text{Total time taken}}=\frac{\Delta\textbf{v}}{\Delta t}\\ &=\frac{\textbf{v}_{final}-\textbf{v}_{initial}}{\Delta t}\end{split}\]

\[\begin{split}\text{Instantaneous acceleration,}\quad\underline{a}= \frac{d\textbf{v}}{dt}\end{split}\]

\[\begin{split}\text{- S. I. units of acceleration: m s${}^{2}$}\\ \text{- Acceleration is a vector quantity. The direction of acceleration is in the same direction as the vector representing the change in velocity.}\end{split}\]

\[\begin{split}\text{TIP S}\quad\text{Sign Convention}\end{split}\]

1. For an object moving in one-dimension (rectilinear), there are only two possible directions in which the object can move. One direction is opposite the other. Hence, for convenience, we define one direction as positive and the other negative.
2. For vertical motion, we usually define upward direction as positive1:

Footnote 1: You will learn in Dynamics that the direction of any objectâs acceleration is determined by the direction of the resultant force acting on the object (Newtonâs 2\({}^{\text{nd}}\) Law of Motion).
3. For horizontal motion, we usually take direction to the right as positive1:

\[\begin{split}\text{*}\text{But this depends on the problem given, if it is more convenient to define downwards as positive or leftwards as positive, you may do so. In any case, you should always state clearly the convention you have adopted:

\[\begin{split}\text{*}\text{*}\text{*}\text{*}\text{*}\text{*} \text{*}\text{*}\text{*}\text{*}\text{*}\text{*}\text{*}\text{*}\text{*}\text {*}\text{*}\text{*}\text{*}\text{*}\text{*}\text{*}\text{*}\text{*}\text{*} \text{*}\

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:45]

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:46]

#### 2.2.2 Vector diagrams

Vector diagrams use vector arrows to depict the direction and relative magnitude of a vector quantity. Vector diagrams can be used to describe the velocity of a moving object during its motion. For example, the velocity of a car moving down the road could be represented by a vector diagram. In a vector diagram, the **magnitude** of the vector is represented by the length of the **vector** arrow.

#### 2.2.3 Recording motion using stroboscope1
Footnote 1: [http://ledgerton-digital-collections.org/techniques/multiflash](http://ledgerton-digital-collections.org/techniques/multiflash)

#### 2.2.3 Multi-flash photographs or stroboscopic photographs

are photographs of a subject illuminated with a flashing light, taken by a camera with an open shutter. By keeping the subject in the dark and then illuminating the subject only at certain times, the resultant image will show a series of different positions of the subject.

Today, by using digital video camera and digital image compositing, a multi-flash photograph can be easily re-constructed from several video frames. The video camera enables us to record motion conveniently, even at high speed. A single video camera captures 2-dimensional motion on a plane parallel to the image plane of the camera. To record complex 3-dimensional motion, many video cameras are used. This technique is useful for sports biomechanical analysis and character analysis in animated film production.

### Describing Motion using Graphs

#### 2.3.1 Displacement vs. Time Graph (s-\(t\) graph)

On an **s-\(t\)** graph,

The **instantaneous velocity** is the **slope** (or **gradient**) of the **tangent line** at a given **instant** of time.

- Average velocity is the **slope** of the **straight line connecting two points** corresponding to a given time **interval**.

- If an object moves with **constant** velocity, its **s-\(t\)** graph will be a **straight** line graph, and the instantaneous velocity at any instant is equal to the average velocity over the entire time interval.

#### 2.3.2 Velocity vs. Time Graph (v-\(t\) graph)

On an **v-\(t\)** graph,

The **instantaneous acceleration** is the **slope** (or **gradient**) of the **tangent line** at a given instant of time.

- Average acceleration is the **slope** of the **straight line** connecting two points corresponding to a given time interval.

- If an object moves with **constant** acceleration, its **v-\(t\)** graph will be a **straight** line graph, and the instantaneous acceleration at any instant is equal to the average acceleration over the entire time interval.

The **area under a **v-\(t\)** graph for a time interval of \(\Delta t\) gives the **change in displacement** of the object in that time interval.

### Describing Motion using Equations (for uniform acceleration)

#### 2.4.1 Derivation of the Equations of Motion (for uniform acceleration)

In this section, we shall derive the equations of motion for an object moving in a straight line with **uniform acceleration**.

Suppose at time \(=0\), the object is at point \(O\) with an initial velocity of \(u\). The object moves at uniform acceleration of \(a\) until time \(=t\), and has travelled through a displacement of \(s\) to arrive at point \(A\) with the final velocity of \(v\).

Let us look at its velocity-time graph:

Note: acceleration of object, \(a\) is given by the gradient of its \(v\) - \(t\) graph,

\[\dot{a}=\frac{v-u}{t} \tag{2}\]

Substitute Eqn (1) into (2), we have

\[\dot{s}=\frac{1}{2}\left[u+\left(u+a\ t\right)\right]t \tag{3}\]

From Eqn (1), we have

\[\dot{s}=\frac{1}{2}\left[u+v\right)\left(\frac{v-u}{a}\right)\]

\[\dot{v}^{2}=u^{2}+2\ a\ s \tag{4}\]

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:53]

**Example 8: Are these Objects in Free-Fall?**

The following are 2 cases of objects in motion.

(i) Determine if each of the objects is in free fall.

(ii) For each case, if the object is not in free fall, identify the physical quantities that affect the acceleration.

(iii) Hence, explain if the equations of motion can be applied to each scenario.

**Case 1: A box sliding down a smooth incline.**

Assume that air resistance is negligible.

**Case 2: A feather falling in vacuum.**

_Solution:_

Considering the forces on the box,

For both cases, can you visualise the acceleration-time and velocity-time graphs?

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:55]

### Non Free Falling Bodies

In practice, free fall does not happen because of resistive forces. The effects on a diver or burgege jumper may not be significant, but this is clearly not the case for a parachutist where air resistance is (deliberately) used to limit the maximum downward velocity of the parachutist.

#### 2.7.1 Velocity-time graph of object falling through air

Let us now consider the motion of an object, dropped from rest, falling through air. If air resistance is not negligible, the forces acting on the object are:

For ease of analysis, break the motion up into stages as seen below. Let us assume that drag force is proportional to speed.

As the body gains velocity, air resistance which is dependent on the velocity also increases.

By Newton's \(2^{\alpha}\) Law(1)

As \(F_{0}\) increases, the net force decreases and hence the acceleration decreases and falls below \(g\).

The object is nevertheless still accelerating and hence the speed still increases (just at a decreasing rate), so the air resistance continues to increase.

Eventually the air resistance increases to a point where it balances the weight of the body. i.e. \(W=F_{0}\).

By Newton's \(2^{\alpha}\) Law(1)

Resultant force acting on the body is zero. Hence acceleration of the body is zero.

The object then travels at a constant velocity called the terminal velocity.

The following graph shows the non-linear velocity change with time for a falling object experiencing air resistance.

#### 2.7.2 Terminal Velocity

We can now explain why heavier objects fall at a faster rate than light ones in the presence of air resistance. For simplicity, let us assume air resistance is proportional to speed \(\nu\), _i.e._\(F_{D}=K\nu\).

Consider the free body diagram of an object falling at terminal velocity,

\[F_{D}=W\]

Assuming air resistance is proportional to speed, therefore \(F_{D}=K\nu_{t}\).

\[k\nu_{t}=mg\]

\[\nu_{t}=\frac{mg}{k}\]

Based on this equation, we can now conclude:

1. Between two objects of the same dimensions but different densities, the denser one reaches a higher terminal velocity because it has a larger \(m\) but the same \(k\).
2. Between two objects of the same mass but different shapes, the more streamline one reaches a higher terminal velocity because it has a smaller \(k\) but the same \(m\).

**Example 9**

A steel ball bearing is released from a height above a deep pool of oil. Taking the drag force between the ball bearing and oil to be proportional to the relative speed of the ball bearing in oil, sketch the graph to show the variation of the velocity \(\mathbf{v}\) of the ball bearing against time \(t\). Indicate clearly on your diagram, \(t_{t}\), the time when the ball bearing hits the oil.

_Solution_

Assume that uptrust is negligible:

Stage 1: Released from rest (\(t=0\) to \(t_{t}\))

Before the ball bearing enters into the oil,

Only the weight acts on it and drag force (due to air) is very small compared to weight:

By Newton's \(2^{nd}\) law,

(1) \(\Sigma F=ma\)

\(\Rightarrow\)\(mg=ma\)

\(\Rightarrow\)\(a=g\)

Stage 2 : Enters the oil

Enters with some initial velocity

Drag force due to oil resistance is potentially large compared to the weight,

leading to two possible cases:

Case A: Ball bearing is released atjust above the surface of the oil, entering the oil at low velocity.

Case B: Ball bearing is released high above the surface of the oil, entering the oil at high velocity.

Case A: \(F_{\alpha\alpha}<mg\)

Resultant force is downwards

Resultant force is upwards

The ball bearing accelerates but

(slows down), \(v\) decreases

As v increases, \(F_{\alpha\alpha}\)increases

until \(F_{\alpha\alpha}=mg\)

Net force = 0

Terminal velocity is reached

### Two-Dimensional Kinematics

In this part of the chapter, we deal with the kinematics of a particle moving in a plane, or two-dimensional motion. Some common examples of motion in a plane are the motion of projectiles, motion of satellites and the motion of charged particles in an electric field. For the beginning we shall deal with the special case of motion of **an object with a uniform velocity in one direction and a uniform acceleration in a perpendicular direction.**

#### 2.8.1 Projectile Motion

Anyone who has observed a soccer ball in motion (or, for that matter, any object thrown into air) has observed _projectile motion_.

**Projectile motion** refers to the motion of an object launched in the air in the presence of a gravitational field. In this section, we are interested in the motion of an object projected with an initial velocity at an angle to the horizontal. To analyze this type of motion, we will start with an idealized model. The assumptions made in our idealized model are:

1. the effect of air resistance is negligible.
2. the acceleration due to gravity \(\boldsymbol{g}\)_is constant_1, _acts downwards_ and has a _magnitude equal to_\(g=9.8t\ m\ s^{2}\).

Footnote 1: We shall restrict ourselves to objects whose distance travelled and maximum height above the Earth are small compared to the Earthâs radius (6400 km) so that \(\boldsymbol{g}\) can be considered constant.

With the above assumptions, we find that the path of a projectile, which we call its _trajectory_, is always a parabola_2.

Footnote 2: The proof that trajectory of a projectile is parabolic will be shown in Example 13.

\[\begin{array}{l}\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{Fig13.pdf}\end{array}\]

The path of the projectile is symmetrical about the highest point.

The speed of the projectile is symmetrical about the highest point.

The time it takes for the object to go from \(y=0\) to the highest point

is equal to

the time it takes for the object to go from the highest point to \(y=0\).

It was Galileo who first accurately described projectile motion. He showed that it could be understood by analyzing the horizontal and vertical components of the motion separately. He found that:

The horizontal and vertical motions of the projectile are independent of each other.

\[\begin{array}{l}\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{Fig13.pdf}\end{array}\]

We shall restrict ourselves to objects whose distance travelled and maximum height above the Earth are small compared to the Earth's radius (6400 km) so that \(\boldsymbol{g}\) can be considered constant.

The proof that trajectory of a projectile is parabolic will be shown in Example 13.

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:60]

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:61]

In exam questions, it is essential to give both the magnitude and direction for any vector quantity.

From the above equations, we can easily use them to obtain other information of the projectile, like:

* **Maximum Height**: Maximum vertical displacement with respect to the initial starting point (vertical velocity, \(\mathbf{v}_{y}=0\) m s\({}^{\text{-}1}\)).
* **Horizontal Range**: Maximum horizontal displacement with respect to the initial starting point:
* **Angle of Projection for Maximum Horizontal Range**.
* **Equation of the trajectory of the projectile**.

**TIP S Solving Projectile Motion Problems:**

In solving problems involving projectile motion, follow the following procedures:

* _Read_ the question carefully.
* _Draw_ a careful diagram summarising the given information.
* **Choose an x-y coordinate system.
* **Identify the accelerations in the** \(x\) **and** \(y\) **directions.**
* **If you are given the initial velocity, you may want to resolve it into its** \(x\) **and** \(y\) **components.**
* **Analyse the horizontal and vertical motion separately.**
* **Apply the relevant equations. Remember to take sign conventions into consideration.**

We shall now work through several examples of projectile motion to familiarize ourselves with the strategy and the application of the equations.

**Example 10**

A long-jumper leaves the ground at an angle of \(20^{\circ}\) to the horizontal and at a speed of \(11\) m s\({}^{\text{-}1}\).

(a) How far does he jump?

(b) What is his maximum height reached?

The Trajectory Equation:

To show that the path followed by any projectile is a parabola, we need to find the \(y\) as a function of \(x\) by eliminating \(t\) between the vertical motion and the horizontal motion.

We can write following equations for both the horizontal and vertical displacements:

\[\begin{array}{l}x=u_{x}t\\ y=u_{y}t-\dot{x}g\dot{g}^{2}\end{array} \tag{1}\]

From (1), we have \(t=\dot{x}u_{x}\), and we substitute it into (2) to obtain,

\[y=(\frac{u_{x}}{u_{x}})x-(\frac{g}{2u_{x}})x^{2}\]

If we write \(u_{x}=u\cos\theta\) and \(u_{y}=u\sin\theta\), we can therefore write

\[y=(\tan\theta)x-(\frac{g}{2u\cos^{2}\theta})x^{2}\]

We can see that \(y\) as a function of \(x\) has the form

\[y=\alpha x-bx^{2}\]

This is an equation of a parabola.

We do NOT recommend you to memorise the formulae derived in this example. During examinations, you will NOT be given any credit for simply quoting these results directly without showing derivation.

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:68]

Furthermore, comparing the vertical motion of the projectile on its flight up and on its flight down, we see that:

* The (vertical) acceleration experienced by the projectile when it is going up is different from the (vertical) acceleration experienced by the projectile when it is coming down. (\(\alpha_{y,\text{up}}\neq\alpha_{y,\text{down}}\))
* For a particular height, the speed of the projectile when it is going up is also different for the speed of the projectile when it is coming down.

Hence, we can see that the **path of the projectile will not be symmetrical about the highest point**, _i.e._ the path is asymmetrical about the highest point.

**In summary,**

**The key characteristics of a projectile motion with air resistance (compared to if air resistance is negligible) are:**

* Horizontal range is shorter.
* Maximum height is lower.
* The time taken to reach maximum height must be shorter than the time taken to return to the starting point.
* Path is asymmetrical about a vertical line through its highest point.

### Introduction

_Mechanics_ is the branch of Physics concerned with the motion of objects subjected to forces.

#### 3.0.1 Types of Forces

Broadly speaking, forces may be categorized into two kinds: **contact** forces and **non-contact** forces.

1. **Contact forces** Forces acting between two bodies that are in physical contact.

**Contact forces** Description

Friction Force that resists the **relative** motion or the tendency for **relative** motion between two surfaces that are in contact.

Normal Contact Force

Contact Force

Vector sum of friction and normal contact force, meaning the total contact force.

Spring Force

Force exerted by one end of a spring when the spring is extended or compressed from its natural length.

Tension

Force exerted by one end of a string/rope which is being pulled taut.

Upthrust

Net upward force exerted by the fluid on a body fully or partially submerged in the fluid.

Viscous drag

Force that resists a body moving relative to a fluid.

force
Air resistance

Drag force exerted by air on a body moving in air.

2. **Non-contact forces** Forces acting between two bodies which are NOT in physical contact (separated by **a** distance). This characteristic of the force is described as **action-at-a-distance**.

**Non-contact forces** Description

Physical property of a body on which the force acts on.

Gravitational force

Attractive force exerted between masses.

Mass

Electric force arm

Attractive/remissive force exerted between electrically charged bodies.

Magnetic force

Force exerted between currents

Moving charges

#### 3.0.2 Weight

The weight of a body is due to the body being in the gravitational field of a massive body. The gravitational force exerted on the body by Earth is called its weight (due to Earth).

Notes:

* Weight is a force (hence a vector).
* Direction: Weight acts on the centre of gravity of the object towards the centre of mass of the body producing the gravitational field. For everyday-life problems, the weight of the object is taken to act **vertically downwards**.
* Magnitude: \(\left|W=mg\right|\) _W_: weight of an object (SI unit: N) _m_: mass of the body (SI unit: kg) _g_: acceleration of free fall/gravitational field strength at the point (SI unit: m s\({}^{2}\))

Distinction between mass and weight

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|} \hline
**Mass** & **Weight** \\ \hline A measure of the inertia of a body & A measure of the gravitational pull on its mass \\ \hline Scalar quantity & Vector quantity \\ \hline SI unit: kg & SI unit: N \\ \hline Same regardless of location & Varies with gravitational field strength at each location \\ \hline Same regardless of the method of measurement. & Some methods of measurement do not measure the true weight but the apparent weight. \\ \hline \end{tabular}

In everyday language, the terms'mass' and 'weight' are used interchangeably, e.g. 1 "weigh" 70 kg. In physics, and especially during examinations, such casual usage is not tolerated.

#### 3.0.2.1 Centre of Gravity

An object of a significant size may have unequal distribution of mass.

The **centre of gravity** of an object is the point at which the weight of the object _appears_ to act.

Notes:

- The force due to weight is drawn from the centre of gravity of an object.

- The centre of gravity of an object is not necessarily on the object. It may lie outside the object.

- In a uniform gravitational field, the centre of gravity always coincides with the centre of mass of the object. For a mathematical definition on centre of mass, refer to Appendix B.

#### 3.0.3 Contact Force

When two surfaces come into contact, they both experience contact forces arising from electrostatic forces between atoms of the surfaces. For ease of analysis, this contact force is often resolved into two components: The component perpendicular to the surfaces is called normal contact force, and the component parallel to the surfaces is given the name friction.

#### 3.0.3.1 Normal Contact Force

A block is able to rest on a table because its weight is balanced by an upward force the table exerts on it. This force arises from the electrostatic repulsion between the molecules of the table and the molecules of the block. It is called the normal contact force since it acts perpendicularly (normal) to the surfaces.

In free body diagrams (see Section 3.5.1 for detail), contact forces must be drawn from a contact point (e.g. somewhere along the base of the block). A common mistake is a student draws them from the centre of gravity. (See diagram below)

By definition, the normal contact force is always directed perpendicular to the surfaces.

The magnitude depends on how hard the two surfaces are pressed into each other.

#### 3.0.4 Friction

**Definition of Friction**

Friction is the force that resists relative motion between two sliding surfaces (called kinetic friction), or the tendency for relative motion between two stationary surfaces (called static friction).

Direction

Friction is always directed in opposite direction to the direction of relative motion:

For example, a block sliding along a rough table is gradually decelerated to rest. It experiences a (kinetic) friction directed backward because the block's surface is sliding forward relative to the table's surface.

Normal contact force

Block sliding forward relative to the table surface

www.KiasuExamPaper.comOn the other hand, a person is able to walk forward only if he experiences a (static) friction that is directed forward. The sole of his shoe tends to rub backward relative to the floor's surface.

The magnitude of friction between two surfaces follows these empirical rules:

1. It is dependent on the _nature of the surface_. For example, friction between glass and rubber is usually larger than friction between glass and wood.
2. It is proportional to the _normal contact force_ between the two surfaces, which in turn depends on how hard the two surfaces are pressed against each other.
3. It is independent of the area of contact between the two bodies.

Mathematically, the magnitude of friction can be expressed as

\(f\leq\mu N\)

\(f\): friction

\(\mu\): coefficient of friction between the two surfaces.

\(N\): normal contact force

It is interesting that the coefficient of friction between two stationary surfaces (tending to have relative motion) is always larger than the coefficient of friction of the same surfaces when they are in relative motion. For more detail, refer Appendix A.

#### 3.0.5 Tension

In physics, tension refers to the magnitude of the pulling force exerted by a string, rope, cable or chain on the object tied to its end when it is pulled **taut**.

- The direction of the force exerted on the object is along the string, directed away from the object.

- The magnitude of the force depends on how much the string is stretched. Once the string is **slack**, the tension falls to zero.

- In many situations, we idealise the string, rope, cable, etc to be **massless** and **inextensible** in order to simplify analysis.

- Strings, ropes, etc are often used together with pulleys. Again, in many situations, we idealise a pulley to be **massless** and **frictionless** (at the **xle**) in order to simplify analysis.

Consider _an object which is at rest, we hung vertically by a rope._

### Newton's Laws of Motion

#### 3.1.1 Newton's 1st Law

**Statement of Newton's 1st law of motion**

A body stays at rest or continues to move with a constant speed in a straight line unless acted upon by a _net external force_.

Notes

Changes in a body's state of motion refer to changes in its velocity. It can be a change in either its **speed** or **direction** (or both).

An object's resistance to change its state of motion is called **inertia**. As such Newton's 1st law is also referred to as the Law of Inertia.

An object's inertia is dependent on its mass: The larger its mass, the larger its inertia.

#### 3.1.2 Linear Momentum

Everyday experience tells us that 2 objects moving at the same velocity can result in very different consequences. Consider a 3-gram ping pong ball and a 3-ton lorry, both travelling at 5 m s\({}^{\text{-}4}\). Which would you rather collide with?

In Physics, we define a "quantity of motion" called **momentum**, \(\mathbf{p}\).

**Definition of Linear momentum**

The linear momentum of a body is the product of its mass and its velocity:

Mathematically, linear momentum, \(\mathbf{\bar{p}}\mathbf{=}\mathbf{m}\mathbf{\bar{v}}\)

Notes

Momentum is **vector quantity**. It shares the same direction as the object's velocity.

Momentum has the SI unit: **kgm s\({}^{\text{-}4}\)**

KIASU

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:80]

**Example 2**

The motor of a small boat has a propeller which sends back a column of water of cross sectional area 0.030 m\({}^{2}\) at a speed of 8.0 m s\({}^{-1}\). Assuming that the boat is held at rest, calculate

(a) the rate (in kg s\({}^{-1}\)) at which the water is propelled backwards

(b) the rate of change of momentum of the water

(c) the thrust exerted by the motor on the boat

Note that Newton's 3\({}^{d}\) Law is utilized in solving the above problem. By calculating the magnitude of the force that A acts on B, we indirectly obtained the magnitude of the force that B acts on A.

#### 3.1.4 Impulse

**Definition of Impulse**

The impulse of a force is the product of the average force and the time interval over which it is applied. Mathematically, \(\bar{\bar{J}}=\bar{F}\Delta t\)

Notes
* Impulse is a vector quantity; its direction is the same as the force \(F\).
* The SI units for impulse are **N s**. They can be shown to be equivalent to **kg m s\({}^{\star}\)**, the same as the units of momentum

#### 3.1.4 Relation between Impulse and Momentum

From Newton's 2nd Law, \(\bar{F}=\frac{d\bar{p}}{dt}\)

Rearranging and integrating, we obtain

\[\int\bar{\bar{F}}dt=\int d\bar{p}\]

The LHS, \(\int\bar{\bar{F}}\Delta t\), is the impulse of the force. The RHS, \(\int d\bar{p}=\bar{p}_{t}-\bar{p}_{t}=\Delta\bar{p}\), is the total change in momentum

This result which links impulse to the change in momentum is known as the Impulse-Momentum Theorem.

**Statement of Impulse-Momentum Theorem**

The _change in_ momentum of a particle during a time interval equals the impulse of the net force that acts on the particle during that interval. Mathematically, \(\bar{\bar{J}}=|\bar{F}dt=\bar{\bar{\rho}}\)

For **average** or **constant** forces, this simplifies to \(\bar{\bar{J}}=\varsigma\bar{F}\approx\Delta t=\bar{\Delta\bar{\rho}}\)

#### 3.1.4.2 Graphical Representation of Impulse

Since \(\vec{J}=\left\lceil\vec{F}\vec{e}t\right\rceil\)\(\sim\)\(\Delta\vec{p}\), impulse is represented by the area under the _force-time_ graph. The same area also represents the change in the momentum of the body.

To illustrate further, study the \(F\)-\(t\) graphs below. Notice even though the two forces have different peak magnitude, both deliver the same impulses (i.e. same area under each graph). Hence the two forces will cause the same change in momentum to the object they are applied on.

[FIGURE:A1.F1][ENDFIGUR

#### 3.1.5 Newton's 2nd law for constant mass

From N2L, \(F_{net}=\frac{d\rho}{dt}=\frac{d(mv)}{dt}\)

For constant mass, \(\vec{F}_{net}=m\frac{d\vec{v}}{dt}\)

\(|\vec{F}_{net}=m\vec{a}|\)

Notes
* \(\vec{F}_{net}=m\vec{a}\) is not a complete representation of Newton's 2nd Law. It only represents a special case of Newton's 2nd law for constant mass.
* The product \(m\vec{a}\) represents the **result** of all the actual physical forces acting on a body. It is **not** a new or additional physical force. As such, we do not draw \(m\vec{a}\) as a separate force in free body diagrams.
* Be clear about which is the cause (\(F_{net}\)), and which is the effect (acceleration).
* A non-zero \(F_{net}\)_results in_ acceleration (change in speed or direction), or
* If acceleration is detected, it _implies_ Fnet is non-zero. It does not result in a new force.

#### 3.1.6 Newton's 3rd Law

**Statement of Newton's 3rd law**

If body A exerts a force on body B, then body B will exert an equal and opposite force on body A.

It is easy to confuse action-reaction pairs with force pairs that happen to have "equal-but-opposite" forces. Performing the following "mental checklist" may 'hep to detect "impostors".

**For two forces to be Action-Reaction Pair, the two forces must be**

**Equal in magnitude**

**Opposite in direction**

**Acting on different bodies**

**Of the same nature. (e.g. grav-grav, friction-friction, tension-tension)**

To illustrate, consider the forces when a person is standing in an elevator.

#### 3.2.2 Types of Collisions

A **collision** is an isolated event in which two or more colliding bodies exert **relatively strong** forces on each other for a relatively short time. Note that the two bodies do not necessarily have to be in any physical contact, as interaction may involve a force at a distance.

##### 3.2.2.1 Head-on vs Glancing Collisions

A head-on collision is one in which the directions of motion before and after the collision are along the same line of motion.

##### 3.2.2.2 Elastic vs Inelastic Collisions

The total kinetic energy of the colliding bodies is NOT necessarily conserved during a collision. (This is unlike the total momentum, which is ALWAYS conserved during a collision) Some kinetic energy is usually converted to heat, sound and deformation energy. How much of the original kinetic energy is conserved after the collision depends on the **elasticity**1 of the collision.

Footnote 1: Refer to Appendix B if you want to know how the elasticity is measured by the coefficient of restitution.

* An **elastic** collision is one where 100% of the kinetic energy is conserved. E.g. two diamonds bouncing off each other. Note that _during_ the collision, some of the kinetic energy can be temporarily be converted to potential energy.
* An **inelastic** collision is one that is NOT elastic, i.e. some or all of the KE is converted into heat, sound, deformation energy, etc.
* A **perfectly inelastic** collision is one where the 2 objects coalesce (stick together) and move with **common velocity** after the collision. E.g. two lumps of clay that don't bounce at all, but stick together after the collision. This represents the **maximum possible loss** of kinetic energy without violating the principle of conservation of energy. It does NOT necessarily mean all the KE is lost.

#### 3.2.2.3 Relative Speed of Approach/Separation during Elastic Collision

Consider a two-body elastic head-on collision.

By PCOM:

Rearranging, we get

Since KE is conserved during an elastic collision:

\[\frac{1}{2}{m_{1}}{u_{1}}^{2}+\frac{1}{2}{m_{2}}{u_{2}}^{2}=\frac{1}{2}{m_{1}}{ v_{1}}^{2}+\frac{1}{2}{m_{2}}{v_{2}}^{2}\]

Rearranging, we get

\[\bar{m}_{1}({\bar{u_{1}}}^{2}-{v_{1}}^{2})={m_{2}}({v_{2}}^{2}-{u_{2}}^{2})\]

\[\Rightarrow\]

\[\bar{m}_{1}({u_{1}}-{v_{1}})({u_{1}}+{v_{1}})={m_{2}}({v_{2}}-{u_{2}})({v_{2}}+ {u_{2}})\]

When (2) / (1)

\[\Rightarrow\]

\[\{\bar{u_{1}}+{v_{1}}\}=\{\bar{v_{2}}+{u_{2}}\}\]

Rearranging

\[\{\bar{u_{1}}-{u_{2}}\}=\{\bar{v_{2}}-{v_{1}}\}\]

or equivalently,

\[\{\bar{u_{1}}-{u_{2}}\}=-\{\bar{v_{1}}-{v_{2}}\}\]

The \(({u_{1}}-{u_{2}})\) term represents the speed of body 1 relative to body 2 before the collision.

The \(({v_{1}}-{v_{2}})\) term represents the speed of body 1 relative to body 2 after the collision.

We thus come to the following conclusion:

**Statement of Relative Speed of Approach/Separation**

For **elastic** collisions, relative speed of approach is equal to the relative speed of separation.

Mathematically,

\[\bar{u_{1}}-\bar{u_{2}}-{v_{2}}-{v_{1}}\]

This result can only be applied for (2 body) **elastic** collision. During examinations, the above statement must be made before it can be applied mathematically in solving problems.

#### Elastic Collision, One Body Initially at Rest (Good to know, not stated in syllabus)

Let's study a head-on elastic collision between two bodies, one of which is initially at rest.

By PCOM:

\(m_{i}u=m_{i}v_{1}+m_{2}v_{2}\)

For elastic collision, relative speed of approach = relative speed of separation:

\(u-0=v_{2}-v_{1}\)

Substitute \(v_{2}=u+v_{i}\) into (1):

\(m_{i}u=m_{i}v_{i}+m_{2}u+m_{2}v_{i}\)

\(v_{i}=\frac{m_{i}-m_{2}}{m_{i}+m_{2}}u\)

Substitute \(v_{1}=v_{2}-u\) into (1):

\(m_{i}u=m_{i}v_{2}-m_{i}u+m_{2}v_{2}\)

\(v_{2}=\frac{2m_{1}}{m_{1}+m_{2}}u\)

Case 1: \(m_{1}=m_{2}\)

\(v_{1}=0,v_{2}=u\)

E.g. During a billiard shot, the cue ball comes to a complete rest after hitting the target ball (of the same mass), passing all the momentum to the target ball.

Case 2: \(m_{1}<<m_{2}\)

\(v_{1}*-\bar{u},v_{2}\approx 0\)

E.g. A ping pong ball lands on the table and bounces back with the same speed as before.

Case 3: \(m_{1}>>m_{2}\)

\(v_{1}*u,v_{2}\approx 2u\)

E.g. After hitting a bowling pin, the bowling ball continues with no noticeable drop in speed, while the pin was sent flying forward at about twice the ball's speed.

Obviously, these results are only valid for head-on elastic collision between two bodies, one initially at rest. During examinations, you are NOT allowed to quote and use these results without derivation.

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:103]

## Appendix A Static and Kinetic Friction

Static Friction

The magnitude of static friction between two surfaces can be expressed as

\[f_{s}\leq\mu_{s}N\]

where \(\mu_{s}\) is the coefficient of static friction between the two surfaces in question and

\(N\) is the magnitude of the normal contact force between the two surfaces.

Static friction thus has a maximum magnitude called the limiting friction \(f_{\text{max}}=\mu_{s}N\).

Kinetic Friction (or sliding friction or dynamic friction)

The magnitude of static friction between two surfaces can be expressed as

\[f_{k}=\mu_{k}N\]

where \(\mu_{k}\) is the coefficient of kinetic friction between the two surfaces in question and

\(N\) is the magnitude of the normal contact force between the two surfaces.

Unlike the static friction, kinetic friction is a constant value. It is also independent of the relative speed of motion.

Both \(\mu_{s}\) and \(\mu_{k}\)are empirically found to be always less than 1 (friction is always less than normal contact force).

\(\mu_{k}\) is found to be always less than \(\mu_{s}\) (kinetic friction is always smaller than the limiting static friction).

To better understand the two, consider the results of the following experiment.

An external force is applied on the block and is increased very gradually until the block starts moving and continues to move at a constant speed. Since the block is always either at static equilibrium or constant speed motion, the magnitude of frictional force can be inferred from the applied force as measured by the force sensor.

The graph of the applied force against time is shown below in relation to the magnitudes of friction, both static and kinetic:

## Appendix B Centre of Mass

**Centre of Mass** _(Good to know, Not stated in syllabus)_

If a mechanical system can be reduced to a set of particles of known mass and spatial separation, then the centre of mass for the original rigid body can be calculated by summing the moments for each particle about any line we choose, and then calculating the distance from the line for a particle equal in mass to the total mass such that the moment of the particle of total mass is the same as the sum of the moments for all the particles. The sum of moments must account for a specified rotational sense with respect to the chosen line.

Suppose we have several particles, with masses \(m_{i}\), \(m_{2}\) and so on. Let the coordinates of \(m_{1}\) be \((x_{i},y_{i})\) and those of \(m_{2}\) be \((x_{2},y_{2})\) and so on.

The centre of mass of the system is the point \((x_{\alpha},y_{\alpha})\) where

\[x_{\alpha}= \frac{m_{1}x_{1}+m_{2}x_{2}+m_{3}x_{3}+\cdots}{m_{1}+m_{2}+m_{3}+ \cdots}=\frac{\sum_{i}m_{i}x_{i}}{M}\] \[y_{\alpha}= \frac{m_{1}y_{1}+m_{2}y_{2}+m_{3}y_{3}+\cdots}{m_{1}+m_{2}+m_{3}+ \cdots}=\frac{\sum_{i}m_{i}y_{i}}{M}\]

\(M\) denotes the total mass \(m_{1}+m_{2}+m_{3}+\cdots\) of the particles.

## Appendix C: Coefficient of Restitution

The elasticity of a collision is quantified by a number called the coefficient of restitution, \(\varepsilon\), defined as the ratio of the speed of separation to the speed of approach:

\(\varepsilon=\frac{\left|\frac{V_{2}}{2}-\vec{V}_{0}\right|}{\left|\vec{V}_{2}- \vec{V}_{0}\right|}\)

A perfectly elastic collision has a coefficient of restitution of 1. Example: two diamonds bouncing off each other. A perfectly plastic, or inelastic, collision has \(\varepsilon=0\). Example: two lumps of clay that don't bounce at all, but stick together. So the coefficient of restitution will always be between zero and one.

\(\varepsilon\) is determined by several factors like the material of the colliding bodies, and _assumed_ to be independent of speed.

## Appendix D: Newton's Law in Car Safety

Using Newton's laws, discuss how each of the following features in vehicles increases the safety of its passengers:

a) Seat Belts

b) Head restraints

c) Air Bags

a) Seat belt exerts a retardation force on the passenger, without which he would have continued in his state of uniform motion in a straight line into the windscreen. (N1L)

(The vehicle is able to decelerate rapidly because the braking system leads to a frictional force between the road surface and the tyres. Unfortunately, this frictional force acts on the vehicle, not the passenger. Without the seat belt, the only retardation force would be the frictional force between the seat and the passenger's bum. But this force is limited. If the vehicle decelerates too fast, the frictional force is not large enough to decelerate the passenger at the same rate as the vehicle)

(Be very clear that when passengers crash into the wind screen, it was due to their inertia. It was not due to some mysterious "forward force")

**b)** If the car is hit from the rear, the head restraint provides a forward force on the passenger's head so that the head is accelerated at the same rate as the rest of his body, so that he does not suffer from whiplash (some kind of neck injury).

**c)** Airbags exerts a relatively small force over a relatively long duration of time, safely bringing the passenger to rest by reducing the passenger's momentum at a relatively slower rate. (N2L)

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:109]

#### 4.2.3 Uphrust

The variation of pressure with depth implies that the forces exerted by a fluid on a body fully or partially immersed in the fluid vary with the vertical height of the body in the fluid. This results in a net upward force on the body by the fluid, which is called an upthrust.

The net upward force exerted by a fluid on a body fully or partially submerged in the fluid.

By considering the fluid forces acting on a cube fully immersed in the fluid as shown in the diagram, we can generalise the result to find the upthrust experienced by any body immersed in the fluid.

\begin{tabular}{l l} \hline \hline \begin{tabular}{l} Let \\ \end{tabular} & \begin{tabular}{l} \(\rho\) = density of the fluid, \\ \(A\) = surface area of a face of the cube, \\ \(\Delta h\) = \(h_{1}\)- \(h_{2}\) = length of a side of the cube. \\ \end{tabular} \\ \end{tabular} The fluid forces acting on the side faces of the cube are equal in magnitude and in opposite directions, thus resulting in **zero net horizontal force**. \\ \end{tabular} The fluid force \(F_{1}\) acting on the **bottom** surface is \(F_{1}=\rho gh_{1}A\). \\ \end{tabular} The fluid force \(F_{2}\) acting on the **top** surface is \(F_{2}=\rho gh_{2}A\) \\ \end{tabular} Thus, the **net vertical force** is \(F_{1}\) - \(F_{2}=\rho gh_{1}A-\rho gh_{2}A\) \\ \(=\rho gA(h_{1}-h_{2})\) \\ \(=\rho gA\Delta h\) \\ \(=\rho gV\), where volume of the cube \(V=A\Delta h\) \\ \(=\rho Vg\) \\ \(=(\)mass of fluid displaced) x g \\ \(=\)weight of fluid displaced. \\ \end{tabular} \\ \end{tabular} \\ \end{tabular} \\ \begin{tabular}{l l} \hline \begin{tabular}{l} **Archimedes' Principle** \\ \end{tabular} For a body submerged in a fluid, the upthrust acting on the body is equal to the **weight of fluid displaced**. \\ \end{tabular} where \(U=\) upthrust, \(\rho=\) density of fluid, \(V=\) volume of fluid displaced by the body, \(g=\)gravitational acceleration \\ \end{tabular} In free body diagrams, upthrust must be drawn from the centre of gravity of the fluid displaced. \\ \end{tabular} \\ \end{tabular} \begin{tabular}{l l} \hline

### Translational Equilibrium

By Newton's Laws of Motion, when the net external force acting on a body is zero, the acceleration will be zero. The centre of mass of this body will be observed to be either stationary or moving at constant velocity. This body is then said to be in **translational equilibrium**.

**Condition for Translational Equilibrium**:

The net external force acting on a body is zero, i.e. \(\Sigma F_{\text{ext}}=0\) N.

**KIASU**

**ExamPaper**

### Moment of a Force

Besides translational motion, objects also exhibit rotational motion. Forces applied on a rigid body1 can also cause or change its rotational motion, other than translational motion, that we are quite familiar with. The quantitative measure of the extent to which a force can cause or change the rotational motion of a rigid body is called the moment of the force, \(\tau\)(Greek letter _tau_). The **moment of a force** is also called the **torque**.

Footnote 1: In physics, we sometimes idealise objects as particles. This means we ignore the size of the object and treat it like a point-like body. A particle has no spatial dimensions, but can have mass. It follows that particles are capable of translational motion only. Obviously we cannot treat objects as particles if we were to analyse their rotational motion. Neglecting that a real-world body may deform (e.g. stretch, bend, twist, etc) we assume that the body has a perfectly definite and unchanging shape and size. We call this idealized model a rigid body.

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:114]

### Rotational Equilibrium and Principle of Moments

**Condition for Rotational Equilibrium:**

The net moment on the body _about any point_ is zero. \(\Sigma r=0\) Nm:

When all lines of action of the forces are in the same plane (co-planar forces), the condition for rotational equilibrium is simplified to the principle of moments.

**Principle of moments** states that for a body to be in rotational equilibrium, sum of clockwise moments about any point equals sum of anticlockwise moments about that same point.

**Example 7**

Find the unknown force \(F\) in each of the following situations required to maintain rotational equilibrium.

**4.6 Static Equilibrium**

Equilibrium is a concept to describe the state of a body that is at rest or at constant velocity. Static equilibrium is when the body is at rest.

**Conditions for (Static) Equilibrium:**

The net external force acting on the body is zero. \(\Sigma F_{\text{eff}}=0\) N.

The net torque on the body _about any point_ is zero. \(\Sigma r=0\) Nm.

**TIP S Solving Static Equilibrium problems**

1. Isolate the body of interest
2. Draw the free body diagram and identify all forces acting on the body.
3. Set up the torque equation (condition for rotational equilibrium)
4. Choose a "good" pivot point.
5. A "good" pivot point is a point which lies on the lines of action of one or more of the unknown forces, thereby reducing the number of unknown terms in the equation.
6. Apply the condition \(\Sigma r=0\) Nm.

**Summation of clockwise moments = Summation of anti-clockwise moments**

## Appendix

### Why are whales so huge?

On land, an animal is a prisoner of its own weight. The larger an animal gets, the more difficult it becomes to support itself. For example, imagine two whales, one twice the size of the other. As the measurements show, the larger whale is twice as long, twice as wide and twice as thick as the smaller whale. As you may have expected, the mass of the bigger whale is actually about eight times that of the smaller one, instead of twice.

On land, this extra weight can pose a big problem. If an elephant doubles in size, its bones cannot just double in strength - they need to get eight times as strong to support its own weight. As land animals get larger and larger, supporting body weight becomes a bigger and bigger concern. This is why the biggest land animals - such as elephants and hippos - have such thick bones.

In water, however, weight is not much of a problem. Objects submerged in water are supported by the buoyant force (upthrust) due to water. The bulk of a whale's mass is made up of water (can you recall the percentage by mass of water in human?) and has similar average density to water. As a whale gets bigger, its weight gets large, and the buoyant force exerted on it increases too. Hence, a whale experiences some kind of weightlessness in water. This allows them to grow to enormous sizes without the need to develop extremely strong bones.

### Buoyancy of a submarine

A submarine or a ship can float because the weight of water that it displaces is equal to the weight of the ship. This displacement of water creates an upward force called the buoyant force (upthrust) and acts opposite to gravity, which would pull the ship down. Unlike a ship, a submarine can control its buoyancy, thus allowing it to sink and surface at will.

To control its buoyancy, the submarine has ballast tanks and auxiliary, or trim tanks, that can be filled with water or air. When the submarine is on the surface, the ballast tanks are filled with air and the submarine's overall density is less than that of the surrounding water. As the submarine dives, the ballast tanks are flooded with water and the air in the ballast tanks is vented from the submarine until its overall density is greater than the surrounding water and the submarine begins to sink. A supply of compressed air is maintained aboard the submarine in air flasks for life support and for use with the ballast tanks.

In addition, the submarine has movable sets of short "wings" called hydrophanes on the stem (back) and bow (front) that help to control the angle of the dive. At the start of the dive the back hydroplanes are rotated upwards so that the stem of the boat is forced upwards. The front hydroplanes are rotated downwards, thus forcing the bow of the boat down. During the dive the back hydroplanes are moved to the neutral position and the dive angle is controlled with the front hydroplanes only. Close to the required depth, the back hydroplanes are rotated down and the front hydroplanes up to level off the boat. At slow speeds the depth of the boat is maintained by the front hydrophanes only.

To keep the submarine level at any set depth, the submarine maintains a balance of air and water in the trim tanks so that its overall density is equal to the surrounding water. When the submarine reaches its cruising depth, the hydrophanes are leveled so that the submarine travels level through the water. The submarine can steer in the water by using the tail rudder to turn starboard (right) or port (left) and the hydrophanes to control the front-back angle of the submarine. In addition, some submarines are equipped with a retractable secondary propulsion motor that can swivel 360 degrees.

When the submarine surfaces, compressed air flows from the air flasks into the ballast tanks and the water is forced out of the submarine until its overall density is less than the surrounding water and the submarine rises. The hydrophanes are angled so that the submarine is angled upward. In an emergency, the ballast tanks can be filled quickly with high-pressure air to take the submarine to the surface very rapidly.

_What keeps airplanes in the air?_

Bernoulli's principle states that the pressure of a moving gas decreases as its velocity increases. When air flows over a wing having a curved upper surface and a flat lower surface, the flow is faster across the curved surface than across the plane one; thus a greater pressure is exerted in the upward direction. The overall effect is the presence of a net upward force acting on the wing, known as lift.

The magnitude of the lift depends on the difference between the pressure on the upper side and lower side of the wing. The faster the forward motion, the greater will be the difference in the pressure. The object needs to travel at high speeds for the lift force to be significant. The wings of aeroplanes are designed to maximise the lift in order to support its weight and hence able to stay in flight.

#### Wings on Race Cars

In the early days of race car design, the principal aerodynamic goal was to have a design that minimized drag in order to maximize top speed. Over the years, however, as race cars started to become faster and more powerful, the need for traction, or adhesive friction between the tires and road surface, during high-speed corners began to become a pressing issue.

The easiest and most effective solution to this problem came in the form of wings or aerofolis similar to those found on airplanes, which, however, would be now designed to generate, instead of lift, "downforce," i.e. effectively negative lift. These wings would be mounted to the chassis of a race car to transfer the force generated to the chassis itself and through this to the car axdes and wheels. This increases the downward pressure in the contact area between the tire and the road surface, thus also increasing the adhesive friction between these two surfaces. A typical race car wing arrangement is illustrated in Fig. 1 under the labels "A" and "B", "A" being the front wing integrated into the body of the car, and "B" the rear wing element.

It is worth noting that due to the physical constraints on the dimensions of the wings in a car, usable downforce is only generated when the race car is traveling at high speed. Due to the importance of wings in providing better traction, cornering and overall performance for race cars, much attention and research is focused on their design and implementation on the car body.

#### 5.1.2 Work done by a variable force

Suppose an object is being displaced along the \(x\)-axis under the action of a force \(F_{x}\) that acts in the \(x\) direction and varies with position. The object is displaced in the direction of increasing \(x\) from \(x=x_{y}\) to \(x=x_{r}\) in order to calculate work done by the _variable force_\(F_{x}\), we first need to know how the force applied \(F_{x}\) varied with displacement. Let's imagine we were able to use a force sensor and a data logger to measure this variation and that we were able to get the plot shown below.

The total displacement \(x\) can be regarded as the sum of many very small steps \(\Delta x\). During each small step, the force is practically constant.

The total work done = sum of work done for each step

\[W =\Delta W_{1}+\Delta W_{2}+\Delta W_{3}+.......\] \[=F_{1}\Delta x+F_{2}\Delta x+F_{3}\Delta x+......\]

As the width of the small steps, \(\Delta x\); gets really small, the sum of area of these strips will just be the area under the graph of \(F_{x}\) against \(x\):

\[W=\int\limits_{x_{i}}^{x_{i}}F_{x}\;\Delta x\]

In other words, the work done by a variable force acting on an object that undergoes a displacement is equal to the area under the force-displacement graph.

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:126]

#### 5.3.2 Potential energy

An object can have energy by virtue of its position or the arrangement of the system that it is part of. The potential energy of a system represents a form of stored energy, which can be fully recovered and converted into kinetic energy.

Potential energy of a body can be defined as the amount of work that was done on it to give it that position.

There are three kinds of potential energy. They are summarized in the table below.

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|} \hline
**Elastic PE** & **Gravitational PE** & **Electrical PE** \\ \hline Interaction between charges on atoms and molecules & Interaction between masses & Interaction between charges \\ \hline Involves attractive and repulsive forces & Involves only attractive forces & Involves attractive and repulsive forces \\ \hline \end{tabular}

### Gravitational Potential Energy

To move objects around near the surface of the earth we need to use forces to overcome the Earth's attraction. The work done by exerting forces to overcome this attraction and place objects in positions further and further from the surface of the earth manifests itself as an increasing gravitational potential energy associated with that object.

The gravitational potential energy (G.P.E) of a body is a measure of the energy it possesses by virtue of its position in a gravitational field.

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|} \hline
**KIASU** \\ ExamPaper.com \\ \hline \end{tabular}

We can infer the formula for G.P.E. from the amount of work that is done _by an external force_\(F_{\text{ext}}\) to lift a body through a vertical distance of \(h\) at constant speed.

\[W=F_{\text{ext}}s\]

To just overcome the gravitational pull, \(F_{\text{ext}}=mg\).

\[W=(mg\,)(h)\]

\[=mgn\]

Hence,

gain in G.P.E = mgh

**Note:**

This definition applies only to objects that stay near to the surface of the Earth during the motion, and \(h\) is small relative to the diameter of the Earth so that the gravitational pull on the body (i.e. its weight \(mg\)) is practically constant during the motion.

#### 5.5.1 Work done by External Force on a Deformed Material

An elastic material (e.g. a wire) usually obey Hooke's Law closely unless the deformation is excessively large. If the material is stretched beyond its proportionality limit, it will no longer obey Hooke's Law and the force-extension graph will not be a straight line from that point onwards. If an elastic material (e.g. a wire) is stretched further **beyond its elastic limit** (also known as yield point), it will suffer a permanent deformation and not snap back to its original length when the external force is removed. If the wire is stretched even further, it will eventually hit fracture point and the wire will simply snap. The force-extension graph will look like the one shown in the figure below.

In such cases, to determine work done by external force on wire, one cannot simply use the equation \(E=\gamma_{2}\)\(\delta\alpha^{2}\) since Hooke's Law is no longer obeyed. Instead, the work done can simply be worked out by calculating the area under the force-extension graph (shaded area).

When the wire is stretched beyond its elastic limit and the external force is subsequently removed, the extension is only partially recovered. Work done by external force on wire will be more than the elastic potential energy. Energy is therefore lost as heat and this phenomenon is known as hysteresis.

Try this out I The effect of hysteresis is usually very small for metals, but is noticeable for polythene, glass and rubber. You can easily investigate this using a rubber band. By simply stretching it and then holding it against your lips you can detect a rise in temperature!

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:131]

### Power

The same amount of work is done in raising a given body through a given height, regardless whether it takes one second or one year to do so. However, _the rate at which work is done_ is greater for the former than that for the latter.

Power is defined as the rate at which work is done.

Instantaneous power, \(P=\frac{dW}{dt}\)

Average power, \(<P>=\frac{\Delta W}{\Delta t}\).

Notes:

* The SI unit of power is the **watt** (W). Power is a **scalar** quantity.
* Work can also be expressed in units of (power x time). This is the origin of the term _kilowatt-hour_.
* One _kilo-watt hour_ is the work done in 1 hour by an agent working at a constant rate of 1 _RW_.

Example 8: A 1.10 x 10\({}^{3}\) kg car, starting from rest, accelerates for 5.00 s. The magnitude of the acceleration is \(a=4.60\) m s\({}^{2}\). Determine the average power generated by the net force that accelerates the vehicle.

\(W=\frac{\Delta t}{\Delta t}\)

#### 5.7.1 Relationship between Power, Force and Velocity

Consider a force \(F\) that acts on a body for a small time interval \(\Delta t\). The body moves a small displacement \(\Delta x\) in the direction of the force.

Work done by the force \(F\) during \(\Delta t\), \(\Delta W=F\Delta x\)

Power delivered by that force \(F\) during \(P=\Delta W/\Delta t\)

the time interval \(\Delta t\)

\(=\frac{F(\Delta x)/\Delta t}{\Delta t}\)

\(=F(\Delta x)\)

where \(v\) is the instantaneous velocity of the body.

Example 9: When a force \(F\) acts on a body that is moving with velocity \(v\), in the direction of the force, it delivers power to the body at the rate given by\(P=\bar{F}v\)

**Notes:**

* A force \(F\) that acts in the direction of the displacement \(\Delta x,\) does positive work on the body. It transfers energy to the body at a rate proportional to the speed of the body.
* If \(F\) or \(v\) varies with time, then \(P\) may not be constant. However, the product \(Fv\) at any moment will gives the instantaneous power of \(F\) at that instant.
* Where \(F\) acts against the motion of the body, it does negative work on the body. It extracts energy out of the body at a rate equal to the magnitude of \(Fv\).

**Example 9**: A car is moving with a constant velocity of 20.0 m s\({}^{-1}\) along a straight horizontal road. The total resistive forces acting on the car is 2000 N. What is the power developed by the engine of the car?

**5.8.2 Efficiency (of energy conversion), \(\eta\)**

No practical engine can transform energy from one form to another without some energy going to internal energy and other non-useful forms of energy.

The efficiency of any energy conversion process is the ratio of

* the useful energy output to the total energy input, or
* the useful power output to the power input

\[\text{efficiency}=\frac{\text{useful energy output}}{\text{total energy input}}\,\quad\eta=\frac{E_{\text{output}}}{E_{\text{input}}}\frac{P_{\text{output}}}{P_{ \text{input}}}.\]

**Note:**

\(\eta\) (Greek small letter, Eta) is a ratio between two quantities of the same type. It has no unit.

**Example 10**: A small motor is used to raise a weight of 2.0 N at constant speed through a vertical height of 80 cm in 4.0 s. The efficiency of the motor is 20 %. What is the electrical power supplied to the motor?

**Figure 10**: A small motor is used to raise a weight of 2.0 N at constant speed through a vertical height of 80 cm in 4.0 s. The efficiency of the motor is 20 %. What is the electrical power supplied to the motor?

## Appendix 1: Relationship between field force and potential energy (to be covered in later chapters)

We have seen that in general, potential energy is a function of position such that the difference between its value at an initial and final position is always equal to the work done in moving an object between these positions. We will use this concept to arrive at a general rule for the relationship between a potential energy function (how the potential energy varies with displacement) and the size of the force generated by the field. We shall for simplicity's sake consider a uniform gravitational field.

Consider a mass that fails freely under the pull of gravity \(F\); through a vertical distance \(\Delta r\) in the direction of \(F\).

Work done by the gravitational force, \(W\)= \(F\)\(\Delta r\)

Work done = Difference in Potential Energy = \(\neg\Delta U\) (Decrease in P.E.)

\(\therefore F\)\(\Delta r\) = \(\neg\Delta U\)\(\Rightarrow F\) = -\(\frac{\Delta U}{\Delta r}\)

This concept can be generalised for any conservative field in which energy is not lost. A force is conservative if the work it does on an object moving between two points is independent of the path taken between the points. Examples of conservative forces are gravitational force, electrostatic force and force of a spring.

Conservative fields can have a potential energy function associated with it. Work done in bringing an object from one point to another is simply the difference in the potential energy between those two points.

In any conservative and uniform field, the force exerted by the field is related to the potential energy U of the system by

\(F\) = -\(\frac{\Delta U}{\Delta r}\)

The magnitude of the field force at a point in the field is given by the potential energy gradient at that point.

The **direction of the field force** is in the **direction of decreasing potential energy.

In general, the concept can be generalised to include non-uniform fields:

\(F\) = -\(\frac{dU}{dr}\)

### Introduction

Circular motion is a type of motion we often come across in our daily lives, e.g. Cars navigating a bend, the capsules of a Ferris wheel, children on a merry-go-round, clothes in a spin dryer.

On a larger scale, in astronomy, we know that the moon circles the Earth, which circles the Sun, which circles the centre of the Milky Way.

Have you ever wondered?

Why must a cyclist lean into a turn?

Why must an airplane tilt when executing a turn?

Why people in a roller coaster don't fall out at the top of the loop? (No, it is not because of the belts)

The exploration of the fascinating world of circular motion begins here.

**A Short Revision on basic ideas of Newton's Laws of Motion**

_Newton's 1st law:_

Describes the motion of any object not subjected to a net external force, specifically that

an object at rest remains at rest, or

an object continues with constant speed in a straight line.

In the presence of a net external force, a constant mass experiences an acceleration governed by _Newton's 2nd Law:_

\[\bar{\alpha}=\frac{\bar{F}_{net}}{m}\]

Note:

Forces which are parallel to the motion of an object result in its motion either speeding up or slowing down, with the direction of motion remaining along the original axis.

Forces which are perpendicular to the motion of the object cannot affect its speed, but instead will change its direction of motion.

Forces which are neither wholly parallel nor perpendicular to the direction of motion will affect both the speed and direction of the object upon which the force acts. (Consider projectile motion).

**In this chapter you will learn that objects will move in circular paths when they experience a force or forces that always act perpendicularly to their motion.**

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:139]

### Uniform Circular Motion

_Uniform circular motion_ is the motion of an object travelling at a **constant** (uniform) speed in a circular path.

An object moving in a uniform circular motion (Fig. 4) has a _constant angular velocity_ (\(\omega\)). The _magnitude_ of the velocity vector (or the linear speed, \(v\)) is _constant_ but the _direction_ of the velocity vector is _changing_. Thus, the _linear velocity vector is continuously changing_ (\(\mathbf{v}_{i}\), \(\mathbf{v}_{2}\) & \(\mathbf{v}_{3}\)) as the object moves around the circle. Since there is a change in the velocity vector with respect to time, the object should be under acceleration.

Figure 4:

**Derivation of the equation of centripetal acceleration:**

In this derivation we only consider the kinematics of uniform circular motion to arrive at a general expression for the acceleration an object is experiencing when it moves in a circle at constant speed.

Consider a particle moving in a circle of radius \(r\) with uniform angular speed (Fig. 5a). At one instant the particle is at A, and its instantaneous velocity is \(v\) in the direction AA'.

A very short time later \(\delta t\)  later, the particle has moved to B, a distance \(r\delta\theta\)  along the arc, where \(\delta\theta\) is a small angle and its velocity is \(v\) in the direction BB' at this time.

With reference to the vector triangle in Fig. 5b, the arc length can be approximated to a chord.

For small angle \(\delta\theta\),

\(\delta v\approx v\delta\theta\)

\(\delta v/\delta t\approx v\delta\theta/\delta t\)

\(\frac{dv}{dt}=v\frac{d\theta}{dt}\)

\(\theta_{c}=v\omega\)

Similarly,

\(\theta_{c}=(fu)\omega=\kappa u^{2}\)

\(\theta_{c}=V(\frac{v}{r})=\frac{v^{2}}{r}\)

As \(\delta t\) (or \(\delta\theta\)) (Fig. 5b) becomes smaller, the angle between \(\delta v\) and either \(v_{A}\) or \(v_{B}\) will tend to \(90^{\circ}\). Since either \(v_{A}\) or \(v_{B}\) are the tangents to the circular path, this means \(\delta v\) will point towards the centre of the circular path. Similarly, its acceleration will point towards the centre of the circular path because \(\delta v\) and its acceleration are in the same direction. This type of acceleration in uniform circular motion is called _centripetal acceleration_,

The centripetal acceleration is directed **radially inward** towards the centre of the circular path. The direction of the centripetal acceleration is continuously changing.

For an object in _uniform circular motion_, there is **no** acceleration component in the tangential direction (i.e. angular acceleration), or else the magnitude of the velocity vector (tangential or linear speed) would change.

Hence,

\(\frac{\text{Centripetal acceleration},\ \ \alpha_{e}=\frac{v^{2}}{r}=\kappa u^{2}= \kappa u\)

**Conceptual Questions:**

1. Is an object travelling at non-uniform speed accelerating?

_Yes, acceleration involves any change in velocity (magnitude and/or direction), and the speed is changing in this coaco._
2. Can an object travelling at constant speed be accelerating?

_Yes, although its speed may be constant, its direction of motion, thus its velocity, may change, hence there must be an acceleration._

### Contripetal Force (\(F_{c}\))

In the last section we discovered both the magnitude and direction of the acceleration associated with circular motion: We now move into the dynamics of circular motion, quantifying and identifying forces that can constrain objects to adhere to such circular paths.

To provide acceleration, there must be a net force. Thus to produce a centripetal (inward) acceleration, there must be a resultant force towards the centre of the circular motion. As the resultant force is centre-seeking, we call it the centripetal force.

From Newton's second law (\(\sum F=ma\)),

\[F_{c}=ma_{c}=\frac{mv^{2}}{f}=m\omega^{2}=mv\omega\,,\]

and it is **always directed toward the centre of the circle.**

_Note:_ In general, when a force is continuously applied **at an angle of 90\({}^{\circ}\) to the direction of motion (as is centripetal force), _only the direction_ of the velocity changes.

**Conceptual Question:** Is there work done by a centripetal force?

_A centripetal force does no work because there is no displacement in the direction of the centripetal force. The centripetal force is always perpendicular to the direction of motion (displacement)._

_Note:_ For uniform circular motion,

Centripetal force **does not** denote a new and separate force created by nature.

Centripetal force is provided by the net force pointing toward the centre of the circular path, and this net force is the **vector sum of all the force components that point along the radial direction.

_Centripetal force is not a new type of force. "Centripetal" is just an adjective employed to describe the action of a force that is causing circular motion. E.g. the force of friction acting between the tires of a car and the road can provide a force which will allow the car to be steered around a bend. In this case it would be legitimate to call the friction a centripetal force because it acts in such a way as to cause circular motion. Friction is also the force that exists between the brake disc attached to the wheels of a car and the brake pads attached to the car itself which slow the car down when required. The friction is now acting in such a way as to cause linear deceleration of the car and could now be better described as a braking or resistive force but definitely not a centripetal force. Moreover the term "centripetal force" should never appear in a Free Body Diagram of an object in circular motion._

### Problem solving for Circular Motion

#### 6.4.1 General strategy for solving circular motion problems

1. Identify the object undergoing circular motion (and the relevant known quantities such as \(m,v,r,\omega...\)).
2. Draw a **free body diagram** of the object, carefully identifying the individual forces _experienced by_ the object.
3. **Resolve forces** into relevant perpendicular "directions" or use triangle of forces to arrive at a net force acting on the object.
4. Equate this before to \(\frac{mv^{2}}{f}\), the ascertain any unknown.

### Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation

Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation states that:

Every particle attracts every other particle with a force that is directly proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them.

Consider two particles (point masses) of masses \(m_{t}\) and \(m_{2}\) separated by a distance \(r\). Each will exert a force \(F\) on the other, given by

\[F=G\frac{m_{t}m_{2}}{r^{2}}\]

where

\[F\]

: gravitational force between the two particles.

\[m_{t},m_{2}\]

: masses of the two particles.

\[r\]

: distance between the two particles.

\[G\]

: gravitational constant.

The two forces form an action-reaction pair and have the following characteristics,

* are equal in magnitude,
* are opposite in direction,
* act on different bodies
* are of the same type (gravitational force).

\(G\) is called the _gravitational constant_ (or constant of universal gravitation), which has been measured experimentally to be: \(G=6.67\times 10^{-11}\) N m\({}^{2}\) kg\({}^{2}\).

Important points to note about Newton's Law of Gravitation

1. Newton's Law of Gravitation is a universal law. It applies everywhere in the universe.
2. **Attractive nature of gravitational force:** Note that the particles in this case are always attracted to each other.
3. The gravitational force is a field force that always exists between two point masses regardless of the medium that separates them. In fact, it would still exist if there were no medium between them.
4. Inverse square law: Newton's Law of Gravitation is an example of an inverse-square law, i.e., the force is inversely proportional to the square of the separation of the particles.

\[F\propto\frac{1}{r^{2}}\]
5. Newton's Law of gravitation force can be applied to spherical bodies as though they were point masses with all their mass concentrated at their geometrical centres.

#### 7.2.1 Gravitational Field of a Point Mass

If a particle of mass \(M\) is placed at some point in space, it will set up a gravitational field around itself. Suppose we wish to determine the gravitational field strength \(g\) at a distance \(r\) away from this point mass \(M\). We need to place a test mass \(m\) at the distance \(r\) away from this source mass \(M\).

The test mass would experience a gravitational force \(F\) as it is in the gravitational field created by \(M\). By Newton's Law of Gravitation,

The magnitude of the gravitational force acting on \(m\) due to the gravitational field set up by \(M\),

\[F=G\frac{Mm}{r^{2}}\]

From the definition of gravitational field strength,

The magnitude of gravitational field strength due to \(M\) at a distance \(r\) away from \(M\),

The magnitude of the gravitational field strength at a point due to a particle of mass \(M\) at a distance \(r\) away from the mass is given by:

**Note:**

The equation is also for valid for gravitational field strength outside spherical body of uniform density or spherical shells of uniform density, where its whole mass is concentrated at its geometric centre,3\(r\) would then represent the distance between the test mass and the geometric centre of the source mass.

#### 7.2.2 Representation of Gravitational Field

Besides using arrows to represent the gravitational field, another way to visualize the gravitational field in a region of space is to model it using field lines. The gravitational field lines are related to the gravitational field in the following manner:

1. **Direction** The direction of the gravitational field strength \(g\) is tangent to the gravitational field line at each point in space.
2. **Magnitude** The magnitude of the gravitational field strength is proportional to the number of lines per unit area through a surface perpendicular to the lines. Therefore, \(g\) is large when the lines are close together and small when they are far apart.

**Gravitational Field Line Diagram** for a point mass** The gravitational field in the vicinity of a point mass is always directed radially towards the point mass.
* The magnitude of the gravitational field is inversely proportional to the square of the distance from the point mass. Therefore, the number of field lines per unit area decreases the further away one is from the point mass, indicating the diminishing strength of the field.
* The field is really 3-dimensional, but on paper, we can only take a 2-dimensional slice of it. This is a radial or spherical field. Note that xamPaper
1. Field lines do not start or stop in empty space. They end on a mass and extend back all the way to infinity.
2. Field lines never cross.
* The field lines are directed downwards (the direction in which a body near the Earth's surface would feel a gravitational force).
* The field lines are parallel and equidistant indicating that the field is constant, or uniform.
* The number of field lines per unit area is approximately constant for about 10 km in height from the Earth surface. Thus the field strength is approximately 9.81 m s\({}^{-2}\).4 (See Example 6 next page)

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:159]

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:160]

#### Variation of \(g\)

However, when we try to measure the value of \(g\) at various regions on Earth, the value of \(g\) varies. At the poles, \(g\) is 9.83 m s\({}^{2}\), while at the equator the value is 9.78 m s\({}^{2}\). (In Singapore, it is about 9.79 m s\({}^{2}\)).

What accounts for this variation? There are mainly three factors affecting the value of \(g\) measured.

(1) The Earth is not a perfect sphere

Earth is approximately an ellipsoid, flattened at the poles and bulging at the equator. Its equatorial radius is greater than its polar radius by 21 km. Thus a point at the poles is closer to the dense core of the Earth than a point on the equator. This is one reason the gravitational field strength increases as one proceeds, at sea level, from the equator towards the poles.

(2) The density of the Earth is not uniform

The density of the Earth varies from region to region over the Earth's surface. The northern hemisphere, for instance, has far more land area than the southern hemisphere. Accurate measurements of the gravitational pull are used to identify different densities of materials beneath the Earth's surface. These measurements are used in prospecting for oil, coal and other minerals.

(3) The Earth is rotating

The Earth rotates about an axis passing through the poles. Because of the Earth's rotation, the gravitational pull on a body at the equator has to also provide the body with a centripetal acceleration required for rotation. Therefore, the measured gravitational acceleration is smaller at the equator.

#### 7.2.6 Weightlessness

There are two types of weightlessness - true weightlessness and apparent weightlessness.

**True Weightlessness**

**An object is truly weightless when there is no net gravitational force acting on it**, such as when it is at an infinite distance away from any other body, or when it experiences opposing gravitational forces that exactly cancel one another out.

**Apparent Weightlessness**

An astronaut orbiting the Earth in a space vehicle with its thrusters off is often said to be 'weightless' as well. To understand why, let us try to 'weigh' this astronaut in the space vehicle.

Suppose an astronaut is standing on a weighing balance in a space vehicle orbiting the Earth.

Let us first consider the space vehicle, astronaut and weighing balance as a single system.

The only force acting on this system is the gravitational force due to the Earth's gravitational field, \(F_{g}\).

Since the space vehicle is in a circular orbit around the Earth,

\(F_{g}\) provides for the centripetal acceleration required for the space vehicle to move in a circular orbit.

By Newton's 2nd Law,

\(F_{g}=M_{sys}\,a\)

But

\(F_{g}=M_{sys}\,g\)

\(M_{sys},g=M_{sys}\,a\)

Therefore,

\(a=g\)

The space vehicle, the man and the weighing machine all have the same acceleration of \(g\).

Now consider forces acting only on the astronaut at position X in the orbit

By Newton's 2nd Law,

\(N\), Force on astronaut by weighing

\(mg-N=ma\)

where \(m\) is the mass of the astronaut and \(a\) is the acceleration of the astronaut.

However, from above, \(a=g\):

Therefore,

\(mg-N=mg\)

\(\Rightarrow\)\(N=0\)

Therefore, we see that the weighing balance does not exert a support force on the astronaut.

By Newton's 3rd Law, the astronaut does not exert a force on its support, the weighing machine. The reading indicated on the weighing machine is zero. The astronaut thus experiences the sensation of 'weightlessness'.

www.KiasuExamPaper.com
H2 Physics C1 2016

Hence, **an object is considered to be (apparently) weightless when it exerts no contact force on its support.** This happens when the object is accelerating with an acceleration of \(g\), e.g. an object in free fall or an object orbiting around the Earth.

### Gravitational Potential and Gravitational Potential Energy

#### 7.3.1 Gravitational Potential Energy

Consider a region of space in which a gravitational field, exerted by source \(\overline{\text{mass}}\)\(M\), is present.

Consider a mass \(m\) placed in this gravitational field. If we apply an external force to this mass to move it between two points, from A to B, without any changes in its kinetic energy. By conservation of energy, whatever work is done by the external force would be equal to the change in gravitational potential energy of the mass \(m\), i.e.

work done by an external force to move \(m\) from A to B in the gravitational field.

\[W=\Delta U_{AB}=U_{g}-U_{A}\]

where \(\Delta U_{AB}\) :Change in gravitational potential energy of the particle as it moves from A to B

\[U_{A}\] :Gravitational potential energy at A

\[U_{B}\] :Gravitational potential energy at B

Choosing point A to be at an infinite distance from \(M\), then the gravitational field strength due to \(M\) would be zero there. If we set the gravitational potential energy to be zero at that point (\(U_{A}=U_{g}=0\)), then

\[W=\Delta U_{AB}=U_{g}-U_{A}=U_{g}\]

i.e. the work done by an external force to move a mass \(m\) from A (at infinity) to a point B without a change in kinetic energy is the gravitational potential energy of the mass at B.

**Definition: Gravitational Potential Energy, \(U\)**

The gravitational potential energy of a mass at a point in a gravitational field is the work done by an external force in bringing that mass from infinity to that point, without any change in kinetic energy.

Following the definition, the gravitational potential energy \(U\) of a system of two point masses \(M\) and \(m\) separated by a distance,\(r\) is given by\(r\)\(GMm\)\(r\). It can be shown that

\[U=-G\frac{Min}{r}\]

#### 7.3.2 Gravitational Potential

Whenever a field is present in a region, we can always define a scalar property of the field at each point in the region. This property is called the _potential_ of the field. This _potential_ of a field is associated with the _potential energy per unit mass_ that a test mass will possess when it is placed at the point in the field.

**Definition: Gravitational Potential, \(\phi\)**

The **gravitational potential** at a point in a gravitational field is the work done per unit mass, by an external force, in bringing a small test mass from infinity to that point, without any change in kinetic energy.

**Notes:**

1. S.I. unit of gravitational potential \(\phi\) J kg\({}^{1}\).
2. The gravitational potential is a **scalar quantity**.
3. The gravitational potential at infinity is taken to be zero.

Comparing the definition of **gravitational potential, \(\phi\)** at a point in a gravitational field and **gravitational potential energy, \(U\)** of a mass, \(m\) placed at the same point in the gravitational field, we see that:

Together with the expression on p. 25: \(U=-G\dfrac{Mm}{r}\), we deduce:

**Gravitational Potential due to a Point Mass :**

The gravitational potential \(\phi\) at a point a distance \(r\) away from a source point mass \(M\) is given by:

**Note:**

1. The equation is also valid for any point outside masses of radial symmetry. This means that, for instance, we can assume the whole mass of the Earth to be concentrated at the Earth's centre. The gravitational potential _beyond the Earth's radius_ can then be calculated using the formula given above.

**Figure 1.** The gravitational potential at a point in the field is the work done per unit mass in bringing a test mass from infinity to that point.

Since the gravitational field is attractive and zero potential is at infinity, the gravitational potential is always negative.

### Appendix A: Gravitational Field due to a Uniform Spherical Shell6

Footnote 6: Proof of shell theorems requires techniques of integral calculus. If you are interested, refer to Resnick, Halifday and Krane.

(Adapted from Liehether, Martin. The Physics Teacher: Vol. 42. January 2004. âGravitational Field Due to a Sphere: A Geometrical Argument.â p5.)

From the statement of Newton's law of gravitation, we see that it applies only to point masses. This is a good approximation when the sizes of the objects are small compared to the distance between them, e.g. the Moon and the Earth.

Can Newton's law of gravitation be applied to an apple resting on the Earth's surface? From the point of view of the apple, the broad and level Earth, stretching out to the horizon beneath the apple, certainly does not look like a particle.

Newton solved this problem by using his law of universal gravitation and calculus to establish two theorems that apply to the gravitational force exerted by a thin spherical shell of uniform density.

**Shell Theorem 1:**

A uniform spherical shell of matter attracts a particle that is outside the shell as if all the shell's mass were concentrated at its centre.

**Shell Theorem 2:**

A uniform shell of matter exerts no net gravitational force on a particle located inside it.

Let us now examine each shell theorem in more detail:

**Shell Theorem 1:**

From Shell Theorem 1, we can see that any solid spherical object can be treated as many nested spherical thin shells with each of their centre of mass coinciding at the centre of the sphere.

The gravitational field at P due to each spherical shell is as if all the shell's mass were concentrated at the centre.

Since the centre of each spherical shell is common, the gravitational field at P, due to each shell, is directed towards the centre of the solid sphere.

Hence the magnitude of the resultant gravitational field at P can also be written as :

\(g=g_{t}+g_{2}+g_{3}+...+g_{N}\)

where \(g_{i}\): gravitational field strength due to the _ith_ shell.

However, \(g_{i}=G\frac{m_{i}}{r^{2}}\)

where \(m_{i}\): mass of the _ith_ shell.

Therefore, \(g=G\frac{m_{1}}{r^{2}}+G\frac{m_{2}}{r^{2}}+...+G\frac{m_{N}}{r^{2}}=\frac{G}{ r^{2}}(m_{1}+m_{2}+...+m_{N})\)

\(=\frac{G}{r^{2}}(\text{mass of the sphere})\)

We can also conclude that

A sphere of uniform composition attracts a particle that is outside the sphere as if the entire sphere's mass were concentrated at its centre.

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:174]

## Appendix B Variation of the Gravitational Field Strength above and below the Earth's Surface

Consider the Earth to be a non-rotating spherical planet of uniform density \(\rho\). Take the radius of the Earth to be \(r_{E}\); and the mass of the Earth to be \(m_{E}\).

To determine the variation of \(g\) with respect to the distance from the centre of the Earth \(r\); the following results (followed from Appendix A) are useful:

* The acceleration due to gravity outside a spherical body of uniform density is the same as if the entire mass of the body were concentrated at its centre.
* The acceleration due to gravity at all points inside a spherical shell of uniform density is zero.

With these results, we are able to obtain expressions for the acceleration due to gravity both above and below the Earth's surface.

**Gravitational Field Strength above the Earth's surface (\(r\geq r_{E}\))**

It follows from Result 1 that for \(r\geq r_{E}\), \(g=G\frac{m_{E}}{r^{2}}\); and at \(r=r_{E}\), \(g=G\frac{m_{E}}{r_{E}^{2}}\)

Since \(G\) and \(m_{E}\) are constants, \(g\propto\frac{1}{r^{2}}\).

**Gravitational Field Strength below the Earth's surface (\(r\leq r_{E}\))**7

Consider a point P below the Earth's surface and at a distance \(r\) away from the centre of the Earth.

* The gravitational field at P,
* \(g=g\) at P due to spherical shell A + \(g\) at P due to spherical mass B By Result 2,
* Gravitation field at P due to shell A = 0, and
* Gravitation field at P due to spherical mass B where \(M_{B}\) is the mass of the spherical mass BBut \(M_{B}=\rho_{\rho}\) (Volume of spherical mass B) = \(\rho(\frac{4\pi\rho^{3}}{3})\)

Hence the gravitational field at P (with \(r<\) radius of the Earth) is:

\[g\qquad\underset{\Xi\Xi}{=}\frac{G}{r^{2}}(\frac{4\pi\rho^{3}}{3}\rho_{\rm c})= \big{(}\frac{4\pi G\rho}{3}\big{)}r\]

Since \(\frac{4\pi G\rho}{3}\) is a constant, we see that for \(r<f_{\rm E}\), \(g\propto f\).

A sketch of \(g\) against \(r\) is shown in below.

## Appendix C Derivation of the Gravitational Potential Energy and Gravitational Potential

Consider a particle of mass \(m\) moving between two points A and B in the gravitational field exerted by another particle \(M\). To find an expression for the gravitational potential energy of this system, we need to first find the work done by an external force in moving the mass \(m\) between the two points without a change in kinetic energy of \(m\).

Suppose we set up the coordinate system as below.

By Newton's Law of Gravitation, the gravitational force8\(F_{g}\) acting on the mass \(m\) at a distance \(x\) away from \(M\),

Footnote 8: Note that is gravitational force is an internal force to the system of \(M\) and \(m\). To consider work done on \(m\), we must always treat \(M\) and \(m\) as a single system, as \(m\) only experiences a force due to the gravitational field exerted by \(M\).

\[\dot{F}_{g}=\dot{G}\frac{Mm}{x^{2}}\]

The negative sign here indicates that the gravitational force is pointing in the negative \(x\) direction.

For the kinetic energy of \(m\) to remain constant, we must move \(m\) at a **constant velocity** (acceleration = 0).

Therefore, the external force \(F_{ext}\) acting on \(m\) is opposite in direction and equal in magnitude to \(F_{g}\).

\[\Rightarrow\]

Since \(F_{ext}\) is not constant but varies with distance \(x\) away from \(M\), to find the work done by this external force from moving the test mass \(m\) between A and B,

\[W=\int\limits_{r_{A}}^{r_{A}}F_{ext}dx=\int\limits_{r_{A}}^{r_{A}}G\frac{Mm} {x^{2}}dx=GMm\left[-\frac{1}{x}\right]_{r_{A}}^{r_{A}}=-GMm\left[\frac{1}{r_{ B}}-\frac{1}{r_{A}}\right]\]

By conservation of energy, since there is no increase in the kinetic energy of the system,

\[W=\text{Change in gravitational potential energy of the system},\Delta U\]

\[\text{Therefore},\qquad W=\Delta\ U=U_{B}-U_{A}=-GMm\left[\frac{1}{r_{B}}- \frac{1}{r_{A}}\right]=\left[-G\frac{Mm}{r_{B}}\right]-\left[-G\frac{Mm}{r_{A }}\right]\]

Suppose we choose the reference point A for gravitational potential energy \(U\) to be zero at \(r_{A}=\infty\), i.e.

Then,

\[U_{B}-U_{A}=U_{B}=-G\frac{Mm}{r_{B}}\]

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:178]

## Appendix D Discovery of Neptune

In 1687, Sir Isaac Newton published Principia, which hypothesizes the inverse-square law of universal gravitation. In his own words, "I deduced that the forces which keep the planets in their orbs must be reciprocally as the squares of their distances from the centres about which they revolve; and thereby compared the force requisite to keep the Moon in her or with the force of gravity at the surface of the Earth; and found them answer pretty nearly."

Newton's theory enjoyed its greatest success when it was used to predict the existence of Neptune based on motions of Uranus that could not be accounted by the actions of the other planets. We illustrate the situation schematically in the diagram on the right. The dominant interaction between Uranus and the Sun is indicated with the heavy line, but some perturbations associated with other masses are indicated by thin lines. Calculations by John Couch Adams and Urbain Le Verrier both predicted the general position of the new planet, and Le Verrier's calculations are what led Johann Gottfried Galle to the discovery of Neptune in 1846 within hours of turning his telescope on the region of the sky implicated by the calculations.

Years later, it was another discrepancy in a planet's orbit that showed Newton's theory to be inaccurate. By the end of the 19th century, it was known that the orbit of Mercury could not be accounted for entirely under Newtonian gravity, and all searches for another perturbing body (such as a planet orbiting the Sun even closer than Mercury) have been fruitless. This issue was resolved in 1915 by Albert Einstein's new general theory of relativity, which accounted for the discrepancy in Mercury's orbit.

Although Newton's theory has been superseded, most modern non-relativistic gravitational calculations still use it because it is much easier to work with and is sufficiently accurate for most applications.

### Introduction

Oscillations occur when a system is disturbed from a position of stable equilibrium. This displacement from equilibrium changes periodically over time. Thus, oscillations are said to be periodic and display periodic motion. Oscillations are very common in everyday life with familiar examples such as the motion of a clock pendulum or the vibrations of strings on musical instruments. Even atoms in a lattice vibrate. Oscillations are also important in many mechanical systems in the real world such as car suspension. It is thus very important to be able to understand these mechanical systems in order to control them in critical situations.

What is a periodic motion?

* _Periodic motion_ refers to any motion that repeats itself at equal intervals of time.

Example 8.1: Periodic Motion

Which of the following cases are periodic oscillations?

\[\begin{array}{c}\end{array}\]

### Simple Harmonic Motion

For this topic, we are interested in **periodic oscillations** - in which an object moves about a fixed point such that the time it takes to complete one to-and-fro motion is the same.

One of the simplest oscillations we shall concern ourselves with is known as the **simple harmonic motion (SHM)**. Common examples of SHM include oscillations of a **simple pendulum** and a **spring-mass system** (assuming no loss of energy, so that the oscillations go on forever).

SHM provides a basis for the characterization of more complicated motions.

Let us take a closer look at a spring-mass system and learn the terms that describe the motion.

To study the motion we can attach a pen to the mass in such a way that it tracks the motion on a long vertical sheet of graph paper that is pulled to the left at a constant rate behind the system. This produces a trace on the graph paper which shows us how the displacement of the mass from its equilibrium position changes with time.

Figure 8.4: Tracking the oscillation of a vertical spring-mass system

#### 8.1.1 Terms used to describe SHM (with reference to Fig 8.4)

\begin{tabular}{|p{142.3pt}|p{142.3pt}|} \hline Terms & \multicolumn{1}{c|}{**Definitions**} \\ \hline Equilibrium: (\(x=0\)) & We often measure the displacement of the oscillator from the equilibrium position. Hence, the displacement \(x=0\) is designated at the equilibrium, i.e., the position at which the net force on the oscillator is zero. \\ \hline _Displacement, \(x\)_ & The displacement \(x\) is the linear distance of the oscillator from its equilibrium position (\(x\) = 0) in a specified direction. \\  & It is a vector; the + / - sign tells the direction of displacement from equilibrium. \\  & If you set the direction for displacement above equilibrium to be positive, then displacement below the equilibrium would be negative. \\ \hline _Amplitude, \(x_{o}\)_ & It is the magnitude of the maximum displacement of the oscillator from the equilibrium position. It is a scalar. \\ \hline _Period, T_ & It is the time taken for an oscillator to make one complete cycle of oscillation. \\  & S.l. unit: second. \\ \hline _Frequency, f_ & It is the number of cycles made by the oscillator per unit time: \\  & \(f\) = \(\frac{I}{T}\). \\  & S.l. unit: hertz (Hz). 1 Hz = 1 s\({}^{\dagger}\). \\ \hline _Angular frequency, \(\omega\)_ & It is the rate of change of the _phase angle_ with respect to time: \(\omega=\frac{d\theta}{dt}\) \\  & Since frequency is a fixed value for an SHM oscillator, and a complete cycle of oscillation is represented by a phase angle of 2\(\pi\) rad, \\  & \(\omega=\frac{2\pi}{T}\) = 2\(\pi f\) \\  & S.l. unit: rad s\({}^{\ast}\). \\  & Note: this is also the familiar equation that we encountered in circular motion where \(\omega\) is the angular velocity of an object moving in a circle. \\ \hline \end{tabular}

#### 8.1.2 SHM - Displacement-time (x-f) relationship

From Fig. 8.4, we see that the variation of the oscillations of a vertical spring-mass system follows a _sinusoidal_ pattern. All SHMs follow a sinusoidal motion.

Consider the spring-mass system in Fig. 8.4. Suppose at \(\hat{t}=0\), the mass is at equilibrium (\(x=0\)) and will next move in the positive direction, the displacement-time graph of the oscillatory system will look like:

From the graph, we can see that the relationship between \(x\) and \(\hat{t}\) is given by

\[x=x_{o}\sin\alpha\hat{t}\]

where \(\alpha=\frac{2\pi}{T}\) is the angular frequency and \(x_{o}\) is the amplitude of the oscillation.

Depending on the initial condition, i.e., when you start the timing, there are also other possible solutions. The following table lists some other possible solutions.

\({}^{1}\) Sinusoidal is used to describe the shape of any sine or cosine curve regardless of whether it is shifted by some arbitrary horizontal amount.

Figure 8.5: A possible displacement-time graph of a simple harmonic oscillator

#### 8.1.3 SHM - Velocity-time (v-f) relationship and acceleration-time (a-f) relationship

From the topic of kinematics, we know that from the displacement-time relationship of an object, we can obtain its corresponding velocity-time and acceleration-time relationship by differentiating the equations or analysing the gradients of the tangents at the various points on the graphs accordingly (see Fig. 8.6).

We can similarly do so for SHM.

The table below illustrates two examples.

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:187]

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:188]

### SHM of Spring-mass System Explained using Dynamics

Let us consider the oscillation of a mass oscillating at the end of a horizontal spring. Ideally, the mass of the spring is negligible, the mass slides without friction (undamped) on the horizontal surface and the spring obeys Hooke's Law. O is the equilibrium position, where the spring is unstretched.

Let us look at how the restoring force of the spring on the mass varies with displacement \(x\):

(a) when \(x\) is stretched to the right, the resultant restoring force is towards the left.

(b) when \(x\) is zero (unstretched), the resultant restoring force is zero.

(c) When \(x\) is compressed to the left, the resultant restoring force is towards the right.

Hence, we see that

1. the resultant restoring force is always towards the equilibrium position.
2. The direction of this resultant force is always opposite to that of its displacement at all points, except at equilibrium position, where \(a=x=0\).
3. According to Hooke's Law, \(F=-k\alpha\), where \(k\) is the spring constant. The restoring force, \(F_{i}\) is proportional to the displacement, \(x\), but directed opposite to it (as indicated by the negative sign).

By Newton's \(2^{nd}\,\mathrm{Law}_{,}\)\(F_{net}\)\(=ma\)

Since \(F_{net}\) is provided by the restoring force of the spring,

\(ma\)\(=-k\alpha\)

\(a\)\(=-\dfrac{k}{m}x\)

Hence, the acceleration is

\(\circ\) opposite in direction to the displacement and

\(\circ\) proportional to the displacement, with proportionality constant -k/m.

which is the definition of SHMI in short, for mechanical oscillation to be possible, there must be a restoring force opposite to the displacement.

www.KiasuExamPaper.com

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:190]

#### 8.1.5 Simple Harmonic Motion: velocity-displacement (v-x) relationship

The velocity-displacement (v-x) relationship for SHM is given by

\[\nu=\pm\omega\sqrt{\left(\chi_{\circ}^{2}-x^{2}\right)}\]

**Note:**

1. The equation is provided in the A-level Physics formulae list. It is applicable whichever position the oscillation starts from.
2. The \({}^{*}\pm\) sign implies that the body in SHM always passes through each position back and forth with the same speed.
3. At the amplitude positions, \(\nu=0\). At the equilibrium position (\(\chi=0\)), the speed is maximum, \(\nu_{\circ}=\omega\nu_{\circ}\).
4. The \(\nu\)-x graph is an ellipse as shown.

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:192]

### Relationship between Simple Harmonic Motion and Uniform Circular Motion

The experimental setup below illustrates how SHM is closely associated with circular motion. As the peg rotates on the turntable with constant angular velocity\(\alpha\), its shadow on the screen moves back and forth in SHM.

### Some observations

1. The motion is symmetrical about the fixed point, O' on the screen.
2. The time taken to complete one oscillation (period) is the same as the time taken to complete one cycle. Thus frequency of SHM = frequency of the circular motion.
3. The distance from the fixed point O' to the extremity (amplitude) is equal to the radius of the circle.
4. When the peg is shifted nearer to the centre of the turntable, the amplitude of the SHM decreases, but the period or frequency remains unchanged.
5. The shadow reaches maximum speed as it passes O' and is momentarily at rest at the extreme positions.
6. Variation of displacement of peg shadow with time

Figure 19: A typical SHM displacement-time equation.

#### Phase & Phase Difference

In SHM, the angle \(\phi\) is called the phase (angle) of oscillation, analogous to the angular displacement in circular motion.

Thus the angular frequency \(\omega\) in simple harmonic motion is interpreted as the rate of change of phase angle of a simple harmonic oscillation.

The idea of phase is useful for comparing two oscillators of the same frequency (and therefore period) that are not moving in step with each other due to a delay or advance at the start of the oscillations with respect to each other.

1. The difference in phase between two oscillations is called **phase difference \(\Delta\phi\)**.
2. Two oscillations are said to be _in phase_ when they are in step, i.e., they reach their respective maximum displacements in the same direction at the same time. It does not matter what their respective amplitudes are.
3. Two oscillations are said to be **in anti-phase** when they are completely out of step, i.e., one oscillation reaches maximum displacement in a given direction at the same instant as the other oscillation reaches maximum displacement in the opposite direction.
4. Of course the two oscillations may not be in phase or in anti-phase but at some intermediate phase difference. In such a case, the phase difference can be calculated by the following: \(\Delta\phi=\frac{\Delta t}{T}\times 2\pi\).

4. Of course the two oscillations may not be in phase or in anti-phase but at some intermediate phase difference. In such a case, the phase difference can be calculated by the following: \(\Delta\phi=\frac{\Delta t}{T}\times 2\pi\).

#### 8.3.2 Variation of Energy with time graphs for a simple harmonic oscillator

The energy-time graphs depend on how the oscillation is started (initial conditions).

Again, without the actual equations, the shapes of the energy-time graphs can be deduced by observing a swinging pendulum or oscillating mass-spring.

Consider an oscillator started at its equilibrium position (\(t=0\), \(x=0\), \(v=v_{o}\)).

\(\Rightarrow\)\(x=x_{o}\sin(\alpha t)\) and \(v=v_{o}\cos(\alpha t)\),

**Note:**

(1) When the oscillatory motion has completed one cycle in one period, both kinetic and potential energies have gone through two cycles.

(2) **Variation of total energy \(E_{F}\) with time \(t\) :**

\(\circ\) Total energy is constant. \(\Rightarrow\) Graph is constant at \(E_{F}=\frac{1}{2}m\omega^{2}{x_{o}}^{2}\)

(3) **Variation of kinetic energy \(E_{K}\) with time \(t\) :**

\(\circ\)\(E_{K}=\frac{1}{2}m^{2}=(\frac{1}{2}m{x_{o}}^{2}\omega^{2})\cos^{2}\alpha t\)

\(\Rightarrow\) Graph is a \(\cos^{2}\) graph (it follows the shape of the \(v^{2}t\) graph).

(4) **Variation of potential energy \(E_{P}\) with time \(t\) :**

\(\circ\)\(E_{P}=\frac{1}{2}m^{2}x^{2}=(\frac{1}{2}m\omega^{2}{x_{o}}^{2})\sin^{2}\alpha\)

\(\Rightarrow\) Graph is a \(\sin^{2}\) graph (it follows the shape of the \(x^{2}t\) graph).

### Damped Oscillations, Forced Oscillations and Resonance

#### 8.4.1 Free oscillations

When a system is disturbed from its equilibrium position, such that it oscillates about this position with no resistive forces acting, the oscillation is said to be a **free oscillation**.

The frequency at which it oscillates is known as the **natural frequency** of the system. This frequency is characteristic of the system:

The simple harmonic motions that we have seen so far for the pendulum and spring-mass systems are ideal free oscillations in which no friction or any forms of resistance to motion exist. The oscillations would in theory continue forever.

#### 8.4.2 Damped oscillations

In an ideal oscillating system, there is no friction and the total mechanical energy is constant. The system in simple harmonic motion continues forever, with no decrease in amplitude.

Real-world systems experience inevitable friction and the mechanical energy of oscillations decreases with time due to the work done against friction. For instance, a simple pendulum gradually decreases in amplitude and stops eventually due to air resistance and friction at the support.

The progressive decrease in amplitude of any oscillatory motion caused by dissipative forces is called _damping_. Such an oscillatory motion is known as a _damped oscillation_. Due to damping, pendulum clocks require energy (wound up spring or batteries) to replenish energy loss in order for their amplitude to remain constant.

There are situations in which damping is introduced to reduce the amplitude of oscillation or bring the oscillation to rest.

**Commonly used damping methods:**

(a) Using air resistance, e.g., to bring an oscillating spring-mass system to rest faster, attach a piece of cardboard of negligible mass but large surface area to the base of the mass. The increase in air resistance increases damping during the oscillation.

(b) Using fluid viscosity, e.g., damping can be increased by submersing the mass of a spring-mass system in a fluid that is more viscous than air, such as oil.

(c) Using eddy currents, e.g., when a copper plate swinging freely passes through a magnetic field, eddy currents induced in the plate will oppose the motion and bring the plate to a stop (further discussed in Electromagnetic Induction in year 2).

### Extent of damping

Damping changes the behaviour of SHM systems.

(1) _Light Damping (underdamped system)_

In a lightly damped system, the total energy of the system decreases with time as energy is dissipated when the system oscillates against resistive forces.

The amplitude of the system decreases **exponentially with time**.

(2) _Critical Damping (critically damped system)_

If we are able to gradually increase the resistive force acting on an oscillatory system, damping increases till a point such that when displaced, the system **returns to the equilibrium position in the shortest possible time without oscillating** at all. The system is said to be **critically damped**.

Critical damping is deliberately introduced into some systems to prevent continuous oscillations. For example, in analogue instruments such as balances, ammeters and voltmeters, the pointer is critically damped so that it stops in the shortest possible time to indicate the reading, instead of oscillating about the reading (underdamped) or take an unnecessarily long time to crawt to the reading (overdamped).

Critical damping is also employed in car suspension systems to ensure a smooth ride when the car moves on a bumpy road. The shock absorbers in the suspension system have hydraulic pistons to prevent the car from bouncing up and down excessively after hitting a bump. The damping of a car can be tested by pushing down the car with your weight and then releasing it; the car should rapidly return to its normal height with negligible overshoot.

(3) _A shock absorber consists of a piston oscilating in a chamber filled with oil. As the piston oscilates, the oil is squeezed through holes between the piston and the chamber, causing a damping of the piston's oscillations._

One type of car suspension system, in which a shock absorber is placed inside a coiled spring at each wheel.

_(3)_ _Heavy Damping_ (_overdamped system_)

When the damping force is increased beyond the point of critical damping, we say that the system is **overdamped** or that it experiences heavy damping. Once displaced from equilibrium, the oscillator takes a very long time to return to its equilibrium position.

An example would be of certain doors which are so heavily damped that they take forever to close.

#### 8.4.3 Forced oscillations and resonance

##### Forced oscillations

As mentioned earlier, most real systems will experience some form of damping and will eventually stop oscillating. To keep them oscillating, one needs to periodically put in energy to the systems to make up for the energy lost. In other words, one needs to apply a periodic force to the systems.

An oscillation under the influence of an external periodic force is called a _forced oscillation_.

The external force that is used to sustain (or drive) the oscillations is known as the **driving force**.

The frequency with which the periodic force is applied is called the **forced frequency** or **driver frequency**.

One example of forced oscillation is pushing a child on a swing at the playground; one needs to continually give the swing a push at the right moment to sustain its oscillation.

##### Resonance

Consider the above example of a child on a swing. We have mentioned that because of damping, the oscillations will eventually die off. However, we can sustain the oscillations by periodically applying a driving force.

If the frequency of the driving force matches the natural frequency of the oscillatory motion of the child-swing system, an interesting phenomenon happens - the final amplitude of the oscillation would be the greatest compared to the amplitudes of oscillation for other frequencies of driving force. This phenomenon is known as _resonance_.

_Resonance_ is a phenomenon in which an oscillatory system responds with maximum amplitude to an external periodic driving force, when the frequency of the driving force (driver frequency) equals the natural frequency of the driven system.

##### Note:

(1) The frequency at which resonance occurs is known as the **resonant frequency**.

(2) Under ideal conditions, i.e., if no resistive forces are present (there is no damping), the amplitude will build up to an infinitely large value.

(3) However, in real cases, damping occurs. So, whilst putting energy into the system in each cycle, energy is also taken away by camping and the amplitude will not build to infinity.

(4) Resonance represents the point where the (driving) energy is transferred most efficiently into the oscillatory system.

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:202]

4. For each frequency of vibration, we can then measure and record the amplitude of vibration of the spring-mass system. We start off with a driving frequency that is much lower than the natural frequency of the spring-mass system and slowly increase this frequency till beyond the natural frequency.
5. The graph above shows the typical results obtained from the experiment for one area of card.
6. The experiment is then repeated for different areas of cards - to produce different amounts of damping.
7. The data points for each area can then be plotted on the same pair of axes for comparison.

The figure below shows the amplitude vs. driving frequency graphs that will be obtained.

**Note:**

1. The amplitude of a lightly damped system is very large at resonance and the peak is sharp. The amplitude drops off rapidly when the driver frequency differs from the natural frequency of the system.
2. When the driver frequency approaches zero, the amplitude of the forced oscillations will be the same as the amplitude of the driver.
3. As the system experiences greater damping, \(\circ\) the amplitude of the oscillation decreases. \(\circ\) the resonance peak becomes **broader**. \(\circ\) the resonance peak shifts slightly to the **left** to a slightly lower value of frequency.

From the graphs, it is evident that damping is a useful way to reduce the effects of resonance. Another way to avoid resonance is to ensure that the frequency of the periodic external force differs from the natural frequency of the driven system.

#### Examples of Destructive and Useful Resonance

Resonance is an important physical phenomenon that can appear in many different situations.

#### Examples of destructive resonance

1. [label=0]
2. **Collapse of buildings in earthquakes** An earthquake consists of many low-frequency vibrations ranging from 1 to 10 Hz. During an earthquake, when the frequencies of the vibration match the natural frequencies of buildings, resonance may occur and result in serious damages. That also explains why some buildings collapse while others stand almost unaffected. In regions of the world where earthquakes happen regularly, buildings may be built on foundations that absorb the energy of the shock waves. In this way, the vibrations are damped and the amplitude of the oscillations cannot reach a dangerous level.
3. **Sittering glass with voice** When an opera singer projects a high-pitched note whose frequency matches the natural frequency of a wine glass, the resonance may cause the glass to vibrate at so large an amplitude that it breaks.
4. **Violent vibrations in vehicles and machines** If the panel in a bus ratties violently when the bus is travelling at a certain speed, it is likely that a resonant vibration is occuring. A washing machine with a load which has natural frequency matching the spinning frequency will get violent vibrations as resonance occurs.

#### Examples of useful resonance

1. **Radio receptions** Resonance not only occurs in mechanical oscillations but also in electric circuits. A radio receiver works on the principle of resonance. Our air is filled with radio waves of many different frequencies which the aerial picks up. The tuner can be adjusted so that the frequency of the electrical oscillations in the circuits is the same as that of the radio wave transmitted from a particular station we desire. The effect of resonance amplifies the signals contained in this wave while the radio waves of other frequencies are diminished.
2. **Microwave cooking** In a microwave oven, microwaves with a frequency similar to the natural vibration frequency of water molecules are used. When food containing water molecules is placed in the oven and radiated by microwave, the water molecules resonate absorb energy from the microwaves and get heated up. This absorbed energy then spreads through the food and cooks/ft. The plastic or glass containers do not heat up as much since they do not contain water molecules.
3. **Magnetic Resonance Imaging** Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is increasingly used in medical diagnosis to produce images similar to those produced by X-rays. Strong, electromagnetic fields of varying radio frequencies are used to cause oscillations in atomic nuclei. When resonance occurs, energy is absorbed by the molecules. By analysing the pattern of energy absorption, a computer-generated image can be produced. The advantage of MRI scanners is that no ionising radiation (as in the process of producing X-ray images) is involved.

## Appendix 1 Period of a Simple Pendulum

Restoring Force \(F=-mg\sin\theta\)

(-ve sign as it is in the opposite direction to the displacement)

Arc length \(\chi=L\theta\)

\(\Rightarrow\)

\(\theta=\kappa L\)

When the angular displacement \(\theta\) is small,

\(\sin\theta\approx\theta\)

\(F=-mg\sin\theta\approx-mg\frac{\chi}{L}\)

From Newton's 2nd law. \(ma=-mg\frac{\chi}{L}\)

\(\Rightarrow\)

\(\alpha=-\left(\frac{g}{L}\right)\chi\)

i.e., \(a=-a\overset{\chi}{\alpha}\chi\)

where \(a\overset{\chi}{\alpha}=\frac{g}{L}\)

Hence, motion of a simple pendulum bob attached to a light inextensible string oscilating with a small angular displacement of - \(10^{o}\) or smaller is, to a good approximation, a linear SHM with period, \(T\), given by

\(T=\frac{2\pi}{\omega}=2\pi\sqrt{\frac{L}{g}}\)

**Note:**

1) Other assumptions made are that the string is massless, the radius of the bob is small compared with the length of the string and air resistance is negligible.

2) The period \(T\) is independent of the amplitude of the oscillation.

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:207]

## Appendix 3 Equations of motion for damped simple harmonic oscillations

In an oscillatory system, the decrease in amplitude caused by dissipative forces is called damping and the corresponding motion is called damped oscilation. The simplest case to analyse is a simple harmonic oscillator under damping, where its dissipative force is directly proportional to its velocity. Its behaviour occurs in friction involving the flow of viscous fluid, such as in shock absorbers or sliding between oil-Iubricated surfaces. The additional force on the body due to viscous drag is \(f=-bv,\) where \(b\) is a constant.

With a viscous drag, the net force on the body is \((-kx-\bar{bv}).\)

Applying Newton's \(2^{\mathrm{nd}}\) second law,

\[m\frac{\bar{d}^{2}x}{\bar{d}^{2}}=-kx-bv\] \[m\frac{\bar{d}^{2}x}{\bar{d}^{2}}+b\frac{\bar{d}x}{\bar{d}t}+kx =0\]

This is a second order linear differential equation with constant coefficients.

If \(\bar{b}<2\sqrt{km},\) the system is under light damping and the equation of motion is

\[x=\left(x_{\bar{q}}e^{\left(\frac{k}{2m}\right)}\right)\left[\cos\left(\left( \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}-\frac{b^{2}}{4m^{2}}}\right)+\phi\right)\right.\]

Its amplitude \((x_{\bar{u}}e^{\left(\frac{k}{2m}\right)})\) is not a constant, but decreases with time because of the decaying exponential factor. In addition, the larger the value of \(b,\) the faster the decrease in the amplitude.

Its angular frequency\(\omega=\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}-\frac{b^{2}}{4m^{2}}},\) is smaller than that without damping, \(\omega=\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}},\) and therefore the period is slightly larger.

If \(\bar{b}=2\sqrt{km},\) then \(x=x_{0}e^{-\left(\frac{b}{2m}\right)}.\) The system is in critical damping, where it no longer oscillates but returns to its equilibrium position without overshooting the equilibrium position.

If \(\bar{b}>2\sqrt{km},\) then the system is heavily damped. Again, there is no oscillation, but the return to its equilibrium takes longer than in the case of critical damping. Its solutions are in the form of \(x=C_{1}e^{-\omega}+C_{2}e^{-\omega t},\) where \(C_{1}\) and \(C_{2}\) are constants determined by initial conditions and \(a_{1}\) and \(a_{2}\) are constants determined by \(m,k\) and \(b\).

## Appendix 4 Demonstration of Forced Oscillation and Resonance - Barton's pendulums

Barton's pendulums consist of several pendulums of different lengths hung from a horizontal string. Each has its own natural frequency of oscillation. The 'driver' pendulum at the end has a large mass and its length is equal to that of pendulum R. When the driver is set swinging, its vibrations are transferred through the common support string to the other pendulums and start the forced oscillations.

Observations show that:

1. All the pendulums vibrate with the same frequency as the driver:
2. Pendulum R whose length matches that of the driver pendulum (therefore has the same natural frequency as the driver) has the largest amplitude. It is said to be resonating with the driver:

**Explanation:**

All the pendulums are coupled together by the suspension. As the driver swings, it moves the suspension, which in turn moves the other pendulums. The matching pendulum is being pushed slightly once each oscillation, and the amplitude gradually builds up to maximum. The other pendulums are being pushed at a frequency that does not match their natural frequency and they therefore oscillate with smaller amplitudes.

### Introduction

So far in our study of Physics, we have been focusing very much on particle systems (i.e. a bulk concentration of mass). However, the concept of waves is another important concept in Physics.

#### So, what is a wave?

Consider a rope that is held under tension. If we give the left of the rope a small wiggle, the wiggle (which we call the waveform) will travel along the length of the rope. (Fig. 9.1.1)

When the waveform travels down the rope, **there is transfer of energy and momentum**, however each section of the rope only vibrates up and down about an equilibrium position, but no section of the rope actually travels from one end to the other.

#### Hence,

A wave is **disturbance (or perturbation)** that is able to **transmit energy or momentum** from a source to its surroundings. However, points in the system that carry the wave do not actually move from the source through the region the wave moves through.

### Different Classifications of Waves

Waves can be categorised by three broad properties (Fig. 9.2.1):

(i): the nature of the wave,

(ii): mode of vibration of the points on the wave, and

(iii): the motion of the wave.

* **Matter Waves** will be discussed in the topic of quantum physics.

www.KiasuExamPaper.com* **In a longitudinal wave, the regions in which the points or particles are closest together are known as regions of "compression". The regions in which the point or particles are farthest apart are known as regions of "rarefaction".**

**Note:**

* **Longitudinal waves cannot be polarised but transverse waves can be polarised.2**

Footnote 2: We will talk more about polarisation later in the chapter.

Not all waves can be classified distinctively as transverse or longitudinal wave. Some waves such as seismic waves and surface water wave exhibit both transverse and longitudinal displacements.

* **Longitudinal waves cannot be polarised but transverse waves can be polarised.**2**

Footnote 2: We will talk more about polarisation later in the chapter.

Not all waves can be classified distinctively as transverse or longitudinal wave. Some waves such as seismic waves and surface water wave exhibit both transverse and longitudinal displacements.

Figure 9.2.4: Transverse Wave Pulse

Figure 9.2.7: A longitudinal wave train on a slinky. The direction of oscillation of a point on longitudinal is parallel to the direction of the wave travel and energy transport.

* **Stationary waves** are also known as _standing waves_.3 Footnote 3: We will further elaborate on stationary waves and its applications in music when we have covered Principle of Superposition for waves in the next chapter.
* A stationary wave is actually formed by the overlapping of 2 progressive waves having the same amplitude, same frequency and travelling in the same speed but moving in opposite directions in the same region of space at the same time.
* For a stationary wave, there seems to be no progression of the wave profile in either directions (Fig. 9.2.8) and there are points on the wave (known as nodes, N) which are permanently at rest.
* As there is no progression of the waveform, there is no transfer of energy. Energy is said to be trapped in the waves and does not propagate. The energy is said to be _localised_.

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:217]

We will use a transverse sinusoidal wave setup on the string to illustrate some basic terminology used in waves.

Suppose we set the free end of a string in simple harmonic motion. A transverse wave will be set up along the string and propagate down the string.

**Displacement (y) :**

The displacement of a particular point on the wave refers to the **distance and the direction** of the point from its equilibrium position.

Before the wave is setup, the rope lies along the x-axis. When the wave is setup in the rope, some points on the rope are being displaced from their equilibrium positions.

Points P and Q are displaced at a distance of \(y_{t}\) from their equilibrium position in the positive direction (as defined by the _y-axis_). Hence, their displacements are both \(y=+y_{t}\).

Point U is displaced at a distance of \(y_{o}\) from its equilibrium position in the negative direction. Hence its displacement is \(y=-y_{o}\).

**Amplitude (A or \(y_{o}\)) :**

The amplitude of a wave is the magnitude of the maximum displacement of a point on the wave.

(Fig. 9.3.4). Points S, T and U are at the amplitudes of the wave.

Note: Amplitude is always positive.

**Wavelength (\(\lambda\)) :**

The wavelength of a wave is the distance between two adjacent points which are oscillating in phase.5

Footnote 5: This refers to two points in the same state of oscillation. The concept of phase associated with oscillations will be dealt with further down the chapter.

**Note:**

For a transverse wave, the distance between 2 successive crests or 2 successive troughs correspond to a single wavelength.

For a longitudinal wave, the distance between 2 successive compressions or rarefactions also corresponds to a single wavelength.

Figure 9.3.4: A sinusoidal wave setup on rope. The figure shows a snapshot of the wave on the rope at an instant of time.

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:219]

**Wavefronts:**

* The **wavefront** (of a 2-dimensional or 3-dimensional wave) is an imaginary line or curve which joins points on the wave which are oscillating in phase.
* Therefore, _all points on a wavefront are at the same part of the cycle_ of their vibration.
* By convention, when we represent waves in a diagram, the _distance between consecutive wavefronts is one wavelength apart_.
* The direction of propagation of the waves perpendicular to the direction of travel of the wave and are indicated by arrows (\(\rightarrow\)) known as _rays_.

**Wave Speed, v:**

The speed of a wave is the distance that the wave profile appears to be moving per unit time.

**Note:**

There are actually two motions associated with waves.

* One's that of the motion associated with the oscillation of the individual points on the wave, the points always oscillate about the equilibrium position.
* The other is that of the _motion_ associated with the propagation of waveform of the wave. This is the one that defines the wave speed:

### Graphical Representation of Waves

Consider a transverse water wave travelling from left to right as shown in the diagram below.

As the wave moves through this region of space, we note the following:

* At a particular instant of time, the _displacement of each point on the wave varies with the distance it is located from the source_.
* For a particular point on the wave e.g. at \(\mathbf{P}\), the _displacement of the point also varies with time_.

Therefore, to completely represent the wave, we need 2 graphs:

**1**: **Graph of displacement (\(y\)) vs. the position (\(x\))** of the points on a wave (at a particular instant of time.)

Fix time \(t\)\(\Rightarrow\) Graph of \(y\) vs. \(x\):
**2**: **Graph of displacement (\(y\)) varies with time (\(t\)) for a particular point** (at a particular equilibrium position).

Fix position \(x\)\(\Rightarrow\) Graph of \(y\) vs. \(t\).

**Graph of Displacement (\(y\)) vs. Position (\(x\))**

Consider a snapshot of a wave on a rope. (Fig. 9.4.2) By superimposing a pair of \(x\) and \(y\) axes on the snapshot, we can describe how the displacement of each point on the rope varies with position.

This graph of displacement vs. position at a particular instant of time (\(y\) vs. \(x\)) gives the **wave profile at an instant of time**.

Figure 9.4.2: Displacement-position graph of a wave on a rope.

Figure 9.4.1: A progressive transverse wave moving towards the right.

**Example 9.4.1**: **: Displacement-Position Graph for a Longitudinal Wave**

A displacement-position graph can also be drawn for a longitudinal wave. Consider the following displacement-position graph for the air molecules along a line when a sound wave passes through a region of space.

(i) Complete the corresponding snapshot of the longitudinal wave that is represented by the \(y\)-\(x\) graph. (i.e. indicate the positions of the air molecules). Take displacement to the right to be positive.

Sketch the corresponding pressure variation of this region.

www.KiasuExamPaper.comConsider a point P on a rope. As a wave propagates through the rope (Fig. 9.4.3), the displacement of this point varies sinusoidally with respect to time (as shown in Fig. 9.4.4).

### Phase and Phase Difference

We have constantly referred to the term "_phase_" in both our study of simple harmonic motion and waves, however we have not formally introduced it. For this section, we will introduce _phase_ by first revisiting simple harmonic motion. Then we will look at the concept of phase with respect to describing wave motion.

#### 9.5.1 Concept of Phase and Phase Difference in Oscillation

When an object is oscillating simple harmonically, the displacement \(x\) of the object from its equilibrium position varies sinusoidally with time \(t\). One of the equations that describe this displacement is:

\[x=x_{o}\sin\alpha t\]

where \(x_{o}\) is the amplitude of oscillation and \(\omega\) is the angular frequency of the oscillation

Representing this graphically we have:

Comparing the two graphs, we note the following

* **one cycle of the oscillation (period of 7) corresponds to an angle of \(\phi=360^{\circ}\) or \(2\pi\) in radians**.
* **2 points of oscillation at an arbitrary time interval of \(\Delta t\) apart would correspond to an angle difference \(\Delta\phi\) apart.**

Hence, we can further write the following:

\[T=2\pi\qquad\text{ and }\quad\Delta t\ =\Delta\phi\]

\[\frac{\Delta t}{T}=\frac{\Delta\phi}{2\pi}\]

\(\phi\) is known as the **phase (angle)** associated with the _state of oscillation_ of the particle at a particular \(t\).
* \(\Delta\phi\) is known as the **phase difference** between the 2 states of oscillation of the particle separated by a time interval of \(\Delta t\).

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:228]

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:229]

#### Phase difference between Two Waves

We can also compare _the phase between two waves_ by comparing the oscillations of every point on a wave at a particular instant.

Consider two waves \(P\) and \(Q\) having the same wavelength and velocity moving towards the right as shown in the diagram below.

_Notice that the Wave \(P\) always leads Wave \(Q\) by a constant distance of \(Ax\). If the wave \(Q\) shifts a distance towards the right by \(Ax\) then every point on Wave Q will be in the same phase of oscillation on points on wave \(P\) at this moment._

Therefore, we say that

* _Wave Q lags Wave \(P\) by a phase difference of \(\Delta\phi\), and_
* _the phase difference between the two waves is \(\Delta\phi\) can be found from : \(\frac{\Delta x}{\lambda}\!=\!\frac{\Delta\phi}{2\pi}\)_

**Note :**

* _The two waves are said to be in phase if every point on Wave \(P\) is at the same state of oscillation as the corresponding point of the same position in Wave \(Q\) at the same time._
* _Notice that when the 2 waves are in phase, their "crests"will correspond and their "troughs"will also correspond. The 2 waveforms overlap._
* _When the phase difference between the 2 waves are \(\Delta\phi\) = \(\pi\), \(3\pi\), \(5\pi\),...., we say that the two waves are in antiphase._
* _When the 2 waves are in antiphase, every particle in Wave \(P\) is in antiphase with the corresponding point._
* _Note that the waveforms seem like a reflection of one another._

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:231]

### Energy Transmitted by a Wave

As a wave propagates, it transports energy from one place to another. Consider a sinusoidal wave moving through a string shown in Fig. 9.6.1, the source of energy is some external agent at the end of the string which does work in producing the oscillations.

As the external agent performs work on the string, it transfers energy to the string in the form of kinetic energy and (elastic) potential energy to each part of the string.

From Chapter 8 Oscillations, we know that the total energy \(E\) of a simple harmonic oscillator is given by \(E=\frac{1}{2}m\omega^{2}\dot{A}^{2}\). Since every part of the string is in simple harmonic motion

**Energy transmitted by a wave to a point is proportional to the square of the amplitude of the oscillator at that point.**

Energy \(\propto\) (Amplitude)\({}^{2}\)

**Intensity of a Wave**

Waves on a string carry energy in one dimension of space (along the direction of the string). But most of the waves that we commonly encounter like the sound waves in air and seismic waves in the body of the earth carry energy along all three dimensions of space. As the wave spreads out in space, the power received per unit area along the path of the wave diminishes as the distance from the source of the wave increases.

**Power of a Wave**:

The amount of energy transported per unit time by a wave is called the _power_ of a wave.

The SI unit is joules per second (J s\({}^{\prime}\)) or watts (W).

**Intensity:**

**Wave Intensity. 1:**

The intensity of a wave is the rate at which energy is transported by the wave, per unit area, across a surface perpendicular to the direction of propagation i.e. it is the power per unit area.

www.KiasuExamPaper.com* Since the energy transmitted by a wave is proportional to the square of the amplitude of the wave, so similarly, we have :

Intensity of a Wave from Point Source or Spherical Source

In the special case where the source is **point source** or **spherical source**, and the propagation is _isotropic_ (i.e. the same in all directions), then the wavefronts of the waves are spherical in shape. The wave itself is said to be a _spherical wave_.

The energy spreads out over the wavefront as the wave propagates, hence, the intensity \(I\) at a particular point a distance \(r\) from the source is given by :

Intensity, \(I=\frac{\text{Power}}{\text{Area}}=\frac{P}{4\pi r^{2}}\)

where \(P\) is the time rate of energy delivered by the wave to a distance of \(r\) away from the source.

Therefore, we see that the **intensity \(I\) at any distance \(r\) is therefore inversely proportional to \(r^{2}\)**.

**Note:**

* This relationship is called the _inverse-square law for intensity_.
* This relationship is only valid for _point sources / spherical sources_ and is based on the assumption that **the power of the wave does not diminish as it spreads out**.

Figure 9.7.6 shows the typical setup used to control the intensity of light. An unpolarised light beam is incident on two polarisers **P** and **Q** with their polarising axes angle an angle of \(\theta\)with each other.

* In such a setup, the second polariser is often known as an **analyser**.
* After passing through the first polariser **P**, the light is polarised along the polarising axis of polariser **P**. Suppose the light then has an amplitude of **E\({}_{o}\)** and an associated maximum intensity of \(I_{o}\).
* If this polarised light then falls on a second polariser **Q**, _then the component of **E\({}_{o}\)** perpendicular to the analyser axis is completely absorbed, while only the component parallel to polarising axis is allowed to transmit through **Q**.
* Since the plane of oscillation of the electric field of this light is oriented at an angle of \(\theta\) to the polarising axis of **Q**, therefore, amplitude of vibration of the light after passing through the polariser **Q** is given by **E\({}_{o}\)**cos \(\theta\).
* Since the intensity of a wave is directly proportional to the square of the amplitude of vibration. Therefore, we can see that

\[\begin{array}{c}\mbox{Intensity of Light after passing through the analyser Q}=\frac{I}{I_{o}}=(\frac{\bar{E}_{o}\cos\theta}{E_{o}})^{2}\\ \mbox{Intensity of Light after passing through the polariser P}=\frac{I}{I_{o}}\cos^{2}\theta\\ \Rightarrow\end{array}\]

Hence the intensity of light that passes through two polarisers that are aligned with an angle between their polarisation directions is

\[\begin{array}{c}\mbox{KIASU}\\ \mbox{ExamPaer}\\ \mbox{figure}\end{array}\]

where \(I_{o}\) is the maximum intensity of light transmitted when the two polarisers are aligned along the same direction of polarisation. The above equation is known as **the law of Malus** after its discoverer Etienne Louis Malus, who first observed this effect experimentally in 1809.

### Introduction

In your secondary schools, you have seen that all waves exhibit _reflection_ and _refraction_.

For the A-levels, we extend our understanding of waves by looking at two other phenomena that are exhibited by waves: _interference_ and _diffraction_, and also look at their applications in _Young's double slit experiment_, _the measurement of wavelengths_ of light and sound, and the formation of musical notes in string and woodwind instruments through the formation of _stationary waves_.

### Principle of Superposition

Imagine throwing two pebbles into a still pond. Each pebble makes its own ripples and as the ripples spread out, they kind of overlap. What determines the resultant "ripple" that we see? The displacement of the resultant wave is determined by the Principle of Superposition:

_Principle of Superposition:_

The principle of superposition states that **when two** or more waves of the same kind overlap, the resultant displacement at any point at any instant is given by the vector sum of the individual displacements that each individual wave would cause at that point at that instant:

\[y_{\text{revisent}}=y_{\text{r}}+y_{\text{2}}+y_{\text{3}}+....+y_{\text{n}}\]

where \(y_{\text{revisent}}\) is the displacement of the resultant wave and \(y_{\text{r}}\), \(y_{\text{2}}\),..., \(y_{\text{n}}\) are the individual displacements of the waves at the point of consideration.

Two pulses travelling on a stretched string in opposite directions pass through each other. When the pulses overlap the net displacement of the string is equal to the sum of the displacements produced by each pulse.

Figure 10.2.1: Consiductive interference of two wave pulses. Figure 10.2.2: Destructive interference of two wave pulses.

R2 Physics C1 2016

_Note that when the two pulses separate, they will continue to move in their original directions as if nothing has happened. From this illustration, we also see that:_

After two travelling waves passed through each other, **the pulse shapes remained unchanged after the interaction, as if the two pulses had never met.**

### Interference

This combination of separate waves in the same region of space at the same time to produce a resultant wave is called interference:

Interference

Interference is the superposing or overlapping of two or more waves to give a resultant wave whose displacement is given by the Principle of Superposition, which states that displacement of the resultant wave at any point is the vector sum of the displacements of the individual waves at that point.

Constructive interference

Constructive interference occurs at a point when two waves meet in phase at that point. The resultant amplitude of the oscillation at that point is therefore a maximum.

Phase difference between the two waves at that point = 0, 2\(\pi\), 4\(\pi\),...

Resultant amplitude \(A_{R}=A_{1}+A_{2}\)

Constructive interference of Transverse Waves

Constructive Interference of Longitudinal Waves

Destructive interference occurs at a point when two waves meet in antiphase (phase difference of 180\({}^{9}\)). The resultant amplitude of the oscillation at that point is therefore a minimum.

Phase difference between the two waves at that point = \(\pi\), 3\(\pi\), 5\(\pi\),...

Resultant amplitude \(A_{R}=A_{1}-A_{2}\)

If the waves have the same amplitude, then the resultant amplitude would be zero.

Figure 10.3.1: Two transverse waves in phase undergo constructive interference at every point to produce a wave of maximum.

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:245]

### Interference of Two Wave Sources

#### 10.4.1 Interference of Two Wave Sources that are in Phase

Consider two identical sources of monochromatic waves \(S_{1}\) and \(S_{2}\) as shown in Fig. 10.4.1. The two sources produce waves of same amplitude, same frequency and are permanently oscillating in phase. Both waves have the same speed.

#### Path Difference between the Two Wave Sources

Before we derive the general conditions for a _constructive interference_ and _destructive interference_ to be observed at any point \(P\), we first define what we mean by _path difference_:

Figure 10.4.2: Path difference between waves from \(S_{1}\) and \(S_{2}\) is the difference between the distances travelled by wave from \(S_{1}\) and wave from \(S_{2}\).

Figure 10.4.1: Interference pattern of 2 waves sources oscillating in phase. Solid lines represent the crests while dotted lines represent the troughs of the waves produced by the two sources

**Conditions for Constructive Interference**

Consider the lines \(\mathbf{A}_{\alpha}\), \(\mathbf{A}_{\mathrm{t}}\), \(\mathbf{A}_{\mathrm{2}}\) and \(\mathbf{A}_{\mathrm{3}}\).

Along these lines, the crests of the wave from \(\mathrm{S}_{1}\) (See Fig. 10.4.1) will always meet with crests from \(\mathrm{S}_{2}\). Similarly the troughs of the wave from \(\mathrm{S}_{1}\) will meet with the troughs from \(\mathrm{S}_{2}\).

From the Principle of Superposition, at the points where a crest meets another crest, we will get a resultant crest that is twice as high of that of the component waves. Similarly, at the points where a trough meets another trough, the resultant wave will have a trough that is twice as low as that of each component wave.

Therefore **along** the lines \(\mathbf{A}_{\mathrm{o}}\), \(\mathbf{A}_{\mathrm{t}}\), \(\mathbf{A}_{\mathrm{2}}\) and \(\mathbf{A}_{\mathrm{3}}\), the **waves will always meet in phase** and hence **constructive interference** occurs. \(\mathbf{A}_{\mathrm{o}}\), \(\mathbf{A}_{\mathrm{t}}\), \(\mathbf{A}_{\mathrm{2}}\) and \(\mathbf{A}_{\mathrm{3}}\) are also known as the antinodal lines.

**For a point P on the antinodal line \(\mathbf{A}_{\mathrm{o}}\), two waves from \(\mathrm{S}_{1}\) and \(\mathrm{S}_{2}\) travel to P over the same distance, therefore they meet in phase. We see that for all points on line \(\mathbf{A}_{\mathrm{o}}\)**

Phase difference between the 2 waves at P: \(\Delta\phi=0\)

Path difference between the 2 waves at P: \(\delta=\left|S_{1}P-S_{2}P\right|=0\)

**If P lies on the antinodal line \(\mathbf{A}_{\mathrm{t}}\), we see that the path (distance) travelled by one wave to P is always longer than the other wave by one wavelength**.

Phase difference between the 2 waves at P: \(\Delta\phi=2\pi\)

Path difference between the 2 waves, \(\delta=\left|S_{1}P-S_{2}P\right|=\lambda\).

**Similarly for antinodal lines \(\mathbf{A}_{\mathrm{2}}\), for all points P on the line, the path travelled by one wave is always longer than the other wave by two wavelengths**.

Phase difference between the 2 waves at P: \(\Delta\phi=4\pi\)

Path difference between the 2 waves, \(\delta=\left|S_{1}P-S_{2}P\right|=2\lambda\).

In general,

**Conditions for Constructive Interference**:

For two waves sources \(\mathrm{S}_{1}\) and \(\mathrm{S}_{2}\) that are oscillating in phase.

Phase difference between the two waves meeting at point P is therefore given by

\(\Delta\phi=0,2\pi,4\pi,6\pi,...=2m\pi\).

Path difference between the two waves travelling from the sources to the point P :

\(\delta=\left|\mathrm{S}_{1}\mathrm{P}-\mathrm{S}_{2}P\right|=0,\lambda,2 \lambda,3\lambda,...=m\lambda\)

where \(m=0\),\(1\),\(2\),\(3\),... and \(\lambda\) is the wavelength of the individual waves.

**Note:**

1. The points of constructive interference are also known as points of maxima.
2. \(m\) is also commonly known as the _order_.

The central maximum is known as the _zeroth order maximum_. (\(m=0\))

The two maxima on either side of the zeroth order maximum are known as the **1st order maxima** (\(m=1\)). The next maxima further away are then known as the **2nd order maxima** and so on.

Note that sometimes, we assign signs (+ or - ) to distinguish the "directions" of the order e.g. the orders observed to the right of the zeroth order may be given a positive sign (+) and therefore those orders observed to left of the zeroth order may be given a negative (-) sign.

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:248]

**Conditions for Destructive Interference:**

Consider two waves sources S\({}_{1}\) and S\({}_{2}\) that are oscillating in phase.

For destructive interference to occur at a point P, a certain distance away from S\({}_{1}\) and S\({}_{2}\),

Phase difference between the two waves meeting at point P is therefore given by:

\[\Delta\phi=\pi,3\pi,\,5\pi,\,7\pi,...=(m-\frac{1}{2})\,2\pi.\]

Path difference between the two waves travelling from the sources to the point P :

\[\delta\ =\ \ \left|S_{1}P-S_{2}P\right|\ =\ \frac{\lambda}{2},\frac{3\lambda}{2}, \ \frac{5\lambda}{2},...\ =(m-\frac{1}{2})\lambda,\]

where the order, \(m=1,2,3,...\) and \(\lambda\) is the wavelength of the individual waves.

**Note :**

1. The points of destructive interference are also known as points of minima.
2. Notice that because there is no destructive interference in the central line, there is no zeroth order minimum observed.

**Question:**

The conditions for constructive and destructive interference stated above are for the case that _the sources started out in phase_. If the original sources _are 180\({}^{o}\) out of phase_ (i.e. in anti-phase or equivalent to an additional path difference of \(\frac{\lambda}{2}\)), will the conditions for path difference change and why?

**Answer:**

(The phase difference between the 2 wave trains arriving at P)

= (Phase difference at the source) + (Phase difference due to the equivalent path difference)

All the points where the waves meet in phase previously, the waves will now meet in antiphase.

All the points where the waves meet in antiphase previously, the waves will now meet in phase.

Hence, the conditions for constructive and destructive interference are interchanged.

For Constructive Interference :

Path difference btwn the 2 waves trains arriving at P,

\[\delta\ =\ \left|S_{1}P-S_{2}P\right|=\frac{\lambda}{2},\,\frac{3\lambda}{2}, \,\frac{5\lambda}{2},...\ \

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:250]

### Diffraction of Waves

What is diffraction?

Diffraction is the _spreading_ of waves, after passing through small apertures or openings, into their "geometrical" shadows; or the spreading of waves round an obstacle.

Diffraction effects become more apparent when the width of the opening is about the same size as the wavelength.

#### Diffraction of water waves

When waves meets a barrier in which there is an opening, if the width of the opening is much larger than the wavelength of the waves, the wave emerging from the opening continues to move in a straight line (apart from some small spreading at the edge). If the width of the opening is comparable or smaller than the wavelength, then the bending is a lot more obvious, and emergent wave becomes more circular.

What is meant by "Geometrical Shadow"

Consider a series of particles projected (diagram below) separately into an aperture and obstacle.

As the particles are blocked by the barriers, there will be a sharp'shadow' region where the particles do not reach: This shadow is known as the "geometrical shadow" of the barriers.

Figure 10.5.1: Waves of identical wavelengths meet gaps of different widths. When the **width of the gap** is comparable to the **wavelength**, diffraction effects are more obvious.

Diffraction is also observed for waves meeting an obstacle in its path. Again, **the relative size of the obstacle to the wavelength will determine the effect of diffraction** as shown in the figure 10.5.3. It is found that in order for the waves to spread around the edges of the obstacle to extend into the geometric shadow of the obstacle, the width of the obstacle should be approximately the size of the wavelength.

Since light and sound demonstrate diffraction effects. They are said to behave like waves. This diffraction effect cannot be explained by particle theory (i.e. diffraction effect is unique to waves).

#### Single Slit Diffraction Pattern

##### Diffraction Pattern of a Single Slit

We might expect that light passing through a small opening would simply result in a broad region of light on a screen, due to the spreading of the light as it passes through the opening. We actually find something more interesting. A diffraction pattern consisting of light and dark areas is observed, somewhat similar to the interference pattern discussed earlier.

For example, when a narrow slit is placed between a distant light source and a screen, the light produces a diffraction pattern shown in Figure 10.5.3. The pattern consists of a broad intense central band (called the central maximum), flanked by a series of alternating bright and dark bands. Figure 10.5.4 shows a diffraction pattern associated with light passing by the edge of an object. Again, we see the bright and dark fringes, similar to an interference pattern.

Figure 10.5.3: The waves will bend if the length of the obstacle is smaller than the wavelength of the waves.

In a single slit diffraction, light waves of wavelength \(\lambda\) passing through a single slit of width \(b\) undergoes diffraction to produce a broad intense central band with an intensity profile that is maximum at the centre, and tapers off towards both sides as shown in Figure 10.5.5.

Christiaan Huygens, a Dutch scientist, developed a geometrical model of wave propagation (known as Huygens' principle, see Appendix A) which helps in explaining the above observation. According to Huygens', the slit is made up of whole row of secondary point sources, radiating wavelets. Hence, light from one of these secondary sources can interfere with light from another secondary source. This diffraction pattern observed is actually the interference pattern produced by the many secondary light sources within the slit!

The first minimum intensity of the single slit diffraction pattern occurs at angle \(\theta\) from the central maximum where

\[\sin\,\theta=\frac{\lambda}{b}\]

This angle \(\theta\) is important because it tells us the angular spread (\(2\theta\)) which contains most of the energy of the wave. It can be seen from this that \(\theta\) gets larger and the pattern spreads out as \(b\) (the slit width) is reduced. The pattern also gets dimmer as less light energy passes through a small slit. A more complete analysis of the diffraction pattern can be found in Appendix B.

Width of the single slit pattern

For small angles the angular spread of the diffraction pattern is inversely proportional to the slit width \(b\) or, more precisely, to the ratio of \(b\) to the wavelength \(\lambda\). Figure 10.5.6 shows graphs of intensity \(I\) as a function of the angle for three values of the ratio \(b\,I\lambda\).

Figure 10.5.5:

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:254]

#### Resolving Power

The resolving power of an optical instrument is the ability of the instrument to differentiate clearly between the images of two close objects, i.e., the two images are seen as two distinct images. As most images are viewed through an aperture as in the case of microscopes and telescopes, it is identical to viewing the diffraction pattern produced. Hence the diffraction of light affects greatly or limits the resolving power of an optical instrument.

To understand this limitation, let us consider two light sources far away from a narrow slit of **slit width \(b\)**.

The two sources can be incoherent, such as two distant stars.

If no interference occurs between the two light passing through the slit, then each light source will produce a diffraction pattern on the screen. What is observed on the screen will be the summation of two diffraction patterns, one from each source. If the sources are close together, their diffraction patterns overlap; if they are close enough, their diffraction patterns overlaps almost completely and cannot be distinguished.

To determine if the two images are resolved, we use the Rayleigh criterion (named after Lord Rayleigh who suggested this rule) which states that **when the central maximum of one image falls on the first minimum of the second image, the images are said to be just resolved**.

Figure 10.5.7: Individual diffraction patterns of two point sources (solid curves) and the resultant patterns (dashed curves) for various separation of sources as light passes through a circular aperture. In each case, the dashed curve is a summation of the two solid curves.

Figure 10.5.7: To determine if the two images are resolved, we use the Rayleigh criterion (named after Lord Rayleigh who suggested this rule) which states that **when the central maximum of one image falls on the first minimum of the second image, the images are said to be just resolved**.

Hence according to the Rayleigh criterion, when **two images are just resolved**, the **angular separation between the two sources, \(\alpha\)** is (approximately) equal to the **angle \(\theta_{min}\)** between the central maximum and the first minimum of one of the images.(See Fig. 10.5.8) This is because the central maximum of one of the image falls on the first minimum of the second image.

From the previous section (i.e. diffraction pattern of **a** single slit), the **first minimum** in a single slit diffraction occurs at an angle for which \(\sin\theta_{min}=\frac{\lambda}{b}\) where \(b\) is the slit width. When \(\theta_{min}\) is small, we can use the approximation \(\sin\theta_{min}\approx\theta_{min}\).

Therefore, the **Rayleigh criteria for the resolving power of a single aperture** is given by

\[\theta_{min}\approx\frac{\lambda}{b}\]

where \(b\) is the slit width and \(\theta_{min}\) is in radians.

Hence we can also say that **the angle subtended by the two sources, \(\alpha\) must be greater than \(\frac{\lambda}{b}\) if the images are to be resolved**.

**Note:**

1. The resolving power of a telescope can be improved by using an objective lens of wide aperture (i.e. large diameter). Besides reducing the diffraction effects, more light is also transmitted through the telescope and a brighter image is observed.

2. In microscopes, the resolving power is improved by using radiation of much smaller wavelengths than visible light, such as ultra-violet. In electron microscopes, the wavelength of the electron beam is \(10^{5}\) times smaller than visible light, resulting in much higher resolution in the images. The wavelength associated with the electron beam will be covered in Chapter 17 Quantum Physics.

### Interference of Light Waves - Young's Double Slit Experiment

The interference pattern produced by two _water waves_ of the same wavelength can be readily seen in a ripple tank1. Interference pattern is not easily observable when two light waves overlap, giving notion that light does not possess wave properties.

Footnote 1: Read more about the Ripple Tank in Appendix C (Pg. 47).

The conditions for interference to occur are:

**Conditions for Interference to occur at a point:**

1. Waves must be of the same kind.
2. The waves must overlap i.e. the waves must be at the same place at the same time.

### So can light waves interfere with each other?

We now know that when two independent light sources are placed side by side, no interference pattern is observed because the light waves emitted by each of the sources are not coherent, i.e. they **do not maintain a constant phase relationship** with each other over the time of observation. Light from an ordinary source undergoes random phase change about once every \(10^{-8}\) s. Therefore, conditions for constructive interference, destructive interference, or some intermediate state last for times of the order of \(10^{8}\) s. The result is that no interference pattern is observed since the eye cannot follow such short-term changes.

**Conditions for Permanent and Observable Interference Pattern**

Generally, for the interference between any 2 similar waves to be observable :

1. The sources must be coherent; i.e. they must maintain a _constant phase difference_ with respect to each other:
2. The two wave sources must also emit waves of roughly the same amplitude.
3. For transverse waves, they must be unpolarised, or share a common direction of polarisation.

Note:
1. These are the conditions for distinct (good contrast) and observable interference pattern. If the conditions are not satisfied the waves still interfere i.e. the waves still obey the Principle of Superposition. However the interference pattern is not sufficiently pronounced or permanent enough for the observer to see.
2. Coherence:

Two waves are said to be coherent if they have a constant phase difference between them.

When two sources are coherent, it does not necessarily imply that they are in phase with each other.

The constant phase difference may be non-zero.

Therefore, if 2 sources are coherent, this necessarily implies that the frequencies and wavelengths (and hence speeds) of the waves emitted must be the same.

#### 10.6.1 Description on Young's Double Slit Experiment

It was Thomas Young who first demonstrated that light can also interfere with each other to produce an interference pattern as predicted by wave theory and hence demonstrating that light was a wave. A schematic diagram of the apparatus that Young used is shown in Fig. 10.6.1.

* To produce light sources which are coherent in Young's interference experiment, a point source of monochromatic light is incident on 2 slits. As light reaches the two slits, it is diffracted by slits S\({}_{1}\) and S\({}_{2}\), which then act as 2 point sources. Since there is only one primary point source, therefore the light waves emerging from S\({}_{1}\) and S\({}_{2}\) are always coherent. If S\({}_{1}\) and S\({}_{2}\) are equidistance from S\({}_{0}\), then the 2 sources are in phase.
* The light waves travelling from S\({}_{1}\) and S\({}_{2}\) overlap and undergo interference, forming an interference pattern of **maxima** and **minima**.
* On the screen points of visible bright rows called _bright bands_, _bright fringes_, or _maxima_ are formed. The dark regions are called _dark bands_, _dark fringes_, or _minima_.
* The pattern of bright and dark fringes on the screen is called an **interference pattern**. (Fig.10.6.2)
* A point source is obtained usually by placing another slit S\({}_{o}\) between the double-slit and an extended light source.

*

Figure 10.6.1 Setup for Youngâs Double Slit ExperimentLet us now derive the conditions for the positions of the maxima and minima of the Young's Double Slit experiment.

In Fig. 10.6.2 a screen is placed at a perpendicular distance \(L\) from the double-slits. The double slits are separated by a _slit separation_ of \(d\). Because the wave through \(S_{1}\) originate from the same wavefront as the wave through \(S_{2}\), the two waves at \(S_{1}\) and \(S_{2}\) are always **in phase**.

Consider an arbitrary point \(P\) on the viewing screen,

For **a maximum to be observed at \(P\)**, the wave from \(S_{1}\) needs to **constructively interfere** with the wave from \(S_{2}\). Hence, the path difference \(\delta\)between the two waves when they meet at \(P\) needs to be:

\[\delta=\left|\gamma_{1}-\gamma_{2}\right|=0,\lambda,2\lambda,3\lambda,...=m \lambda\qquad\text{where }m:\text{order }(m=0,1,2,3,...)\]

Similarly, for **a minimum to be observed at \(P\)**, the wave from \(S_{1}\) needs to **destructively interfere** with the wave from \(S_{2}\). Hence, the path difference \(\delta\)between the two waves when they meet at \(P\) needs to be:

\[\delta=\left|\gamma_{1}-\gamma_{2}\right|=\frac{\lambda}{2},\frac{3\lambda}{2},\frac{5\lambda}{2},\frac{7\lambda}{2}=(m-\frac{1}{2})\lambda\qquad\text{where }m:\text{order }(m=1,2,3,...)\]

However, for the experiment, the separation between the slits \(d\) is often negligible compared to the distance \(L\) between the screen and the slits, i.e. \(L>>d\). Therefore the rays from \(S_{1}\) and \(S_{2}\) to \(P\) are almost parallel to each other. (Fig. 10.6.3)

_Point to Note: What are the typical orders of magnitude for slit separation, \(d\), slit widths \(S_{1}\) and \(S_{2}\) and distance \(L\) for Young's double slit experiment with light?_

ExamplPaperTherefore, the _path difference_\(\delta\)may be _approximated_ by:

\[\delta\!=\!d\sin\theta\]

where \(d\) is _the separation between the slits_, and \(\theta\) is the _angular displacement_ of the position of interference fringe observed from the _principal axis QQ_.2

Footnote 2: The _principal axis_ is a line joining the midpoint of the two slits perpendicularly to the viewing screen.

The conditions that defines whether _bright_ or _dark_ fringes are observed at point P is thus given by

\[\begin{array}{c}\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{Conditions for Constructive Interference (Maxima or Bright Fringes):}\\ \hskip 142.26378ptd\sin\theta\!=\!m\lambda\hskip 142.26378pt\text{ where }m\!:\text{ order number }(\ m\!=\!0,\!1,\!2,\!3,\!...)\\ \hskip 142.26378pt\text{Condition for Destructive Interference (Minima or Dark Fringes):}\\ \hskip 142.26378ptd\sin\theta\!=\!(m\!-\!\frac{1}{2})\lambda\hskip 142.26378pt \text{ where }m\!:\text{ order number }(m\!=\!1,\!2,\!3,\!...)\\ \hskip 142.26378pt\text{The assumption made during the derivation of these two equations is }L>>d\end{array}\]

Note:

Similar to the two source interference introduced earlier, \(m\) is called the order number.

\(m\) = 0 corresponds to \(\theta\) = 0. In this case, a central bright fringe is observed and hence it is known as the _zeroth order maximum_. The first maximum on either side is called the _first-order maximum_, and so forth.

Sometimes a sign is assigned to the order to help distinguish the positions of the maxima or minima. For example in this case, maxima located at one side (suppose above) of the zeroth order maximum may have values of \(m\) = 1, 2, 3, 4.... while maxima located at the other side (below) the zeroth order maximum may have values of \(m\) = -1, -2, -3, -4,...

2Positions \(\gamma\) of Bright and Dark Fringes

It is often useful to obtain expressions for the positions \(y\) along the screen of the fringes measured vertically from \(\mathsf{O}\) to \(\mathsf{P}\).

In a typical Young's Double Slit experiment, constructive interference occurs when

\[\begin{array}{c}\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{Conditions for Constructive Interference (Minima or Bright Fringes):}\\ \hskip 142.26378ptd\sin\theta\!=\!m\lambda\hskip 142.26378pt\Rightarrow\sin\theta \!=\!m\lambda\hskip 142.26378ptd\\ \hskip 142.26378pt\text{Given small values of }m\!,\text{ the value of }\theta\!\text{ would be very small if }\lambda<<d\!,\end{array}\]

hence we can use small angle approximation (\(\sin\theta\!\approx\!\tan\theta\)) to arrive at \(\tan\theta\!=\!m\lambda\hskip 142.26378ptd\)

\[\begin{array}{c}\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{Conditions for Constructive Interference (Minima or Bright Fringes):}\\ \hskip 142.26378ptd\sin\theta\!=\!m\lambda\hskip 142.26378ptd\\ \hskip 142.26378pt\Rightarrow\hskip 142.26378pt\frac{m\lambda}{d} =\frac{y}{L}\end{array}\]

#### Effects of Diffraction on Double Slit

The slits used in the double slit experiment in practice cannot be considered as point sources. As a result, each slit produces a diffraction pattern as shown in Figure 10.5.5. Figure 10.6.4 illustrates the interference pattern of two slits superposed on the intensity pattern of a single slit. The interference fringe pattern due to the double slit gets moderated by the diffraction pattern.

This can sometimes result in missing orders in the interference fringe pattern. When the minima of the diffraction envelope coincide with the maxima of the interference pattern, the "maxima" of the interference pattern go missing.

Figure 10.6.4:

### Diffraction Grating

We have seen that the Young's double-slit experiment is able to allow us to determine the wavelength of light. However, a more commonly used tool is the _diffraction grating_. A diffraction grating has many fine, parallel, closely spaced and equidistant slits/rulings inscribed on a sheet of glass or metal. A typical diffraction grating has several hundreds to thousands of slits per mm.

To see how a diffraction grating pattern differs from a Young's double-slit pattern and why it is so useful, we will analyse the diffraction pattern for various number of slits of the same slits-separation \(d\).

Figure 10.7.1:From the Fig. 10.7.2(a) above, we make the following observations:

* For the same slits separation \(d\), the **positions of the maxima remain the same**.
* As the number of slits increase, the maxima become narrower, i.e. the fringes become sharper on the screen.
* As the number of slits increase, the intensity of the maxima increases.

Therefore, we can infer that for a grating (no. of slits \(\rightarrow\infty\)) the **fringe pattern will have very good contrast** (narrower and brighter maxima separated by broad regions of dark minima).

Figure 10.7.2: This shows the diffraction pattern of one slit, then two, then three, four, five, six, and more. When there are many slits, we call it a diffraction grating. The more slits, the narrower the pattern becomes. The pictures (a) above were taken with monochromatic light.

**Condition for Maxima for a Diffraction Grating**

* From the above observations of the diffraction patterns of various slits, we can therefore infer the equation that determines the positions of the maxima for a _diffraction grating pattern_.
* For same value of \(d\), **the positions of the maxima (bright fringes) of a grating coincide with the positions of the maxima for a double slit** :

**Condition for Constructive Interference (Maxima) for a Diffraction Grating**

For the _nth order maxima_,

\[d\sin\theta=n\lambda\]

where \(d\) : separation between the slits

\(\theta\) : angular position of the bright fringe from the principle axis

\(n\) : order number (\(n\)=0, 1, 2, 3,...)

\(\lambda\) : wavelength of light passing through the grating

Commercially available gratings are labelled by the _no. of lines per unit length_, \(N\). The relationship between \(N\) and \(d\) are given by

**Note :**

1 In this case, we _do not define_ the conditions for _destructive interference_ as the width of the region between the bright fringes is very large.

2 For most of the gratings in the laboratory, the slit separations are much smaller than that of the double slits. Hence, _you will notice that the positions of the first and higher orders of the bright fringes lie much further away from the central bright fringe and hence small angle approximation does not hold_. Therefore, in most questions for diffraction grating it is not meaningful to talk about the _fringe separation_ as the angular separation between consecutive fringes are not constant, in fact _they increase as the order increases_.

Although the formula for constructive interference for the double slit and the diffraction grating is the same, the formula for fringe separation for double slits, \(\Delta y=\frac{\lambda L}{d}\), CANNOT, we used in a grating, unless the fringes are shown to be regularly spaced.

3 Grating vs. Young's Double Slit

The grating-is often the preferred choice over the double-slit for the following reasons. For a diffraction grating,

\(\lambda\) : fringes are sharper and positions are more precisely determined. There is therefore less uncertainty in measuring the position of the fringes, and less uncertainty in the computation of wavelength.

\(\circ\) Typically the angular displacements are large, so percentage uncertainty in measuring the angular displacement becomes relatively lower. This translates to a relatively lower percentage uncertainty in measuring wavelength as well.

### Stationary Waves

Consider two identical wave trains moving in opposite directions overlapping in the same region of space. Figure 10.8.1 shows wave P moving towards the right and wave Q moving towards the left. By applying the principle of superposition, we know that during the time the two waves overlap, the resultant displacements is given by the vector sum of the displacements of the primary waves at that location.

Because the wave pattern does not appear to move in either direction along the wave, the resultant waveform is known as a **standing wave** or **stationary wave**.

We can observe from the diagram that amplitude of vibration for every point of the resultant wave varies.

* There are particular points called **nodes** (\(N\)) that never move, i.e. the amplitude of vibration is zero.
* Midway between the nodes are points called **antnodes** (\(A\)), where the amplitude of vibration is greatest.

Figure 10.8.1: The diagram shows how the superposition of 2 identical waves moving in opposite directions overlapping to form a stationary wave.

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:271]

Figure 10.8.2 shows a car driven at a speed of 30 m s\({}^{-1}\) along a straight road between 2 radio transmitters. The transmitters T\({}_{1}\) and T\({}_{2}\) are sending out the same programme, using a frequency of 1.50 MHz. The radio is heard to fade and strengthen regularly.

Figure 10.8.2: What is the period of this regular fading? [Ans: 3.3 s]

Figure 10.8.3: Example 10.8.1: Stationary Waves

#### Stationary Waves in Strings

Consider a string that is fixed at one end. Suppose its free end is moved up and down in simple harmonic motion, the oscillation will produce a continuous wave-train down the string. As the wave-train reaches the fixed end, it gets reflected back. The reflected wave-train will interfere with the wave-train from the source to form a resultant waveform on the string. It is observed that at certain frequencies of vibration of the source, we will be able to see some unique waveforms on the string as illustrated in Fig. 10.9.3(a)-(c).

The frequencies at which standing waves are produced are known as the natural frequencies or resonant frequencies of the string.

The different standing wave patterns shown in Fig. 10.8.3 are the different "resonant modes of vibration". When the driving frequency matches that of the natural frequency of the string, the amplitude of oscillation generated are the largest.

This principle is very important as it is used in the generation of music in many stringed instruments like guitar and violin.

**Resonant modes of vibrations in a stretched string fixed at two ends**

Consider a wire stretched between 2 points and plucked in the middle, a transverse wave travels along the wire and is reflected at the ends. The reflected and re-reflected waves from the ends will continually interfere with each other to produce a stationary wave on the string.

**The two ends of the strings are fixed and thus must have zero displacement and hence must be displacement nodes.**

This additional constraint or boundary condition results in the string being allowed to have only certain wavelengths and frequencies of oscillations.

Fig. 10.8.4 shows the largest possible wavelength of stationary wave that can be produced on the wire - corresponding to the smallest frequency. This mode of oscillation is known as the fundamental mode and the lowest frequency of vibration \(f_{i}\) is known as the fundamental frequency.

Fig. 10.8.3 shows the largest possible wavelength of stationary wave that can be produced on the wire - corresponding to the smallest frequency. This mode of oscillation is known as the fundamental mode and the lowest frequency of vibration \(f_{i}\) is known as the fundamental frequency.

**Note:**

1. **Fundamental Frequency and Harmonics**

All resonant frequencies of vibrations that can be generated are called harmonics. The harmonics are numbered according to the ratio of their frequencies to the first natural frequency \(f_{t}\). Thus if the 1st harmonic is 110 Hz, then 220 Hz, 330 Hz, 440 Hz etc. are the 2nd, 3rd, 4th etc harmonics respectively.

The first natural frequency is the lowest possible frequency and is known as the _fundamental frequency_ (or 1st harmonic)

The frequencies of the harmonics are related to the fundamental frequency \(f_{t}\) by \(f_{t}=nf_{t}\) where \(f_{t}\) is the frequency of the \(n^{th}\) harmonic.

Note that all harmonics are present for the string shown above.

2. **Overtones**

Overtones are the frequencies (excluding the fundamental) that can be produced by an instrument accompanying the 1st harmonic that is played.

The tuning fork and frequency generator are the only examples that can produce a pure note.

The lowest overtone is known as the 1st overtone, the next overtone is the 2nd overtone. Hence, in this case, the 1st overtone of the string corresponds to the 2nd harmonic of the string.

3. **Speed of a wave on a string**

The speed of a wave on a string is given by \(v=\sqrt[]{\frac{T}{\mu}}\) where \(T\) is the tension in the string and \(\mu\) is the mass per unit length of the string.

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:275]

### 10.8.3 Standing Waves in Air Column

Like standing transverse wave on a stretched string, a standing longitudinal wave is obtained by _the superposition of two trains of progressive longitudinal waves of equal amplitude, and frequency, travelling with the same speed in the opposite directions._

Stationary transverse and longitudinal waves share similar properties except for the _direction of the displacement of the particle_ where the displacement of air molecules are parallel to the direction of propagation of the component waves that form the stationary wave.

The formation of stationary waves in pipes and tubes is the basis of production of musical notes in most wind instruments. When stationary waves are set up in the tubes, **the air column resonates at its natural frequencies**.

The boundary conditions that determine the natural frequencies of the air column depends on whether that end is open or closed.

Figure 10.8.6: The diagram can be used to show a longitudinal standing wave. To see the effect, move a piece of stiff card with a slot of no more than 1 mm cut in down over the diagram.

### Resonant Frequencies of Air Columns

There are generally 2 types of air columns we want to concern ourselves with :

* open pipe
* closed pipe ( closed at one end)

Recall that the open end of the pipe, we have a displacement antinode, and at the closed end of the pipe, we have a displacement node.

### Resonant Vibrations in an Open Pipe

The _nth_ harmonic can be expressed as: \(f=\eta\bigg{(}\dfrac{\nu}{2L}\bigg{)}\), where \(n\) = 1, 2, 3, 4,...

### Resonant Vibrations in a Closed Pipe

The _nth_ harmonic is given by: \(J_{a}=\eta\bigg{(}\dfrac{\nu}{4L}\bigg{)}\), where \(n\) = 1, 3, 5,...

**Note:**

1. The fundamental frequency of an open pipe is twice that of a closed pipe of the same length.
2. Only odd harmonics are present in closed pipe.
3. Assuming that we have a closed pipe and an open pipe with characteristics the same in all aspects inclusive of length, the following table presents a possible situation for the combination of frequencies emitted.

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|} \hline Harmonics & Frequency emitted from a Closed & Frequency emitted from an Open \\  & Pipe /Hz & Pipe / Hz \\ \hline
1 & 256 & 512 \\ \hline
2 & - & 1024 \\ \hline
3 & 768 & 1536 \\ \hline
4 & - & 2048 \\ \hline
5 & 1280 & 2560 \\ \hline \end{tabular}

The quality of sound emitted is a mixture of these harmonics for each system. Hence we see that the "note" from an open pipe is "richer" than that from a closed pipe.

**Example 10.8.3**.: **Serway p18.37.**

Calculate the length of a pipe that has a fundamental frequency of 240 Hz if the pipe is

(a) closed at one end and

(b) open at both ends.

Take the speed of sound to be 343 m s\({}^{\text{-1}}\).

#### 10.8.4 What about the pressure?

Earlier we discussed the pressure variations in a progressive sound wave; now we can consider how pressure varies in a stationary sound wave.

Fig. 10.8.7 (a) shows the two extreme curves of the displacement-position graph for a stationary wave for times when the displacements are greatest. As before, we will take displacements of air molecules to the right to be positive.

Consider graph (a),

Air to the left of node N, is displaced positively and hence to the right towards N, air to the right of N, has a negative displacement and hence to the left toward N, as well.

At N, the air is compressed and the pressure is greater than normal.

Hence, we can conclude

Pressure variation is greatest at displacement nodes.

Therefore, for a longitudinal stationary wave, we can conclude that :

Displacement node is subjected to large pressure changes and hence it is a pressure antinode.

Since nodes are always located at midpoints of 2 adjacent antinodes, therefore

Displacement antinodes corresponds to points of pressure nodes

At those points, molecules are free to move about and hence the pressure remains at normal pressure.

Now consider N, in this case the air molecules to the left and right of N all moves away from N. Therefore, at N, the air is less dense than usual.

A N, the air is rarefied and the pressure is lower than normal.

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:281]

#### Investigating the speed of sound using stationary waves

We can determine the speed of sound wave by setting up a stationary wave and measure the corresponding frequency and wavelength as described by the experiment below. A stationary sound wave is set up by reflection from a reflector.

The experimental setup is shown in Fig. 10.8.9.

* The signal generator (See Appendix E, Pg. 49) connected to a speaker delivers a note of frequency \(f\) towards a reflector (e.g. a metal sheet).
* The sound wave gets reflected off the reflector and interference occurs between the forward and reflected waves and a stationary wave pattern with nodes and antinodes is established between the speaker and reflector.
* The positions of antinodes are determined using a microphone connected to the oscilloscope (See Appendix E, Pg. 49). The microphone is slowly moved away from the reflector until a trace of maximum amplitude is obtained. This denotes the position of an antinode. The distance \(x_{t}\) of the microphone from the reflector is measured using a metre rule.
* The microphone is next moved slowly further away from the reflector until the amplitude of the trace on the C.R.O. is once again maximum. The distance of the microphone from the reflector, \(x_{2}\), is again measured.

Therefore, Distance between 2 successive antinodes, \(d=x_{2}-x_{1}=\lambda/2\)

Wavelength of the sound wave, \(\lambda=2d\)

* If the frequency \(f\) of the sound wave is known, the speed of sound \(\nu\) can be determined from

\[\nu=f\lambda.\]

## Appendices

### Huygens' Principle

Huygens' Principle

But how can one explain the bending of waves due to diffraction? Why does the spreading of waves become increasingly more obvious with the width of the aperture decreases to about the same order as the wavelength? This phenomenon may be explained using _Huygens' Principle_.

The _Huygens' Principle_ is a geometrical method for finding, from the known shape of a wave front at some instant, the shape of the wave front at some later time. Huygen assumed that

_every point of a wave front may be considered the source of secondary wavelets that spread out in all directions with a speed equal to the speed of propagation of the wave._

The new wave front at a later time is found by constructing a surface _tangent to the secondary wavelets_, called the _envelope_ of the wavelets.

The following diagram shows how Huygens' construction is used to determine the new wavefronts for a plane wave and for a spherical wave.

Through Huygens' construction, we can now see how the subsequent wavefronts'reconstruct' themselves when incident plane waves pass through a slit.

## Appendix C Ripple Tank

One way to observe interference of water waves is in a ripple tank. Generally a ripple tank could be used to investigate various properties of water waves.

1. **Eccentric:** An eccentric (off-centre) metal disc on the axle of the motor causes the beam to vibrate at the same frequency as the revolutions of the motor. The speed of the motor is controlled by a rheostat in series with a low-voltage d.c. supply, or a dry battery (usually 3.0 or 4.5 V).
2. To generate continuous straight wave, a vibrating beam just touching the water is used.
3. To generate circular waves, a small spherical dipper is fixed to the beam instead.
4. The speed of the motor may be adjusted to vary the frequency and wavelength of continuous wave train.
5. The progressive waves move quite quickly across the water surface and any attempt to measure the wavelength or draw the wave diagrams from the moving water shadows would be very difficult. A standard method of freezing or slowing down rapid motion would be to use a stroboscope.

Figure 1: Set-up for the ripple tank

Figure 2: Observations of wavefronts in a ripple tank.

## Appendix D Spectrometer

The grating or double slit is usually mounted on a device known as a _spectrometer_ to allow us to easily take measurements of \(\theta\) so that we can study about the light source. Fig. 2 below shows you a typical laboratory spectrometer and Fig. 2 shows a schematic sketch of the spectrometer.

When used with a grating,

we usually start off by locating the position of the _zeroth order maximum_. It is the brightest fringe that has the brightest intensity. This provides a reference point for which angular displacement can be measured. The angular displacement of the _m\({}^{th}\) order maximum_.

\(\theta=\left|\left|\theta_{o}-\theta_{o}\right|\right|\)

Alternatively, by noting the angular positions of the _m\({}^{th}\)_ order bright fringe at either side of the central maximum (\(\theta_{o,i\theta}\) and \(\theta_{o,i\theta_{o}}\) ), we can also determine the angular displacement \(\theta\) of _m\({}^{th}\)_ order maximum from the central maximum. In this case, \(2\,\theta=\left|\theta_{o,i\theta}-\theta_{o,i\theta_{o}}\right|\)

We also move the telescope to each side of this central maximum to check that several orders of _diffraction_ can be seen and there is some symmetry about this central maximum. If not, the plane of the surface of the grating is not perpendicular to the plane in which telescope moves and tilt of the table needs to be adjusted.

## Appendix E Function Generator and C.R.O.

### Function Generator

A function generator is an instrument that produces alternating (a.c.) voltage of different frequencies.

The standard voltage signals it can produce are:

As not all function generators have a precise digital display of the frequency of the waveform or the amplitude of the voltage wave produced. It will sometimes be necessary to connect the function generator to a CRO in order to determine the precise frequency and amplitude of the voltage wave.

To generate the sound waves, the function generator is often connected to a speaker so that the speaker can convert the voltage signals to vibrations of the membrane of the speakers to produce sound waves.

### Cathode Ray Oscilloscope

The other commonly used equipment in sound experiments is the **cathode ray oscilloscope** (CRO). The oscilloscope is basically a graph displaying device that traces the variation of the input voltage signal with respect to time.

Figure 1: Examples of function generators. The top one is a single output generator. The bottom generator is able to produce two outputs at the same time.

Using the oscilloscope, you can measure the amplitude, period, and frequency of any voltage signal. Therefore, a CRO is actually a more complex voltmeter. Hence, to measure the frequency of a sound wave, we need to first connect a microphone to the scope. The microphone will then convert the vibrational energy of the air molecules to voltage signals which can be measured by the CRO.

Most scopes can display two signals on the screen at one time, enabling you to observe their time relationships. These scopes are known as dual-channel oscilloscopes. A typical front panel view of such a scope is shown in Fig. 10.12.2.

Actual CROs vary depending on model and manufacturer, but most have certain common features. The main controls will be discussed below. You will need to refer to the user manual for complete details of the scope you are using.

### Vertical Controls:

In the vertical section of the scope (Fig. 2), there are identical controls for each of the two channels (CH1 and CH2).

* **Position Control**. The position control lets you move **a** displayed waveform up or down vertically on the screen.
* **Volts/Div control**. The Volts/Div control is also known as the **Y-sensitivity**/ **Y-gain control**. It adjusts the number of volts represented by each vertical division (usually 1 cm) on the screen. For this scope, the Volts/Div setting for each channel is displayed at the bottom of the screen. For CH1, it is 500 mV/div and for CH2, it is 200 mV/div.

### Horizontal Controls:

In the horizontal section, the controls apply to both channels.

* **Position Control**. The position control lets you move a displayed waveforms left or right horizontally on the screen.*
* **Sec/Div Control**. The Sec/Div control is also known as the **Timebase** control, it adjusts the time represented by each horizontal division or main time base. Similarly, for this scope, the Sec/Div setting is displayed at the bottom of the screen.

Figure 2: A typical dual channel oscilloscope. Numbers below screen indicate the values for each division on the vertical (voltage) and horizontal (time) scales and can be varied using the vertical and horizontal controls on the scope.

### 11.1 Internal Energy, Temperature and Heat

You are familiar with energies due to the bulk movement or position of a system as a whole. Internal energy, on the other hand, refers to microscopic energies due to the movement and interaction of individual constituents within the system.

For example, in the macroscopic view, a tennis ball flying across the court possesses kinetic energy of motion and potential energy of gravitation.

In the microscopic view, the molecules that make up the tennis ball also possess kinetic energy since they are in constant motion vibrating within the lattice. They also possess potential energy since they are held together by the intermolecular forces which are electrical in nature. These make up the internal energy of the tennis ball.

The **internal energy** is the summation of microscopic kinetic energy due to random motion of the gas molecules and the microscopic potential energy due to intermolecular forces.

\[U\!=\!\sum\!PE_{microscopic}+\!\sum\!KE_{microscopic}\]

Notes:
1. The internal energy of a system is an energy term and hence is measured in joules (J).
2. The commonly used symbol for representing internal energy is \(U\).

It turns out that the temperature of a body is a measure of the **average kinetic energy** of the molecules that make up the body. Increases in internal kinetic energy of a body can be detected by a rise in its temperature.

Increases in internal potential energy, on the other hand, does not result in any temperature rise. This is most dramatically demonstrated by boiling water: despite all the heat being supplied, the thermometer continues to read 100 \({}^{\circ}\)C.

KIASU-

Two objects are said to be in thermal equilibrium when they are in thermal contact and there is _no net exchange of thermal energy_ between them.

Temperature, \(T\)

If two objects are in _thermal equilibrium_, they have the _same temperature_:

Heat, \(Q\)

Heat is defined as the _transfer of energy_ between a system and its environment due to a difference in temperature between them.

2. The commonly used symbol for representing heat is \(Q\).

### Zeroth Law of Thermodynamics

If bodies A and B are _separately in thermal equilibrium_ with a third body C, then A and B are also in thermal equilibrium with each other.

If the Zeroth Law looks like a no-brainer to you, you are not alone. Let's take a little time to examine this framework that we have cobbled together. A few interesting deductions:

1. It is temperature, not internal energy, which decides the direction of heat flow between two bodies. Thermal equilibrium is attained when the molecules in both bodies have the same average kinetic energy.
2. Two bodies at the same temperature may have different internal energy. For example, for the same temperature, 1 kg of water has less internal energy than 2 kg of water, simply because it contains fewer molecules. For another example, 1 kg of water at 0 \({}^{\circ}\)C has more internal energy than 1 kg of ice also at 0 \({}^{\circ}\)C, simply because it possesses higher potential energy.
3. A rise in temperature of a body indicates a rise in its internal energy. However, a rise in its internal energy may not lead to a rise in its temperature. (This will be elaborated on in the sections on Latent Heat)
4. Heat is the transfer of thermal energy. So it is wrong to say "a water bath can store a lot of heat", or "a hot object has a lot of heat".

### 11.2 Thermometers

#### 11.2.1 Thermometric Property (Covered in Year 4 / O-Level Physics)

All thermometers are based on some material's thermometric property. A thermometric property is a physical quantity which varies continuously with temperature in a quantitative and repeatable manner. See **Appendix A** to review necessary and desirable features in a thermometric property.

\begin{tabular}{|p{113.8pt}|p{113.8pt}|} \hline
**Types of Thermometer1** & \multicolumn{2}{|c|}{Thermometric Property} \\ \hline Liquid-in-glass thermometer & Length of liquid in a capillary \\ \hline Thermocouple thermometer & E.m.f. between junctions of a wire at different temperatures \\ \hline Thermistor & Resistance of a semiconductor \\ \hline Platinum resistance thermometer & Resistance of a coil of wire \\ \hline Constant-volume gas thermometer & Pressure of a fixed mass of gas at constant volume \\ \hline \end{tabular}

Footnote 1: For more details of thermometers and their characteristics, refer to **Appendix B**.

#### 11.2.2 Centigrade Scale (Empirical scale)

The earliest scales were called **empirical scales** because they were based on experimental measurements of specific thermometric properties.

For example, the centigrade scale uses 0 *C to represent freezing point of water and 100 *C to represent boiling point of water. The temperatures between these two fixed points are divided into 100 equal intervals. Hence the centigrade temperature \(\theta\) is given by the formula \(\theta\)\(/^{\circ}\)C = \(\frac{X_{\theta}-X_{0}}{X_{\text{too}}-X_{0}}\times\)100, where \(X\) represents the thermometric property.

Say you are given a mercury-in-glass and a platinum resistance thermometer. The resistance values of the resistance thermometer are 40 \(\Omega\) and 80 \(\Omega\) at the ice and steam points, respectively. When both thermometers are used to measure the temperature of a cup of coffee, the mercury-in-glass thermometer reads 50 \({}^{\circ}\)C and the resistance value of the resistance is 55 \(\Omega\).

What temperature does the resistance thermometer read?

**Solution**:

Assumption: The resistance thermometer will be used to create a centigrade scale.

\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|c|} \hline  & Mercury-in-glass thermometer & Resistance of Platinum & \multicolumn{1}{c|}{Calibrated platinum resistance thermometer} \\ \hline Ice point & 0 \({}^{\circ}\)C & 40 \(\Omega\) & 0 \({}^{\circ}\)C (fixed point) \\ \hline Steam point & 100 \({}^{\circ}\)C & 80 \(\Omega\) & 100 \({}^{\circ}\)C (fixed point) \\ \hline Temperature of coffee & 50 \({}^{\circ}\)C & 55 \(\Omega\) & Assuming that the resistance increases linearly with temperature, an increase of temperature of 100 \({}^{\circ}\)C corresponds to an increase in resistance of 80 - 40 = 40 \(\Omega\). \\ \end{tabular}

So each increase in 1 \(\Omega\) resistance corresponds to an increase in temperature of \(\frac{100}{40}=2.5^{\circ}\)C.

Since the temperature of coffee corresponds to the resistance of 55 - 40 = 15 \(\Omega\) above resistance of platinum at ice point, the temperature is 15 x 2.5 = 37.5 \({}^{\circ}\)C

In short we are using this equation:

\(\partial\,l^{\circ}\,\mathrm{C}=\frac{X_{g}-X_{g}}{X_{100}-X_{0}}\times 100\)

\(\partial\,l^{\circ}\,\mathrm{C}=\frac{55-40}{80-40}\times 100=37.5^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\)

#### Kelvin Scale (Absolute Scale)

In the late 1600s, the study of gas behaviour under extremely low pressures yielded two remarkable discoveries:

1. The pressure of a constant volume of gas varies linearly with its temperature in "C; more intriguingly,
2. Regardless of the type of gas (nitrogen, oxygen, etc.), each linear curve extrapolates to the temperature -273.15C when pressure of the gas tends to zero.

This strongly suggests that there is a lowest temperature achievable. At **absolute zero** the system has its minimum (not zero!!) possible total internal (kinetic plus potential) energy.

**Absolute zero** is the lowest possible temperature. All substances have a **minimum** internal energy at this temperature.

Thus, Lord William Thomson Kelvin proposed a new temperature scale known as the ideal-gas scale, later renamed the Kelvin scale. In this scale, temperatures carry the unit of Kelvin (K). This extrapolated zero-pressure temperature of -273.15C is designated as 0 kevin (0 K), known as **absolute zero**. The ice point and steam point correspond to 273.15 K and 373.15 K on the Kelvin scale, respectively. (Refer to **Appendix D** for details on calibration of the ideal-gas scale.)

In Si nomenclature, "degree" is not used. So it is 0 K, not 0 "K. Another thing, it is always capitalised when abbreviated (K), but never capitalised when spelled (kevin). Don't argue. He was Lord Kelvin.

Because of quantum effects, it is not true that at 0 K, all molecular motion ceases. There are theoretical reasons for believing that absolute zero cannot be attained experimentally.

#### Thermodynamic Scale (Absolute Scale)

In 1848, Lord Kelvin finally succeeded in developing an absolute thermodynamic scale based on the laws of heat transfer in an ideal-heat engine. Since the ideal heat engine can be built out of any substance, this scale is fully absolute.

The **thermodynamic scale** is an absolute scale because it is a theoretical scale that is independent of the thermometric properties of any substance or on any empirical results.

Fortunately, Lord Kelvin was also able to show that the ideal-gas scale is equivalent to the thermodynamic scale. In other words, scientists were using an absolute scale even before they knew it was an absolute scale. In celebration, the ideal-gas scale was renamed the Kelvin scale.

www.KiasuExamPaper.comThe Celsius Scale was later proposed. The Celsius scale is just a mere arithmetic adjustment of the thermodynamic scale measured in kelvin.

\(T\,I^{\circ}\,C=T\,/\,K\)-273.15

Notice that the units of the Kelvin scale are the same size as those on the Celsius scale. In other words, an interval of 1 K is equal to an interval of 1\({}^{\circ}\)C. This leads to the simple conversion between the Kelvin and Celsius scales.

The chart below illustrates some important temperatures in both the Kelvin and Celsius scales.

Wait a minute, doesn't the Celsius Scale look like the old configrade scale? Well, the Celsius scale was designed to look like the configrade scale, so that we can continue to call the ice point 0 \({}^{\circ}\)C and the steam point 100 \({}^{\circ}\)C, so that the laymen don't even notice anything has changed. However, as a student of Physics, you should understand the conceptual distinction between them. The Celsius scale is based on the Kelvin scale, which is equivalent to the thermodynamics scale which is an absolute scale. The configrade Scale is an empirical scale based on the thermometric property of water.

### Specific Heat Capacity

The heat capacity of an object is the amount of energy that is required to raise the temperature of the object by one unit of temperature.

Notes:
1. The Si unit for heat capacity is J K\({}^{\text{-1}}\).
2. The commonly used symbol for representing heat capacity is C.

The specific heat capacity of a substance is the energy per unit mass required to raise the temperature of the substance by one unit of temperature.

Notes:
1. The Si unit for heat capacity is J kg\({}^{\text{-1}}\) K\({}^{\text{-1}}\).
2. The commonly used symbol for representing specific heat capacity is \(c\).

The table below lists specific heat capacities of some substances at 25 \({}^{\text{-1}}\)C and 1 atmospheric pressure.

\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|c|} \hline Substance & Specific heat capacity (J kg\({}^{\text{-1}}\) K\({}^{\text{-1}}\)) & Substance & Specific heat capacity (J kg\({}^{\text{-1}}\) K\({}^{\text{-1}}\)) \\ \hline Water & 4186 & Iron & 448 \\ \hline Ice & 2090 & Copper & 387 \\ \hline Aluminium & 900 & Mercury & 138 \\ \hline Glass & 837 & Lead & 128 \\ \hline \end{tabular}

The amount of heat \(Q\) supplied to an object to produce a change of temperature of \(\Delta T\) is given by

\[Q=C\Delta T\text{ or }\ Q=mc\Delta T\.\]

In equations in which \(T\) appears, such as the ideal gas law, the Kelvin temperature _must_ be used. In equations involving \(\Delta T\), it is possible to use either Celsius or Kelvin temperatures, because a change in temperature is the same in both scales. (\(T_{K}\neq T_{c}\) but \(\Delta T_{K}=\Delta T_{c}\))

### Solving Problems - Revisiting Conservation of Energy

#### Two-Body Problems

In a typical two-body problem, two bodies initially at different temperatures exchange heat until thermal equilibrium is achieved. Assuming an isolated system (i.e. the only heat exchange is between the two bodies), the law of conservation of energy allows us to write:

Energy lost by the hotter object = Energy gained by the colder object

\[m_{i}c_{x}(T_{x,i}-T_{t})=m_{i}c_{y}(T_{t}-T_{y,i})\]

**Worked Example 11.3.1 - Thermal Energy Between Two Bodies**

A 0.0500 kg metal ingot is heated to 200.0 \({}^{\circ}\)C and then dropped into a beaker containing 0.400 kg of water initially at 20.0 \({}^{\circ}\)C. If the final equilibrium temperature of the system is 22.4 \({}^{\circ}\)C, find the specific heat capacity of the metal. Hence, suggest what this metal could be.

**Solution:**

Assuming that the thermal energy absorbed by the beaker is negligible and that no energy is lost to the surroundings, we can further assume that the system of water and ingot is an isolated system.

We first look at the objects involved in the thermal transfer and look at the changes they go through:

\(\circ\)Ingot : Solid \(\theta_{\text{ingot}}=200.0^{\circ}\)C. \(\theta_{\text{fr}}=22.4^{\circ}\)C

Water : Liquid \(\theta_{\text{fr}}=20.0^{\circ}\)C. \(\theta_{\text{fr}}=22.4^{\circ}\)C

By conservation of energy,

Heat gained by the water = Heat lost by the metal

Therefore,

\[m_{\text{s}}c_{\text{fr}}\left(\beta_{t}-\beta_{t}\right)=m_{\text{ingot}} \,c_{\text{ingot}}\left(\partial_{\text{ingot}}-\partial\right)\]

\(\Rightarrow\) (0.400 kg) (4186 J kg\({}^{-1}\) K\({}^{1}\))(22.4\({}^{\circ}\)C - 20.0\({}^{\circ}\)C)

\(=\) (0.0500 kg)(\(\partial_{\text{ingot}}\))(200.0\({}^{\circ}\)C - 22.4\({}^{\circ}\)C)

\(\Rightarrow\) \(c_{\text{ingot}}\) = 453 J kg\({}^{-1}\) K\({}^{-1}\)

From the table, we see that the ingot is most likely to be iron.

#### Three or More Bodies Problems

If the problem involves \(n>2\) bodies exchanging thermal energy, each initially at a different temperature, it is easier to form our equation in the following manner:

\[\sum_{j=1}^{n}Q_{j}=0\] \[m_{i}c_{i}(T_{ij}-T_{r})+m_{2}c_{2}(T_{2,j}-T_{r})+...m_{n}c_{n}(T_ {n,j}-T_{r})=0\]

**Worked Example 11.3.2 - Thermal Energy Changes Between 3 Bodies**

Suppose 0.400 kg of water initially at 40.0 \({}^{\circ}\)C is poured into a 0.300 kg glass beaker having a temperature of 25.0 \({}^{\circ}\)C. A 0.500 kg block of aluminium at 37 \({}^{\circ}\)C is placed in the water and the system is insulated. Calculate the final equilibrium temperature of the system.

**Solution:**

The three objects involved in this process of heat transfer are

\[\begin{array}{lclcl}\text{Water}&:&\theta_{w}=40.0\ ^{\circ}\text{C}&\underline{Q_{w}} &\theta_{i}\\ \text{Aluminium}&:&\theta_{at}=37.0\ ^{\circ}\text{C}&\underline{Q_{si}}& \theta_{i}\\ \text{Glass Beaker}&:&\theta_{y}=25.0\ ^{\circ}\text{C}&\underline{Q_{g}}& \theta_{i}\end{array}\]

When the three objects are in thermal equilibrium finally, they should be at the final temperature, \(\theta_{i}\).

By conservation of energy, since the three objects form an isolated system, the net heat gain by the whole system is 0:

\[Q_{w}+Q_{at}+Q_{g}=0\quad\quad\Rightarrow\ m_{w}c_{w}(\theta\ \text{-}\ \theta_{i})+m_{at}\ c_{ai}\ (\theta\ \text{-}\ \theta_{i})+m_{g}\ c_{g}\ (\theta\ \text{-}\ \theta_{i})=0\]

Simplifying, we have

\[\begin{array}{lcl}\theta&=&\frac{m_{w}c_{w}\theta_{w}+m_{al}c_{ai}\theta_{ al}+m_{g}c_{g}\theta_{g}}{m_{w}c_{w}+m_{al}c_{ad}+m_{g}c_{g}}\\ &=&\frac{(0.400)\ \langle 4186\rangle(40.0)+(0.500)(900)(37.0)+(0.300)(837)(25.0 )}{(0.400)(4186)+(0.500)(900)+(0.300)(837)}\\ &=37.8\ ^{\circ}\text{C}\end{array}\]

**Analysis:**

Assuming that there are no energy losses to the surroundings,

Energy supplied by heater = Energy gained by the solid block

_IVI = mc(\(\theta\)- \(\theta\))_

The mass of the block \(m\) can be found using a mass balance. The specific heat capacity of the solid \(c\) can then be found.

**Notes:**

1. We keep the energy lost to the surrounding to a minimum by:

* lagging the solid well with a good insulator of heat
* not letting the temperature of the solid rise significantly e.g. >10 \({}^{\circ}\)C
* choosing a thermometer and heater of low heat capacities so that the heat they absorb will be negligible.
2. Glycerine is used to form a good thermal contact between the solid and thermometer, so that the thermometer truly measures the temperature of the solid and not the layer of air.

(The other common method that is used in determining heat capacities is known as the _method of mixtures_, which is the one which we commonly encounter in problems. This method should have been covered in the Secondary syllabus.)

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:301]

**Description:**

The liquid to be investigated is passed through a continuous flow calorimeter at a constant mass flow rate. The liquid enters the calorimeter at temperature \(\partial_{\text{in}}\), gets heated up by the heating coil, and leaves at temperature \(\partial_{\text{out}}\).

The liquid is allowed to flow for some time, until a steady state is obtained. This happens when the temperature readings at the inlet and outlet are constant. In this steady state, the temperatures \(\partial_{\text{in}}\) and \(\partial_{\text{out}}\) are recorded and so are the current \(l\) through the electrical heater and the potential difference \(V\) across the heater.

The mass rate of flow of liquid \(m\) is determined by collecting and weighing the mass of liquid \(M\) from the outlet in a measured time \(l\) using \(m\) = \(M\).

The whole experiment is then repeated with a new mass flow rate \(m^{\prime}\), but with the current and potential difference adjusted to \(l^{\prime}\) and \(V^{\prime}\) such that the temperatures at the outlet and inlet, \(\partial_{\text{out}}\) and \(\partial_{\text{in}}\), remain the same as before.

**Analysis:**

Electrical energy supplied by the electrical heater

= Energy gained by the liquid + Heat Lost to the surrounding

\(\Rightarrow\)\(l\)/\(\gamma\) = \(M\)c(\(\partial_{\text{out}}\) - \(\partial_{\text{in}}\)) + \(Q_{\text{turb}}\)/\(\gamma\)

Dividing the equation throughout by \(l\);

\(\Rightarrow\)\(l\)/ = \(m\)c(\(\partial_{\text{out}}\) - \(\partial_{\text{in}}\)) + \(q\) (1)

where \(q\) is the rate of heat loss to the surroundings.

Likewise, for the second set of data, we can write

\(l\)/\(\gamma\)' = \(m\)c(\(\partial_{\text{out}}\) - \(\partial_{\text{in}}\)) + \(q\) (2)

where \(c\) can be found.

**Notes:**

1. The rate of heat loss to the surroundings \(q\) is dependent on the temperature of the liquid and apparatus. Obviously, the hotter they are, the faster they lose heat. The two sets of data are collected at the same inlet and outlet temperatures so that \(q\) is the same in equations (1) and (2), allowing **heat loss to the surroundings to be eliminated through calculations** in equation (3).
2. During steady state, the temperature of the calorimeter is constant. No heat is used to heat up the calorimeter. It is thus not necessary to know the specific heat capacity of the apparatus.

### 11.4 Specific Latent Heat

There are three phases of matter: solid, liquid and gas2. A phase change involves a change in the internal energy, but no change in the temperature of the substance, even though heat is transferred between the substance and its surrounding.

Footnote 2: There is a fourth state of matter known as **plasma**, which occurs at extremely high temperatures consisting of atomic nuclei and electrons all moving at very high speeds. It has been estimated that most of the matter in the Universe (\(\sim 90\%\)) is actually plasma.

The **specific latent heat of fusion** (_L_) is defined as the _energy per unit mass_ required to change a substance from solid to liquid without a change in temperature.

SI unit: J kg\({}^{\dagger}\)

The heat supplied to a system of mass \(m\) to change it from solid phase to liquid phase, without causing a change in the temperature, is thus

\[Q=mL,\]

The **specific latent heat of vaporisation** (_L_) is defined as the _energy per unit mass_ required to change a substance from liquid to gas without a change in temperature.

SI unit: J kg\({}^{\dagger}\)

The heat supplied to a system of mass \(m\) to change it from liquid to gaseous phase, without causing a change in the temperature, is thus

\[Q=mL,\]

Figure 11.4a: Different processes involving phase changes.

**Worked Example 11.4.1 - Incomplete Phase Change**

A 5.00 kg block of ice at 0 \({}^{\circ}\)C is added to an insulated container partially filled with 10.0 kg of water at 15.0 \({}^{\circ}\)C.

(a) Find the final temperature, neglecting the heat capacity of the container.

(b) Find the mass of the ice that has melted.

**Strategy**:

This question is tricky because the ice does not melt entirely in this example. When there is any doubt concerning whether there will be a complete phase change, it is always good to make some preliminary calculations to check.

**Solution**:

**(a)**: First, let us find the energy required to melt the ice completely:

\(Q_{melt}\) = \(m_{\rm ice}\)\(L_{t}\) = (5.00 kg) (3.33 \(\times\) 10\({}^{5}\) J kg\({}^{+}\)) = 1.67 \(\times\) 10\({}^{6}\) J

The maximum energy that can be lost by the initial mass of water without freezing it:

\(Q_{water}\) = \(m_{water}\)\(\alpha_{water}\) (\(\delta_{init}\) - \(\delta_{init}\))

= (10.0 kg) (4 186 J kg\({}^{+}\)C\({}^{+}\))(15 \({}^{\circ}\)C - 0 \({}^{\circ}\)C)

= 6.29 \(\times\) 10\({}^{5}\) J

Since the energy that can be lost by the water is not sufficient to melt all the ice, the final state of the system is a mixture of water and ice and final temperature of the system is \(\delta\) = 0 \({}^{\circ}\)C.

**(b)**: To find the mass of ice that melted.

Since the mass of ice is already initially at melting point, the heat it gains from the water just goes to melting part of it.

Let \(m\) be the mass of the ice that has melted,

\(m\)\(L_{t}\) = \(Q_{water}\)

\(\bar{m}\) = \(\frac{Q_{water}}{L_{f}}\) = \(\frac{6.29\times 10^{5}\)J kg\({}^{+}\) = 1.89 kg

**Remarks**

If this problem is solved assuming (wrongly) that all the ice melts, a final temperature \(\partial_{t}\) = -16.5\({}^{\circ}\)C would have been obtained. This result would have been nonsensical!

**Figure 11.4.1a** Experimental setup to determine the specific latent heat of fusion of ice.

(a) The setup with the switch closed. (b) The setup with the switch opened as a control experiment

**Description**:

An electric heater is placed in a funnel containing ice. At the instant the switch \(S\) is closed, a beaker is placed below the funnel to collect the water from the melting ice. The rheostat is adjusted when necessary to maintain a constant current through the heater. After a measured time \(t\), the beaker is removed from below the funnel and the mass \(m_{2}\) of water collected is measured.

To take into consideration the mass of ice melted due to absorption of heat from the surroundings, the same amount of ice is placed in another funnel containing an electric heater which is not connected to the circuit. The mass \(m_{1}\) of ice melted after the measured time \(t\) is obtained by collecting the water with a beaker.

where \(h\) is the rate at which heat is lost to the surroundings

Dividing through by \(t\), we have \(IV=\dfrac{m}{t}l_{V_{t}}+h\)

Since we have two sets of data, we can write two equations:

\[\text{ Trial 1}: l_{t}V_{t}=\dfrac{m_{t}}{t_{1}}l_{V_{t}}+h \tag{1}\] \[\text{ Trial 2}: l_{t}V_{t}=\dfrac{m_{2}}{t_{2}}l_{V_{t}}+h\] (2) \[\text{ (1) - (2)}: l_{t}V_{t}-l_{t}V_{t}=(\dfrac{m_{1}}{t_{1}}-\dfrac{m_{2}}{t_{2}})l_{V} \tag{3}\]

Hence, \(L_{v}\) may be found.

**Notes:**

1. When the liquid is boiling, the temperature of the liquid remains constant. Hence, the rate at which heat is lost to the surroundings becomes constant. This allows heat loss to the surroundings to be

**eliminated through calculations** in equation (3).
2. Furthermore, since the temperature of the apparatus no longer rises, no energy is required to raise its temperature and hence the specific heat capacity of the experimental setup need not be considered.

### Kinetic Model of Matter

The kinetic theory of matter states that all matter is made up of a large number of tiny atoms or molecules which are in continuous motion.

#### 11.5.1 Phase Changes at a Microscopic Level

Fig 11.5.1 is a plot of the experimental measurement of temperature as energy is added to some solid at some initial temperature below its melting point.

Fig 11.5.1: For these parts of the graph, we clearly see that the energy added into the system increases the temperature of the system and hence, at the molecular level, will increase the microscopic random kinetic energy of the molecules.

**Parts B and D:**

In these parts of the graph, the system remains at the same temperature. Hence, there is no increase in the microscopic random kinetic energy of the molecules despite heat being added to it. So _what happened to the energy supplied_?

#### 11.5.1 Melting

The process during which a solid changes to a liquid at melting point is known as _melling_ (Part B) and the energy supplied to bring about the change is known as the latent heat of fusion.

During melting, the substance is transformed from the ordered solid phase to the disordered liquid phase. Work must be done to enable the molecules to overcome the attractive bonding between them, so that they can slip out of the rigid structure to an arrangement with weaker intermolecular forces. Latent heat provides the energy for that.

Since the intermolecular force is weaker in a liquid, the potential energy is higher (less negative). The heat supplied during melting goes only into increasing the potential energy component of the internal energy. The temperature does not rise since the kinetic-energy component remains constant during melting.

#### 11.5.1.2 Boiling

Similarly, in Part D, a process called _boiling_ occurs. In this case, the system changes from the liquid phase to the gaseous phase at boiling point.

During boiling, the molecules are totally liberated, ending up in a state in which there is virtually zero intermolecular force. Work must be done to enable molecules to overcome the attractive bonding and allow them to move around independently as gas molecules. Latent heat provides the energy for that.

Since the intermolecular force is virtually zero in a gas, the potential energy is virtually zero. The heat supplied during boiling goes only into increasing the potential energy component of the internal energy. The temperature does not rise since the kinetic-energy component remains constant during boiling.

#### 11.5.1.3 Comparison between L\({}_{t}\) and L\({}_{v}\)

The table below lists some of the specific latent heats of fusion and vaporisation of various substances.

\begin{tabular}{l l l l l} \hline \multicolumn{5}{l}{Specific Latent Heats of Fusion and Vaporisation} \\ \hline
**Substance** & **Melting Point** & **Latent Heat of** & **Boiling Point** & **Latent Heat of** \\  & _l_\({}^{\circ}\)**C** & **Fusion / J kg\({}^{\circ}\)** & _l_\({}^{\circ}\)**C** & **Vaporisation/ J kg\({}^{\circ}\)** \\ \hline Helium & -269.65 & \(5.23\times 10^{3}\) & -268.93 & \(2.09\times 10^{4}\) \\ Nitrogen & -209.97 & \(2.55\times 10^{4}\) & -195.81 & \(2.01\times 10^{5}\) \\ Oxygen & -218.79 & \(1.38\times 10^{4}\) & -182.97 & \(2.13\times 10^{5}\) \\ Ethyl Alcohol & -114 & \(1.04\times 10^{5}\) & 78 & \(8.54\times 10^{5}\) \\ Water & 0.00 & \(3.33\times 10^{5}\) & 100.00 & \(2.26\times 10^{6}\) \\ Sulphur & 119 & \(3.81\times 10^{4}\) & 444.60 & \(3.26\times 10^{5}\) \\ Lead & 327.3 & \(2.45\times 10^{4}\) & 1 750 & \(8.70\times 10^{5}\) \\ Aluminium & 660 & \(3.97\times 10^{5}\) & 2 450 & \(1.14\times 10^{7}\) \\ Silver & 960.80 & \(8.82\times 10^{4}\) & 2 193 & \(2.33\times 10^{6}\) \\ Gold & 1 063.00 & \(6.44\times 10^{4}\) & 2 660 & \(1.58\times 10^{6}\) \\ Copper & 1 083 & \(1.34\times 10^{5}\) & 1 187 & \(5.06\times 10^{6}\) \\ \hline \end{tabular}

Examining the table, you can observe that the specific latent heat of vaporisation for a given substance is higher than the specific latent heat of fusion.

There are two reasons for this:

(1) The required increase in potential energy for boiling is usually much larger than that for melting. The intermolecular bonds are completely broken down during boiling. Hence the amount of bond weakening (and thus the increase in potential energy) during boiling is much larger than that during melting.

(2) Work must be done against the atmospheric pressure during boiling and less so during melting. During melting, the molecules remain bonded. The change in volume of the substance is insignificant and hence very little work is done against the atmosphere. During boiling, however, the liquid-type bonds are broken down completely. The expansion of volume is much more significant and hence the work done against the atmosphere is also more significant.

Therefore, it is not surprising that more energy is required to vaporize a given mass of substance than to melt it.

#### 11.5.1.4 Evaporation

**Evaporation** is a process during which liquid changes phase to become a vapour. It takes place at the surface of the liquid and at any temperature.

Unlike boiling, evaporation can occur at any temperature. Boiling is in fact a special case of evaporation, where evaporation takes place at the boiling point of the liquid. At this boiling point, the rate of evaporation of the liquid is greatest.

Fig 11.5.1.4 Evaporation occurring at the surface of a liquid.

The average kinetic energy per molecule is proportional to the thermodynamic temperature. For a given temperature there is a range of kinetic energies around this average. Transfer of energy takes place when molecules collide with each other. A molecule near the surface of the liquid which possesses more kinetic energy than the potential energy (energy which binds it to the rest of the liquid) is able to leave the liquid and become a molecule in the vapour state.

It follows that the rate of evaporation can be increased by the following ways:

1. **Increase the surface area of the liquid.**
2. **Increase the temperature of the liquid.** An increase in temperature will increase the average kinetic energy of the molecules. Hence, there is a greater proportion of molecules with higher kinetic energies and, therefore, the probability of the molecules acquiring sufficient energy to escape at the surface is also greater.
3. **Reducing the air pressure just above the surface liquid.** Microscopically, it translates to having less air molecules present just above the surface of the liquid. This decreases the chance of a vapour molecule rebounding off an air molecule to return to the liquid.
4. **Having a straight above the liquid surface.** This will remove the vapour molecules before they have a chance to return to the liquid.

**Cooling Effect of Evaporation** During the process of evaporation, the more energetic molecules escape. The molecules that remain in the liquid are less energetic and hence have a lower average kinetic energy. Macroscopically, this is manifested as a decrease in the temperature of the liquid. This explains why evaporation is often accompanied by a cooling effect.

Fig 11.5.1.4: Evaporation occurring at the surface of a liquid.

### Ideal Gases

Chemically, different gases behave very differently, e.g. some are combustible, others are inert and reactions may take place when you mix them. However, physically, all gases behave identically, e.g. for a given amount of any gas, a specific increase in pressure at constant temperature will result in a specific decrease in volume. On a microscopic scale, forces are at play between the different molecules that will affect the short-term behaviour. However, in most cases, we may ignore these microscopic effects. We can then treat the gas as a so-called ideal gas. Air at sea level and room temperature, the atmospheres of stars like our sun and most of the gases in laboratories on earth all behave like ideal gases.

#### 11.6.1 Moles and Avogadro's Constant

The amount of gas is most often expressed in terms of the number of moles, \(n\);

One mole of any substance is that amount of substance that contains the Avogadro's number \(N_{n}=6.02\times 10^{23}\) of constituent particles (atoms or molecules).

The Avogadro constant is defined as the number of atoms in 0.012 kg of carbon-12.

The molar mass of a substance is defined as the mass of that substance divided by the number of moles of the substance. The number of moles \(n\) of a substance is related to its mass \(m\) and molar mass \(M\) through the expression \(n=\frac{m}{M}\).

Numerically, molar mass is simply the atomic mass expressed in g mol\({}^{\text{-}\dagger}\).

For example, the molar mass of helium gas (consisting of He atoms) is 4.00 x 10\({}^{\text{-}\ddagger}\) kg mol\({}^{\text{-}\dagger}\). The molar mass of oxygen gas (consisting of O\({}_{2}\) molecules) is 16.0 x 2 = 32.0 x 10\({}^{\text{-}\ddagger}\) kg mol\({}^{\text{-}\dagger}\). Molar masses are also commonly given in g mol\({}^{\text{-}\dagger}\), e.g. the molar mass of oxygen gas is 32.0 g mol\({}^{\text{-}\dagger}\).

The molar volume of a gas is the volume occupied by one mole of the gas. The molar volume \(V_{\text{m}}\) is equal to the molar mass divided by the density. The unit is m\({}^{\text{3}}\) mol\({}^{\text{-}\dagger}\).

#### 11.6.2 The Ideal Gas Equation

An ideal gas is a theoretical gas composed of a set of randomly moving, non-interacting point particles. The ideal-gas concept is useful because it obeys _the ideal gas law_, a simplified equation of state, and is amenable to analysis under statistical mechanics. You will have learnt about the ideal-gas law in Chemistry.

Early experiments in the 17th and 18th century with ideal gases resulted in three laws known as the gas laws. They are, in chronological order, Boyle's Law, Charles' Law and the Pressure Law. The observations made in these laws were summarized in the **equation of state for an ideal gas** which is known as the Ideal Gas Law3.

Footnote 3: The evolution of how Boyleâs, Charlesâ and the Pressure Law became the ideal Gas Lawâs laid out in Appendix E.

**Ideal Gas Law (in terms of no. of moles) :**

\(PV=nRT\) _[Need to be able to recall and use as stated in LQ]_

_where_\(P:\) pressure of the gas

\(V:\) volume occupied by the gas

\(n:\) amount of gas in terms of number of moles

\(T:\) thermodynamic temperature of the gas (in kelvins)

\(R:\) Universal Gas constant

**Ideal Gas Law (in terms of no. of molecules) :**

\(PV=NkT\)

where_\(N:\) amount of gas in terms of number of gas molecules

\(k:\) Boltzmann's constant

**Notes:**

**1.** Temperatures used in gas laws MUST ALWAYS be in kelvin.

**2.** The Universal Gas Constant \(R\) is a constant that is experimentally determined. In SI units,

\(R=8.31\) J mol\({}^{-1}\) K\({}^{-1}\)

**3.** The **Boltzmann constant** is related to \(R\) by the relation \(k=\frac{R}{N_{A}}\) and has a value of

\(k=\frac{R}{N_{A}}=1.38\times 10^{-23}\)JK\({}^{-1}\)

\(\Lambda\)

Be very clear that the \(k\) here is NOT the spring constant, it is the Boltzmann constant \(k\)

which is another constant.

We can now formally define an ideal gas in terms of its macroscopic quantities.

An **ideal gas** is a gas which obeys the _Equation of State for the Ideal Gas_ at all values of pressure, volume and temperature.

**Note:**

An ideal gas does not exist. Nevertheless real gases like hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen and carbon dioxide behave almost identically at normal pressures and temperatures. The ideal gas model tends to fail at very low temperatures or high pressures, when intermolecular forces and molecular size become important. It also fails for most heavy gases, such as water vapour and many refrigerants. At some point of low temperature and high pressure, real gases may turn into a liquid or a solid. The model of an ideal gas, however, does not allow such changes.

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:315]

#### 11.6.3 Molecular Interpretation of Pressure

Among other things, the **Kinetic Theory of Gases** assumes that a gas consists of a large number of molecules in rapid random motion, colliding elastically with one another and the walls of the container.

##### 11.6.3.1 Microscopic Model of an Ideal Gas

The kinetic theory of gases consists of a set of basic assumptions for the properties of gas molecules of an ideal gas. The assumptions are

* A gas consists of a very large number of molecules.
* The gas molecules are moving randomly.
* The collisions of the gas molecules with one another and with the walls of the container are perfectly elastic.
* There are no intermolecular forces of attraction.
* The volume of the gas molecules is negligible as compared to the volume of the container, which is the volume of the gas.
* The duration of collisions is negligible compared to the time interval between collisions.

This microscopic model of an ideal gas leads to the macroscopic description using the equation of state, \(pV=nRT\).

When the gas molecules collide elastically with the container of the gas, they rebound off the wall with the same speed. Clearly, the walls of the container exert a force on the gas molecules to cause their momentum to change in direction. (By Newton's \(2^{nd}\) Law, this force is equal to the rate of change of momentum of the molecule.) By Newton's 3rd Law, the molecules exert an equal but opposite force on the walls.

Since there is a large number of molecules, the number of collisions at any instant in time is very large and practically constant, resulting in a constant gas pressure.

The **pressure by the gas on the container** is the **average force per unit area exerted by the molecules on the walls of the container.**

The pressure \(P\) due to the gas molecules on a wall of the container can be written as

\[P = \frac{\mbox{average force exerted on the wall by molecules}}{\mbox{area of the wall}}\] \[= \frac{\mbox{(no. of collisions per unit time)(change of momentum per collision)}}{\mbox{area of the wall}}\]

We can now explain how the following factors can lead to an increase in pressure of a gas:

* **No. of molecules in the container.** All other conditions being constant, a larger number of molecules will imply-more collisions made with the wall of the container.
* **Volume of container.** Having a smaller container implies that the molecules need to travel less distance to reach the next wall after rebounding from one. The no. of collisions they make with the walls per unit time therefore increases. (Refer to Fig 11.6.3b.)
* **Mass of the molecule.** The type of gas used will determine the mass of the molecule which in turn determines the momentum that each molecule possesses. The larger the mass, the greater the momentum and thus the change of momentum of the molecules per collision is greater.
* **Velocities of the molecules.** The momentum of each gas molecule is also determined by its velocity. A molecule possessing a larger velocity will have a greater momentum and hence its change in momentum will correspondingly be larger per collision.

#### 11.6.3.2 Relationship between the Pressure of a gas in terms of its Microscopic Quantities

From the Kinetic Theory of Gases, a gas consists of many molecules in constant random motion, colliding elastically with each other and the walls of the container. The pressure of the gas is due to the collision of the gas molecules with the walls of the container.

We shall attempt to relate the macroscopic quantity, pressure, with the microscopic model of gases as a collection of atoms moving in random motion in a vessel. [_Need to know the derivation of the relationship_\(pV=\frac{1}{3}Nm\left\langle c^{2}\right\rangle\) _as stated in LO_]

**Step 1**

**Resolve the motion of molecule along x-y-z directions**

Consider a gas of \(N\) molecules in a cubical container of sides \(L\) (Fig. F1). Suppose the mass of a molecule is \(m\). Consider a molecule moving with a velocity \(c_{1}\). The velocity \(c_{1}\) of the molecule can be resolved into \(x\), \(y\) and \(z\) directions as \(u_{1}\), \(v_{1}\) and \(w_{1}\) respectively.

**Step 2**

**Find the change of momentum upon collision with a wall**

Consider the component of velocity \(-v_{I}\) along the \(y\)-axis. After colliding with the wall A, the molecule rebounds with a velocity \(v_{I}\) since the collision is perfectly elastic.

**Figure 11.6.3b** There are equal numbers of molecules in the enclosed portion of each diagram. As the volume of the gas decreases, the number of molecules per unit volume increases. The number of molecules striking a given area of the walls per unit time also increases, thus increasing the force on that area. This force per unit area is the pressure and hence the pressure increases.

### Step 3

**Find the force on the wall due to the bombardments of molecules on the wall**

Assuming that the molecule does not collide with other molecules, the time interval \(t\) between a collision of the molecule with the wall A and its next collision with the same wall is the same as the time the molecule takes to move from wall A to wall B and back and is given by:

\[t=\frac{2L}{v_{1}}\]

Hence, the number of collision with the wall A per second = \(t^{-1}=\frac{v_{1}}{2L}\).

Since the force exerted on the wall by this molecule = rate of change of momentum

\[=2mv_{1}\times\frac{v_{1}}{2L}=\frac{mv_{1}^{2}}{L}\]

If there are \(N\) molecules, each with the component of velocity along the \(y\)-axis as \(v_{1}\), \(v_{2}\), \(v_{3}\),..., \(v_{N}\) respectively, then the total force on wall A due to the collision of these \(N\) molecules is

\[F=\frac{mv_{1}^{2}}{L}+\frac{mv_{2}^{2}}{L}+\frac{mv_{3}^{2}}{L}+\cdots+\frac {mv_{N}^{2}}{L}.\]

### Step 4

**Find the pressure on the wall**

Pressure on wall A,

\[p=\frac{F}{L^{2}}=\frac{\frac{mv_{1}^{2}}{L}+\frac{mv_{2}^{2}}{L}+\frac{mv_{3 }^{2}}{L}+\cdots+\frac{mv_{N}^{2}}{L}}{L^{2}}=\frac{m}{L^{3}}\Big{(}v_{1}^{2} +v_{2}^{2}+v_{3}^{2}+\cdots+v_{N}^{2}\Big{)}}{,\]

where \(L^{3}\) = volume of container.

### Step 5

**Express in terms of root-mean-square speed \(v_{\text{rms}}\)**

Since \(c_{1}^{2}=u_{1}^{2}+v_{1}^{2}+w_{1}^{2}\)

\(c_{2}^{2}=u_{2}^{2}+v_{2}^{2}+w_{2}^{2}\)

\(c_{N}^{2}=u_{N}^{2}+v_{N}^{2}+w_{N}^{2}\)

Adding all equations and dividing by: We have

\(\frac{c_{1}^{2}+c_{2}^{2}+c_{3}^{2}+\cdots+c_{N}^{2}}{N}=\frac{u_{1}^{2}+u_{2 }^{2}+u_{3}^{2}+\cdots+u_{N}^{2}}{N}+\frac{v_{1}^{2}+v_{2}^{2}+v_{3}^{2}+ \cdots+v_{N}^{2}}{N}+\frac{w_{1}^{2}+w_{2}^{2}+w_{3}^{2}+\cdots+w_{N}^{2}}{N}\)

## Chapter 11.7 First law of thermodynamics

### 11.7 First law of thermodynamics

#### First Law Of Thermodynamics

The increase in the internal energy of a system is the sum of the heat supplied to the system and the work done on the system.

Expressed in a mathematical equation,

\(\Delta U=Q+W_{on}\)

where \(\Delta U\) : INCREASE in internal energy of the system \(Q\) : heat supplied TO the system \(W_{on}\) : work done ON the system

A system may be a solid, liquid or gas. Let's now look at each term in the equation more closely, for a system of a fixed amount of gas.

#### 11.7.1 Heat, \(Q\)

This term refers to the transfer of thermal energy through conduction, convection or radiation. \(Q\) is positive when heat flows into the gas (e.g. by bringing a flame to it), negative when heat flows out of the gas (e.g. by leaving it in a cold surrounding).

#### 11.7.2 Work, \(W\)

Work is done whenever the volume of a gas changes, much like work is done whenever the point of application of a force is displaced.

The formulae for calculation of work done ON and BY the gas are listed below. Read on for further elaboration.

\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|} \hline  & Work done ON the gas & Work done BY the gas \\ \hline Constant pressure & \(W_{on}=-p(V_{i}-V_{i})\) & \(W_{by}=p(V_{i}-V_{i})\) \\ \hline Varying pressure & \(W_{on}=-\int_{V_{i}}^{V_{i}}\rho\,dV\) & \(W_{by}=\,\dagger\int_{V_{i}}^{V_{i}}\rho\,dV\) \\ \hline When gas expands & negative & positive \\ \hline When gas contracts & positive & negative \\ \hline \end{tabular}

Suppose that the constant pressure of the gas in the cylinder is \(p\), the piston is of area \(A\) and the gas expands by pushing the piston a small distance \(\Delta x\), then by the definition of work, the work done BY the gas is given by

\[W_{by}=F\,\Delta x=p\,A\,\Delta x\]

Since the change in volume is given by \(\Delta V=A\,\Delta x\)

\[W_{by}=p\,\Delta\Delta x=p\,\Delta V\]

More generally, for varying pressure \(p\), if the volume of gas changes from some initial \(V_{i}\) to some final \(V_{i}\) the total work done BY the gas is then given by:

\[W_{by}=\int_{V_{i}}^{V}pdV\,\,\,\,(\mbox{or area under the $pV$ graph})\]

#### 11.7.2.2 W\({}_{\mbox{\scriptsize on}}\) = -W\({}_{\mbox{\scriptsize by}}\)

When a gas expands, the forces due to its pressure push back the piston. Hence work done BY the gas is positive. If energy is exchanged only between the gas and the surrounding and nothing else, we can interpret the positive work done BY a gas (by the gas pressure) when it expands, as negative work done ON the gas (by the surrounding pressure). It makes sense because the surrounding has withdrawn energy from the gas.

Likewise, when a gas contracts, the forces due to surrounding pressure push back the piston. Hence work done ON the gas is positive. We can interpret the positive work done ON a gas (by the surrounding pressure) when it contracts, as negative work done BY the gas (by the gas pressure). It makes sense because the gas has withdrawn energy from the surrounding.

We distinguish between the quantities work done ON the gas and work done BY the gas.

work done ON the gas = - (work done BY the gas)

#### 11.7.2.3 Microscopic View

When gas molecules hit an incoming piston, they rebound with speed larger than before the collision. The mean-square speed of the gas molecules, and thus the microscopic kinetic energy, increases. This agrees with the macroscopic interpretation that positive work is done on the gas when the gas is compressed.

Conversely, when gas molecules hit a retreating piston, they rebound with speed smaller than before the collision. The mean-square speed of the gas molecules, and thus the microscopic kinetic energy, decreases. This agrees with the macroscopic interpretation that negative work is done on the gas when the gas expands.

Figure 11.7:

#### 11.7.3 Increase in Internal Energy, \(\Delta U\)

This term refers to the change in internal energy. For an ideal gas, the internal energy is proportional to its thermodynamics temperature (\(\dot{U}\)=\(\frac{3}{2}nRT\) ). Hence a positive \(\Delta U\) must imply an increase in temperature of gas, and a negative \(\Delta U\) must imply a decrease in temperature of gas.

#### 11.7.4 \(\Delta U\) = \(Q\) + \(W_{\alpha}\)

Putting all the terms together, you should realize that the **First Law of Thermodynamics is a statement of the Principle of Conservation of Energy** on a thermodynamic system. And there are two ways to raise the temperature of a system: (1) by heating and (2) by doing work on it, _i.e._ by compressing it.

Because solids and liquids have practically fixed volumes, the magnitude of work done is usually insignificant. This leads many of us to have this misconception that heating is the only way to raise the temperature of a system. But for gases, which are highly compressible, the amount of work is significant and plays an important role in changing the temperature of the gas.

Likewise, many of us have the misconception that no change in temperature means no heat transfer. The truth is the temperature can remain constant if energy enters the gas by heat (\(Q\) is positive) and leaves through work (\(W_{\alpha}\) is negative).

### PV Graphs / Indicator Diagrams

The **state** of a fixed amount of gas is defined by three variables: Pressure \(P\), Volume \(V\), and Temperature, \(T\). A thermodynamic process is said to have taken place when the gas changes from one state to another.

Changes to the pressure and volume of the gas are usually shown as lines on a graph of pressure against volume, called \(PV\) graphs. Each point on the graph corresponds to one state. The lines showing the transition in states during a thermodynamics process are called **indicator diagrams**.

For example, the \(PV\) graph in Fig. 11.8 shows different ways by which the state of an ideal gas may take in going from initial state 1 to final state 2.

1. The gas may undergo an isobaric process (1-3) where the gas is held at constant pressure, followed by an isovolumetric process (3-2) where the gas is held at constant volume.
2. Or the gas may undergo an isothermal process (1-2) where the system is held at constant temperature. (It should be clear to you now that temperature of the gas is not directly shown on a \(PV\) graph. But it can always be calculated through the equation of state \(PV=nRT\) )

Figure 11.8:

#### Isothermal Process

An isothermal process is a process in which the temperature of the system remains constant.

(_i.e._\(\Delta T\) = 0 \(\Rightarrow\)\(\Delta U\) = 0 for a fixed mass of an ideal gas.)

An example of an isothermal process is the expansion of a cylinder of gas with very thin walls by pulling the piston extremely slowly, allowing sufficient time for the gas to gain heat through the thin wall to maintain thermal equilibrium with the surroundings.

The indicator diagram of this isothermal expansion is a hyperbolic curve known as an **isotherm**.

By the First Law of Thermodynamics,

For this example, the amount of heat gained from the surrounding (\(Q\) > 0) is equal to the area under the isothermal, which also represents the work done BY the gas (\(W_{\infty}\)< 0) expanding.

#### Isobaric Process

An isobaric process is a process that occurs at constant pressure. (\(W_{\infty}\) = -\(P\Delta V\))

An example of an isobaric process is the expansion of a cylinder of gas with freely moving and frictionless piston, by heating the gas slowly, so that the pressure of the gas is always at equilibrium with the atmospheric pressure,

The indicator diagram for this isobaric expansion is a horizontal line.

By the First Law of Thermodynamics,

For this example, of the heat received by the gas (\(Q\) > 0); some of it is used to do work against the atmospheric pressure during the expansion (\(W_{\infty}\) < 0) and the rest goes to increasing the internal energy of the gas when it rises in temperature from \(T_{t}\) to \(T_{r}\) (\(\Delta U\) > 0).

#### Isovolumetric Process

An isovolumetric process is one that takes place at constant volume. (\(W_{\infty}\)= 0)

An example of an isovolumetric process is heating a cylinder of gas with the piston clamped at a fixed position.

www.KiasuExamPaper.comThe indicator diagram for this isovolumetric expansion is a vertical line.

By the First Law of Thermodynamics,

\(\Delta U=Q_{in}+W_{on}\)

\(=Q_{in}+0\)

\(\Delta U=Q_{in}\)

For this example, all the heat received by the gas (\(Q>0\)) goes into increasing the internal energy of the gas when it rises in temperature from \(T_{t}\) to \(T_{t}\) (\(\Delta U>0\)).

#### Adiabatic Process

An adiabatic process is one in which no energy leaves or enters the system by heat. (\(Q=0\))

An example of an adiabatic process is the sudden compression of a cylinder of gas by pushing the piston rapidly, so that there is negligible time for energy to transfer by heat out of the system. If the walls of the cylinder are well-insulated, it will further ensure minimal heat exchange during the compression.

The indicator diagram for this adiabatic compression is a steep curve (steeper compared to the two isotherms it is bridging).

By the First Law of Thermodynamics,

\(\Delta U=Q_{in}+W_{on}\)

\(=0+(-\int\limits_{V_{t}}pdV)\)

\(\Delta U=-\int\limits_{V_{t}}pdV\)

For this example, all the work done on the gas (\(W_{on}>0\)) (represented by the area under the graph) goes into increasing the internal energy of the gas when its temperature rises from \(T_{t}\) to \(T_{t}\) (\(\Delta U>0\)).

#### Cyclic Process

A process that eventually returns a system to its initial state is called a cyclic process. As the internal energy \(U\) of the system depends only on the state of the system, in a cyclic process the net change of internal energy \(\Delta U\) will be equid to zero.

By the First Law of Thermodynamics,

\(\Delta U=Q_{in}+W_{on}\)

\(=Q_{in}+W_{on}\)

\(W_{on}=-Q_{in}\)

So work done on the system is equal in magnitude but opposite in sign to the heat supplied to the system.

For example, the indicator diagram on the left shows the system returning to state 1 through processes A then B. The area under curve A represents work done by the system, whereas the area under curve B represents work done on the system. Since the latter is larger, the net work done ON the system during one complete cycle is positive (\(W_{on}>0\)). For cyclic process, this also means that overall the system lost heat to the surrounding during one complete cycle (\(Q<0\)).

In fact, since \(\Delta U\) is zero, the area enclosed by the loop represents both the net work done ON the system, and the heat lost by the system, during one complete cycle.

The indicator diagram on the right shows the system returning to state 1 through processes B then A. Using similar logic, we can conclude that the net work done ON the system during one complete cycle is negative (\(W_{on}<0\)). For a cyclic process, this also means that overall heat is supplied to the system during one complete cycle (\(Q>0\)).

In fact, since \(\Delta U\) is zero, the area enclosed by the loop represents both the net work done BY the system, and the heat supplied to the system, during one complete cycle.

Appendix A Necessary and Desirable Features in a Thermometric Property Necessary Features in a Thermometric Property

The thermometric property in a thermometer must satisfy the following characteristics:

1. _The property must vary continuously with temperature._
2. _The property must be monotonic increasing or monotonic decreasing with temperature._

This is so that the value of the thermometric property is unique for each temperature.

To illustrate what we mean, let us look at why water would not be a suitable liquid in a liquid-in- glass thermometer.

When water is cooled, it initially contracts and below 4 \({}^{\circ}\)C, it starts expanding as it is cooled further (Fig 8.2.1). This implies that for the same volume of water, there are two possible readings of temperature.

Pause and Think However if two range of temperatures to be measured is limited to above 4 \({}^{\circ}\)C, then the volume of water can be used as a thermometric property. Why is it so?

1. _The value of the property at a temperature must be reproducible._

A thermometer is essentially useless, if on one occasion, the thermometric property gives one value and on another occasion, it gives another, for the same temperature. This implies that the same temperature measured on different occasions is indicated as different temperatures on the thermometer.

Figure 8.2.1: The variation of volume of water with temperature. Because of the unique behaviour of water with temperature, there will be a volume that corresponds to two temperatures that are different.

_(4) The property used must be suitable over the range being measured._

For example, the working range of alcohol-in-glass thermometer is generally limited by the melting and boiling point of alcohol. Above the boiling point, alcohol would turn gaseous and below the melting point the alcohol would turn solid.

Other Desirable Features in a Thermometric Property and Thermometer: - ('Good To Have')

In addition to the essential features that a thermometric property must possess, there are also certain desirable features that we would like our thermometric property and thermometer to have. They are:

_(1) Variation of the thermometric property is large or significant with temperature. (Good Sensitivity)_

If variation of the property with temperature is not sufficiently large, we will not be able to detect changes of the property for small changes in temperature. This reduces the _sensitivity_ (and _precision_) of the thermometer:

_(2) Variation of thermometric property with temperature is linear._

A thermometric property that varies linearly with temperature \(T\) allows easy calibration for use in a thermometer. Using two known values of the property at just two temperatures allows the relationship between the property and temperature to be both interpolated and extrapolated.

If the property is not linearly related to temperature, it can still be used. The thermometer will need to be calibrated at more fixed points. However, extrapolation of values beyond the range of the calibration points will be a challenge.

_(3) The thermoelectric property-styroid register changes in temperature quickly. (Good Responsiveness)_

In this case, the thermal conductivity of the thermometer should be high, so that the thermometer can come to thermal equilibrium with the environment that it measures quickly.

_(4) The thermometer should have a small heat capacity._

Having a _small heat capacity_ implies that the thermometer will not need to absorb a significant amount of energy from the surroundings (or conversely not give off too much heat to the surroundings) for it to come to thermal equilibrium with the surroundings, so that it does not disturb the environment that it is measuring.

Figure 1.3.2:

## Appendix B: Types of Thermometers

**(You should have cover this in Year 4 /'O' level Physics.)**

The choice of which thermometer to be used for a particular temperature depends on a variety of factors. These includes accuracy, sensitivity, convenience, size, nature of read-out required, cost, operating range of the thermometer, the temperature being measured, responsiveness and availability.

The different types of thermometers you should be familiar with are listed in the table below.

## Appendix C Limitations of the Centigrade Scale

Key problems with the centigrade scale were :

**(1) Two different types of thermometer using the two fixed points agree only at the calibration points.**

* Apart from the calibration points, a temperature measured with two different types of thermometers, e.g. a mercury-in-glass and a platinum resistance thermometer, may yield very different readings as different thermometric properties behave differently with temperature.

Let us use a graph (Fig. C1) to further illustrate what we mean.

Suppose we have two different types of thermometers, one having thermometric property \(X\) and the other having thermometric property \(Y\), which we have calibrated on the centigrade scale.

Based on the assumption of linearity, we would expect both the variation of \(X\) and \(Y\) with temperature to be given by the middle straight line.

Note that the vertical scale for \(X\) and \(Y\) have been scaled so that both \(X_{0}\) and \(Y_{0}\) indicate \(0\,^{\circ}\!C\). Similarly \(X_{iso}\) and \(Y_{iso}\) indicate \(100^{\circ}\!C\). The thermometers agree at the calibration points.

Suppose we use these calibrated thermometers (X and Y) to measure the temperature of an object which has a "true" temperature of \(\theta\).

At \(\theta\), Thermometric property registered by thermometer \(X=X_{\theta}\)

Temperature "read" by thermometer \(X=\theta_{X}\)

Temperature property registered by thermometer \(Y=Y_{\theta}\)

Temperature read by thermometer \(Y=\theta_{Y}\)

Note that:

Both thermometers do not indicate the true temperature \(\theta\), as both properties do not behave linearly with temperature.

They also do not agree with each other (\(\theta_{X}\neq\theta_{Y}\)) as they do not respond similarly with temperature.

**(2) Disagreement between Instruments of the Same Type**

* Even two thermometers of the same type may not agree with each other as the behaviour of the thermometric property with temperature depends on many external factors.
* For example, it is not possible to manufacture two thermometers of the same type to be exactly the same. In a mercury-in-glass thermometer it is extremely difficult to manufacture a bore of uniform cross-sectional area and hence the linear expansion between thermometers may differ slightly.

**(3) Problems in Reproducibility of the Fixed Points**

* The ice point and steam point of water are actually very difficult to duplicate in the laboratory.
* For ice point,

* one cannot simply put in some ice cubes in water. An ice cube in water may have a temperature of 0\({}^{\text{o}}\)C only right at the surface of the ice cubes, while the surrounding water a short distance away from the ice cubes may be at a temperature of 2 \({}^{\text{o}}\)C.
* To obtain 0 \({}^{\text{o}}\)C (melting point of ice), the ice water mixture must consist of finely crushed ice that is kept in equilibrium with the water by continuously stirring.
* Melting point of ice instead of the freezing point of water is used as the fixed point. This is because water does not necessarily freeze at 0\({}^{\text{o}}\)C. Pure water under very clean conditions may go well below 0 \({}^{\text{o}}\)C before suddenly crystallizing. Ordinary tap water is usually sufficiently contaminated so that it freezes below 0\({}^{\text{o}}\)C.
* For boiling point of water, it depends very much on the atmospheric pressure. For example, boiling point is defined to be 100 \({}^{\text{o}}\)C at normal atmospheric pressure at sea level. At normal atmospheric pressure in Denver, about a mile above sea level, the boiling point is about 95\({}^{\text{o}}\)C.

## Appendix D Calibration of a Thermometer Using the Ideal Gas Scale

The following steps illustrate how temperature is quantified in an ideal-gas scale :

**Step 1 : Choose a Thermometric Property, \(X\)**

We have seen that when the temperature of an ideal gas changes, both the pressure of the ideal gas as well as the volume of the ideal gas can change. Therefore, the property of the ideal gas that is used to set up the new scale of temperature is the product of pressure \(p\) and volume \(V\) i.e. \(pV\).

Charles and Guy-Lussac found that a linear relationship exist between \(pV\) and the temperature. Hence we have

\(pV=aT+b\)

where \(a\) and \(b\) are constants in the experiments.

The unit of temperature measured on this scale is Kelvin (K).

**Step 2 : Choosing Two Fixed Points**

**Lower Fixed Point : Absolute Zero**

As we have seen from Charles and Guy-Lussac's experiments that the graph of the product of pressure and volume curve is extrapolated to very low temperatures, all the gases seems to behave similarly and intersect the temperature axis at -273.15 \({}^{\circ}\)C. Hence, if we choose this point to be zero on our new temperature scale, the \(pV\) axis will be shifted to the left as in Figure B1.

Figure B1: **(a)** The \(pV\) of gases at extreme low pressures and volumes all extrapolates to the value of - 273.15 \({}^{\circ}\)C. **(b)** By assigning -273.15\({}^{\circ}\)C to be 0 \(K\) on the new temperature scale, the \(pV\) axis is shifted to the right, and \(pV\) becomes proportional to \(T\), the temperature on the new temperature scale.

With the lower fixed point chosen to be \(T=0\) K when \(pV=0\),44

Footnote 44: Note that the point 0 K is a point that is obtained from the extrapolation of the \(pV^{\prime}\) graph. In reality, the temperature of absolute zero (0 K) cannot be achieved, although laboratory experiments incorporating the laser cooling of atoms have come very close. What would happen to a gas if its temperature could reach 0 K (and did not liquefy or solidify)? As the \(pV^{\prime}\) vs. \(T\) curve indicates, the pressure exerted on the wall becomes zero. In a later section, we shall show that this pressure of the gas is proportional to the average kinetic energy of the gas molecules. Thus according to classical physics, the kinetic energy of the gas molecules would become zero at absolute zero, and molecular motion would cease; hence, the molecules would settle out on the bottom of the container: Quantum theory modifies this prediction and shows that some residual energy, called the _zero-point energy_, would remain at this low temperature.

Figure 1.5a: Triple point of water cell.

## Appendix E Getting the Ideal Gas Law

The early experiments in the \(17^{\text{th}}\) century and \(18^{\text{th}}\) century with ideal gases resulted in three laws known as the **gas laws**. They are, in chronological order :

Boyle's Law

Charles' Law

Pressure Law

**Boyle's Law** states that for a fixed mass of gas at constant temperature, the product of the pressure \(P\) of the gas and the volume \(V\) occupied by the gas is a constant.

From Boyle's Law, we have

\[PV=\text{constant}\Rightarrow\qquad P=\frac{\text{constant}}{V}\]

Hence, if we were to plot a graph of pressure \(P\) versus volume \(V\), we will obtain Fig. E1.

**Charles' Law** states that for a fixed mass of gas at constant pressure \(P\), the volume \(V\) occupied by the gas is directly proportional to the absolute temperature of the gas.

From Charles' Law we have,

\[V\propto T\Rightarrow\qquad V=(\text{constant})T\]

Hence, a plot of volume \(V\) versus temperature \(T\) would give Fig. E2.

Lastly, we have the Pressure Law which was also known as the Guy-Lussac's Law.

The **Pressure Law** states that for a fixed mass at constant volume, the pressure \(P\) of the gas is proportional to the absolute temperature \(T\) the gas is at.

Therefore, we have

\[P\propto T\Rightarrow\qquad P=(\text{constant})T\]

and a plot of pressure \(P\) against temperature \(T\) will give Fig. E3.

### Review of Basic Concepts

#### Electrical Charges

Many of us could have encountered such an experiment in our secondary school years. When a glass rod that has been rubbed with a silk cloth is brought near another rubber rod which has been rubbed with fur, they attract each other. However, when two rubber rods which have been rubbed with fur are brought together, they repel each other (Fig. 1):

#### Atomic Structure

All materials are made up of atoms. The structure of atoms can be described in terms of three particles - the negatively charged electron, the positively charged proton and the neutral neutron.

The protons and neutrons in an atom make up a small, very dense core called the **nucleus**, which is approximately \(10^{-16}\) on size (Fig. 2). Surrounding the nucleus are electrons, extending out to distances of approximately\(10^{10}\) on time-nucleus. These negatively charged electrons orbit the nucleus and the attractive electrical force on the electrons by the protons provides the force required to keep the electrons in orbit.

#### Atomic Structure

The nucleus is a very dense core called the **nucleus**, which is approximately \(10^{-16}\) on size (Fig. 2). Surrounding the nucleus are electrons, extending out to distances of approximately\(10^{10}\) on time-nucleus. These negatively charged electrons orbit the nucleus and the attractive electrical force on the electrons by the protons provides the force required to keep the electrons in orbit.

Figure 1: (a) A negatively charged rubber rod is attracted to a positively charged glass rod. (b) A negatively charged rubber rod is repelled by another negatively charged rubber rod. (Jewett, 2008)

Figure 2: The structure of an atom. The particular atom depicted here is lithium. (Young & Freedman, 2007)

#### Neutral Atoms, Positive Ions and Negative Ions

A **neutral atom** is one in which the **number of electrons equals the number of protons**. If one or more electrons are removed from this atom, the atom becomes positively charged and is known as a **positive ion**. A **negative ion** is an atom that has _gained_ one or more electrons. This process of gaining or losing electrons is called **ionisation**. (Fig. 3 illustrates an example.)

Furthermore, when the total number of protons in body equals the number of electrons in the body, the total charge is zero and the body is on the whole electrically neutral. **To charge a body _negatively_, we add electrons to the originally neutral body so that it has excess negative charges. Similarly, **to positively charge a body**, we can **remove electrons** (or sometimes add protons). Hence, when we speak of _charge_ of a _body_, we always mean its _net charge_.

#### Principles of Conservation and Quantization of Charges

Implicit to the discussion above are two very important principles:

* Principle of Conservation of Charges
* Principle of Quantization of Charges:

The _principle of conservation of charges_ states that charges cannot be created or destroyed. Hence, for any closed system, the sum of all electric charges must be constant.

Suppose we _rub a plastic rod_ with a piece of fur, both initially uncharged, and the plastic rod acquires a positive charge and the fur a negative charge. The principle of conservation of charges tells us that the positive charge acquired by the rod must be equal in magnitude to the charge on the fur. The rod has acquired a positive charge as it has transferred its electrons to the fur. Hence, in the charging process, charge is not created or destroyed; it is merely _transferred_ from one body to another.

Figure 3: (a) A neutral **thin** atom has equal number of protons and electrons. (b) A positive **thin** ion has a deficit of electrons. (c) A negative ion has an excess of electrons. (Young & Freedman, 2007)

**Principle of Quantization of Charges**

In 1909, Robert Millikan (1868 - 1953) discovered that **electric charge** always occurs as integral multiples of a fundamental amount of charge **e** which is also known as the **elementary charge**. Charges are therefore said to be **quantized**, i.e. any charge \(q\) must be equal to \(\pm Ne\) where \(N\) is some integer. (See [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oil_drop_experiment](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oil_drop_experiment).)

### The Electric Field

How do objects not in contact with each other affect each other's behaviour? How does a proton exert a pull on an electron at a distance? To explain 'action at a distance', physicists developed the idea of a field. You have learnt about the gravitational field that results from the presence of a mass. In this chapter you will learn about the electric field, which comes about due to the presence of a net charge.

The electric force between charged objects is an example of action at a distance. One charged object exerts a force on another even though they are not in physical contact. A charged object **A** sets up an electric field in the space around it. When a second charged object **B** is in the field set up by **A**, object **B** experiences a force (Fig. 4). Just as object **B** experiences a force as it is in the field set up by **A**, it also generates an electric field around itself and hence **A** experiences a force by **B** as it is in the electric field set up by **B**.

#### 12.2.1 Electric Field Strength

Definition: **Electric Field Strength**, \(E\)

The electric field strength1 at a given point is the **force** per unit charge that acts on a small positive test charge placed at that point.

Footnote 1: Note that though we distinguish the terms _electric field strength_ and _electric field_ here, they are often used interchangeably.

\[E=\frac{F}{q}\]

* Electric field strength is a **vector quantity**.
* The _direction of the electric field_ at a point is the **direction of the electric force experienced by a positive test charge (r.placed at that point.

The S.I. unit of electric field strength is newton per coulomb (N C\({}^{-1}\)).

Figure 4: When the charged object B is placed in the electric field set up by charged object A, it experiences a force. Similarly, A experiences a force as it is in the field of B. (Young & Freedman, 2007)

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:348]

#### 12.2.2 Electric Field Lines

A convenient way of visualizing electric field patterns is to draw straight or curved lines that are parallel to the electric field vector at every point in space. These **field lines** are also known as **lines of force** as they represent the direction of the force experienced by a _positive charge_ placed at that point in the field.

In general, the electric field lines must be able to represent the variations in the **magnitude** and **direction** of the electric field in a region of space, which is done in the following manner:

* **Magnitude of the Strength of the Electric Field:*
* The _number of field lines per unit area_, through a surface perpendicular to the lines, is proportional to the _magnitude_ of the electric field.
* Hence, where the lines are close together, the electric field is strong, while where the lines are far apart, the field is weak (Fig. 6).

* **Direction of the Electric Field:*
* The **direction of the electric field strength \(E\) at a point in an electric field is tangent to the electric field line at that point*
* and is the same as that of the electric field (Fig. 7).

* **Rules for Drawing Electric Field Lines2:*
* Electric field lines must begin from a positive charge and end on a negative charge. In the case of an excess of one type of charge, some lines will begin or end infinitely far away.

Footnote 2: There are also rules associated with drawing field lines from equipotential lines. We will cover that in a later section and summarize all the rules there.

2. The number of lines drawn leaving a positive charge or approaching a negative charge is proportional to the magnitude of the charge.

3. Field lines do not intersect because \(E\) at a point can only point in one direction.

Electric field lines are an effective way to pictorially represent the direction and strength of an electric field at different points in a region of space around a charged object. Only a finite number of lines from each charge can be drawn, which makes it appear as if the field only exists in certain parts. The field, in fact, is continuous, existing at every point in the region around the charged object.

Also try to avoid obtaining the wrong impression from a two-dimensional drawing of field lines used to describe three-dimensional situation.

\({}^{\text{\tiny{$\circ$}}}\) The charged parallel plates are said to produce a uniform electric field between them (indicated by the parallel lines between the plates), except near the edges, where there are _fringe effects_. This is because the charges at the edges are not distributed uniformly, unlike the other charges that are nearer to the centre of the plates:

Charge system (**d**) is known as an electric dipole and is a commonly occurring configuration, for instance, the charge distribution between the oxygen atom and hydrogen atom in a water molecule constitutes an electric dipole.

Fig. 8: Electric field of some common charge systems. (Jewett & Serway, 2008)

#### 12.2.3 Force between Two Point Charges (Coulomb's Law)

As stated earlier, when a charge \(Q\) is placed near another charge \(Q\), each of them will experience a force as they are in the field set up by the other charge. If \(Q\) and \(Q^{\prime}\) are point charges, the magnitude of the force can be determined by **Coulomb's Law**.

**Coulomb's Law**

The magnitude of the electrical force acting between two point charges is proportional to the product of the magnitude of the charges and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them.

\[\boxed{F=\frac{1}{4\pi\varepsilon_{0}}\frac{QQ^{\prime}}{t^{2}}}\]

where \(F\) : magnitude of the force between charges \(Q\) and \(Q^{\prime}\)

\(\varepsilon_{0}\) : permittivity of free space, and

\(r\) : the distance between \(Q\) and \(Q^{\prime}\)

**Notes:**

* There are, in reality, one force \(F\) acting on \(Q\) and another force \(F\)' acting on \(Q^{\prime}\). These two forces are actually a _(Newton's Third Law) action-and-reaction pair_.
* **Permitivity:**

In the S.I. system of units, the constant of proportionality in Coulomb's Law is usually written as _1/4\(\pi\varepsilon\)_. The constant \(\varepsilon\) is known as _permittivity_. Permittivity is a property of the medium, i.e. its value depends on the medium in which the charges are placed. If the space between the charges is _'free space'_ (or _vacuum_), its permittivity (known as permittivity of free space) will be denoted as \(\varepsilon_{0}\).

\[\boxed{\varepsilon_{0}=8.85\kappa\,10^{\prime 42}\,F\,m^{-1}}\]

where F (farad), is the unit for capacitance (expressed in SI units). 1F = 1CV\({}^{\dagger}\).

For most practical purposes the permittivity of 'air' is the same as that of 'free space'.

When using Coulomb's Law, just _substitute the magnitude of the charges_ (without the signs) to find the _magnitude of the force_.

Indicate the direction of the force (or whether it is attractive or repulsive) separately.

### Electric Potential

Using the concept of energy, it is possible to associate a scalar quantity with every point in an electric field.

Suppose an external agent does work, \(W\), in bringing a small positive charge \(q\) from infinity to a particular point in an electric field.

**Definition: Electric Potential, \(V\)**

The electric potential \(V\) at a point in an electric field is defined as the work done per unit charge, by an external force, in moving a small positive test charge from infinity to that point in the electric field, without any change in the kinetic energy.

\[V=\frac{W}{q}\]

The SI unit of potential is J C\({}^{-1}\) but it is more common to use the volt, V.

**Notes:**

1. Electric potential is a scalar quantity.
2. Note that the test charge moved is not the one generating the field, it is the charge used to test the field.

The work done in this definition refers to the work done by the external force and is commonly referred to as the "work done on the system". Some questions in A-levels will ask you to look for "work done by the system" instead - it is simply the work done by the internal force that the external force is trying to overcome. You can simply find it by using:

Work done on system (by external force) = - Work done by system (by the associated field force)

#### 12.3.1 Potential due to a Point Charge

The electric potential in the field by a point charge4\(Q\) is given by

Footnote 4: The actual derivation of this equation is not in the syllabus: If you are interested, you can find it in Appendix A.

\[V=\frac{1}{4\pi e_{\theta}}\frac{Q}{\Gamma}\]

where \(V\) is the potential at a point the electric field, at a distance \(r\) away from the point charge.

**Note:**

**What if I have two or more point charges, how do I determine the potential at a point in the electric field set up by these point charges?**

Since the electric potential is a scalar quantity, the resultant potential at a point in the field is the _algebraic summation_ of the potentials contributed by each charge at the point.

\[V_{\text{result}}=V_{t}+V_{2}+V_{3}+......\]

Remember to keep the signs in your substitution.

#### 12.3.2 Electric Potential Energy

The electric potential energy, \(U\), of a charge at a point in an electric field is defined as the work done by an external agent in moving the charge from infinity to that point, without any change in the kinetic energy.

**Relationships between \(U\) and \(V_{2}\)**

**Electric Potential Energy \(U\) of a charge \(Q\) placed at a point in an electric field with potential \(P\) is given by**

\(U=QV\)

**The work done by the external agent in moving a charge \(Q\) from point A to point B in an electric field is given by**

\(U_{A\to B}=U_{B}-U_{A}=Q(V_{B}-V_{A})\)

**where \(V_{A}\) and \(V_{B}\) are the potentials of the field at A and B respectively.**

**Notes:**:

**(i)**: \(U\) **may be positive of negative, depending on the sign of the charge and the potential.**
**(ii)**: Similar to gravitational potential energy, the electric potential energy is stored in a system of charges and not possessed by a single charge \(Q\).**

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:357]

Consider two point charges \(Q_{t}\) and \(Q_{2}\) separated by a distance \(r\) (Fig. 16). We can find the potential energy by viewing the situation as such: \(Q_{t}\) sets up an electric field around itself and \(Q_{2}\) is in the electric field of \(Q_{t}\).5 Hence,

Footnote 5: You can also analyse the situation by treating \(Q_{t}\) as setting up the field and \(Q_{t}\) being in the electric field by \(Q_{t}\). You would still end up with the same final expression for the electric potential energy for the system of two point charges.

Potential of the electric field by \(Q_{t}\) at the location of \(Q_{2}\), \(V\) = \(\frac{Q_{t}}{4\pi\varepsilon_{o}r}\)

Potential energy of the system = \(Q_{2}\)\(V\) = \(\frac{Q_{2}Q_{t}}{4\pi\varepsilon_{o}r}\)

Potential Energy Between Two Point Charges:

The potential energy \(U\) between two point charges \(Q_{t}\) and \(Q_{2}\) separated by a distance \(r\) is given by

\[U=\frac{QQ_{t}}{4\pi\varepsilon_{o}r}\]

In Coulomb's Law, as we are looking at the electrical force between the charges, any **negative sign represents the direction** and since we only wish to find the magnitude we ignore the signs of the charges.

Potential energy however is a **scalar quantity**, and the sign no longer indicates the direction. Hence, we **have to indicate the sign in the calculation!

What is the potential energy of a system of two or more charges?

Consider the system of point charges given by the diagram below. Let us determine the expression for the potential energy of this system.

Figure 17: Potential Energy of the System

To determine the potential energy of this system, we go back to the fundamentals of what potential energy is - the work done by an external force to bring a charge from infinity to the point in the electric field.

So we start off assuming that all the charges are at infinity and infinitely far away from each other. To determine the potential energy of the system, we carry out the following steps and determine the net work required to assemble the whole system.

**Step One:**: Bring \(q_{i}\) from infinity to the point. As there is no electric field initially in the region,

\(\Rightarrow\) Work done, \(W_{i}\) = 0 J
**Step Two:**: Bring \(q_{2}\) from infinity to the point. As \(q_{i}\) is already in place, it will have set up an electric field in the region and an external force will need to do work against the electrical force experienced by \(q_{2}\) due to its interaction with the field set up by \(q_{1}\). Hence,

\(\Rightarrow\) Work done, \(W_{2}\) = \(\frac{\vec{q_{i}}\vec{q_{j}}}{4\pi\varepsilon_{e^{\prime}_{12}}}\)
**Step Three:**: We bring \(q_{3}\) from infinity to its position in the electric field. Since \(q_{1}\) and \(q_{2}\) are now in place, the electric field in the region is now due to \(q_{1}\) and \(q_{2}\), and the external force will need to do work against the force on \(q_{3}\) due to its interaction with the field set up by both \(q_{2}\) and \(q_{3}\). Hence, the work done in this process is

\(\Rightarrow\) Work done, \(W_{3}\) = \(\frac{q_{i}\vec{q_{j}}}{4\pi\varepsilon_{e^{\prime}_{13}}}+\frac{q_{i}\vec{q_{ i}}}{4\pi\varepsilon_{e^{\prime}_{23}}}\)

Hence, the net potential energy of the system is the net work to assemble the system:

\(\Rightarrow\) Potential energy of this system, \(U\) = \(W_{i}+W_{2}+W_{3}\)

\(=\frac{\vec{q_{i}}\vec{q_{j}}}{4\pi\varepsilon_{e^{\prime}_{12}}}+\frac{\vec {q_{i}}\vec{q_{j}}}{4\pi\varepsilon_{e^{\prime}_{13}}}+\frac{\vec{q_{j}}\vec{ q_{j}}}{4\pi\varepsilon_{e^{\prime}_{23}}}\)
**Potential energy of a System of More than Two Point Charges**

Hence, for a system that contains more than two point charges, the

**Total potential energy can be found by calculating \(U\) for every pair of charges and summing the terms algebraically.

### Relation between Potential Energy and Electrical Force

In the chapter of "Work, Energy and Power", we learnt that the relationship between this force \(F\) and the potential energy of the charge \(U\) can be written as6

Footnote 6: The derivation of \(F=-\frac{dU}{dr}\) can be found in the chapter on âWork, Energy and Powerâ or, alternatively, in Appendix B.

**Note:**

* This equation gives us both the magnitude and direction of the force acting on the charge placed at a point in an electric field.
* The _magnitude_ of the force is given by: \[F=\left|\frac{dU}{dr}\right|=\left|\text{gradient of the $U$ vs. $r$ graph}\right|\] \[\circ\] The direction of the force on the charge is given by the negative (-) sign i.e. the force on the charge points in the direction where the decrease in potential energy is greatest.7 Footnote 7: In fact this is something fundamental in physics, for many systems, to achieve greater stability charges would try to move to a location such that the system will end up with lower potential energy.

#### 12.4.1 Relation between Potential Gradient and Electric Field Strength

Now, from above, we have

\[F=-\frac{dU}{dr}\] \[\Rightarrow qE=-\frac{d(qV)}{dr}\]

where \(q\) is the charge placed the point in the electric field with field strength \(E\) and potential \(V\). Dividing both sides by \(q\), we get the relationship

\[\boxed{E=-\frac{dV}{dr}}\]

**Note:**

* \(\frac{dV}{dr}\) is known as the _potential gradient_ of the field. It gives the variation of the potential of field at the point of consideration.
* The _magnitude_ of \(E\) is given by : \[E=\left|\frac{dV}{dr}\right|=\left|\text{gradient of the $V$ vs. $r$ graph}\right|\]
* The _direction of \(E\)_ is **towards decreasing potential**.

Figure 18: Relationship between potential and field strength.

### Representation of Electric Fields by Equipotential Lines or Surfaces

Another way to represent the electric field in a region is through _lines_ or _surfaces_ of equal potential.

**An equipotential surface is a surface in which every point on the surface is at the same potential.**

It is standard practice to draw these equipotential lines or surfaces the same number of volts apart. Recall, that the relationship between _potential V_ and _electric field strength_\(E\) is given by \(E=-\frac{d\mathcal{V}}{dr}\). Hence, from the equipotential lines or surfaces, the electric field can be "visualised".

In general:

* Magnitude of the electric field \(E\equiv\left|\frac{d\mathcal{V}}{dr}\right|\). Hence, the **closer the equipotential lines or surfaces** are to each other, the greater the change in potential for the same distance and hence **the stronger the electric field**.
* Direction of the **electric field points from higher potential to lower potential**.

Further, all points on an equipotential surface have the same potential, hence

* Potential gradient along an equipotential surface is zero.
* There is no component of electric field along an equipotential surface.
* Electric field lines are always perpendicular to equipotential surfaces.

Fig. 19 below shows some examples of equipotential surfaces for different systems.

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:362]

**the potential in the conductor is constant everywhere inside the conductor and equal to its value at the surface.**

**The electric field in the conductor is therefore zero (no potential gradient). Hence, no field lines are drawn.**

With this we can now summarise a more complete set of rules for drawing electric field lines and equipotential lines for charged systems. We will include the previous rules for completeness.

**Rules for Drawing Electric Field Lines and Equipotential lines:**

Electric field lines must begin from a positive charge and end on a negative charge. In the case of an excess of one type of charge, some lines will begin or end infinitely far away.

The number of lines drawn leaving a positive charge or approaching a negative charge is proportional to the magnitude of the charge.

Field lines do not intersect, because **E** at a point can only point in one direction.

Equipotential lines/surfaces are lines/surfaces that join all points of equal potential.

Equipotential lines/surfaces are drawn at equal intervals of potentials (e.g. 10 V, 20 V, 30 V etc.). Hence, the closer the equipotential lines or surfaces, the stronger the field.

Electric field lines are always perpendicular to lines of equal potential, e.g. to the surface of a conductor.

Electric field lines always point towards the direction in which potential is decreasing.

The electric field in a conductor is zero. No field lines are drawn.

#### Electric Field between Two Charged Parallel Plates

Consider two large metal plates that carry equal but opposite charges. (This can be done by connecting them to the opposite terminals of a constant voltage supply.) It is reasonable to suppose that within each plate, except at the edges, the charges on each plate are spread uniformly over the inside surface of each plate, because of their mutual repulsion and the attraction by the opposite charges on the other plate.

The lines of forces are straight, parallel to each other and equally spaced (except at the fringes - see Fig. 8(f)). The electric field in the space between the two plates is said to be uniform.

Suppose that in Fig. 20, the potential difference between two large charged metal plates is \(V\) and the plate separation is \(d\). Since the electric field strength between the plates is constant, from \(E=-\frac{dV}{dr}\) we have

* **Magnitude of the electric field strength:** \[E=\frac{V}{d}\]
* **Direction of the electric field:**\(E\) is directed from the plate with the higher potential to the plate with the lower potential.

#### 12.6.1 Motion of Charged Particles in a Uniform Electric Field

Consider a particle of mass \(m\), carrying charge \(q\), that is placed in a uniform electric field \(E\).

The field exerts a force \(qE\) on it, giving it an acceleration \(a\) in the direction of the force.

By Newton's second law, \(ma=qE\). The acceleration of the charge is therefore given by \(a=\frac{qE}{m}\).

In most questions, the mass is so small that the electric force overwhelms the gravitational force on the mass (weight). Hence the weight can be ignored.

For example, if you are considering an electron:

Its weight is 9.11 x10.31 x9.81 = 8.94 x10.30 N

If it is between parallel plates of potential difference 1.0 V and separation 10 cm, the electric force it experiences is (1.60 x 10.19) x 1.0/0.10 = 1.6 x10.18 N.

However, you should not assume that it is always the case that the weight can be ignored. You might get a question where the mass is large enough to make the weight significant compared to the electric force. (e.g. the Milkan oil drop experiment).

Figure 20: Electric Field between two parallel, oppositely charged plates.

A positively charged particle will accelerate in the direction of \(E\). A negatively charged particle will accelerate in the direction opposite to \(E\).

In general, the motion is that of an object moving under constant acceleration. There are two possible paths:

i.  If its initial velocity is zero or parallel to the direction of \(E\), the charged particle will move in a straight line parallel to \(E\).

ii.  If its initial velocity is inclined to the field \(E\), it will travel in a parabolic path.

Figure 21: Acceleration of charged particles subjected to an E-field.

**Example 6**

A beam of electrons, travelling at 1.35 x 10\({}^{7}\) m s\({}^{-1}\), enters a uniform electric field between two plates of length 0.060 m, which are separated by a distance of 0.020 m. The top plate is at +50 V while the lower plate is at -50 V. Find the angular deflection of the beam as electrons emerge from between the plates, assuming that the electrons never reach the upper plate.

## Appendix B Deriving the Relationship between Force and Potential Energy

The relationship between a (conservative) force \(F\) and the associated potential energy is given by

\[F=-\frac{dU}{dx}\]

This is a general relationship that applies to all conservative forces, of which the gravitational force and the electric force are examples.

To get this relationship, it is best to look at a specific case. In this case we will look at the electrical force \(F_{E}\) experienced by a charge in an electrical field.

By conservation of (mechanical) energy, assuming that no dissipative forces act on the system,

Work done by an external force on the system \(W=\) Increase in P.E. + Increase in K.E. of system

Assuming we move the object in the field at a constant velocity

\(\Rightarrow\) Increase in K.E. of system = 0

Now, let us move the object (a small charge in this case) by a small distance of \(\vec{dx}\) in the direction of the external force, the small amount of work done \(\vec{dW}\) by the external force is this case can be written as

\[\vec{dW}=F_{ext}\vec{dx}\]

Since the object is moving with constant velocity, \(F_{ext}=-F_{E}\)

Hence, we have

\[\vec{dW}=F_{ext}\vec{dx}\]

\[\Rightarrow\quad\vec{dW}=-F_{E}\vec{dx}\]

Now, as stated above, the work done by the external force results in the gain of potential energy of the system, hence we have

\[\Rightarrow\quad\vec{dU}=\vec{dW}=-F_{E}\vec{dx}\quad\quad\text{where $U$ is the potential energy}\]

which can be written as \(\quad\Rightarrow\quad\vec{F}_{E}=-\frac{dU}{d\vec{x}}\quad\quad\text{(derived)}\)

**Note:** In our derivation, the scenario given is that of a charge moved in an electric field but there was no substitution of the actual force or field. The scenario is given to only help in the visualisation. The same derivation can be used for the scenario of a mass moved in a gravitational field or even a spring stretched by an extension of \(x\); you would still be able to get the same general result.

### Practical Circuits

Symbols for various circuit elements

#### Circuit Essentials

Most complete electric circuits contain 6 parts:

1. An _energy source_ to provide the voltage needed to drive current through the circuit.
2. _Conductors_ through which the current can travel.
3. _Insulators_ to confine the current to the desired paths.
4. A _load_ to control the amount of current and convert the electrical energy supplied by the energy source.
5. A _control device_, often a switch, to start and stop the flow of current.
6. A _protection device_ to interrupt the circuit in case of a circuit malfunction

The first 4 of the above 6 parts are essential parts. All complete circuits use them. The control device is occasionally omitted. Protection devices are often omitted from circuits.

### 13.2 Electric Current

**Electric current** is the rate of flow of electric charge. It can be due to the flow of positive charges or negative charges or both.

Consider some charges moving through a cross-sectional area, which is perpendicular to the flow of charges. Suppose the electric charge \(\delta\,Q\) flows through the area in time \(\delta t\).

The electric current \(I\) through the area is the rate of flow of the electric charges through the cross-sectional area of the surface. \(I=\frac{\delta Q}{\delta t}\)

If the charge flows at an irregular or non-linear rate, then the current \(I_{i}\) due to this flow of charge is

\[\left[\begin{array}{c}I_{i}=\frac{dQ}{dt}\end{array}\right]\quad\mbox{( Formula for instantaneous current)}\]

If the charges flow such that in a time interval \(t\), the total charge which crosses that area is \(Q\), the average current \(I_{av}\) due to this flow of charge is

\[\left[\begin{array}{c}I_{av}=\frac{Q}{t}\end{array}\right]\quad\mbox{( Formula for average current)}\]

### 13.2.1 Direction of Electric Current

By convention, the direction of electric current (also known as conventional current) is chosen to be in the

**same direction as the flow of positive charges**.

If the conductor is a metal (e.g. copper), the current is due to the motion of negatively charged electrons (i.e. mobile valence electrons). By convention, the current due to the flow of negative charges to the left for example is treated as a current towards the right. _Conventional current is in the opposite direction to the flow of electrons.1_

Footnote 1: There is an interesting story on why the direction of current is always interpreted based on the flow of positive charges and not that of negative charges. Do find out more by investigating the work of Benjamin Franklin (1706 - 90) who was the first person to study the electric current.

#### The velocities of the current carriers

The diagram above shows a length of conductor of cross sectional area \(A\) m\({}^{2}\) containing \(n\) free (mobile) charges per m\({}^{3}\) (also known as the number density of charge carriers). The number of free charges (or electrons) in the conductor has to remain constant; when a current flows in a metallic wire, electrons enter it at one end and the same number leave at the other per unit time.

The motion of the electrons is not rectilinear but rather somewhat irregular, but we can assign an average or drift velocity \(\nu\) m s\({}^{-1}\) to the flow along the wire.

Suppose the section of the conductor between X and Y has a length \(L\) and a cross-sectional area \(A\), the total number \(N\) of charge carriers in the volume between X and Y is

\[N=nAL.\]

If each charge carrier has a charge of \(q\), then the total charge passing the point Y in time \(\Delta t\) is \(Nq\).

Therefore the current \(I\) passing point Y is

\[I =\frac{\text{total charge passing Y}}{\text{time taken}}=\frac{Nq} {\Delta t}\] \[=\frac{(nA)q}{\Delta t}\] \[=nA\left(\frac{L}{\Delta t}\right)q\]

For a given current \(I\), a good conducting material is one for which \(n\) is large and \(\nu\) therefore small. Copper is one of the best conductors, having in the region of 10\({}^{29}\) free electrons per m\({}^{3}\).

Using the equation above, we can estimate a typical value for \(\nu\) when a current of 1A flows through a copper wire of cross sectional area \(2.0\times 10^{-7}\)m\({}^{2}\) (about 0.5 mm diameter).

The actual values of the velocity \(\nu\) are amazingly small! However it is worth noting that this slow drift starts almost instantaneously in all parts of an electrical circuit completed when, for instance, a switch is closed. (Hence there is clearly no delay between closing a switch in one part of a room and the light in another part coming on.)C2107

#### 13.2.3 Units of Current & Charge

#### Current

SI unit for electric current is **ampere (A)**, named after the French scientist who established the laws of electromagnetism. It is defined in terms of the magnetic forces that act between current-carrying conductors. The definition will be given in the topic Electromagnetism.

#### Charge

SI unit for charge is **coulomb (C)**, after the French scientist who first investigated the forces acting between electric charges. The unit is defined in terms of SI base units, ampere (A) and second (s).

One **coulomb (C)** is the quantity of electric charge that pass a given point in a circuit when a steady current of one ampere flows through that point for one second.

1 coulomb = 1 ampere-second

1 C = 1 A s

If a steady current \(I\) flows in a conductor for a time interval \(t\), the quantity of electric charge \(Q\) that passes a cross-section of the conductor is given by the product of the current and time.

The magnitude of the charge on an electron is \(e\), i.e. 1.60 X 10\({}^{18}\) C;

The total charge \(Q\) of a quantity \(N\) of electrons is

\(Q=Ne\)

However, it is difficult to count the exceedingly large number of charge particles that constitute a measurable or observable steady current. Therefore, the unit for charge is not defined in terms of \(e\), but in terms of current \(I\).

### 13.3 Potential Difference and Electromotive Force

#### 13.3.1 Energy considerations of an electric current

The circulation of an electric current in a complete circuit leads to the continual dissipation of energy throughout the circuit in the form of heat and other forms of energy (e.g. light energy in a filament lamp, mechanical energy in an electric motor, etc). All this energy must be continuously supplied by a voltage source (or more correctly, an e.m.f.), e.g., battery, dynamo, etc.

#### 13.3.2 Electromotive Force (e.m.f.)

The sources of e.m.f. (stands for _electromotive force_) required in any complete circuit to generate electric current are therefore primarily means of _converting energy to electrical form from some other form_. E.g. a dry cell converts chemical energy to electrical energy, a dynamo converts kinetic energy to electrical energy, a microphone converts vibrational energy of a sound wave to electrical energy, etc.

The term e.m.f. has historical origins, but it is _NOT a force_, despite its name. It is more a measure of energy (i.e., electrical potential energy) rather than force.

The _electromotive force (e.m.f.), & of a source_ is defined as the energy converted _per unit electric charge_ to electrical energy in driving charge round a complete circuit.

The SI unit for e.m.f. is **volt (V)**, after the Italian scientist Alessandro Volta, who first investigated the action of electric batteries.

If charge \(Q\) flows in a circuit containing a source of e.m.f. \(\mathcal{E}\), the electrical energy supplied by the source to the whole circuit is

\[W=Q\mathcal{E}\]

The power \(P\) of the source varies with the current it drives and hence, we normally specify the power of the source with reference to the current, i.e. its power to current ratio. This ratio which is a constant of the electrical source is the e.m.f. of the source.

\[P=\frac{d\dot{W}}{dt}=\frac{dQ}{dt}i\mathcal{E}=I\mathcal{E}\]

\[\varepsilon=\frac{P}{I}\]

\[\begin{array}{c}\end{array}\]

#### 13.3.3 Potential Difference

A source of e.m.f. produces an _electric field_ between its terminals. The electric force will act on charge carriers in the circuit and a complete conducting path between the terminals allows the charge carriers to flow through the circuit.

Inside the conductors, the electric force does work on the moving charged particles. As a result, electrical potential energy is converted into heat and other forms of energy.

We can define the electric potential at a point in the circuit. The conventional current will flow from a point of higher electric potential to a point of lower electric potential in the circuit. The potential difference (p.d.), between two points in the circuit is the work done by the electric field to drive a unit charge from one point to the other.

The p.d. across a conductor is sometimes described as "voltage" or "potential drop" across the conductor:

Most of the time, _it is only differences of potential (i.e., p.d.) and NOT the potentials of points in a circuit that are of any significance in electric circuits_.

To determine the electric potential at a point in a circuit, it would be necessary to first identify a point to be at _conventional zero potential_. This point is used as a reference to which the potentials of other points in the circuit can be determined. Many electrical circuits have a point in the circuit that is connected to Earth. By convention, _Earth is taken to be at zero potential_. Electrical apparatus that is connected to the earth is said to be "earthed".

The _potential difference V between two points_ in a circuit is defined as the energy converted _per unit electric charge_ from electrical energy to other forms of energy when charge moved between the two points.

If the electrical energy \(W\) converted is for charge \(Q\) moved between the two points; then, potential difference \(V\) between two points is

\[V=\frac{W}{Q}.\]

Thus, if a charge \(Q\) flows in a part of a circuit across which there is a p.d. \(V,\)_the electrical energy supplied_ is given by \(QV\):

The SI unit for potential difference is **volt (V)**.

One volt is the potential difference across two points in a circuit in which one joule of electrical energy is converted to other forms of energy when one coulomb of charge is moved between the two points.

\[1\ V=\frac{1}{1\ C}\]

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:381]

### 13.5 Resistance and Resistivity

If a potential difference is applied across a conductor; then a current \(I\) will flow through the conductor. The potential difference required to produce a given current depends on a property of the conductor called its resistance. Resistivity is a property of the material of the conductor. Example: _resistance_ of copper wire, _resistivity_ of copper.

#### 13.5.1 Resistance

The resistance, \(R\), of a device is the **ratio** of the potential difference \(V\) across the device to the current \(I\) flowing through it.

\[R:=\frac{V}{I}\]

The electrical resistance of a conductor is due to its atoms obstructing the drift of electrons past them. Resistance is thus a measure of the obstruction to the movement of charge carriers.

Unit for resistance \(R\) is **ohm (\(\Omega\))**.

One ohm is the resistance of a conductor through which a current of one ampere flows when a potential difference of one volt exists across it.

\[\Omega=\Omega\,V\,A^{\mathrm{-1}}\]

#### 13.5.2 Ohm's Law (Review of High School Physics)

Georg Simon Ohm, a German physicist, was the first person to distinguish clearly between the two concepts. p.d. and current, and to investigate the relation between them. Ohm determined that there is a _direct proportionality_ between the potential difference applied across a metallic conductor and the resultant electric current through the conductor (known as Ohm's Law). From the results of his experiment, Ohm was able to define the fundamental relationship between voltage, current and resistance.

The current in a metallic conductor depends on a number of factors beside the p.d. across it. The most important of these is the temperature. But other physical conditions will also affect the current through it.

In addition, for electrolytic conduction, the relation between p.d. and current is complicated by the e.m.f that arises at the electrodes, accompanying the conversion of electrical energy to chemical energy. The same situation arises in other cases where the conductor is itself the site of an e.m.f. (e.g. the armature coil of a motor, or a coil in which a rapidly changing current induces an e.m.f. by self-induction).

KASUU

Thus, **Ohm's Law states that**

A _steady current_ flowing through _a metallic conductor_ is _proportional to the potential difference across it_, provided the _temperature and other physical conditions are constant_.

As a consequence of Ohm's Law, the resistance for a given metallic conductor under steady physical conditions is a constant. Such conductors are also known as **ohmic conductors.**

#### 13.5.3 Resistivity

The resistance of a uniform conductor is

(i) proportional to its length \(l\)

(ii) inversely proportional to its cross-sectional area \(A\).

(iii) dependent on a property of the material of the specimen known as its resistivity; \(\rho\).

The relationship between resistance and the above factors is given by

\[R=\rho\frac{l}{A}\]

Unit for resistivity is \(\Omega\) m.

The table shows the resistivity of some common materials.

\begin{tabular}{|l|c|} \hline  & **Resistivity at 20\({}^{\circ}\)C/** \\ Material & \(\Omega\) m \\ \hline silver & 1.6 x 10\({}^{-8}\) \\ copper & 1.7 x 10\({}^{-8}\) \\ gold & 2.2 x 10\({}^{-8}\) \\ iron & 10.1 x 10\({}^{-8}\) \\ nichrome & 110 x 10\({}^{-8}\) \\ skin (dry) & 3 x 10\({}^{4}\) \\ \hline \end{tabular}

**Example 4**

The resistivity of the human body is low compared with the resistivity of the skin which is about 3\(\times\)10\({}^{4}\)\(\Omega\)m for dry skin. For a layer of dry skin 1 mm thick, determine the resistance of a 1 cm\({}^{2}\) area of skin.

\(\bar{R}=\frac{\beta R}{A}\simeq\frac{(3\times(\beta^{*})(a00\mid)}{\{x\times 10^{-4} \}}\simeq\bar{g}\times(\beta^{*})\gamma_{L}\).

**13.5.4 Determination of resistance using an ammeter and a voltmeter**

In principle, the resistance \(R\) of a resistor can be found by measuring the current \(I\) which flows through it as a result of there being a potential difference, \(V\), across it, and substituting the measured values of \(I\) and \(V\) into the equation \(R=V/I\).

Whenever **an ammeter** is put into a circuit, it is put in **series** with the circuit components, and therefore it must have **zero resistance** if it is not to affect the current in the circuit.

**A voltmeter**, on the other hand, is always placed **in parallel** with a circuit component, and therefore must have **infinite resistance** if it is not to draw current through itself and alter the current in the circuit.

**An ideal ammeter has zero resistance; an ideal voltmeter has infinite resistance.**

A real ammeter has a resistance which can range from near zero to 1 \(\Omega\); a real voltmeter has a resistance, which can range from 20k \(\Omega\) to 2M \(\Omega\).

**13.5.4 Determination of resistance using an ammeter and a voltmeter**

In principle, the resistance \(R\) of a resistor can be found by measuring the current \(I\) which flows through it as a result of there being a potential difference, \(V\), across it, and substituting the measured values of \(I\) and \(V\) into the equation \(R=V/I\).

Whenever **an ammeter** is put into a circuit, it is put in **series** with the circuit components, and therefore it must have **zero resistance** if it is not to affect the current in the circuit.

**A voltmeter**, on the other hand, is always placed **in parallel** with a circuit component, and therefore must have **infinite resistance** if it is not to draw current through itself and alter the current in the circuit.

**An ideal ammeter has zero resistance; an ideal voltmeter has infinite resistance.**

A real ammeter has a resistance which can range from near zero to 1 \(\Omega\); a real voltmeter has a resistance, which can range from 20k \(\Omega\) to 2M \(\Omega\).

**13.5.6 Power dissipation in resistors (Joule heating)**

From the definitions of resistance and potential difference, we have learnt:

For an electric device of resistance \(R\) carrying a steady current \(I\):

The potential difference \(V\) across the device is: \(V=IR\)

The power dissipated by the device is: \(P=IV\)

Electric components manufactured especially for their resistance are called resistors. These resistors introduced into circuits provide resistances that are large compared with the resistance of the wires and connectors joining together the other circuit components.

When an electric current passes through a resistor, electrical energy is irreversibly transformed into thermal energy (Joule heating). The following two equations describe the rate of transfer of electrical energy to heat generated in resistor:

\[P=I(IR)=I^{2}R\]

This expresses the result first discovered experimentally by Joule:

_The rate of production of heat by an electric current in a given resistance is proportional to the square of the current flowing in it._

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:388]

### 13.6 I-V Characteristics of Various Electrical Components

It is often useful to understand how an electrical component (e.g. resistor, diode, etc) would behave or function in an electrical circuit. This information is often obtained from the I-V characteristics graphs of the required electrical component. Thus it is often useful and critical (for GCE A Level exams) to be able to understand and interpret the I-V characteristics graphs of different electrical components.

**At is important to note that for any I-V characteristics graph, the \(I\) represents the current passing through the component and \(V\) represents the p.d. across the component. Thus, the resistance of the component (for a particular set of \(I\) and \(V\) values) is obtained by directly dividing \(V\) by \(I\).**

**An ohmic conductor** is one in which the potential difference across it varies proportionally with the current through it.

**Metallic Conductor**

Metal conductors are ohmic conductors if their physical conditions remain constant. Experimentally, it can be shown that if the temperature of the conductor is kept constant, its resistance will be constant.

Any increase in the p.d. produces a proportionate increase in the current. The ratio of \(V\) to \(I\) is constant and the conductor has a single value of resistance. The \(I\)-\(V\) graph is a straight line passing through the origin.

Microscopically, the resistance of the metal conductor is due to collisions between the free electrons and the metal ions in the lattice. When the temperature of the conductor is kept constant, the amplitude of lattice ion vibrations will remain the same. This means that the hindrance to the flow of electrons is fixed and the resistance will remain constant.

**Filament Lamp (case of a metal conductor whose temperature is not controlled)**

When a larger p.d. is applied, the temperature of the filament increases due to the heating effect of the current. The resistance of the filament increases with temperature at larger values of p.d. and current.

The collisions between the electrons and lattice ions cause energy to be transferred to the lattice ions, enabling the ionic to vibrate with larger amplitudes - this implies an increase in the temperature of the filament, and beyond a certain point, the filament glows. The increased vibration of the lattice ions presents a greater hindrance to the flow of electrons, resulting in an increase in the resistance of the filament. Hence at any particular value of p.d. (except at low values of p.d. where there is no significant increase in temperature - any energy gained by the filament is dissipated to the surroundings quickly enough), the current in a filament is lower than that in an ohmic conductor.

**Semiconductor Diode**

A _p-n junction diode_ is a semiconductor which conducts well in one direction of p.d. (forward-bias direction) but conducts poorly when the p.d. is reversed (reverse-bias direction). In an ideal diode (which does not exist in real life), if the diode is reverse biased, the current flowing through it is zero. The ideal diode starts conducting at 0 V and for any positive voltage an infinite current flows and the diode acts like a short circuit (a "perfect" wire).

A real diode needs a minimum positive voltage, called the turn-on voltage, before it conducts any significant current. A silicon diode requires a p.d. around 0.7 V to conduct. Once the applied p.d. is above 0.7 V, the current rises very quickly with the p.d., and the diode has very small resistance. If the p.d. is applied in the opposite direction (_reverse biased_), almost zero current flows, and the diode has very high resistance.

Note that if the reverse-biased p.d. is too high, the diode may break down, resulting in a short circuit.

A diode is used as a rectifier for changing an alternating current to a direct current (greater detail is in the topic Alternating Current).

(A diode is essentially a p-n junction which will be dealt with in greater detail in the topic Lasers and Semiconductors.)

**Thermistor**

Usually, a thermistor is a semi-conductor device. Unlike the filament lamp, its **resistance decreases with increasing temperature.2**

Footnote 2: This is what we call a negative temperature coefficient (NTC) thermistor. There are also positive temperature coefficient thermistors, whose resistance increases with temperature.

As a larger p.d is applied, the current through the thermistor increases, causing the thermistor to heat up. Even thought there is increased-lattice vibrations which increases the hindrance to the flow of the charge carriers (like in the case of the filament), the extra thermal energy supplied to a thermistor _also_ causes it to release more charge carriers. The outcome is a decrease in the ratio of \(V\) to \(I\) - a fall in its resistance at higher values of p.d..

The graph below shows the resistance-temperature characteristic of a thermistor.

The thermistor's response is rapid and most sensitive to changes to temperature in the region of 200 K to 600K; it is a more limited range compared to thermocouples or resistance thermometers.

The thermistor is commonly used in very low temperature measurements as the high sensitivity (_idR/dT_) at low temperature enables more accurate measurements to be made. It can also be used to operate fire alarms and thermostats.

The current / flowing through a component vary with the potential difference \(V\) across it as shown.

### 13.7 Internal resistance of a source of e.m.f.

All practical sources of e.m.f. have internal resistance. The chemicals within a cell offer a resistance to current flow, known as the internal resistance of the cell.

#### 13.7.1 Terminal potential difference, e.m.f and internal resistance

Consider a simple circuit with a cell of e.m.f. \(\mathcal{E}\) and a load of resistance \(R\). From the energy point of view, the cell is the supplier while the load is the consumer of electrical energy. However, the cell has internal resistance which-would consume part of the energy. Hence, less energy is available to drive each coulomb round the external circuit.

A cell can be represented as an ideal source of e.m.f. in series with a resistor representing the internal resistance of the cell. This internal resistance _cannot be_ separated out or measured directly:

By the law of conservation of energy,

Energy supplied by the cell

= total energy consumed by the load and internal resistance of the cell

Since energy is supplied continuously, it follows that:

Power supplied by the cell

= total power consumed by the load and internal resistance of the cell

\[P_{cell}=P_{load}+P_{loss}\] \[I\varepsilon=IV_{R}+IV_{r}\] \[I\varepsilon=IV_{R}+I^{2}r\] \[\varepsilon=V_{R}+Ir\] \[V_{R}=\varepsilon-Ir\]

Thus, the _potential difference across the terminals of a cell_ (**terminal \(\boldsymbol{p.d.}\)**) of a source supplying current to an external circuit is always _smaller than its e.m.f._ due to the presence of the internal resistance, \(r\).

If the circuit is open, no-current-by-ill flow through the circuit and the terminal p.d. of the source will be equal to the e.m.f. of the source.

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:393]

### The Potential Divider Principle

A potential divider is an arrangement of resistors which is used to supply varying levels of p.d. to a circuit from fixed e.m.f. sources.

Consider two resistors connected in series.

The current \(I\) flowing in the circuit is given by

\[I=\frac{\varepsilon}{R_{\mathrm{t}}+R_{2}}\]

Therefore, the potential difference across \(R_{\mathrm{i}},V_{AC}\) is

\[V_{AC}=IR_{\mathrm{i}}\] \[=(\frac{\varepsilon}{R_{\mathrm{i}}+R_{2}})R_{\mathrm{i}}\] \[=\frac{R_{\mathrm{i}}}{R_{\mathrm{i}}+R_{2}}\varepsilon\]

The potential difference across \(R_{2},V_{CR}\) is

\[V_{CR}=IR_{2}\] \[=(\frac{\varepsilon}{R_{\mathrm{i}}+R_{2}})R_{2}\] \[=\frac{R_{2}}{R_{\mathrm{i}}+R_{2}}\varepsilon\]

Hence, by adjusting the ratio of \(R_{I}\) to \(R_{2}\), we can obtain the desired potential difference across AC.

Note: The supply voltage is divided proportionately between the two resistors if the same current flows in both resistors. The fraction depends on the _RATIO of the resistors_ and not the absolute values of the resistances. It is assumed that this cell has no internal resistance. If the cell has internal resistance, a proportionate amount of voltage will drop across the internal resistance.

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:395]

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:396]

### The Potentiometer

The potentiometer comprises a resistance wire AB and a jockey that is connected to the wire which can be shifted up and down the wire. It is usually connected to a driver circuit and a secondary circuit (the secondary circuit will be elaborated in a later section). In its most basic form, the driver circuit consists of a driver cell, \(\mathcal{E}\) and a long resistance wire, shown as AB below.

A voltmeter connected across AC will measure a fraction of the potential difference \(\mathcal{E}\). The fraction of \(\mathcal{E}\) measured out depends on where point C - a metallic contact called a jockey - is placed along AB.

The principle on which a potentiometer works is exactly the same as for a potential divider. Assuming that the resistance wire AB has a uniform cross-sectional area and a length \(l_{AB}\), the resistance \(R_{AC}\) will be proportional to the length \(l_{AC}\), since \(R=\frac{\rho l}{\mathcal{A}}\), or \(R\propto l\). Therefore,

\[V_{AC}=\frac{R_{AC}}{R_{AC}+R_{CB}}\,\varepsilon=\frac{l_{AC}}{l_{AB}}\,\varepsilon\]

A Balanced Potentiometer

The potentiometer is said to be **balanced** when the jockey is at a position on AB such that there is **NO current** through the galvanometer (essentially an ammeter). This means that there is no current or charge flow between the driver circuit and the secondary circuit, i.e. the driver circuit and secondary circuit are electrically isolated. The applications of the potentiometer that we will discuss in the next section rest on finding this balanced point.

#### Applications of the potentiometer

The secondary circuit can take on many forms, depending on the application of the potentiometer.

**Application 1: To determine the unknown e.m.f. of a cell**

The secondary circuit is just composed of the unknown e.m.f. source \(\mathcal{E}_{1}\).

By adjusting the length \(l_{AC}\),we change the p.d. \(V_{AC}\).

At the point where the galvanometer shows null deflection (no current flows through it and the potentiometer is balanced),

\[\begin{array}{l}\mathcal{E}_{1}=V_{XY}=V_{AC}\\ \mathcal{E}_{1}=\frac{l_{AC}}{l_{AB}}\,\mathcal{E}\end{array}\]

The length \(l_{AC}\) is known as the balanced length. By measuring \(l_{AC}\), with known \(l_{AB}\) and \(\mathcal{E}\), \(\mathcal{E}_{i}\) can be found.

Since there is no current flowing through the galvanometer, the potentiometer essentially functions as an ideal voltmeter!

**Application 2: To determine the unknown internal resistance of a cell**

A driver cell with e.m.f. \(\mathcal{E}\) has negligible internal resistance. The secondary circuit consists of an unknown e.m.f. \(\mathcal{E}i\) (with unknown internal resistance \(r\)) connected in series with an external resistor \(R\).

When **switch S is open**, there is no current flowing in XGHY.

When the galvanometer shows null deflection (no current flowing through AXYC),

\[V_{XY}=\mathcal{E}_{1}\] (since there is no p.d. across \[r\])

Since \(V_{AC}=V_{XY}\), \[V_{AC}=\mathcal{E}_{1}\]

From the driver circuit, \[V_{AC}=\frac{l_{AC}}{l_{AB}}\,\mathcal{E}\]

Therefore, \[\mathcal{E}_{1}=\frac{l_{AC}}{l_{AB}}\,\mathcal{E}\] [1]

\[\begin{array}{l}\text{KIASU}\\ \text{ExamPaper}\end{array}\]When we **close the switch**\(S\), a current flows in the circuit XGHY.

At a new balanced length AD (no current flows **between** the driver and secondary circuits, even though a current flows in the driver circuit and a (possibly different) current flows in the, secondary circuit),

\[V_{xx}=V_{Gm}=\frac{R}{R+r}\varepsilon_{1}\]

Since \(V_{AD}=V_{XY}\), \(\frac{l_{AD}}{l_{AB}}\,\varepsilon=\frac{R}{R+r}\,\varepsilon 1\)[2]

Since \(\varepsilon\), \(R\), \(l_{AC}\), \(l_{AD}\) and \(l_{AB}\) are known, \(\varepsilon_{I}\) and \(r\) can be calculated using equations [1] and [2].

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:400]

Practical pointers on the potentiometer

* The e.m.f.s of both the driver cell and the unknown cell should be constant throughout: If not, the balance length will fluctuate.
* The jockey should not be scraped along wire AB to determine the balance point, because doing so could damage the uniformity of the wire. Instead the jockey gently taps along the wire AB.
* A very sensitive galvanometer is needed if precise locations of the balance points are to be made. Such a galvanometer should be protected, by a large (typically 1 Mx) series resistance, from the relatively high current which would flow through it when the jockey is far away from the balanced point. The presence of this resistor will not affect the balance length since at balanced point, no current flows through the galvanometer (and the resistor of large resistance).

Advantages of using a potentiometer to measure voltage

* It draws no current. Therefore, it functions as an ideal voltmeter. When used to measure an unknown e.m.f., the value obtained at balanced point is the true e.m.f. If a practical voltmeter of resistance 1000 \(\Omega\) is used across an e.m.f. source of 10 V and internal resistance 5 \(\Omega\), the practical voltmeter will read only \(V=\frac{1000}{1005}\times 10=9.95\) V.
* which would be 9.5 V for the circuit below. If a practical voltmeter of resistance 1000 \(\Omega\) is used instead to measure the terminal p.d., the effective external resistance would be \((\frac{1}{95}+\frac{1}{1000})^{-1}\) and the voltmeter would read only 9.46 V.

Disadvantages of using a potentiometer to measure voltage

* It is slow in operation. It cannot be used to monitor rapidly changing voltages.
* The resistance wire may not be uniform due to wear and tear.

It should be appreciated that the measurement using a potentiometer is basically a method of comparison.

Appendix A Two different arrangements of voltmeter and ammeter to find a more accurate value of the resistance of an unknown resistor.

If the meters are not ideal, the significance of the error in the meter readings can be reduced by using the following circuit arrangements:

If the unknown \(R\) is expected to be low

The voltmeter reads the correct value of p.d. across \(R\).

While the ammeter reads the sum of the current flowing through both \(R\) and the voltmeter, because \(R\) is low, most of the current actually passes through \(R\) rather than the voltmeter - hence the error in the ammeter reading will not be too great.

If this circuit were used for a high \(R\) (perhaps comparable to the resistance of the voltmeter) instead, the ammeter will not be measuring a value of current close to the current actually flowing through \(R\) - the error in the ammeter reading will be more significant (the voltmeter still reads the p.d. across \(R\)).

If the unknown \(R\) is expected to be high

The ammeter reads the correct value of current flowing through \(R\).

While the voltmeter reads the sum of the p.d. across both \(R\) and the ammeter, because \(R\) is high, most of the p.d. actually falls across \(R\) - hence the error in the voltmeter reading will not be great.

If this circuit were used for a low \(R\) (perhaps comparable to the resistance of the ammeter) instead, the error in the voltmeter reading will be more significant (the ammeter still reads the current through \(R\)).

## Appendix B The Wheatstone bridge (Good to know)

Unknown resistances can be accurately measured using a circuit known as a Wheatstone bridge.

This circuit consists of the unknown resistance A, three known resistors B, C and D (where C is a variable resistor), a galvanometer, and a source of e.m.f.

Since point \(a\) is common and the potential at \(b\) = the potential at \(d\), the potential difference across _ab_ = potential difference across _ad_. Likewise, the potential difference across _bc_ = potential difference across _dc_.

Resistor C is varied until the galvanometer reading is zero (null deflection), i.e. there is no current flowing through the galvanometer between points \(b\) and \(d\). Under this condition of null deflection, the bridge is said to be balanced, and the current which flows in A flows in B as well; the current which flows in C flows in D as well.

\[\begin{array}{l}\dot{i}_{i}A=i_{2}C\\ i_{i}B=i_{2}D\end{array} \tag{1}\]

(2)

Since B, C and D are known, A can be found.

Advantages
* Variation in the e.m.f. of the supply does not affect the balance point.

Disadvantages
* This method is unreliable for finding small resistances (< 1 \(\Omega\)) because the unknown resistances of the (real) wires used to connect the resistors into the bridge are significant.
* This method is insensitive for high resistances (\(\sim\)10\({}^{6}\)\(\Omega\)) unless a highly sensitive galvanometer is used. This is because the presence of high resistances in the circuit causes the current through the galvanometer to be near zero even when the potentials of points \(b\) and \(d\) are far from each other.

## 14 Introduction

More than 2000 years ago, the Chinese discovered magnetic phenomena and have since been using them for navigation. However, it was only in the 1700s that magnetic properties and phenomena were studied in greater depth. Major discoveries made in the last 300 years have made a significant impact on our lives today. Scientists who have contributed significantly to our understanding of magnetic phenomena include Ampere, Oersted, Gauss, Henry and Faraday.

Magnetism has many useful applications in our everyday lives. Earth's magnetic field not only allows us to find our way around, but also enables birds to navigate when they migrate South during winter in the North. Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) which makes use of atoms' magnetic moments allows us to capture images of our body. Mobile phones, speakers and microphones make use of the concept of electromagnetic induction. The Great Industrial Revolution would not have been possible without knowing that the cutting of magnetic flux can generate electricity.

In the lectures on Electric Field, we have studied forces due to electric charges. You have learnt that there are two types of charges: positive and negative. In this topic, you will learn about forces due to magnetic fields, how magnetic fields can be generated and subsequently how electricity can be generated using magnetic fields. We will again be dealing with charges, as moving charges generate a magnetic field.

### 14.1 The Magnetic Field and Magnetic Flux Density

Just like the gravitational and electric fields, the magnetic field is an example of a _'field of force'_. The concept of a field illustrates _'action at a distance'_, which means that a suitable object placed in the field can experience a force. A region of space is said to be covered with a magnetic field when a magnetic material or a moving charge/current-carrying conductor placed in that region of space experiences a magnetic force.

As with electric fields, we can illustrate magnetic fields by drawing magnetic field lines. An easy way to draw magnetic field lines is to scatter fine iron flings around a magnet. Each iron filling is magnetized and acts like a tiny compass needle. Thus, the filings rearrange themselves along the magnetic field lines.

Note that,

* Magnetic field lines appear to originate from the north pole and end on the south pole of a magnet. But to be exact magnetic field lines have no start or end point. The field lines actually continue on within the magnet to form a complete loop.
* The _direction of a magnetic field at any point_ is indicated by the **tangent to the magnetic field line** at that point. The direction of the magnetic field at any point in space is the direction indicated by the north pole of a small compass needle placed at that point.
* Magnetic field lines **do not cross each other**.

Figure 14.1: Plotting of magnetic field lines of a magnet using a compass.

* The **strength of the magnetic field is indicated by the density of the field lines**; the magnetic field is stronger in regions where the field lines are relatively close together and weaker where they are relatively far apart.

Are magnetic field lines of any use?

For now, we use the **direction of the field lines at a point to define the direction of a vector quantity called magnetic flux density B**. As we shall soon discover, this quantity will come in very useful when we try to form an equation to calculate the force that the field can exert.

Further, the **magnitude of this quantity will indicate the strength of the magnetic field**. Nearer to the source, the magnetic field is stronger and thus \(B\) will have greater magnitude. The SI unit for magnetic flux density is the **tesla** (T).

### 14.2 Currents can generate Magnetic Fields

Before the 1800s, magnetism and electricity were considered to be two independent topics. Although there were a number of scientists who thought the two topics were related, they were unsuccessful in finding the link. It was only in 1820 that a Danish physicist, Hans Christian Oersted, discovered the link. He observed that a compass needle swung almost perpendicular to a current-carrying conductor as if attracted by a powerful magnet. This discovery prompted Ampere to work out the mathematical relationship between currents and magnetic fields known as Ampere's force law (not required in the 'A' level syllabus). It also inspired Faraday's work on electromagnetic induction. Oersted's discovery, which linked the motion of electric charges with the creation of a magnetic field, marked the beginning of an important discipline called electromagnetism.

Two important observations were made about the **magnetic field due to current-carrying conductors**:

1. The direction of the magnetic field is always _perpendicular_ to the direction of the current.
2. The strength of the magnetic field produced is dependent on the magnitude of the current.

Previously, we detect the presence of a magnetic field of a magnet by observing how the iron filings align themselves when sprinkled around the magnet. A similar effect is observed when we sprinkle iron filings around a current carrying wire!

Figure 14.2.1: Comasses, dodecard arrangement the element is on.

The direction of the magnetic field lines can be easily remembered using the Right-Hand Grip Rule.

#### Magnetic-Field Patterns

##### Long Straight Current-Carrying Conductor

Figure 14.2.3 shows the magnetic-field pattern produced by a long straight current-carrying conductor.

##### Magnetic-field pattern

Figure 14.2.3: Magnetic-field pattern due to a long straight current-carrying conductor.

Figure 14.2.2: Using the right-hand grip rule to determine the direction of the magnetic field due to a current-carrying conductor.

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:408]

The right-hand grip rule can still be used to determine the direction of the magnetic field lines produced by a current in circular coils. In general, there are 2 different methods that can be used:

1. For the straight-current scenario, the thumb represents the current and the coiling fingers representing the B-field.
2. For "circular" currents, we can exchange the fingers and the thumb to let the coiling fingers represent the direction of the currents in the circular coils and the thumb the direction of the magnetic-field lines passing through the cross-sectional area of the circular coils 1. Using the thumb to represent the B-field also allows us to determine the "north" pole of the circular coil, since B-field lines originate from the "north" pole of the magnet. This will be very useful later.
3. It is sometimes difficult to tell from the diagram which part represent the "front" of the coils. Standard conventions include using a hard line for the "front" and a dotted line for the "back" and using a thicker/bolder line for the "front" of the coil.

The magnetic flux density, \(B\), at the **centre** of a flat circular coil of \(N\) turns, radius, \(r\), and carrying current, \(I\), is given by

\[B=\frac{\mu_{o}NI}{2r}\]

where \(E\) is the permeability of the space which has the value 4tr x \(10^{7}\) H m\({}^{\dagger}\).

Again, we observe the same relationship as the magnetic field due to a long straight current-carrying conductor, that is, \(B\)**is _directly proportional_ to \(I\) but is _inversely proportional_ to the radius of the circular coil, \(r\)

Figure 14.2.4: Magnetic-field pattern of current flowing in circular loop.

The magnetic flux density, \(B\), at the **centre** of a long solenoid with \(n\) turns per unit length and carrying current, \(I\), is given by

\[B=\mu_{o}nI\]

where \(\mu_{o}\) is the **permeability of free space** which has the value \(4\pi\times 10^{-7}\) H m\({}^{-1}\).

Here, \(B\) is _directly proportional_ to \(I\) and \(n\) (the number of turns per unit length). Note that \(n\) (lower-case \(n\)) is the _number of turns per unit length_, whereas \(N\) (capital \(N\)) is the _total number of turns_.

One way of strengthening the magnetic field of a solenoid is to insert a piece of soft iron (ferrous core) into the solenoid. The magnetic flux density at the poles of the solenoid will be modified.

\[B=\frac{I}{2}\mu_{o}nI\Rightarrow B=\frac{I}{2}\mu nI\]

In this case, the soft iron, which can be permanently magnetized, increased \(\mu_{0}\) to \(\mu\). The magnetic domains in the soft iron causes the magnetic field to strengthen. Inserting the soft iron causes the permeability of free space, \(\mu_{0}\) to change to permeability of iron, \(\mu\). Materials that add to magnetic field in this manner are described as _ferromagnetic_.

Figure 14.2.5: Magnetic-field pattern of a current-carrying solenoid.

Examples of ferromagnetic materials include soft iron, steel, cobalt and nickel. They could all be magnetized.

Figure 14.2.6 Increasing field lines due to ferrous core

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:412]

### 14.3 Currents Experiencing a Force when in a Magnetic Field

Since currents can generate a magnetic field and magnetized conductors behave like magnets, maybe a current-carrying wire will experience a magnetic force when placed beside a magnet too. The figure below shows the results of such an experiment.

Observations from this experiment show that there is a relationship between the magnetic flux density of the magnetic field present and the force experienced by the current-carrying wire.

**Maximum force** is experienced by the wire when the magnetic flux density \(B\) and the wire are **perpendicular to each other**. The direction of the force that results, is perpendicular to both \(B\) and the wire. Quantitatively, in this orientation, we have

\[F_{B}=BIL\]

where \(F_{B}\) is the force exerted on the wire, \(l\) is the current flowing in the wire and \(L\) is the length of the wire.

The relative directions are easily remembered by **Fleming's Left-Hand Rule**,

Figure 14.3.2 Fleming's Left-Hand Rule.

Figure 14.3.1 Each sketch shows the direction of the force exerted on a current-carrying wire placed near a magnet.

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:414]

### Defining the Magnetic Flux Density and the Tesla

We may now define quantitatively the magnetic flux density, \(B\):

Definition of Magnetic Flux Density, \(B\):

The **magnetic flux density** is defined as the **force** per unit length per unit current acting on a straight current-carrying conductor placed perpendicular to a magnetic field.

\[B=\frac{F}{IL\sin 90^{0}}\]

Definition of Tesla (T):

The magnetic flux density of a magnetic field is said to be 1 tesla, if the force per unit length per unit current which acts on a straight current-carrying conductor placed perpendicular to the magnetic field is 1 newton per metre per ampere.

Magnetic flux density, \(B\), is a **vector** quantity and the S.I. **unit is the tesla (T)**.

For different shapes of current-carrying wires, the magnetic fields around the wires will in general be different. There are ways to measure experimentally the value of \(B\), which generally depends on the current that is generating the magnetic field as well as the distance from the wire.

### Measuring Magnetic Flux Density using a Current Balance

How a current balance works:

1. A wire frame AXYC is balanced on 2 knife edges through which a current \(I\) can pass from a battery. The frame is arranged such that the side AC of the frame (of length \(L\)) lies within the magnetic field whose flux density \(B\) is to be determined.
2. When there is no current-charge frame is horizontal, as the force acting on AC is zero. When current flows through a magnetic force acts on AC and pushes that side of the frame downwards (by Fleming's Left-Hand Rule).
3. A known mass is loaded on the right side to restore the frame to its horizontal position.

Figure 14.4:1 Current balance.

4. Consider the free-body diagram of the wire frame, taking moments about the knife edges, clockwise moments = anticlockwise moments (mg) \(\nu\) = (BIL)u

\[B=\frac{mg\nu}{ILu}\]

Side view of wire frame.

### 14.5 Forces Between 2 Long Parallel Current-Carrying Conductors

Now that we know that a current can generate magnetic fields like a magnet and that they can also experience a magnetic force when they are near other magnets, it is natural to consider what happens if we replace the magnet with another current-carrying wire.

When 2 parallel long wires are placed in a vacuum, **each wire experiences a force as it will be in a magnetic field generated by the other wire**.

Current \(I_{X}\) sets up a magnetic field that interacts with current \(I_{Y}\). Therefore the force acting on \(I_{Y}\) due to \(B_{X}\) is

\[F_{xx}=B_{x}I_{Y}I\]

Recall that \(B_{X}\) is given by

\[B_{x}=\frac{\mu_{0}I_{X}}{2\pi}\]

Hence the force

\[F_{xx}=\frac{\mu_{0}I_{X}I_{Y}I}{2\pi}\]

The direction of the force on \(I_{Y}\) can be found using Fleming's Left-Hand Rule. In this case, the force on \(I_{Y}\) due to \(I_{X}\) is towards \(I_{x}\). We can go through the same analysis to understand the force acting on \(I_{X}\) as a result of \(I_{Y}\), but honestly, there is no need to do so. This is because we can simply apply **Newton's 3\({}^{\text{nd}}\) law** and conclude that the force on \(I_{X}\) due to \(I_{Y}\) is of the same magnitude but in the opposite direction!

Hence the force on \(I_{X}\) due to \(I_{Y}\) is also \(F_{xx}=\frac{\mu_{0}I_{X}I_{Y}I}{2\pi}\).

It is interesting to note that in this case where the **two currents are flowing in the same direction, the force between them is attractive**, We can apply a similar analysis to currents flowing in opposite directions and find that the force between them is repulsive.

Figure 14.5.2 Sketch showing the magnetic fields and forces on parallel current-carrying wires.

Figure 14.5.2 Sketch showing the magnetic fields and forces on parallel current-carrying wires.

### 14.6 Revisiting the DC Motor

Consider a rectangular coil PORS of \(N\) turns pivoted so that it can rotate freely about a vertical axis which is perpendicular to a uniform horizontal magnetic field of flux density \(B\). Let the normal to the plane of the coil make an angle \(\theta\) with the field (Figure 14.6.1 (b)).

The side PS of length \(h\) is perpendicular to the magnetic field (from N to S) and so the magnetic force on it is given by

\[F=B\!I\!h\]

If the coil has \(N\) turns, the length of the conductor is increased \(N\) times and so the force acting on side PS is

\[F=N\!B\!I\!h\]

The force acting on side QR is also given by \(F=N\!B\!I\!h\), but its direction is opposite to that on PS, as shown in Figure 15.6.1 (b). The force on side PQ cancels out the force on side SR as these two forces are equal in magnitude but opposite in direction.

The two forces on sides PS and QR tend to turn the coil about an axis XY passing through the middle of the coil. These two forces together form a couple and the torque due to this couple is given by

\[\tau=F_{g}(b\sin\theta)\]

But \(h\,x\,b=\) Area. of the coil. So

\[\tau=N\!B\!I\!h\!h\!\sin\theta\]

Figure 14.6.1 The DC motor.

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:420]

### 14.8 Motion of a Charged Particle in a Uniform Magnetic Field

Let's now look at how moving charges that are not confined within a wire is affected by a magnetic field. We will again use Fleming's Left Hand Rule to find the direction of this force.

Consider a positively charged particle entering a magnetic field with velocity \(v\).

Using Fleming's Left Hand Rule and using the concept that the direction of the convention current is the direction of motion of the positively charged particle, we can conclude that the direction of the force at this instant is upwards. This cause the particle to be deflected from its initial path.

However, note that the direction of the force remains perpendicular to the direction of velocity and magnetic field (Fleming's Left Hand Rule) even as the charged particle deflects, hence the charged particle will move in a circular path! The magnetic force provides the centripetal acceleration needed for the charged particle to travel in a circular path.

The magnetic force on the positive charge provides the centripetal force:

\[Bqv=\frac{mv^{2}}{r}\text{, where r is the radius of the circular path}\]

From this equation for the radius of the path, we can deduce that for particles entering the magnetic field with the same velocity, the radius would be proportional to the mass-to-charge ratio of the particle (i.e. \(\frac{m}{q}\) ). The ratio of the charge on a particle to the mass of the particle (i.e. \(\frac{q}{m}\) ) is known as the _specific charge_.

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:422]

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:423]

### 14.10 Velocity Selector

In many experiments involving moving charged particles, it is important that all particles move with essentially the same speed. This can be achieved by applying a combination of an electric field and a magnetic field oriented as shown in the figure below.

A uniform \(E\) field is applied vertically downwards and a uniform magnetic field is applied in the direction perpendicular to the electric field. Consider a positive charge entering the region from the right with velocity \(v\).

It experiences a electric force \(qE\) that is downwards (in the same direction as the electric field) and a magnetic force \(Bqv\) that is upwards (Fleming's Left Hand Rule). By adjusting the magnitudes of the electric and magnetic fields, we can set up a scenario so that \(qE=Bqv\) and the particle experiences no resultant force, and moves through the fields in a straight horizontal line!

\[\begin{array}{l}\Sigma F=0\\ F_{g}=F_{g}\\ Bqv=qE\\ v=\frac{E}{B}=\frac{V}{Bd}\end{array}\]

When we have many particles of different speeds being projected into this region, only particles of velocity \(v=\frac{E}{B}\) will pass through undeflected.

For particles with speeds greater than this, the magnetic force will be larger than the electric force and deflect upwards.

For particles with speeds less than this, the magnetic force will be less than the electric force, and they deflect downwards.

Not all E and B fields that are perpendicular to each other will work as a velocity selector. It is important to note that the concept behind this application is that the particle experiences no resultant force when travelling in the crossed fields. Hence it is important to ensure that the direction of the electric force is opposite to the direction of the magnetic force set up by the two fields.

Figure 14.10 Velocity Selector

## APPENDIX A: Earth as a Magnet

Our Earth possesses a weak magnetic field. The Earth's magnetic field pattern is as if a gigantic bar magnet is embedded within it. As shown in Figure A.1, the orientation of this fictitious bar magnet defines a magnetic axis for the Earth.

The location where the _magnetic axis_ crosses the surface in the northern hemisphere is known as the _south magnetic pole_. The _north geographic pole_ is that point where the Earth's _axis of rotation_ crosses the surface in the northern hemisphere.

The south and north magnetic poles are found near the north and south geographic poles respectively. When we talk about a compass magnet having a north pole and a south pole, we should say more properly that it has a 'north-seeking' pole and'south-seeking' pole. Since unlike poles attract, the _south magnetic pole_ of earth's fictitious bar magnet is in fact the location toward which the 'north-seeking' end of a compass needle points.

The magnetic axis is not exactly aligned with the Earth's rotational axis. As a result, although the north pole of a compass needle points northward, it does not point exactly at the north geographic pole.

Also, Earth's magnetic field lines are not parallel to the surface at all points. Near the magnetic poles, the field lines are almost perpendicular to the surface of the Earth. At the magnetic equator, the magnetic field lines are almost parallel to the surface of the earth. The angle that the magnetic field makes with respect to the surface at any point is known as the _angle of dip or inclination_.

Figure A.1: Earthâs magnetic poles versus geographic poles* [32009]

## APPENDIX B: The Cyclotron

A cyclotron is a device that can accelerate charged particles to very high speeds. The energetic particles produced are used to bombard atomic nuclei and thereby produce nuclear reactions of interests to researchers.

Both electric and magnetic forces play a key role in the cyclotron. The charges move inside two semicircular containers D\({}_{1}\) and D\({}_{2}\), referred to as does. A high frequency alternating potential difference is applied across the dees and a uniform magnetic field is directed perpendicularly to them. A positive ion released at P near the center of the magnet in one dee moves in a semicircular path (as shown by the dotted line) and arrives back at the gap in a time interval of 7/2 where \(T\) is the time needed to make one complete trip around the dees.

The frequency of the applied potential difference is adjusted so that the polarity of the dees is reversed at the same time interval during which the ion travels around one dee. The ion then accelerates across the gap from D\({}_{1}\) to D\({}_{2}\) and its kinetic energy increases by qV where V is the potential difference set up across the dees.

It now moves with a larger radius in D\({}_{2}\) due to the increase in speed. After 7/2, it arrives at the gap again, coinciding with the reversing of the polarity of the potential difference set up across the dees. The ion thus accelerates again across the gap and the cycle repeats itself. Every time the ion passes the gap, it gains an energy of qV. By the time it exits the cyclotron, it would have garnered about 20 MeV.

### 15.1 Introduction

In the previous chapter, we discussed the production of magnetic fields due to electric currents. As nature is often symmetric, this led scientists to suspect that the reverse (i.e. the production of electric currents due to magnetic fields) could also be possible. Experiments conducted by Michael Faraday and independently by Joseph Henry in 1831 showed that a changing magnetic field could indeed produce an electric current in a circuit. These results led to a fundamental law known as Faraday's Law. In this chapter, we will discuss Faraday's Law and see how his experimental findings have helped set the foundation for many of modern world's technologies.

### 15.2 Magnetic Flux and Magnetic Flux Linkage

We have learnt that magnetic flux density, \(B\), is a measure of magnetic fields. Before we learn about electromagnetic induction, we need to understand what is meant by the term magnetic flux:

Definition of Magnetic Flux, \(\varphi\) :

The **magnetic flux** through a plane surface is the product of the magnetic flux density normal to the surface and the area of the surface,

\[\varphi=B_{\perp}A\]

where \(\varphi\) : magnetic flux through the plane surface

\(B_{\perp}\): magnetic flux density perpendicular to the plane surface

\(A\) : area of the surface

The magnetic flux for two different cases is given below.

Definition of weber (Wb):

There is a magnetic flux of 1 weber through a surface if a magnetic field of flux density of 1 T exists perpendicularly to an area of 1 m\({}^{2}\).

In the previous chapter, we learnt that the S.I. unit for the magnetic flux density, \(B\), is the tesla (T). An alternative unit for \(B\) is Wb m\({}^{2}\).

Note that magnetic flux density, \(B\), is a **vector quantity**, but magnetic flux, \(\phi\), is a scalar.

### Induced Emf in a Moving Conductor (Motional Emf)

In the previous topic on Electromagnetism, we learnt that the magnetic force experienced by a current-carrying conductor in a magnetic field is given by \(F_{B}=BIL\sin\theta\), where \(\theta\) is the angle between \(B\) and \(l\).

Similarly, the magnetic force acting on a moving charge \(Q\) with velocity \(v\) in a magnetic field of flux density \(B\) is given by \(F_{B}=BQv\sin\theta\), where \(\theta\) is the angle between \(B\) and \(v\).

Next, we shall look at the effects of a moving conductor in a magnetic field.

When the copper rod is moved downwards, the pointer on the meter flicks to the right showing that an emf has been induced.

When the rod is moved upwards, the meter flicks to the left. An emf has now been induced in the opposite direction.

If the rod is held stationary in the field or made to move _along_ the magnetic field lines, there is no induced emf.

The **faster** the copper rod is moved, the **larger** the current.

It appears that _an emf is induced in a moving conductor if it moves through magnetic flux._**The _magnitude of this induced emf is proportional to the speed._

We shall now derive an expression for the induced emf for a moving conductor. Consider a straight conductor or moving rod of length \(L\) moving perpendicularly at a constant velocity \(V\) under the influence of some external agent through a uniform magnetic field \(B\) directed into the page as shown in Figure 15.3.2.

The electrons in the conductor experience a magnetic force \(F_{B}=BQv\) that is directed along the length \(L\), perpendicular to both \(v\) and \(B\). Under the influence of this force, the electrons move to the lower end of the conductor and accumulate there, leaving a net positive charge at the upper end. As a result of this charge separation, an electric field \(E\) is produced inside the conductor. The electrons accumulate at \(D\), leaving a

netic positive charge at \(C\), until the downward magnetic force \(F_{g}=BQv\) is balanced by the upward electric force \(F_{E}=QE\). At this point, the electrons stop moving. The condition for equilibrium requires that

\[\begin{array}{c}BQv=QE\\ E=Bv\end{array}\]

The electric field produced in the conductor (once the electrons stop moving and \(E\) is constant) is related to the potential difference across the ends of the conductor by

\[V_{co}=EL=BLv\]

where the upper end \(C\) is at a higher electric potential than the lower end \(D\). Thus, from the above equation, we can see that a potential difference is maintained between the ends of the conductor as long as the conductor continues to move through the unform magnetic field. If the direction of the motion is reversed, the polarity of the potential difference is also reversed.

In the scenario above, **only an emf is induced across the rod.** As the circuit is not complete or closed, there is _no induced current_ flowing in the rod.

Now suppose the moving rod slides along a stationary U-shaped conductor, forming a complete circuit. No magnetic forces act on the charges in the stationary U-shaped conductor, but the charges in the moving part CD redistribute themselves, creating an electric field within it. This field establishes a current in the direction shown in Figure 15.3.3. The moving rod has become a source of electromotive force and within it, current moves from lower potential D to higher potential C, and in the remainder of the circuit, current moves from higher to lower potential. We call this emf a motional electromotive force, denoted by \(s\). And from the above discussion, the magnitude of this emf is

\[\varepsilon=BLv\]

If the total resistance of the U-shaped conductor and the sliding rod is \(R\), the induced current \(l\) in the circuit is given by \(BLv=lR\).

**(i) Factors affecting magnitude of induced emf**

From the formula \(\varepsilon=BLv\), we can easily infer that increasing one or more of the following factors will increase the magnitude of the induced emf.

* The magnetic field strength \(B\);
* The length of the moving conductor within the magnetic field \(L\);
* The speed at which the cond(circ) is moving v.

Conversely, decreasing one or more of these factors will lead to a decreased magnitude of the induced emf.

### Laws of Electromagnetic Induction

#### Faraday's Experiment and Findings

In the last section we saw that relative motion between a magnetic field and a conductor can induce an emf in the conductor. An experiment carried out by Michael Faraday in 1825 showed how the same effect can be achieved with no apparent relative motion. Figure 15.4.1 shows the setup that led to his discovery.

A primary coil is connected to a battery and a switch. The coil is wrapped around a wooden core, and a current in the coil produces a magnetic field when the switch is closed.

A secondary coil also is wrapped around the wooden core and is connected to a sensitive galvanometer. No battery is connected in the secondary circuit and the secondary coil is not connected to the primary coil.

Faraday observed that:

* At the instant the switch is closed, the galvanometer needle defects in one direction and returns to zero.
* When there is a steady current in the primary coil, the galvanometer always shows null deflection, no matter how large the current is.
* At the instant the switch is opened, the galvanometer needle deflects in the opposite direction and returns to zero.

In order to explain these observations, Faraday invoked the concept of changing magnetic flux linkage between the coils. His given explanation was:

(1) When the switch is closed, the **magnetic field produced by the current in the primary circuit** increases from zero to a constant value over some finite time. The **secondary coil experiences this changing magnetic flux linkage produced by the primary circuit** and the induced current only exists for a short time while the magnetic flux linkage through the secondary coil is increasing.

(2) Once the magnetic field produced by the primary coil reaches a steady value, the **magnetic flux linkage through the secondary coil is constant** and there is no current in the secondary coil.

(3) When the switch is opened, the opposite occurs - the **magnetic field produced by the current in the primary circuit decreases** from the constant value to zero over time. Again, the **secondary coil experiences this changing magnetic flux linkage produced by the primary circuit** and the induced current flows [in the opposite direction to that in (1)] while the magnetic flux linkage through the secondary coil is decreasing.

In effect, when induced current flows in the secondary coil, the secondary circuit behaves as though a source of emf were connected to it. Hence, Faraday concluded that there will be an induced emf in the secondary circuit if it experiences a changing magnetic flux linkage.

With further experiments, he concluded that the **induced emf is directly proportional to the rate of change of magnetic flux linkage, which led to the Law of electromagnetic induction.

Figure 15.4.1: Faradayâs experiment.

#### Faraday's Law

The _magnitude_ of the induced e.m.f. \(\varepsilon\) is _directly proportional_ to the _rate of change_ of magnetic flux linkage or rate of cutting of magnetic flux.

The S.I unit for induced emf, \(\varepsilon\), is the volt (V). An alternative unit for induced emf is Wb turns s\({}^{\text{-1}}\).

#### 15.4.3 Lenz's Law

The Russian physicist Heinrich Lenz (1804 - 1865) made a discovery that allows the polarity of the induced emf to be determined. This discovery led to the Lenz's Law.

Lenz's Law states that the **polarity of the induced emf** is such that it tends to produce a current that creates a magnetic field so as to **oppose the change in magnetic flux**.

Consider the following scenario:

If the bar magnet is moved rightwards towards the stationary metal loop (Figure 15.4.2), the flux through the loop increases with time. The increasing flux induces an emf in the metal loop (Faraday's Law), and since the loop forms a closed circuit, a current is produced. This induced current produces its own magnetic field. By Lenz's law, the direction of the induced current must be such as to produce a magnetic field directed in the **opposite direction** to the **strengthening external field**.

If the magnet is moved to the left (Figure 15.4.3), the flux through the loop decreases with time. The decreasing flux again induces an emf in the metal loop (Faraday's Law). However, this time the direction of the induced current is such as to produce a magnetic field that is directed in **the same direction** as the **weakening external field**.

Figure 15.4.3 Magnet moving away from loop.

Notice also that the interaction of the two magnetic fields (produced by the magnet and the loop, respectively) produces magnetic forces. Note that the direction of the induced current is such that the magnet experiences a repulsion force when approaching the loop and an attractive force when moving away from the loop.

This leads to the important insight that Lenz's Law is really a re-statement of the law of conservation of energy. The direction of induced current is always such as to (produce a magnetic force to) oppose the motion of the magnet (which was the cause of the electromagnetic induction). Since the motion of the magnet is opposed, work must be done in order to maintain the motion of the magnet. This mechanical work enables the conversion of energy into the electrical energy of the current. This is further illustrated in Figure 15.4.4.

Hence, it is common to see the following equation used in textbooks when stating Faraday's Law:

\[\varepsilon=-\frac{d\Phi}{dt}\]

The negative sign in the above equation is a consequence of Lenz's law. It implies that the direction of the induced emf is always such as to oppose the change in the magnetic flux.

Figure 15.4.4: Illustration of Lenzâs Law in view of the law of conservation of energy.

The magnetic field shown in the figure has a uniform magnitude of 25.0 mT and is directed into the paper. The initial diameter of the kink is 2.00 cm.

Specify the polarity of the emf in your answer. Suppose the kink is undisturbed, but the magnetic field increases to 100 mT in \(4.00\times 10^{3}\) s. Determine the average induced emf between endpoints A and B, together with the polarity.

As the wire is quickly pulled taut, this area of loop advance, magnetic flux flux (top quenches).

### Practical Applications of Electromagnetic Induction

#### 15.5.1 Electric Generator (rotating coil in magnetic field)

A coil of \(N\) turns, with area \(A\), rotates at a constant angular velocity \(\omega\) in a uniform magnetic field \(B\).

As the coil rotates in the magnetic field, it experiences a _changing magnetic flux linkage_ as the component of the magnetic field perpendicular to the plane of the coil keeps changing. By Faraday's law, an emf is induced in the coil.

Derivation of an expression for the induced emf

1. Magnetic flux linkage through the coil \[\Phi=NB_{1}A=NBA\cos\theta=NBA\cos\omega t\]
2. Induced emf \[\varepsilon=-\frac{d\Phi}{dt}=-\frac{d}{dt}(NBA\cos\omega t)=-NBA\frac{d}{dt}( \cos\omega t)\] \[\varepsilon=NBA\omega\sin\omega t\]

Hence the induced emf is dependent on \(N\), \(B\), \(A\) and \(\omega\). By Lenz's law, the direction of the induced emf is such that it sets up a current to oppose the rotation of the coil.

Figure 15.5.1: Rotating coil in a magnetic field, generating a current.

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:440]

#### 15.5.2 Speedometer of a Car

A permanent magnet is attached to the wheel of the car. A sensor consisting of a coil of wire is connected to the frame of the car. When the car moves, the magnet rotates with the wheel. As the magnet passes over the sensor, the magnetic flux in the coil rises and then falls. This induces an emf and a current in the coil. The current, in the form of pulses, is sent to an electronic device which counts the number of turns performed by the wheel in each second. With this information, the speed of the car can be calculated if the radius of the wheel is known and the speed can thus be displayed on the speedometer.

Figure 15.5.2 Speedometer:

#### 15.5.3 Ground Fault Interrupters

The ground fault interrupter is a safety device that protects people against an electric shock when they touch appliances and power tools. In the diagram below, wire 1 leads from the wall outlet to the appliance to be protected and wire 2 leads from the appliance back to the wall outlet. An iron ring surrounds the two wires to confine the magnetic field set up by each wire. A sensing coil, which can activate a circuit breaker when changes in magnetic flux occur, is wrapped around part of the iron ring.

Since the currents in the wires are in opposite directions, the net magnetic field through the sensing coil due to the currents is zero. However, if a short circuit occurs in the appliance so that there is no returning current, the net magnetic field through the sensing coil is no longer zero. This can happen for example if one of the wires loses its insulation, providing a path through the person to ground if the person happens to be touching the appliance. As the current is alternating, the magnetic flux through the sensing coil changes with time, thus inducing an emf in the coil. This induced emf will trigger the circuit breaker, stopping the current quickly in about a millisecond before it reaches a level that might be harmful to the person using the appliance.

#### Electric Guitar

The pickup coil is placed near the vibrating guitar string, which is made of a metal that can be magnetized. The permanent magnet inside the coil magnetizes the portion of the string nearest the coil. When the guitar string vibrates at some frequency, its magnetized segment produces a changing magnetic flux through the pickup coil. The changing magnetic flux induces an emf in the coil. This induced emf or voltage is fed to an amplifier, the output of which is sent to the loudspeakers.

Figure 15.5.4: How the electric guitar works.

Figure 15.5.3: How the around fault interrupter works.

### Eddy Currents

As we have seen, emf and current can be induced in a circuit by a changing magnetic flux. This also results in eddy currents being induced in bulk pieces of metal moving through a magnetic field.

Consider a flat copper or aluminium plate attached to a rigid rod which swings back and forth through a magnetic field.

As the plate enters the field, the changing magnetic flux induces an emf in the plate, which in turn causes the free electrons in the plate to move, producing swirling currents (eddy currents). As the currents flow, the plate will heat up: its internal energy will increase. By the principle of conservation of energy, this means that the mechanical energy in the oscillating plate must reduce. This loss in mechanical energy will eventually bring the plate to rest.

Also, according to Lenz's law, the eddy currents give rise to repulsive forces that opposes the motion of the plate. This retarding magnetic force will eventually bring the plate to a rest.

Eddy currents are often undesirable because they represent a transformation of mechanical energy to internal energy. If slots are cut into the plate, the eddy currents and the corresponding retarding force will be greatly reduced. Also, conducting parts in devices are often laminated, that is, they are built up in thin layers separated by a non-conducting material. This layered structure greatly increases the resistance of eddy current paths and effectively confines the currents to individual layers. Such a laminated structure is used in transformer cores.

However, eddy currents are often used in the braking system of many subway and rapid-transit cars. An electromagnet attached to the train is positioned near the steel rails. The braking action occurs when a large current is passed through the electromagnet. The motion of the magnet relative to the rails induces eddy currents in the rails, and the direction of these currents produces a drag force on the moving train. As the train slows down, the eddy currents decrease, hence the braking effect is quite smooth.

**Example 9**: **Magnetic Braking**

A copper disc spins freely between the poles of an unconnected electromagnet as shown. Describe and explain what will happen to the speed of rotation of the disc when a direct current is switched on in the electromagnet.

_Answer:_

_As the copper disc rotates, different parts of the copper disc pass through the magnetic field exerted by the electromagnet._

_Regions of the copper disc which are entering the electromagnet's magnetic field experience strengthening flux, leading to induced emf proportional to the rate of flux change (by Faraday's law). The polarity of the induced emf and current is such that it creates a magnetic flux in a direction opposite to the electromagnet's magnetic field, creating a repelling pole (by Lenz's law)._

_Regions of the copper disc leaving the electromagnet's magnetic field experience weakening flux, leading to an induced emf proportional to the rate of flux change (by Faraday's Law). The polarity of the induced emf and current is such that \(\mathfrak{A}\) creates a magnetic flux in the same direction as the electromagnet's magnetic field, creating an attracting pole (by Lenz's law)._

_For both regions, the direction of the magnetic force is always opposite to the direction of motion. The magnetic force retards the motion and slows down the spinning._

Figure 1.6.1: Eddy currents.

## Appendix 1 A Faraday's Disc with area \(A\) rotating with a frequency \(f\) in a magnetic field \(B\)

The Faraday's disc, an example shown in Figure 1A, is the first homopolar generator. A homopolar generator is a DC electrical generator comprising an electrically conductive disc or cylinder rotating in a plane perpendicular to a uniform static magnetic field.

**Figure 1A**

As shown in Figure 1B, the disc can be divided into small elemental strips. As each strip rotates, they cut the magnetic field B. By Faraday's Law of Electromagnetic induction, an induced emf will be setup across each strip.

**Derivation of an expression for the induced emf**:

Consider an elemental strip

Magnetic flux it cuts in time \(t\),

\[\Phi=B_{\perp}A=B\left(\frac{1}{2}R^{2}\theta\right)\]

The rate at which magnetic flux is cut by the conductor is given by

\[\varepsilon=-\frac{d\Phi}{dt}=-\frac{d}{dt}\left(\frac{1}{2}BR^{2}\theta\right) =-\frac{1}{2}BR^{2}\frac{d\theta}{dt}=-\frac{1}{2}BR^{2}\omega\]

**Direction of the induced emf**:

Electrons in the disc are pushed to the outer edge-(circumference). The flow of electrons to the edge will stop when the electric force equals the magnetic force. Using Fleming's Right Hand Rule, P is at a higher potential than Q.

## Appendix 2 Electromagnetic Braking in Transport.

The link below addresses some of the problems that have been encountered in using electromagnetic brakes on high-speed trains, the two main issues being the brakes interfering with signalling equipment and the excessive heating caused by the brakes in the rails.

## Appendix 3 Volcanic Eruption as a Consequence of Eddy Currents in Action

(Extracted from Young and Freedman, University Physics, 12\({}^{\text{th}}\) edition)

A particularly dramatic example of eddy currents in action is Jupiter's moon Io, which is slightly larger than the earth's moon. to moves rapidly through Jupiter's intense magnetic field (Figure 3A), and this sets up strong eddy currents within Io's interior. These currents dissipate energy at a rate of \(10^{12}\) W, equivalent to setting off a one kilo-ton nuclear weapon inside Io every 4 seconds! This dissipated energy helps to keep Io's interior hot and so helps to cause volcanic eruptions on its surface, like those in Figure B. (However, note that gravitational effects from Jupiter cause even more heating.)

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:447]

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:448]

Suppose an AC periodic current \(I\) passes through an electrical load of resistance \(R\), its instantaneous power \(P\) dissipated will be changing with time \(I\).

In general, mean power \(<\)\(P\)\(>\)\(=\)\(\frac{1}{T}\int\limits_{0}^{T}\)\(P\)\(dt\)

\[= \frac{1}{T}\int\limits_{0}^{T}\)\(I^{2}R\)\(dt\)

\[= R(\frac{1}{T}\int\limits_{0}^{T}\)\(I^{2}\)\(dt)\(\qquad\text{which is}\quad R\)\(\times\)\(\frac{(area\ under\ I^{\prime}vs\ t\ graph)}{duration\ of\ one\ period}\)

\[= R<\)\(I^{2}>\)\(\qquad\text{which is}\quad R\)\(\times\)\(\{\)mean-squared of \(I\}\)

\[= R\)\((I_{m})^{2}\)\(\qquad\text{which is}\quad R\)\(\times\)\(\{\)(root-mean-squared of \(I\))\(\}^{2}\)

The **root-mean-square** value of an alternating current is that **equivalent constant direct current** that will **dissipate the same average power in a given resistive load**.

In other words, a direct current of \(\uparrow\) A and an alternating current of r.m.s. value of 1 A have the same heating effect, i.e. both currents dissipate the same power in a given resistor.

Instantaneous power =\(V\)\(I\)\(=\)\(I^{2}R\)\(=\)\(\frac{V^{2}}{R}\)

\[\text{Peak power}=\)\(V_{b}\)\(I_{b}\)\(=\)\(I_{b}^{2}R\)\(=\)\(\frac{V_{b}^{2}}{R}\)

Mean power \(<\)\(P\)\(>\)\(=\)\(V_{rms}\)\(I_{rms}\)\(=\)\(I_{rms}\)\({}^{2}R\)\(=\)\(\frac{V_{rms}}{R}\)

[1]

Based on the above equation in [1], we can derive that \(\left[\)\(V_{rms}\)\(=\)\(I_{rms}R\)

Note that the above relationships are not restricted to sinusoidal AC. They are applicable to non-sinusoidal AC as well.

#### 16.3.1 Root-mean-square (r.m.s.) values for sinusoidal AC (IMPORTANT)

Suppose a sinusoidal current of \(I=I_{0}\sin\omega\,t\) passes through an electrical load of resistance \(R\).

Using concept of power dissipation,

\[\begin{array}{ll}\mbox{mean power}<\!\!P\!\!>=\frac{(area\,\,\mbox{\it under $P\,vs\,t\,\,\mbox{\it graph}$})}{\mbox{\it duration}\,\,\mbox{\it of $one\,\,\,period$}}\\ \mbox{\it Because of the symmetrical nature of the function,}\\ <\!\!P\!\!>\quad=\frac{1}{2}(I_{0}^{2}R)\quad\mbox{ which is equal to}\,\,\frac{1}{2}P_{\mbox{\tiny{max}}}\\ =\!\!\left(\frac{I_{0}}{\sqrt{2}}\right)^{2}R\end{array}\]

From the previous page in equation [1] which shows that

\[\begin{array}{ll}<\!\!P\!\!>\;=\;(I_{\mbox{\tiny{min}}})^{2}\,R\quad,\\ \mbox{ we can deduce that}\;\;I_{\mbox{\tiny{max}}}=\frac{I_{0}}{\sqrt{2}}\\ \mbox{ for a sinusoidal current.}\end{array}\]

In summary, for a **sinusoidal** AC,

\[\begin{array}{ll}\mbox{\it}I_{\mbox{\tiny{max}}}=\frac{I_{0}}{\sqrt{2}}=0.707I_{0}\\ \mbox{\it}V_{\mbox{\tiny{min}}}=\frac{V_{0}}{\sqrt{2}}=0.707I_{0}\\ \mbox{\it}I/S\end{array}\quad,\]

Note that the above 3 formulae are _ONLY applicable to sinusoidal AC_. For other forms of AC, you would need to derive the corresponding relationship between its r.m.s. value and its peak value.

For the A-level exam, AC supply is assumed _sinusoidal unless otherwise stated_. The value of the AC power quoted in an exam question is the mean value.

Current and voltage values are _often quoted in r.m.s. values_ unless otherwise stated_. r.m.s. values and mean power are more meaningful and useful rather than the peak values (which are just instantaneous/value).

#### 16.4.3 Efficiency

The efficiency of commercial transformers are very high - typically in the range of 95% to 99%. The four most important sources of power loss are listed below.

(a) Resistance of windings

Some energy is dissipated as heat in both coils (\(\lx@overaccentset{{\circ}}{R}R\)). This can be reduced to an acceptable level by using suitably thick wires. (The coil which has the smaller number of turns, carries the larger current. And thus, it usually requires thicker wires.)

(b) Eddy Currents

The alternating magnetic flux induces eddy currents in the iron core and causes heating. The effect is reduced by having a laminated core.

(c) Hysteresis

Each time the direction of magnetization of the core is reversed, some energy is wasted in overcoming internal friction. This is known as hysteresis loss and it produces heating in the core. It is minimized by using special alloys (e.g. Permalloy which is an alloy of nickel and iron) for the core material.

(d) Flux Leakage

The flux due to the primary coil may not all link to the secondary coil if the core is badly designed.

### Rectification

The _I-V_ characteristic of rectifiers (or diodes) are such that they present a very low resistance to current flow in one direction (when forward biased), and a very high resistance in the opposite direction (when reverse biased).

Some energy is dissipated as heat in both coils (\(\lx@overaccentset{{\circ}}{R}R\)). This can be reduced to an acceptable level by using suitably thick wires. (The coil which has the smaller number of turns, carries the larger current. And thus, it usually requires thicker wires.)

(b) Eddy Currents

The alternating magnetic flux induces eddy currents in the iron core and causes heating.

## Appendix

### Full-wave Rectification

Full-wave rectification can be accomplished with a bridge rectifier consisting of 4 diodes. During any half cycle, two of the four diodes are forward biased.

* When the upper terminal of \(V_{S}\) is positive with respect to the lower terminal, diodes B and D are forward biased, while diodes A and C are reverse biased.
* When the lower terminal of \(V_{S}\) is positive with respect to the upper terminal, diodes A and C are forward biased, while diodes B and D are reverse biased.
* Hence, current will always flow in the direction from X to Y through the load resistor \(R\), and the output voltage \(V_{R}\) is unidirectional.

## 2 Smoothing output voltage

Smoothing is the process of reducing the fluctuations of the rectified DC output. In other words, it is to make the output more constant. This is done by connecting a special device, known as a capacitor, in _parallel_ with the load R.

The output of the rectifier is'smoothed' by connecting a capacitor across the output.

**Introduction**

By the middle of the 19th Century, classical physics (Newtonian mechanics and electromagnetic theory) was well established and scientists of the day were confident that they could explain many phenomena happening in a physical world. However, within a few decades (by the end of the 19th Century), it became clear that there were some problems such as several observed phenomena continued to defy explanations by classical physics:

1. Blackbody radiation and the ultraviolet catastrophe (MOE H3)
2. Photoelectric effect (H2)
3. Compton Effect (MOE H3)
4. Bright line spectrum of gas discharge tubes (H2)

While scientific attempts were focusing on trying to explain these experiments, a new theory dubbed as "quantum theory" was developed with contributions from a number of eminent scientists.

Max Planck received his Nobel Prize in 1918, for resolving the issue of blackbody radiation and ultraviolet catastrophe by introducing the concept of discrete energy (quantum) and a crucial constant \(h\) known as Planck constant. Albert Einstein received his Nobel Prize in 1921 by extending Planck's proposal of discrete energy for electromagnetic radiation to successfully explain the photoelectric effect. Niels Bohr was honoured with a Nobel Prize in 1922 for explaining the bright line spectrum using the quantum theory of light.

Items 2 and 4, along with some introductory quantum mechanics, are covered in this topic. For a more holistic and comprehensive understanding, you are encouraged to go online to find out more about items 1 and 3.

Without the scientists and their efforts in the development of quantum theory, our world will be devoid of modern technology such as lasers and many electronic based devices.

**17.1 The Photoelectric Effect**

**17.1.1 Background**

In 1887, Heinrich Hertz discovered the **photoelectric effect** - electrons were emitted when he shone UV light on a freshly polished zinc plate.

The **photoelectric effect** is a phenomenon in which electrons are liberated from a cool metal surface when electromagnetic radiation of sufficiently high frequency is incident upon it.

Philippe Lenard performed some very careful investigations of the effect in 1902. His results could not be explained using classical physics and the wave theory of light. It was Albert Einstein who finally explained the photoelectric effect with particulate nature of light in 1905.

**17.1.2 Quantum Theory of Light**

In 1900 Max Planck, attempting to explain black body radiation, suggested that, although light was a wave, these waves could gain or lose energy only in finite amounts related to their frequency. Planck called these lumps of light energy _quartics_ (We now call them _photons_. In 1905, Albert Einstein used the idea of light quanta to explain the photoelectric effect and suggested that these light quanta had a real existence.

#### 17.1.3 Experimental Setups to Investigate the Photoelectric Effect

Let's look at some investigations of the photoelectric effect before using the "photon" theory to explain it. Fig. 1 shows a schematic diagram of a typical set-up used to investigate the photoelectric effect.

Fig. 1: Experimental set-up

Two metal plates are located at two ends of an evacuated tube. The two metal plates can be kept at different potential differences and polarity by an adjustable DC supply.

Light of various **frequencies** and **intensities** are shone on one of the metal plates (the emitter). In doing so, electrons **could** be ejected from the emitter and travel to the other metal plate (the collector).

If electrons reached the collector, a current would be registered and measured by the ammeter as shown in the diagram.

The ejected electrons are also called **photoelectrons**.

A monochromatic (single wavelength) source of EM radiation of constant intensity is shone on the emitter.

When the adjustable DC supply is adjusted such that the collector is at a **higher** potential than the emitter, an electric field is set up to attract the photoelectrons towards the collector (Fig. 2(a)), and a current can be detected.

When the adjustable DC supply is adjusted such that the collector is at a **lower** potential than the emitter, it will produce an electric field that repels the photoelectrons away from the collector (Fig. 2(b)). A small potential difference is not able to stop the more energetic photoelectrons from reaching the collector. Hence, a current can still be detected by the ammeter if the potential difference is not large enough.

By adjusting the DC supply, there will be a value such that the current becomes zero - this corresponds to the potential difference whereby even the **most energetic** photoelectrons could not reach the collector. This potential difference across the adjustable DC supply is known as the **stopping potential**.

### Results and Interpretation

Typical results are shown in Fig. 3.

The applied/voltage V is the potential of the collector with respect to the emitter. As \(V\) is increased, the current \(I\) increases as well. It reaches a maximum and remains constant a little beyond \(V=0\). Increasing \(V\) further does not increase \(I\). This maximum current is known as the saturation current \(I_{s}\). It represents the maximum rate of emission of photoelectrons from the emitter as all ejected photoelectrons reach the collector.

**Note**: The reason that the current reaches a maximum a little beyond \(V=0\) and not exactly at \(V=0\) is that the electrons are not all aimed straight at the collector. However, in most A-Level questions, the saturation current is reached at \(V=0\). See, for instance questions S7 and D3 in Tutorial 17A.

Figure 3: Photoelectric Effect. Graph of current \(I\) against applied voltage \(V\)

When \(V\) becomes more negative, the current decreases gradually until it becomes zero at a certain potential difference. The magnitude of this potential difference is known as the stopping potential \(V_{s}\).

The current decreases gradually because when the photoelectrons are ejected from the metal surface, they can have different kinetic energies (\(KE\)). When the applied voltage is negative, the photoelectrons are repelled by the collector, but some can still reach the collector if they have sufficient \(KE\).

As the applied voltage becomes more negative, more and more photoelectrons which do not have sufficient \(KE\) will fail to reach the collector and the current decreases. When the negative applied voltage is large enough, even the most energetic photoelectrons cannot reach the collector, i.e., \(J=0\).

The adjustable DC supply is used as a means to determine the \(KE\) possessed by the most energetic photoelectrons (i.e., \(KE_{max}\)) when they are first ejected from the metal surface. The applied potential difference \(V\) does not alter the \(KE_{max}\) in any way.

The potential difference just enough to stop even the most energetic photoelectrons is called the **stopping potential V\({}_{s}\)**. By applying the Principle of Conservation of Energy, the kinetic energy of the most energetic photoelectrons \(KE_{max}\), is therefore equal to \(eV_{s}\).

Thus the stopping potential is a measure of the maximum kinetic energy (\(KE_{max}\)) of the photoelectrons.

Now that we have a way of measuring \(KE_{max}\) of the photoelectrons, we can investigate how \(KE_{max}\) changes with other factors like the intensity and frequency of the incident light.

Experiment 1 is repeated for two different intensities of the incident light, _Intensify\({}_{t}\)_ and _Intensify\({}_{2}\)_. The frequency of the incident light remains the same.

### Results and Interpretation

Typical results are shown in Fig. 4.

The effect on the saturation current (\(l_{s}\)) is higher for increased intensity. _Intensify\({}_{2}\)_.

However, the graph also shows that \(KE_{max}\) is not affected by the intensity. This observation is not consistent with the wave theory of light.

According to the wave theory, increasing intensity would increase **both**\(I_{s}\) (saturation current) _and_\(KE_{max}\) (hence the stopping potential) of the photoelectrons. The wave theory would predict results similar to Fig. 5.

Figure 4: Effects of changing light intensity (ACTUAL results)

Figure 5: EXPECTED results as predicted by wave theory

#### 17.1.4 The Photoelectric-Effect

Einstein offered an explanation for the photoelectric effect by assuming light to be made up of photons. According to Einstein, when light shines on a metal, a photon can interact with an electron and causes the electron to be ejected from the metal.

In the interaction, the photon gives up all its energy to the electron and disappears in the process. Part of this energy is used to do work necessary for the electron to leave the metal. The rest of the energy appears as the kinetic energy of the ejected electron. Each ejected electron is the result of an interaction with one photon only.

Some electrons are more strongly held than others. For the least strongly held electrons, the work done is a minimum and is known as the work function of the metal, \(\Phi\). These least strongly held electrons will have maximum _KE_ when released through interaction with a photon.

The work function is the minimum amount of energy required to remove an electron from the metal surface (i.e. the energy required to remove the least strongly held electron).

Different metals have different lattice structures and hence different work functions.

By applying the Principle of Conservation of Energy to a single photon-electron interaction:

Energy of photon absorbed = Work done to liberate an electron from material + _KE_ of emitted electron

For the least strongly held electron:

\begin{tabular}{|c|c c c|} \hline _hf_ & = & \(\Phi\) + & _KE\({}_{max}\)_ \\ photon energy & energy needed to eject the least strongly held electron & kinetic energy of the least strongly held electron when \\ \multicolumnIn this experiment, we will repeat Experiment 1 for different frequencies. For a given value of \(f\), we vary the applied potential difference, \(V\) and measure the current, \(l\). By plotting \(l\) against \(V\), the stopping potential, \(V_{s}\), can be determined (i.e. the value of \(V\) when \(l=0\)).

We will repeat this process for different values of incoming _frequencies_.

However, \(KE_{max}\) cannot be measured directly in this experiment. If we want to plot \(KE_{max}\) against \(f\), we use the relationship between \(KE_{max}\) and the stopping potential on page 2.2, which is given by:

We may now plot each value of \(f\) against its corresponding value of \(eV_{s}\)

Figure 6: \(I\) against \(V\) for different frequencies

Figure 7: Graph of \(KE_{max}\) against frequency \(f\)

**Validation of Relationship**

The results indicate that the relationship

\[KE_{max}=hf\cdot\Phi\]

is correct. This gives strong support for Einstein's theory for the photoelectric effect.

When the experiment is repeated for different metals (i.e, different \(\Phi\)), Fig. 8 is obtained.

The gradient is the same for all the metals, but the \(x\) and \(y\) intercepts are different.

**Drawing Conclusions**

From the equation:

\[KE_{max}=hf\cdot\Phi\]

**(i)**: The gradient and the Planck constant**

The gradient gives the value of Planck constant.

The gradient is the same for different metals and should be equal to the Planck constant, a universal constant.

Experimental data shows that the gradient of the graph agrees with the value for \(h\) which Planck had derived separately when he was trying to fit experimental data for the spectrum of black body radiation.

This is very strong evidence in support of Einstein's theory because experimental data from different metals gave the same value for \(h_{i}\)

**(ii)**: The vertical-intercept and the work function.

The value of the vertical- intercept gives the work function of the metal.

www.KiasuExamPaper.com

Figure 8: Graph of \(KE_{max}\) against \(f\) for various metalsFrom the equation, the \(y\) intercept gives the work function of the metal. The value varies for different metals as they have different lattice structures. The work function is usually given as a positive number. So, for example, if \(y\) intercept is -2.80 eV, \(\Phi=2.80\) eV.

**(iii)**: **The \(x\) intercept and the threshold frequency**

When \(KE_{max}=0\), the energy \(hf_{0}\) of the incident photon is equal to the work function \(\Phi\) of the metal:

\[hf_{0}=\Phi\]

This means that according to the "photon" theory, if the incident light has a frequency below \(f_{0}\), no photoelectrons will be produced, no matter how intense the light:

\[f_{0}\]

is the threshold frequency, \[f_{0}=\Phi\]

\[/\hbar\]

For different metals, the threshold frequency is different because different metals have different work functions.

\[\begin{array}{c}\end{array}\]

www.KiasuExamPaper.comThe three problems below show the failure of the wave theory and the success of the photon (or particle) theory of light in explaining the observations from photoelectric emission.

## 1 The Intensity Problem

Wave Theory: According to the wave theory of light, when the intensity increases, there is a larger amount of energy in the wave and the kinetic energy of the photoelectrons would be expected to be higher. This would result in a higher measured \(KE_{max}\). Experiments show that this is not true; intensity does not affect \(KE_{max}\).

Photon Model: If intensity is increased, keeping frequency constant, the number of photons falling on unit area per unit time is increased but the energy of each photon remains the same. Since each photoelectron is produced by one photon, the maximum kinetic energy of the electron remains unchanged.

Recall the definition of intensity.

\[\begin{array}{ll}\mbox{Intensity}=\mbox{power passing per unit area perpendicular to direction of energy propagation}\\ \mbox{Intensity}=\frac{power}{Area}=\frac{Energy}{time\times area}=\frac{N \times(hf)}{t\times A}\end{array}\]

where \(N\): No. of photons; \(hf\): energy of 1 photon; \(t\): time; \(A\): cross sectional area

If the frequency remains constant, then energy of each photon remains the same. **Greater intensity simply means larger number of photons incident per unit time**. This just means that a proportionately larger number of electrons will be emitted per unit time, resulting in a proportionately larger photoelectric current. **The \(KE_{max}\) of the photoelectrons does not change**.

## 2 The Frequency Problem

Wave Theory: The wave theory cannot explain the existence of the threshold frequency. According to the wave theory, if the intensity is sufficiently high, electrons will be ejected regardless of the frequency. There should not be a threshold frequency.

Photon Model: If the energy of the photons is below \(hf_{0}\), the photons cannot liberate any electrons. The minimum amount of energy needed to liberate an electron is \(\Phi\), which is equal to \(hf_{0}\), where \(f_{0}\) is threshold frequency.

## 3 The Time Delay Problem

Wave Theory: The wave theory predicts that at very low intensities, there will be a time delay before photoelectrons are detected. This is because at the low rate of transfer of energy to the electron, ample time needs to be given for sufficient energy to be accumulated for the electron to escape from the metal. However, experiments show that there is negligible time delay. Photoelectrons are detected as soon as the metal is exposed to light-of-suitable frequency, even if the intensity is low.

Photon Model: The energy of photon is transferred in a single interaction. If the photon energy is large enough, electrons should be liberated as soon as the light shines on the metal. There should be no time delay.

### Atomic Structure and Line Spectra

#### Atomic Models1
Footnote 1: In this topic, the Bohr model of the atom will be the main model used. Alternate models and the gold foil experiment will be covered in greater detail in the topic of Nuclear Physics.

For a long time, people have been wondering what matter was made of. The first atomic theory of matter was developed as early as 500 BC by Democritus, in which he believed that matter was made up of particles so small that they could not be further subdivided. These particles are known as atoms (_a__rojov_, meaning "indivisible" in Greek).

The Plum Pudding model (Fig. 9(a)), however, was disproved by an experiment known as the gold foil experiment (Geiger and Marsden, 1909) whereby alpha particles (helium nuclei) are scattered at different angles when they are incident upon a thin gold foil. Ernest Rutherford proposed a model in which the electric charge of an atom is not distributed over the whole area of the atom but is concentrated in a small area (Fig. 9(b)). He envisaged the atom as having a central positive nucleus surrounded by negative orbiting electrons, somewhat similar to the solar system. This model suggested that most of the mass of the atom was contained in the small nucleus, and that the rest of the atom was mostly empty space. He tested his model successfully against data from the gold foil experiment and came up with the Rutherford scattering formula.

Unfortunately, Rutherford's model faced a very fundamental problem. Maxwell's electromagnetic theory predicted that a charge undergoing acceleration will radiate EM waves, losing energy in the process. This means that the orbiting electrons, which undergo centripetal acceleration, will lose energy through EM radiation and rapidly-spiral infoc the nucleus!

### Bohr's model of the atom

Figure 9: Joseph John Thomson, after he discovered the existence of electrons, came up with the plum pudding model of the atom. He suggested an electrically neutral atom as composing of electrons surrounded by a relatively large, uniformly distributed, positive mass to balance the electronâs charge, much like raising embedded in a plum pudding (a traditional English Christmas fare).

In 1913, Niels Bohr presented a new model of the atom to address this problem. Bohr adopted Rutherford's picture of an atom as a nucleus surrounded by electrons moving in circular orbits, but he improved upon the old model by making a number of assumptions in order to combine the new quantum ideas of Planck and Einstein with the traditional description of a particle in uniform circular motion (Fig. 9(c)).

Inspired by the quantisation of energy levels of a blackbody in Planck hypothesis, Bohr assumed that the electrons could only orbit the nucleus in particular circular orbits with fixed energy (and angular momentum). Electrons in quantised orbits do not radiate electromagnetic waves because they could not lose energy in a continuous manner, and hence they were not allowed to spiral into the nucleus:

To incorporate Einstein's photon concept, Bohr theorized that a photon is emitted only when an electron jumps orbit from a larger one with a higher energy to a smaller one with a lower energy (Fig. 10).

When an electron in an initial orbit with a larger energy \(E_{i}\) changes to a final orbit with a smaller energy \(E_{i}\) the emitted photon has an energy of \(E_{i}-E_{i}\) consistent with the law of conservation of energy.

where \(f\) is the frequency of the emitted light. This process is known as **de-excitation**.

Electrons in the atom can also jump from a lower-energy orbit to a higher-energy orbit by acquiring energy (this is known as **excitation**):

* through collision of the atom with a colliding particle (such as another electron produced in a high voltage discharge tube). The colliding particle will impart energy to the atom equal to the difference between two energy levels in the atom; any remaining energy will be retained by the colliding particle as its kinetic energy.
* through absorbing a photon of energy **exactly** equal to the energy difference between two levels of the atom.

The Bohr model is sometimes known as the semi-classical model of the atom, as it adds some primitive quantization conditions to what is otherwise a classical mechanics treatment. The Bohr model is certainly not a full quantum mechanical description of the atom. The full quantum mechanical model, or electron cloud model, describes the electron as a three-dimensional shape ("cloud") where there is at least a minimal probability of finding the electron's 9(d).

You may find a YouTube video about the Atomic Line Spectrum of Hydrogen here:

The simplest Bohr model would be that of the hydrogen atom, which consists of an electron and a proton. Bohr was able to derive the energy levels \(E_{n}\) for the hydrogen atom2:

Footnote 2: You are not required to memorise this formula or know how Bohr arrived at it. In fact, you are not required to know the energy levels or spectra for any particular element.

\[E_{n}=-\frac{13.6}{n^{2}}\ \mathrm{eV}\]

where \(n\) is known as the principal quantum number and is a positive integer (i.e., \(1,2,3,...\)).

The electron normally occupies the energy level corresponding to \(n=1\), also known as the ground state. At the ground state, the electron has the lowest energy, -13.6 eV, and orbits nearest to the proton (hydrogen nucleus). The higher levels are called excited states. Observe how the energies of the excited states come closer and closer together as \(n\) increases.

The electron in a hydrogen atom at room temperature spends most of its time in the ground state. To raise the electron from the ground state (\(n=1\)) to the highest possible excited state (\(n=\infty\)), 13.6 eV of energy must be supplied. Supplying this amount of energy removes the electron from the atom, producing the positive hydrogen ion H\({}^{+}\). 13.6 eV is known as the ionisation energy of the hydrogen atom.

In general, for a multi-electron atom,

\[\begin{array}{c}\includegraphics[width=142.364pt]{Fig1}\end{array}\]

The **ionisation energy** is the minimum energy needed to remove the

\[\begin{array}{c}\includegraphics[width=142.364pt]{Fig2}\end{array}\]

(putermost electron from the atom.

**Evidence that the energy states of the atoms are discrete and quantised is provided by the existence of atomic line spectra**, the subject of the next two sections.

Figure 11:

### 17.2.2 Emission Line Spectra

When gases such as hydrogen, neon or sodium are placed inside a narrow discharge tube at low pressure (so that the gas atoms are effectively isolated from one another), a high voltage (e.g. 1 kV) applied across its ends causes the gas atoms to ionise, forming ions and electrons. The ions and electrons accelerate towards opposite ends of the tube, under the applied electric field. Collisions between the electrons and atoms result in transfer of energy from the electrons to the atoms and the atoms are excited from their ground state. Excited states are not stable, however, and an excited atom will quickly de-excite to lower-energy states. The excited atom can, but may not de-excite directly to ground state; it may make a series of jumps through intermediate energy states to ground state, releasing more than one photon in the process.

The photons emitted by the gas discharge tube are passed through a collimator slit, to produce a narrow beam of photons. Next, the photons are passed through a diffraction grating to produce an **emission line spectrum** on a dark screen behind the grating.

The frequency, \(f\), of an emitted photon depends on the energy difference between the initial and final energy states, as given by \(hf=E_{i}-E_{i}\). The frequency or wavelength of the photons emitted can be determined by studying the spectrum seen on the screen (Fig. 12).

The emission line spectrum consists of a series of **distinct coloured lines** on a dark background. The different colours or frequencies are unique to the gas, i.e., no two different gases emit the same set of discrete frequencies of light and atoms of the same element always emit the same set of discrete frequencies of light.

Using his model for the energy levels of the hydrogen atom, Bohr was able to account for the spectra pattern of hydrogen gas. For hydrogen gas, several distinct groups of lines can be detected, though only one group is in the visible range (Fig. 13).

The Lyman (ultraviolet) series of lines corresponds to electron transitions down to the level \(n=1,\) the Balmer (visible) series are produced by transitions down to \(n=2,\) and the Paschen (infrared) series are produced by transitions down to \(n=3\), each-sades being named after its discoverer. The Balmer series is shown in Fig. 14.

### 18.

Figure 12:When the electron is given an amount of energy equal to the ionisation energy, the electron is just able to become a 'free' electron. If the electron is given an amount of energy greater than the ionisation energy, the excess energy becomes the kinetic energy of the free electron outside the atom. The **free electron can have a continuous range of energies. Inside the atom, however, it can have only one of the energy level values characteristic of the atom**.

Typically, gas at low pressure is used for spectral analysis as the atoms are sufficiently far apart and have minimal interaction with one another. When the atoms are close together, the discrete energy levels will become several continuous energy bands due to interactions between the atoms (you may read on "Band Theory"), and the distinctive spectral lines will not be observable.

Figure 14:

Figure 13:

### 17.2.3 Absorption Line Spectra

An absorption spectrum is formed when the continuous spectrum emitted from an incandescent lamp (or white light) passes through a cool gas. The electrons in the gas absorb the frequencies corresponding to the energies they need to jump from a lower energy state to a higher energy state. These vacancies show up as "black lines" in the otherwise continuous spectrum of colours. An absorption spectrum, in a sense, is the inverse of an emission spectrum of the same series.

In the set-up shown in Fig. 15, a filament lamp emits a continuous spectrum of light which is incident on a tube containing cool atomic vapour at low pressure - "cool" meaning atomic vapour in ground state. As a photon is incident on an atom, if its energy corresponds to the energy difference between the ground state and an excited state, it may be absorbed by the atom. As such, the atomic vapour absorbs photons of specific energies/frequencies.

What is observed on the screen is the original **continuous spectrum emitted by the hot filament lamp with darker lines corresponding to the frequencies absorbed**. Since excited states are not stable, the atoms eventually return to the ground state. However, **the photons are emitted in all directions** and not just in the forward direction. Hence the parts of the spectrum corresponding to these photon frequencies appear darker by comparison with the other frequencies.

Figure 15:

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:481]

### 17.3 X-ray Spectra

X-rays was discovered by Wilhelm K. Rontgen in 1895. He found that a gas-discharge tube which he was using with a high voltage had caused some wrapped photographic plates to become fogged. He discovered that the tube emitted a radiation that could penetrate paper, wood, glass, rubber and even thick aluminium. Rontgen could not find out whether the radiation was a stream of particles or a train of waves and he named it **X-rays**.

X-rays are produced when high-speed electrons, accelerated through a large potential difference, collide with a metal target and are slowed down. The target is contained within an evacuated glass tube known as an X-ray tube (See Fig. 16).

The production of X-rays can be seen as the **inverse process** of the photoelectric effect. In X-ray production, an incoming electron causes a photon to be emitted. In the photoelectric effect, an incoming photon causes an electron to be emitted.

A typical plot of X-ray intensity versus wavelength is shown in Fig. 17. It consists of sharp peaks or lines superimposed on a broad continuous spectrum. The sharp peaks are called **characteristic lines** or **characteristic X-rays** because they are **characteristic of the target metal used**. The broad continuous spectrum is referred to as **bremsstrahlung** (German for "braking radiation") and is emitted when the bombarding electrons decelerate upon hitting the target.

Figure 16: X-ray tube

#### 17.3.2 Explanation of X-ray Emission Spectra

Two distinct processes are involved in X-ray emission (corresponding to two distinct features of the X-ray spectrum in Fig. 17):

* Process 1 accounts for the bremsstrahlung.
* Process 2 accounts for the characteristic lines.

Explaining the bremsstrahlung

In the first process, some of the electrons pass through the electric field of the atomic nuclei in the metal target. As a result, part or all of the kinetic energies of these electrons are converted directly to a continuous spectrum of photons, including X-rays. The electrons are slowed down or stopped by the target as a result.

The intensity of the continuous background radiation decreases gradually for increasing wavelength, but is cut off sharply at the other end of the spectrum with a minimum wavelength \(\lambda_{min}\) (Fig. 17)

Using the quantum theory of light, one can explain the existence of \(\lambda_{min}\). When the bombarding electrons interact with the metal atoms in the target, they can lose any fraction of their initial energy, up to the maximum in a single interaction. If the electron loses all its energy in a single interaction, based on quantum theory, a single quantum of electromagnetic radiation (photon) is produced with maximum energy, and hence minimum wavelength.

If the accelerating voltage of the X-ray tube is \(V\), and an electron has charge -e, the electron gains kinetic energy \(eV\). Thus the most energetic photon (i.e. highest frequency and shortest wavelength) is produced when the entire electron's kinetic energy goes to produce one photon.

Then,

\[\frac{hc}{\lambda_{min}}=\delta V\Rightarrow\lambda_{min}=\frac{hc}{eV}\]

(For an electron completely stopped in its first interaction with the metal target)

The minimum wavelength \(\lambda_{min}\) in the bremsstrahlung process is _INDEPENDENT_ of the target material. It is dependent only on the accelerating voltage.

Explaining the characteristic lines

The second process accounts for the peaks in the X-ray spectrum at certain frequencies or wavelengths (i.e. the characteristic X-rays in Fig. 17).

Electrons in atoms are grouped in various energy states called'shells'. The shell nearest to the nucleus is known as the K shell (principal quantum number \(n=1\)). This is followed by the L shell (\(n=2\)), the M shell (\(n=3\)), the N shell (\(n=4\)) and so on:

In the X-ray tube, highly energetic electrons which have been accelerated by tens to hundreds of kilovolts of potential difference bombard the metal target. These highly energetic bombarding electrons can eject electrons from the _inner shells_(r, \(\lambda\) closer to the nucleus) of the atoms of the metal target. The vacancies created will be quickly filled by electrons dropping down from higher levels, emitting X-rays with sharply defined frequencies associated with the difference between the atomic energy levels of the target atoms.

If \(E\) is the difference in energy between the two shells where the electron transition occurs, the frequency \(f\) of the radiation emitted is related to \(E\) by

\[E=\hbar f.\]

### Wave-Particle Duality and the Uncertainty Principle

This video gives the first part of the answer to the question: "What is the Wave/Particle Duality?"

#### 17.4.1 Introduction

We have seen evidence that light can behave like a particle. Yet light also exhibits wave-like properties like diffraction, interference and polarization. Experiments like the Young's double slit experiment clearly demonstrated so.

Can Einstein's photon hypothesis explain the interference and diffraction of light? Unfortunately it cannot. Such behaviour can only be explained using the wave theory of light.

Light behaves **both** as photons and as a wave.

In fact, the equation \(E=hI\) contains this contradictory nature of light. The energy of a photon is a particle of light; depends on the _frequency_ of the light. Light can have a frequency only if it is a wave.

#### 17.4.2 de Broglie's Hypothesis - Matter Waves

As a graduate student in 1923, Louis de Broglie made an astounding suggestion. Since light can exhibit particle-like behaviour; then the converse should be true. Particles (like electrons) should also exhibit wave-like behaviour.

de Broglie boldly proposed that a relationship between momentum (of the particle) and wavelength (of the **associated matter wave**) exists for **all particles**:

\[\lambda=\frac{h}{p},\quad\text{ where $p$ is the momentum of the particle}\]

\(\lambda\) is known as the _de Broglie wavelength_ of the particle.

**Example 9**

What is the de Broglie wavelength of an electron that has been accelerated from rest through a potential difference of 54 V?

### Evidence of Wave-like Nature of Particles

To exhibit diffraction with light, we had to make very narrow slits that are approximately equal to the wavelength of light (10\({}^{7}\) m). For his experiment, Young used a razor blade to scratch slits on a piece of glass that had been blackened with soot. In order to validate de Broglie's hypothesis, we must be able to observe wave-like behaviour with particles (e.g. electrons).

The de Broglie wavelength of electrons is determined to be even shorter. In fact, it is about the same order of magnitude as the size of a typical atom (about 10\({}^{\text{-}10}\) m). This holds the key to showing diffraction of electrons. Diffraction experiments were successfully conducted using a metal crystal. The regularly arranged atoms of the crystal acted as a diffraction grating for the electron "waves". A number of important experiments conducted in the 1930s were based on this principle and clearly demonstrated the wave-like nature of moving electrons.

Davisson and Germer directed a beam of electrons onto a crystal of nickel. The atoms of nickel acted like a diffraction grating and it was observed that the electrons exhibited diffraction behaviour.

Further experiments to demonstrate the wave nature of electrons were conducted by G.P. Thomson. He targeted a mono-energetic beam of electrons at a thin metal foil (Fig. 20). A photographic plate placed behind the foil revealed a bright central maximum surrounded by diffraction rings (Fig. 21).

G.P. Thomson is the son of J.J. Thomson, who discovered the electron. The father was awarded a Nobel Prize for demonstrating that the electron was a particle. The son was awarded one for showing that electrons can behave like waves!

These electron diffraction experiments clearly show that electrons can behave like waves, and detailed calculations show that de Broglie's equation is valid. The wave nature of electrons is something that we now take for granted, and has been put to practical use in devices like the electron microscope.

#### 17.4.4 The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle

Another YouTube video, which tries to answer the question: "What is the Uncertainty Principle?"

When we take measurements in an experiment, there will always be experimental uncertainties or errors involved no matter how good the measuring apparatus are. However, according to classical mechanics, there is no fundamental barrier imposed by nature to an ultimate refinement of the apparatus or experimental procedures. That is, the uncertainty in a measurement can be made indefinitely small by using more precise instruments.

Quantum theory predicts, however, that such a barrier does exist and there is a **definite limit** to the precision of any measurement. This limit is **not** due to the limitation of the measuring instrument; rather, it is **inherent in nature** as a result of the **wave-particle nature of matter**.

Imagine generating a wave in a string by periodically shaking it up and down. One would not be able to precisely point out where the wave is along the string, but could certainly give a value for the wavelength, and hence momentum.

On the other hand, if one were to give the string a sudden jerk, one would get a relatively narrow bump travelling down the string. In this case, the location of the wave along the string is more defined, while the wavelength could not be stated (it is not even periodic). For intermediate cases, one could say that it has a fairly defined wavelength and a fairly defined position, but there is an inescapable trade-off between the momentum and position.

In 1927, Werner Heisenberg formally introduced this notion, which is now known as the **Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle**:

If a measurement of position of a particle is made with uncertainty \(\Delta x\) and a simultaneous measurement of linear momentum is made with uncertainty \(\Delta p_{x}\), then the product of the two uncertainties can never be smaller than \(\hbar\).

In general terms, the uncertainty principle states that it is impossible to know the exact values of two **related** physical quantities, such as the position and momentum of a particle, **at the same time**.

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:490]

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:491]

By de Broglie's postulate, the magnitude of the electron momentum must have one of the values

\[p_{in}=h\,l\,\lambda_{in}=nh\,l\,2L\]

Thus the electron momentum is also restricted to a particular set of values. As the potential energy is assigned to be zero and the electron's kinetic energy depends on its mass and its momentum, the total energy is similarly confined to one set of particular values. (i.e. the energy is **quantised** into levels.)

Energy levels of the electron in a box are

\[E_{in}=\left\{\begin{array}{ll}\times\,m_{i}v_{in}^{2}=p_{in}{}^{2}/2m_{e} \end{array}\right.\]
**Note:**: In the case discussed above, we considered matter waves associated with particles trapped in a one-dimensional box. The particle moves in a region where the potential energy is constant. As a result, the momentum and speed of the particle is also constant within the region. But if we considered a particle moving through a region where the potential energy varies, its speed and hence the wavelength associated with the wave function will be changing.

In general, the analysis of a situation where the potential energy varies will require the study of the Schrodinger wave equation. In the case discussed above, where the potential is uniform, the solutions of the Schrodinger equation have the form of standing waves and justified the simplified approach we took.

### Rutherford's Alpha-Particle Scattering Experiment

Thomson's plum pudding model of the atom was disproved in _1910 - 1911_ by _Emest Rutherford_ and two of his students, _Hans Geiger_ and _Emest Marsden_, at the _University of Manchester_ in _England_.

#### 18.2.1 Details of Rutherford's Experiment

* **Aim:** To probe the internal structure of the atom.

* In Rutherford's alpha(\(\alpha\))-particle scattering experiment, \(\alpha\)-particles (Helium nuclei) from a radioactive source were directed towards a thin sheet of gold foil in a vacuum chamber.
* The _vacuum_ is necessary because alpha particles only have a short range of about 5 cm in air, and they get scattered before hitting the foil or the screen.
* The gold foil, being very ductile, is rolled into a very thin sheet of 0.00004 cm (about 100 atoms) thick, so that the high energy alpha particles can pass through instead of being absorbed.
* The angular deflection of alpha particles is measured using a microscope that has a glass screen coated with zinc sulphide (Figure 3). A charged particle impacting with the screen will produce a tiny flash of light, called a **scintillation**.
* To determine how the alpha-particles are scattered, the number of scintillations \(N\) per minute is obtained for each angular deflection, \(\theta\) (Figure 4).
* **Predicted Alpha-scattering based on Thomson's Model (Hypothesis)*
* The positive charge and the negative electrons are distributed throughout the whole atom. Hence, the electric field inside the atom should be quite small.
* Alpha particles are doubly-charged helium ions which are more massive than protons, and fast-moving with a considerable amount of energy, the electrical force on an \(\alpha\)-particle that enters the atoms should be quite weak, so the maximum deflection \(\theta\) observed should only be at most a few degrees.
* **Actual Observation*
* **More than 99% of \(\alpha\)-particles passed through with little or no angular deflection,*
* it is expected to be 100% i.e. for all of the particles if the plum pudding model was correct.
* **A few \(\alpha\)-particles (\(\uparrow\) in 900) back-scattered, i.e. suffered deflections of more than 80. A very small number were deflected backwards. These results were so unexpected that Rutherford later wrote: "_It was quite the most incredible event that ever happened to me in my life. It was almost as incredible as if you had fired a 15-inch shell at a piece of tissue paper and it came back and hit you."_

Figure 4: Graph showing the results of the \(\alpha\)-particle scattering experiment. Note that the vertical axis is marked in powers of 10.

Figure 5: Scattering of \(\alpha\)-particles by the nucleus.

**18.2.2 Interpretation of Results**

Rutherford concluded from the \(\alpha\)-particle scattering experiment that:

* Very few particles were deflected from their path, i.e. most particle passed through undeflected, indicating that the positive charge of the atom occupies very little space. **Most of the space inside the atom is therefore empty**.
* A very small fraction of \(\alpha\)-particles were deflected by very large angles, indicating that **all the positive charge and mass of the gold atom were concentrated in a very small volume within the atom**.

From the data, he also calculated that the radius of the nucleus should be less than \(10^{14}\) m, at least \(10^{4}\) times less than the radius of the atom. (Today, it is deduced that typical size of a nucleus is about \(10^{15}\) m, i.e. \(10^{5}\) times less than the size of the atom.)

He worked out a detailed formula for the scattering, which matched the experimental data to high precision and later proposed a new structure for the atom.

**18.2.3 Rutherford's Nuclear Model of an Atom1**

On the basis of his experiment, Rutherford put forward the nuclear model of an atom, which had the following features (Figure 6.):.

* There is a positively charged centre in an atom called the nucleus. Nearly all the mass of an atom resides in the nucleus.
* The electrons revolve around the nucleus in well-defined orbits.
* The size of the nucleus is very small as compared to the size of the atom.

**1 Drawbacks of Rutherford's model of the atom:**

* It does not obey the Maxwell theory of electrodynamics which dictates that "an accelerated charged particle continuously emits energy" It can be shown that continuously lose its energy and set up a spiral motion, ultimately falling into the nucleus. However, atoms are observed to be quite stable.
* It could not explain the fine speed of hydrogen atom and its discontinuous spectrum nature.

In order to overcome the objections raised against Rutherford's model of the atom, Neils Bohr proposed the following model of an atom.

* Only certain special orbits known as discrete orbits of electrons, are allowed inside the atom.
* While revolving in discrete orbits, the electrons do not radiate energy. These orbits or shells are called energy levels. Energy levels in an atom are represented by the letters K,L,M,N,... or the numbers, n = 1,2,3,4,...

### 18.3 Some Properties of the Nucleus

#### 18.3.1 Basic Building Blocks of the Nucleus

The basic building blocks of the nucleus are the **proton** and **neutron**:

Experiments show that we can model a nucleus as a sphere with a radius \(R\) that depends on the total number of _nucleons_ (neutrons and protons) in the nucleus (Figure 7).

In a **neutral** atom, the **no. of electrons and protons are the same**.

The masses and charges of these particles are given below:

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|} \hline  & _Proton_, \({}^{1}\)_P_ & _Neutron_, \({}^{1}_{0}\)_n_ & _Electron_, \({}^{0}_{-1}\)_e_ \\ \hline  & \(m_{p}\) & \(m_{e}\) & \(m_{e}\) \\ _Mass_ & _1.007276 u_ & _1.008665 u_ & _0.000548580 u_ \\  & _[1.672622 x 10\({}^{27}\) kg]_ & _[1.674927 x 10\({}^{27}\) kg]_ & _[9.10938 x 10\({}^{37}\) kg]_ \\ _Charge_ & _+ e_ & _0 (neutra)_ & _- e_ \\ \hline _Electronic charge_ e _= 1.60 x 10\({}^{18}\) C_ & _Unified atomic mass_, _u = 1.66 x 10\({}^{27}\) kg_ \\ \hline \end{tabular}

From the above table, we can see that over 99.9 % of the mass of an atom comes from its nucleus.

#### 18.3.2 Nuclide Notation

A **nuclide** is a species of atom characterized by the specific constitution of its nucleus, i.e., its _number of protons_ and its _number of neutrons_.

The _proton number_, \(\mathbf{Z}\), is the number of protons in the nucleus. (\(Z\) is also called the _charge number_, or _atomic number_);

The _nucleon number_, \(\mathbf{A}\), is the number of **nucleons**. A nucleon is either a neutron or proton in the nucleus. (\(A\) is also known as the _mass number_)

Therefore, the number of neutrons in the nucleus is \(N=A-Z\):

The **notation** for a nuclide \(X\) with proton number \(Z\) and nucleon number \(\hat{A}\) is \({}^{A}_{Z}X\).

#### 18.3.3 Isotopes

Isotopes are atoms that have the same number of protons but different number of neutrons.

Examples of isotopes of hydrogen : \({}^{1}_{1}\)H (hydrogen) : \({}^{2}_{1}\)H (deuterium) : \({}^{3}_{1}\)H (tritium) Examples of isotopes of carbon:

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|} \hline  & _Abundance in Nature_ & _Remarks_ \\ \hline \({}^{1}_{0}\)C & Trace & Radioactive : Half-life of 20.4 min \\ \({}^{2}_{0}\)C & 69:0-3-6 & Stable \\ \({}^{3}_{0}\)C & Stable \\ \({}^{4}_{0}\)C & Trace & Radioactive : Half-life of 5730 yrs \\ \hline \end{tabular}

Isotopes have nearly identical chemical properties (same proton number) but different physical properties (different nucleon number).

Figure 7: The nucleus is approximately spherical and contains protons \(\delta\) neutrons.

#### Common Units used in Nuclear Physics

* **Atomic Mass**: Atomic masses are usually expressed in terms of the unified atomic mass unit (\(u\)).
* **Atomic Mass Unit (\(u\))**: One unified atomic mass unit is one-twelfth the mass of the carbon-12 atom. Hence, \(1\)\(u=\frac{1}{12}\)(\(\frac{\text{mass of 1 mole of carbon-12}}{\text{Avogadro's number}}\)) = \(\frac{1}{12}\)(\(\frac{0.012\text{ kg}}{6.02\times 10^{23}}\)) = \(1.66\times 10^{27}\) kg
* **Relative Atomic Mass**: It is common to find in data about a particular atom, the relative atomic mass, \(m_{i}\). The relative atomic mass (\(m_{i}\)) of an atom is the ratio of the mass of the atom to the unified atomic mass unit. \[m_{i}\ =\ \frac{\text{mass of atom}}{\text{one-twelfth the mass of a }^{12}\text{C atom}}\] It follows from the definition that the mass of an atom expressed in unified atomic mass units is numerically equal to its relative atomic mass e.g. the relative atomic mass of Iron (Fe) is 55.845, then the mass of one atom of Fe is 55.845 u. Notes:
* Relative atomic mass has no unit.
* The mass number A should not be confused with the atomic mass. Mass number is an integer specific to a nuclide and has no unit - it is simply a count of the number of nucleons. Atomic mass is generally not an integer because it is a weighted average of the masses of the naturally occurring isotopes of a given element, and has a unit of u.
* **The Electron-Volt**: In nuclear physics, the unit of energy called an electron-volt (eV) is often used : \(1\) eV = (\(1.6\times 10^{-19}\) C)(\(1\) J/C) = \(1.6\times 10^{-19}\) J Usually, slightly larger units are more convenient, such as: \(1\) keV = \(1\times 10^{3}\) eV and \(1\) MeV = \(1\times 10^{6}\) eV (= \(1.6\times 10^{-13}\) J)

### Nuclear Reactions

The nuclei of atoms can change, or be made to change, in various ways. Changes to the nuclei of atoms are called nuclear reactions.

**Examples**

* **Radioactive decay**: It is a process where an unstable nucleus spontanenously and randomly changes into a different nucleus, emitting radiation (\(\alpha\), \(\beta\), \(\gamma\)) as it does so.
* **Nuclear fission**: Occurs when a large atomic nucleus splits into two smaller nuclei of approximately the same size: \(\gamma\)**Nuclear fusion**: Occurs when two smaller atomic nuclei join together (fuse) to form a single larger nucleus. This can only occur when the smaller nuclei have very high energy (e.g. at very high temperatures).

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:500]

**Example 5: Conservation of Mass Energy \(\rightarrow\) Mass Loss**

_Senway College Physics p558 - main text (modified)_

Consider the following nuclear reaction:

The masses of the nuclei in the above equation are given by:

Mass of \({}^{2}_{1}\)H = 2,014 102 \(u\)

Mass of \({}^{12}_{6}\)C = 12,000 000 \(u\)

Mass of \({}^{14}_{7}\)N = 14,003 074 \(u\)

Mass of \({}^{14}_{2}\)He = 4,002 602 \(u\)

a) What is the mass "loss" by the system in the nuclear reaction?

b) What is therefore the equivalent energy "loss" by the system, in MeV?

c) What is this lost energy manifested as?

d) Suggest why the combined energies of the products are usually higher than the value calculated in (b)?

### Nuclear Force & Nuclear Binding Energy

An atomic nucleus consists of positively charged protons and neutral neutrons concentrated in a tiny volume in space. Electrostatic repulsion between the positively charged protons should have caused the disintegration of the nuclei spontaneously. However we know that other than radioactive nuclei, nuclei are relatively stable.

It dawned on physicists that there must be another force, other than the electrostatic force, which holds the nucleons together - the Strong Nuclear Force.

#### 18.5.1 Strong Nuclear Force & the Stability of Nucleus

\(\circ\) **Nature and Range of the Strong Nuclear Force**

\(\times\)At typical nucleon separation 1.3 fm (1.3 x 10\({}^{15}\)m), it is a very strong attractive force (10\({}^{4}\) N).

\(\times\)At much smaller separations between nucleons, the force becomes repulsive.

\(\times\)Beyond about 1.3 fm separation, the force quickly dies off to zero.

\(\times\)Thus, the nuclear force is a **short-range force**.

\(\times\)The much smaller Coulomb force between protons has a much longer range and becomes the only significant force between protons when their separation exceeds about 2.5 x 10\({}^{15}\)m.

\(\circ\)**The nuclear force is independent of charge**

The nuclear forces associated with the proton-proton, proton-neutron and neutron-neutron interactions are the same.

#### 18.5.2 Stability of a Nucleus

Apart from the nucleus of \({}^{\dagger}_{1}H\) atom, _there is a very delicate balance between the strong nuclear forces that act between adjacent nucleons and the electrostatic forces that act between the protons_ and this determines how **stable** a particular nucleus is.

Out of the 339 naturally occurring nuclides, 254 are stable and 85 unstable. Beyond the 339 naturally occurring nuclides, more than 3000 radionuclides have been artificially produced.

A plot of \(N\) vs. Z for a number of stable nuclides is given in Figure 9.

\(\circ\)**Note that for **light nuclides**, they are _most stable if they contain almost equal numbers of neutrons and protons_ (i.e. \(N=Z\)).

\(\circ\)**Heavier nuclides** are _more stable_ if **N > Z**.

This difference can be partially understood by recognizing that as _the number of protons increases, the electrostatic repulsive force increases,_ and this tends to break the nucleus apart. Hence, _more neutrons are needed to keep the nucleus stable_ as neutrons are affected only by the attractive nuclear forces.

\(\circ\)**Beyond Z = 83**, there are no stable nuclides. This is because the repulsive forces between the protons can no longer be compensated by the addition of neutrons.

Nuclides that contain more than 83 protons are unstable and tend to decay or disintegrate into other nuclides.

**Beta Decay**

\(\circ\)**Beta decay is a type of radioactive decay in which a** \(\beta\)**- particle is emitted.**

\(\circ\)**A** \(\beta\)**- particle can be**

\(\bullet\)**a high speed electron ejected from an unstable nucleus, referred to as** \(\beta^{*}\) **particle, or**

\(\bullet\)**a high speed positron2 ejected from an unstable nucleus, referred to as** \(\beta^{*}\) **particle. (For the purpose of the A-level,** \(\beta\)**-particle refers to the electron.)**

\(\circ\)**Beta decay can be :**

\(\bullet\)**Beta-minus (**\(\beta^{*}\) **decay.**

**where an unstable neutron in the nucleus** _transforms into a proton_ **and electron and ejects the electron (**\(\beta^{*}\) **particle). (Figure** 15a**)**

**The decay process can be written as :**

\(\stackrel{{ A}}{{{}_{\geq}}}\)**X** \(\rightarrow\)\(\stackrel{{ A}}{{{}_{\geq}}}\)**Y** \(+\)\(\stackrel{{ 0}}{{{}_{\geq}}}\)**(incomplete expression)**

\(\bullet\)**Beta-plus (**\(\beta^{*}\) **decay,**

**where an unstable proton in the nucleus** _transforms into a neutron_ **and ejects the positron (**\(\beta^{*}\) **particle). (Figure** 15b**)**

**The decay process can be written as :**

\(\stackrel{{ A}}{{{}_{\geq}}}\)**X** \(\rightarrow\)\(\stackrel{{ A}}{{{}_{\geq}}}\)**Y** \(+\)\(\stackrel{{ 0}}{{{}_{\geq}}}\)**(incomplete expression)**

### More on Beta Decay - the Existence of Neutrinos

Consider the \(\beta\) decay or \(\beta^{\prime}\) decay represented above. (Figure 15). If you apply _conservation of linear momentum_ and _conservation of mass-energy_ to each decay, you will see that for an radioactive isotope \({}^{{}^{\prime}}_{x}X\), the \(\beta\) radiation emitted should have only a single momentum and energy.

However, experimentally, it has been found that beta particles from a single type of nucleus are emitted over a range of energies and momentum, violating both conservation of energy and momentum.

In 1930, Pauli proposed a third particle must be present in the decay products. Enrico Fermi named this particle the _neutrino_ (symbol \({}^{*}v\)), meaning the little neutral one.

\(\circ\) **Beta Processes in their most correct and complete form** is therefore:

\(\bullet\) **Beta-minus (\(\beta^{*}\))decay**: \({}^{{}^{\prime}}_{x}X\rightarrow\)\({}^{{}^{\prime}}_{x}Y+{}^{{}^{\prime}}_{\alpha}e+\overline{v}\) (complete expression) \(\bullet\) **Beta-plus (\(\beta^{*}\))decay**: \({}^{{}^{\prime}}_{x}X\rightarrow\)\({}^{{}^{\prime}}_{x}Y+{}^{{}^{\prime}}_{\alpha}e+\nu\) (complete expression) \(\bullet\)

where \(\overline{v}\) represents the antineutrino and \(\nu\) represents the neutrino

\(\circ\) **The energy emitted in each reaction is shared between the \(\beta\)-particle and the neutrino (or antineutrino in the case of \(\beta\) minus decay). This allows the \(\beta\) particles to be emitted from the nucleus with a range of energies and momentum - ensuring coherence with the conservation of mass-energy and conservation of linear momentum.

\(\circ\) **Properties of Neutrino**:

\(\bullet\) **From conservation of charge, we can see from the equation above that the neutrino is _neutrally charged_.

\(\bullet\) **The neutrino also have _neglible mass_ as it interacts weakly with other matter and hence have eluded detection for many years.**

### Gamma Decay

\(\circ\) **Very often:** after an \(\alpha\)or _decay_, the nucleus is left in an _excited_ state.

A typical nucleus has a set of allowed energy levels, including a ground state and several excited states. A \(\Lambda\)-nucleus in an excited state is unstable and it will undergo decay to a lower energy state by emitting one or more high energy Gamma photons:

\({}^{{}^{\prime}}_{x}X^{*}\rightarrow\)\({}^{{}^{\prime}}_{x}X+\gamma\) (The excited nucleus is denoted by an asterisk \({}^{*}\).)

**Properties of Radioactive Emissions**

#### Laws of Radioactive Decay

**Activity (A) of a Radioactive Decay**

The _rate of decay_, or _activity_, of a radioactive sample is the number of disintegrations per unit time:

\[A=-\frac{dN}{dt}.\]

where \(N\) is the number of radioactive nuclei present.

S.I. **unit of activity**: s\({}^{-1}\) or Bq (bequevel)

**Notes:**

\(\frac{dN}{dt}\) is a negative number, since \(N\) decreases with time. The activity is reported as a positive number, since it represents the decrease per unit time.

1 Bq = 1 disintegration per second.

Another commonly used unit of activity is **curie** (Ci), defined as 1 Ci = 3.7 x 10\({}^{10}\) Bq

The curie is a very large unit. Most of the activity of radioactive substances are measured in millicuie (mCi) or microcurie (uCi).

The GM tube measures the **count rate** (C) instead of the activity. This is because the detector only captures A PORITION of the radioactive emissions from a sample of radioactive nuclide.

**The count rate is actually a fraction of the activity**, i.e. \(C\propto A\)

**Background Radiation**

In the absence of specific radioactive source, a radiation detector still picks up a non-zero count rate (typically 20 to 50 counts per minute) from the environment. This measurement is known as the **background count**.

Background count is due to **ionizing radiation** that is constantly present in the environment. This radiation is known as **background radiation**, and its sources can be natural or man-made.

Naturally-occurring sources account for about 80% of our exposure, and is contributed by things such as rocks, radon (a colourless and odourless gas that is easily trapped in buildings) and cosmic radiation. Man-made sources include those used in nuclear medicine, nuclear power plants and in consumer products (such as tobacco, which contains radioactive Pb-210). For more information on background radiation, refer to Appendix B.

In experiments to study radioactivity, the background count is usually subtracted from the measurement, to eliminate the systematic error in the count rate.

**Archaeology - Carbon Dating**

\(\circ\): Carbon-14 dating is a way of determining the age of certain archeological artifacts of a biological origin up to about 50,000 years old.

\(\circ\): Carbon isotopes that occur naturally are

\({}^{12}\)C : stable, 99% abundance

\({}^{13}\)C : stable, 1% abundance

\({}^{14}\)C : radioactive, \(t_{172}\) = 5730 year\({}_{i}\) trace amounts

\(\circ\): When cosmic rays from outer space collide with the upper atmosphere, one of the nuclear reactions that occur is the conversion of Nitrogen-14 to Carbon-14 by neutron capture :

\({}^{14}\)N + \({}^{1}\)n - \({}^{14}\)C + \({}^{1}\)p

The carbon-14 atoms then undergo beta-decay:

\({}^{14}\)C + \(\rightarrow\) + \({}^{14}\)N + \({}^{15}\)e

\(\circ\): Because \({}^{14}\)C is chemically identical to \({}^{12}\)C, it can form carbon dioxide CO\({}_{2}\). This radioactive CO\({}_{2}\) is absorbed by plants via photosynthesis. All living organisms that eat plant matter will also ingest this radioactive CO\({}_{2}\).

\(\circ\): In the atmosphere, _the rate of production of \({}^{14}\)C is approximately balanced by the rate of removal of \({}^{14}\)C and hence the ratio of \({}^{14}\)C to \({}^{12}\)C in the atmosphere is constant at approximately 1.3 x 10\({}^{12}\)._

The _carbon atoms in all living organisms will correspondingly have this same ratio \({}^{14}\)C /\({}^{12}\)C_ as the organisms continuously exchange carbon dioxide with their surroundings.

\(\circ\): When an organism dies, the carbon-14 atoms decayed are not replenished, while the amount of carbon-12 remains constant in the organism. Thus the ratio \({}^{14}\)C /\({}^{12}\)C begins to decline.

\(\circ\): It is therefore possible to determine the time elapsed since death by measuring its \({}^{14}\)C activity.

\(\circ\): Using this technique, scientists have been able to identify samples of wood, charcoal, bone and shell as having lived from 1000 to 25000 years ago. This knowledge has helped us reconstruct the history of living organisms - including humans, during this time span.

**Example 12: Carbon Dating**

\(\bullet\): _TYS **N831/8 (part)**_

Living material contains a fairly constant small fraction of radioactive isotope \({}^{14}\)C. After death, the activity from the \({}^{14}\)C present in the material decays with a half-life of 5.7 x 10\({}^{3}\) years. A certain quantity of carbon converted from recently dead organic matter to carbon dioxide and placed in a GM tube gave 12 counts per minute above background. If the same quantity of carbon were taken from a lineh shroud and similarly treated, what count rate would you expect if the shroud were

#### 18.6.4 Radiation Hazard

Radioactive emissions can cause damage to the cells in your body.

Most of this damage is due to **ionization** when the radiation passes, although if levels of radiation are high there can also be damage due to heating effects as your body absorbs the energy from the radiation.

\(\circ\) **Ionizing Radiation**

Ionizing radiation encompasses energetic subatomic particles, ions or atoms moving at high speeds, and electromagnetic waves on the high-energy end of the electromagnetic spectrum. During an interaction with an atom, it removes electrons from the orbit of the atom, causing the atom to be electrically charged or ionized.

\(\circ\) **Damage to Cells**

The nucleus of a biological cell has been shown to be the part of the cell most vulnerable to radiation damage. This is because the nucleus contains the DNA molecules which carry the organism's genetic code.

\(\circ\) **Types of damage to cells**

Damage may be **direct** or **indirect**.

1. Ionisation may cause **direct damage** to the DNA within the nucleus, when the whole DNA molecule may either be broken into fragments or have sections of it removed.
2. **Indirect damage** occurs when the radiation interacts with other molecules in the cell e.g. water, producing ions and radicals (H\({}^{+}\), OH, H\({}_{-}\), OH\({}_{-}\)) which can then attack other cell structures and DNA. They can also combine to form toxic substances like H\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{2}\) which could initiate harmful reactions within the cells.

\(\circ\) **Effects of Damage to DNA**

\(\times\) **Cell death**: If the damage within the cell is great, then **cell death** occurs immediately or within a very short time.

\(\times\) **Cell is unable to replicate**: The DNA in the cell nucleus may have been damaged so badly that the **cell is unable to replicate itself by **cell division**. This may have serious long term consequences for the organism.

\(\times\) **Cancer, genetic mutation and sterility**: At low doses, cellular reproduction may continue for many cell generations, giving rise to delayed effects such as **enhanced risk of developing cancer**. Rapidly multiplying cells are _tar_page susceptible to damage and consequently, special attention is paid in the use of _twisting_radiation or _unborn_ children and young persons. The reproductive system may also, be affected, giving rise to an increased risk of genetic mutations. If the damage is severe enough, it can cause _serrility_.

## Appendix A Detecting Radiation

Nuclear radiation may come from the following:

1. Naturally occuring radioactive materials such as compounds of uranium; thorium and potassium.
2. From purified or man-made sources, which are stronger than the natural sources. The ones you find the school laboratory are sealed and are called _closed_ sources. They are stored in lead-lined boxes.
3. Space: High energy particles such as muons, pions, sigmas reach the earth's surface from space. All these decay into other particles very quickly. They can also be produced artificially in particle accelerators. There are various theories that these 'fundamental' particles (including protons, neutrons, electrons) are made from even more fundamental particles called quarks with a charge of \(\pm\frac{1}{3}e^{\cdot}\). It is unlikely that you will be able to detect these in the laboratory.

### Wilson Cloud Chamber

A cloud chamber is a device that makes the paths of ionizing radiation entering it visible.

Water is introduced into chamber Y. If sufficient time is given, the air in the chamber becomes saturated with water vapour.

A series of adiabatic expansion is carried out to cool the air in chamber Y. As the air cools, the water condenses on the dust particles in air and will fall off as water droplets. After a series of controlled adiabatic expansions, the air could be made dust free and supersaturated i.e. the vapour pressure is greater than the saturated vapour pressure at the reduced temperature reached but no water vapour condenses. This supersaturated air is exposed to ionising radiation such as alpha, beta or gamma.

An ionising particle would collide with the air and water molecules to produce ions. This leaves a track of ions in its path which forms the nucleating centers for water to condense. Hence the expansions leave a track of water droplets showing the route the particle had taken. The light scattered from the tracks makes them visible.

### Glaser's Bubble Chamber

In the same way as air can be super-saturated with water vapour, a liquid under pressure can be heated to a temperature higher than that at which boiling normally takes place and is then said to be superheated.

If the pressure is suddenly released, bubbles may not form in the liquid for a certain time interval. During this quiet period, if the liquid is exposed to ionising radiation, nucleating centers are obtained for bubble formation and the liquid quickly evaporates into bubble which grow rapidly, and the bubble track would reveal the path of the ionising radiation.

Figure 24: Wilson Cloud Chamber.

* A GM tube consists of a tube filled with a low-pressure inert gas such as helium, neon or argon, and an organic vapor or a halogen gas. The tube contains electrodes, between which there is a potential difference of several hundred volts, but no current flowing. The walls of the tube are either entirely metal or have their inside surface coated with a conductor to form the cathode while the anode is a wire passing up the center of the tube.
* When ionizing radiation passes through the tube, some of the gas molecules are ionized, creating positively charged ions, and electrons. The strong electric field created by the tube's electrodes accelerates the ions towards the cathode and the electrons towards the anode. The ion pairs gain sufficient energy to ionize further gas molecules through collisions on the way, creating an avalanche of charged particles. This results in a short, intense pulse of current which passes (or _cascades_) from the negative electrode to the positive electrode and is measured or counted.
* The usual form of GM tube is an _end-window tube_. This type is so-named because the tube has a window at one end through which ionizing radiation can easily penetrate. The other end normally has the electrical connectors. There are two types of end-window tubes: the glass-mantle type and the mica window type. The glass window type will not detect alpha radiation since it is unable to penetrate the glass, but is usually cheaper and will usually detect beta radiation and X-rays. The mica window type will detect alpha radiation but is more fragile.
* The ideal GM tube should produce a single current pulse on entry of a single ionising particle. It must not give any spurious pulses, and must recover quickly to the passive state. Unfortunately for these requirements, when positive argon ions reach the cathode and become neutral argon atoms again by obtaining electrons from it, the atoms can acquire their electrons in enhanced energy levels. These atoms then return to their ground state by emitting photons which can in turn produce further ionisation and hence cause spurious secondary pulse discharges. Some form of quenching of the ionisation is therefore essential. The disadvantage of quenching is that for a short time after a discharge pulse has occurred (the so-called _dead time_, which is typically a few microseconds), the tube is rendered insensitive and is thus temporarily unable to detect the arrival of any new ionising particle. This effectively causes a loss of counts at sufficiently-high count rates.
* External quenching uses control electronics to temporarily remove the high voltage between the electrodes. Self-quenching or internal-quenching tubes stop the discharge without external assistance, by means of the addition of a small amount of an organic vapor or a halogen such as bromine or chlorine, the choice of quencher molecules is important.
* If a poor gas quencher were introduced to the tube, the positive argon ions, during their motion toward the cathode, would have multiple collisions with the quencher gas molecules and transfer their charge and some energy to them. Neutral argon atoms would then be produced and the quencher gas ions would reach the cathode instead, gain electrons in excited states which would decay by photon emission, thereby producing spurious tube discharge as before. However, effective quencher molecules, when excited, do not lose their energy by photon emission but by dissociation into neutral quencher atoms. No spurious output pulses are then produced.

## Appendix B Background Radiation

Background radiation is the ionizing radiation that is constantly present in the environment. Sources of such radiation can be natural or man-made.

Natural Sources of Radiation

Naturally-occurring radiation accounts for approximately 80% of our exposure. Most of our exposure is from indoor radon, followed by radiation from outer space and from the Earth's crust.

\(\circ\): **Radon**

Approximately 55% of our exposure to radiation comes from radon.

Radon is a _colourless_, _odourless_ and _relative inert_ naturally occurring radioactive gas. Radon-222 is one of the elements in the long radioactive decay chain from uranium-238 (Figure 29), and the less common isotope radon-220 is part of the decay series from thorium-232 (Figure 30), both of which can be found in rocks and soil.

\(\circ\): **Dangers of Radon Gas**

Radon is the 2nd leading cause of lung cancer in the United States, with only smoking causing more lung cancer deaths.

Key dangers associated with radon gas is not so much of radon itself but its radioactive daughters which are solid particles that easily attach themselves to dust particles which are inhaled.

When inhaled these particles stick to the surfaces of the bronchial tubes and the \(a\)-particles emitted in the decay of the radon daughters damage the cells they are attached to, causing cancer.

\(\circ\): **How does Radon get into the _i_d_homes?

Radon usually migrates into _i_d_omes and other buildings from the ground through openings in the floor or wall. Buildings trap radon inside, where it accumulates and may become a health hazard. Any home or building may have a radon problem, including new and old homes, well-sealed and draffty homes, and homes with or without basements.

Figure 28: Sources of Radiation Exposure.

Figure 30: The _i_d_homes?

Figure 29: The _i_d_h_decay series; terminating with stable _i_d_h_Cpb.

**Soil and Buildings**

Natural radioactive material in rocks and soil account for about another 8% of the radiation dose a person typically receives in a year.

The earth's crust contains small amounts of uranium, thorium, and radium as well as radioactive isotopes of several elements including potassium.

The radiation dose also comes from some building materials (such as bricks and concrete).

**Cosmic Radiation**

Another 8% of our exposure comes from cosmic radiation

Cosmic radiation mainly originates from the sun and outer space. Cosmic radioactive nuclides (mainly carbon-14), are produced through interactions of the cosmic rays with atoms in the atmosphere.

Cosmic rays are extremely energetic particles, primarily protons, which originate in the sun, other stars, and from violent cataclysms in the far reaches of space. Cosmic ray particles interact with the upper atmosphere of the earth and produce showers of lower energy particles. Many of these lower energy particles are absorbed by the earth's atmosphere.

The cosmic radiation exposure varies with altitude. The exposure of an individual to cosmic rays is greater at higher elevations than at sea level. For example, a passenger in a jetliner traveling at 37,000 feet would receive about 60 times as much cosmic radiation as would a person standing at sea level for the same length of time.

**Natural Radioactivity in the Body**

Small traces of many naturally occurring radioactive materials are present in the human body. These come mainly from naturally occurring radioactive nuclides present in the food we eat and in the air we breathe. These isotopes include tritium (\({}^{3}\)H), carbon-14, and potassium-40.

**Man-Made Sources**

Since the discovery of radiation, people have benefited from the use of radiation in medicine and industry.

Man-made sources of radiation account for about 20% of our total exposure to radiation.

**Medicine**

The radiation used in medicine is the largest source of man-made radiation to which people in most countries are exposed.

Most of the exposure is from diagnostic X-rays. Physicians use X-rays in more than half of all medical diagnoses to determine the extent of disease or physical injury.

Radiation is also used in cancer treatments, where precisely targeted radiation destroys diseased cells without killing nearby healthy cells.

Radiopharmaceuticals, another medical treatment, are used to locate tumors in a patient's body and to treat cancer. One third of successful cancer treatments involve radiation.

**Consumer Products**

Small amounts of man-made background radiation is attributable to consumer products like colour televisions, smoke detectors, gas lantern mantles, natural gas heating and cooking fuel, and mining and agriculture products, such as coal, granite and potassium salt.

## Appendix C Uses of Radioactive Nuclides

Radioactive nuclides are used in some industries and in nuclear medicine for their chemical properties and as sources of radiation. Some examples are listed below.

\(\circ\) In Medicine:

\(\flat\) As a tracer. Any radioactive nuclide which is to be used as a tracer for diagnostic purposes must be incorporated into a pharmaceutical product which can be administered to the patient.

The pharmaceutical produce and the radioactive nuclide which it incorporates should have the following properties:

\(\flat\) It should concentrate in the organ or system which is to be imaged or assessed.

\(\flat\) It should not change the functioning of the organ, i.e. the pharmaceutical behaves in the same way as the substance it is replacing.

\(\flat\) The half-life of the radioactive nuclide should be as short as possible to reduce radiation damage, but sufficiently long to enable measurements to be made.

Some examples of the use of radioactive tracers in Medicine is listed below:

\(\circ\) Thrombosis (Blood clots). A radioactive tracer, iodinated fibrinogen is introduced into the blood. If there is a blood clot forming in some part of the body, a concentration of the radioactive fibrinogen will occur at that point. The concentration can be located using a radiation detector.

\(\circ\) Haemorrhage Inside the body. Similar to thrombosis, the radioactive tracers are used to locate the precise site of haemorrhage in an emergency situation. Radioactive chromium is injected into the body and is taken up by the red blood cells and carried uniformly throughout the body. However, there will be more blood accumulating at the haemorrhage site and hence a greater activity which can be located using a radiation detector.

\(\flat\) Cancer treatment. Immature cells and cells that are growing or dividing most rapidly are most sensitive to radiation. This is made use of in radiation treatment of cancer.

Often, cancer cells are growing rapidly and are therefore much more likely to be killed by a high dose of gamma radiation from cobalt-60 source than are normal cells that divide less frequently.

\(\circ\) In Industry:

\(\flat\) As a tracer. Tracers are used for detecting leaks in underground pipes by doping the water in the pipes and using a detector to check where the water flows. Tracers are also used to check the wear of a machine part. For example, we can check the wear of the piston if it has been doped with a radioactive material during manufacture by checking the activity in the oil that is used with the piston.

\(\flat\) To check for cracks and imperfections

\(\circ\) Gamma rays can be used in place of X-rays to photograph solid objects. Gamma rays are directed onto the object and its image is captured on a photographic film placed on the other side. The film can reveal any imperfections e.g. a crack. The technique has an advantage over X-rays as no high voltage electrical sources are needed.

\(\circ\) The same technique can also be used to check and control the thickness of paper or plastic during the manufacturing process. The thickness of rolled sheets of plastic can be controlled by placing a beta source on top of the sheet and a detector beneath it. If the sheet is too thin, the count rate will rise. This rise in count rate can then be directly coupled to the rollers so that they separate slightly.

**In Agriculture:**

* Suppose a plant research centre wishes to investigate the ability of a particular plant to take up magnesium through its roots, it is possible to water the plant with a fertilizer containing a known, extremely low concentration of radioactive magnesium-28: If a detector is placed in contact with the leaves of the plant, an increase in count rate soon after watering in the fertilizer indicates that the magnesium has travelled through the plant to the leaves. This can happen within a time as short as 20 min.

**As a sterilization tool:**

* Radiation can also be used as a means of preserving food because exposure to high levels of radiation can destroy or incapacitate bacteria and mould spores. Techniques include exposing foods to gamma rays, high-energy electron beams, or x-rays. Food preserved this way can be placed in a sealed container (to keep out new spoiling agents) and stored for long periods of time.
