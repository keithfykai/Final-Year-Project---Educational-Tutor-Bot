Exercise:

State the equations of the asymptotes of the curve with equation \(y=x-\frac{1}{x^{2}}\).

Answer: \(\forall\):X, X :b

### Shape of graphs

Having discussed intercepts and asymptotes of graphs, it remains for us to study the shape of the graph. Recall in Chapter 7B we have discussed the concept of strictly increasing (decreasing), concavity as well as stationary points.

These form the foundation to determine the shape of any given graph. Hence given a curve with equation \(y=f(x)\), it is important for us to look at \(f^{\dagger}(x)\) to determine the shape of the graph.

## Summary for curve sketching

A simple way to start any curve sketching question is to remember the following mnemonic: **S** (Shape/Stationary Points) **I** (Intercepts) **A** (Asymptotes). In practice, we usually start from determining the asymptotes (if any), then the intercepts, followed by the shape, which includes the stationary points.

(Shape/Stationary Points) (Intercepts) (Asymptotes)

In the next section, we will learn how to sketch some standard curves such as graphs of rational functions and conic sections.

## 2 Rational Functions

### Graphs of functions of the form \(f(x)=\frac{ax+b}{cx+d}\), where \(c\neq 0\), and the numerator

and denominator have no common factor if \(a\neq 0\).

In general, the graph of \(y=f(x)\) where \(f(x)=\frac{ax+b}{cx+d}\) where \(c\neq 0\) takes one of the following

The dotted lines are known as **asymptotes**. They are lines which the curve \(y=f(x)\) approaches when \(x\) or \(y\) is large.

**Note:**

The graph of \(y=\frac{ax+b}{cx+d}\) has no turning points. To understand this, we consider \(\frac{d\,y}{dx}\) which can be easily shown to be given by \(\frac{d\,y}{dx}=\frac{ad-bc}{(cx+d)^{2}}\).

When \(ad-bc\neq 0\), \(\frac{dy}{dx}=0\). Hence the graph of \(y=f(x)\) has no turning points.

When \(ad-bc=0\), \(\frac{dy}{dx}=0\) for all real values of \(x\) (except for \(x=-\frac{d}{c}\) ). Hence \(y=f(x)\) will be a horizontal line (with the point when \(x=-\frac{d}{c}\) removed).

## 3 CONIC SECTIONs

Conics are curves that can be obtained from the intersections of a cone and a plane. In this section, we will look at the equations of circle, ellipse, and hyperbola and some of their characteristics.

### Circle

The equation of a circle with centre (0,0) and radius \(r\) units is given by

\(x^{2}+y^{2}=r^{2}\), where \(r>0\).

Consider the circle with equation \(x^{2}+y^{2}=9\).

This is a circle with centre \(\left(0,0\right)\) and radius 3 units.

Now, let us find out the equation of a circle with centre (2,1) and radius 3 units.

Using Pythagoras' Theorem, we know the equation of a circle with centre (2,1) and radius 3 units is \((x-2)^{2}+(y-1)^{2}=3^{2}=9\).

**Note :**

The GC gives the shape of the graph. In many cases, you may need to resize the window to capture the entire graph, or to change window settings to capture critical features of the graph.

We can use it to find intersections with axes and turning points, but it does not draw asymptotes!

To determine if a graph has any asymptotes, you need to examine its equation. Sometimes, a vertical line may appear like a vertical asymptote, but actually it is only connecting one point off the top of the screen with the next point off the bottom. The GC does-not know if there is any undefined value between the values it is graphing.

## Conclusion

Graphs have many practical uses in everyday life. For example, the exponential curve is useful in modelling the rate of growth of the population of a species, or the rate of decay of a radioactive substance. The applications of conics are related to their reflective properties and to planetary motion. For example, the reflectors on automobile headlights and dish antennas are parabolic, while the orbits of planets are elliptic.

It is useful to recognise the equations of basic functions and understand the properties of their graphs. When sketching graphs, one should take note of characteristics such as symmetry, intersections with the axes, turning points and asymptotes.

A graphing calculator is a useful tool in sketching graphs. However, it has certain limitations. For example, it cannot draw vertical asymptotes, and the graphs obtained are only an approximation. A GC also does not know what critical features of a graph to display - that is dependent on you.
