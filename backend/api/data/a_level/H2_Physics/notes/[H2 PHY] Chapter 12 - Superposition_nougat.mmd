## Appendix A* When two or more waves of the same nature meet at a point, the resultant displacement is the **vector sum** of the individual displacements at that point.

Interference is the phenomenon where 2 or more waves of the same type **superpose** to produce a resultant wave.

* all waves of the same **nature** can superpose and interfere with one another.

* occurs when 2 waves meet in phase with one another, so that there is **reinforcement** of the waves at that point.
* The **resultant displacement is larger than the individual displacements.

* occurs when 2 waves meet in antiphase (180 degrees or \(\tt{m}\) radians out of phase), so that there is a **weakening** of the waves at that point.
* The resultant displacement will be equal to 0 or **less than** the larger value of the individual displacements.

1. It does not propagate. As such, it is also called **standing wave.**
2. Every particle **oscillates** (expect at the nodes) with the **same frequency,** but different amplitudes.
3. The **amplitude** of oscillation at the antinodes is **double** that of the component waves.
4. Within two consecutive nodes, every particle oscillates in phase. (Note that these particles do have the same amplitude.)
5. **Distance** between two adjacent nodes (or antinodes) is

\[\frac{1}{2}\lambda\]
6. Particles in neighboring segments vibrate 180\({}^{\circ}\) (or \(\pi\) rad) out of phase with each other.

* At the fixed ends, there must be nodes (since the strings cannot vibrate).
* In reality, multiple harmonics give the timbre or characteristics of an instrument.

* By sending sound waves into an air column or pipe, it is possible to generate stationary waves in the pipe.
* A **closed pipe** is a pipe with one end open while the other end is closed.
* In an **open pipe**, both ends are open.

* Wave propagates to the end of the pipe and is reflected.
* The reflected superposes with the incident wave and forms a stationary wave.
* **displacement node** is formed at the closed end, while a displacement **antinode** is formed at the open end
* The bottom figure shows arrows indicating the amplitudes of vibration of air molecules.
* As sound wave travels down an open pipe and reaches the other end, part of the wave is reflected.

* A displacement antinode is formed at both ends.

* Overtones and harmonic frequencies are the same as in the strings.

Diffraction is pronounced when the wavelength if the wave is the same order of magnitude as the with of the aperture or obstacle. \(\lambda\)\(\sim\)\(a\) where \(a\) = gap width or length of the obstacle.

## Chapter Single Shift Diffraction

As a light beam from a laser, passes through the single aperture, the light **diffracts**, and an intensity pattern is seen on the screen.

## Two-Source Interference Pattern

By having 2 point sources, **S1** and **S2**, the interference patterns of waves can be studied. In Young's double slit experiment, we are able to observe the interference pattern of light, as alternating bright and dark fringes are seen on the screen.

At points of constructive interference (maxima), bright fringes are observed.

At points of destructive interference (minima), dark fringes are observed

Preface Example 3

Two boats are stranded off in an island. Without any binoculars, the coast guards observe the boats, and their separation is just resolvable. If their pupils have diameter of 2.0 mm, what is the limit of resolution of the eyes? (Let the wavelength of light be 600 nm)

**Solution:**

(a) At the fundamental,

\[f_{1}=\frac{v}{4L}=\frac{330}{4(0.33)}=250\ Hz\]

First overtone,

\[f_{3}=3f_{1}=750\ Hz\]

(b) \(f_{1}=750-250=500\ Hz\)

\[\lambda_{1}=\frac{v}{f_{1}}=\frac{330}{500}=0.66\ m\]

\[\lambda_{1}=2L\rightarrow\ \ \ \ L=\frac{\lambda_{1}}{2}=\frac{0.66}{2}=0.33\ m\]

## Preface Example

In Young's double-slit experiment, the separation between the first and the fifth bright fringe is 2.5 mm when the wavelength used is 620 nm. If the distance from the slit to the screen is 0.80 m, calculate the separation of the two slits.

**Solution:**

Between the 5th and the 1st bright fringe, there are 4 fringes. So, we divide 2.5 mm by 4 to get the fringe separation \(x\).

\[x=\frac{2.5\times 10^{-3}}{4}=0.625\ mm\]

\[\alpha=\frac{\lambda D}{x}=\frac{\left(620\times 10^{-9}\right)\left(0.8 \right)}{0.625\times 10^{-3}}=0.80\times 10^{-3}m=0.80\,m\]

## Chapter 2 Particle Example 8

How many bright fringes can we observe using a diffraction grating of 600 lines per mm illuminated normally with light of wavelength 633 nm?

Solution:

\[d\sin\theta=n\lambda\quad\Rightarrow n=\frac{d\sin\theta}{\lambda}\]

\(\Rightarrow n<\frac{d}{\lambda}\) since sine function ranges from 0 to 1 (\(0<\theta<90\))

\[d=\frac{1}{N}=\frac{1mm}{600}=1.67\times 10^{-6}\]

\[n<\frac{1.67\times 10^{-6}}{633\times 10^{-9}}=2.63\]

\(n\) must be an integer so \(n\) must be 2. This means that there are 2 bright fringes on either side. Including the central fringe, there is a total of **5 bright fringes**.

Two boats are stranded off in an island. Without any binocularars, the coast guards observe the boats, and their separation is just resolvable. If their pupils have diameter of 2.0 mm, what is the limit of resolution of the eyes? (Let the wavelength of light be 600 nm)

Write answer in degree and radian.

**Solution:**

\[\theta=\frac{\lambda}{n}=\frac{600\times 10^{-9}}{2\times 10^{-3}}=0.30\ mrad\ or\ 0.017^{\circ}\]

**Convert radian in degree by multiplying 180/\(\pi\).**
