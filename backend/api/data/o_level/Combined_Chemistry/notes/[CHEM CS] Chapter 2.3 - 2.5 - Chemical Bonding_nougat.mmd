## Why are chemical bonds formed?

Atoms of elements strive for **stability** by achieving a **stable electronic configuration (2,8,8)**. This is by forming chemical bonds with other atoms.

The formation of chemical bonds can be done by **transferring electrons, sharing electrons or forming a metal lattice**.

Non-metal atoms, such as the Group VII halogens, would form **ionic bonds** with metal atoms. They can also form **covalent bonds** with other non-metal atoms.

Metal atoms can also form **metallic bonds** with other metal atoms.

**COVALENT BONDS**

Covalent bonds are formed between **non-metal & non-metal atoms**.

A covalent bond is defined as the **electrostatic force of attraction between the nuclei of the atoms and the shared electrons.**

To attain a stable electronic configuration, the two atoms **share their valence electrons** so that they can both attain stable and full valence shells.

Covalent bond is formed from the sharing of electrons.

**Examples:**
## 1 Simple Molecular Structure

Covalent compounds that are made up of small, discrete molecules have simple molecular structures.

Between the small molecules, they are held together by **weak intermolecular forces of attraction**, _AKA van der Waals'forces_.

These weak intermolecular forces can be overcome easily, hence they have **low melting and boiling points**.

However, atoms within the molecules itself are held together by strong covalent bonds.

## Simple.Molecular Structure

For example, ammonia has a simple molecular structure.

These ammonia molecules experience **weak intermolecular forces of attraction between other ammonia molecules**. Hence, they have low melting point & boiling point.

**HOWEVER**, within the ammonia molecules are **strong covalent bonds** that holds together a single nitrogen atom and three hydrogen atoms.

**TAKE NOTEI**

Are covalent bonds strong? **Yes, very strong**.

Then why the low MP BBP Because it is the weak intermolecular forces that are being overcame**.

For example, it is easy to change the state of water (melting/boiling) but extremely difficult to break a water molecule back into the individual hydrogen and oxygen atoms, as that would involve breaking the strong covalent bonds.

**Covalent bonds & intermolecular forces of attraction are different things!!**
