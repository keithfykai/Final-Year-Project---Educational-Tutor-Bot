### 1.3 PHYSICAL PROPERTIES OF AMINES

(a)Boiling \(I\) / Melting Points (SDL)

Lower alkylamines are gases (with odours similar to ammonia) or low boiling liquids (with characteristic fishy smell). Amines with high molecular mass are solids.

E.g. CH\({}_{3}\)NH\({}_{2}\) b.p. = -7\({}^{\circ}\)C (gas) CH\({}_{3}\)CH\({}_{2}\)NH\({}_{2}\) b.p. = 17\({}^{\circ}\)C (gas) CH\({}_{3}\)CH\({}_{2}\)CH\({}_{2}\)NH\({}_{2}\) b.p. = 49\({}^{\circ}\)C (liquid)

Boiling points of amines are higher than the alkanes of similar relative molecular masses.

E.g. CH\({}_{3}\)CH\({}_{2}\)CH\({}_{3}\) (M\({}_{r}\) = 44), b.p. = - 42\({}^{\circ}\)C CH\({}_{3}\)CH\({}_{2}\)NH\({}_{2}\) (M\({}_{r}\) = 45), b.p. = 17\({}^{\circ}\)C

**Reason**: Amines are polar compounds and can form **intermolecular hydrogen bonds**. Large amount of energy is required to overcome the stronger hydrogen bonds between amine molecules.

Among isomeric amines, primary amines have the highest boiling points, and tertiary amines the lowest.

**Reason:** Tertiary amines have no N-H bond, they are unable to form intermolecular hydrogen bonds between molecules of tertiary amine.

**Only 1\({}^{\circ}\) and 2\({}^{\circ}\) amines can form intermolecular hydrogen bonds.**

WHY?

**Reason:** For 1\({}^{\circ}\) and 2\({}^{\circ}\) amines, the H atom bonded to N can form H-bonding with the lone pair of electrons on N atom of another molecule. However, molecules of 3\({}^{\circ}\) amines lack a H atom bonded to the electronegative N atom, hence they can only form weaker permanent dipole-permanent dipole attractions between the molecules.

For molecules with similar number of electrons, amines have lower boiling point than alcohols.

**Reason:** Since N atom is less electronegative than O atom, the N-H bond in amines is less polar than the O-H bond in alcohols. Hence, hydrogen bonding between amines is weaker than the hydrogen bonding between alcohols.

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|} \hline
**Compound** & **Functional Group** & **Mr** & **Boiling point / \({}^{\circ}\)C** & **Predominant intermolecular forces of attraction** \\ \hline CH\({}_{3}\)CH\({}_{3}\) & Alkane & 30 & -89 & Instantaneous dipole - induced dipole attractions \\ \hline CH\({}_{3}\)NH\({}_{2}\) & Amine & 31 & -6 & Hydrogen bonding \\ \hline CH\({}_{3}\)OH & Alcohol & 32 & 65 & Hydrogen bonding \\ \hline \end{tabular}

2025 JCE 2H2 Nitrogen Compounds (b) **Solubility (SDL)**

Lower alkylamines (usually amines with fewer than 5 carbon atoms) are **soluble in water Reason**: All amines (1\({}^{\circ}\), 2\({}^{\circ}\), 3\({}^{\circ}\)) can form **hydrogen bonds** with water molecules.

**Tertiary amines, though they do not contain a H atom bonded to a N atom, can form hydrogen bonds with water as well (as shown in the diagram below).**

**However, solubility in water decreases as molecular mass increases. E.g.**

**Phenylamine has limited solubility in water.**

**Recall:**

For a solute to dissolve in a solvent, the energy released from the solute-solvent interactions >-1 energy required to overcome the solute-solute interactions and solvent-solvent interactions.

**Reason: As molecular mass increases due to increase in number of C atoms in the hydrocarbon chain, there will be stronger instantaneous dipole-induced dipole (i.d.-i.d.) attractions (as number of electrons increases) between amine molecules.**

**Hence, energy released from the formation of hydrogen bonds between the amine and water molecules is not enough to compensate for the energy required to overcome the stronger i.d.-i.d. attraction between amine molecules and hydrogen bonding between water molecules.**

### BASIC PROPERTIES OF AMINES

**Amines like ammonia are weak Lewis bases in which the lone pair of electrons on the N atom can form a co-ordinate (dative) bond with a proton from an acid (i.e. act as electron pair donor).**

**The basic strength of an amine depends on the availability of the lone pair of electrons on N atom to form a dative bond to H\({}^{+}\) (or to accept a proton).**The extra alkyl groups in 2'/3' amine exerts a greater electron donating effect and increase the electron density on N atom. This increases the availability of the lone pair of electrons on N atom to accept a proton.

Relative Basicity of Amines in AQUEOUS medium

* **Recall from _Acid-Base Equilibria_: The strength of a base is indicated by the extent to which the dissociation equilibrium lies to the right and this is represented by the base dissociation constant, \(\mathbf{K_{b}}\). E.g. When an amine is dissolved in water, equilibrium is established in which the lone pair on N atom of the amine accepts a proton from water. Water is acting as an acid. \[\begin{array}{ccccc}\text{R}\text{N}\text{H}_{2}&+&\text{H}_{2}\text{O}& \text{R}\text{N}\text{H}_{3}&+&\text{OH}^{+}\\ \\ \text{K}_{\text{b}}=\frac{[\text{R}\text{N}\text{H}_{3}+[\text{OH}^{+}]}{[ \text{R}\text{N}\text{H}_{2}]}\\ \\ \text{\Rightarrow}\text{The \bf{more readily}}\text{the lone pair of electrons on N atom accepts a proton}\\ \\ \text{\Rightarrow}\text{the \bf{larger}}\text{the value of }\text{K}_{\text{b}}\\ \\ \text{the \bf{stronger}}\text{the base}\end{array}\] \[\begin{array}{ccccc}\text{Compare }\text{K}_{\text{b}}\text{ of ammonia, ethylamine and phenylamine:}\\ \\ \text{Ammonia}&\text{H--N}\text{H}_{2}&1.8\times 10^{5}\\ \\ \text{Ethylamine}&\text{CH}_{3}\text{CH}_{2}\text{--N}\text{H}_{2}&5.6\times 10^{4} \\ \\ \text{Phenylamine}&\text{NH}_{2}&4.2\times 10^{-10}\\ \\ \text{Why does the base dissociation constant, }\text{K}_{\text{b}}\text{, values differ for different compounds?}\\ \\ \text{What are the other factors that can affect the basicity of a compound?}\\ \end{array}\]

**(1) Ethylamine is a stronger base than ammonia**

- Ethyl (or in general, alkyl) group is **electron-donating** and increases the electron density around the N atom.

- This **increases** the **availability of the lone pair of electrons on N atom to accept a proton** (or to form a native bond to a proton).

- Resulting in a stronger base than ammonia.

**(2) Phenylamine is a weaker base than ammonia**

-

 Lone pair of electrons on N atom in phenylalanine is **delocalised** into the \(\pi\) electron cloud of the benzene ring.

- This **decreases** the **availability of the lone pair of electrons on N atom to accept a proton** (or to form a native bond to a proton).

- Resulting in a weaker base than ammonia.

Conclusion:

**In general, the relative basicities in aqueous medium:**

**RNH2 (alkylamines) > NH3 > C6HsNH2 (phenylamine)**

The reaction with Br\({}_{2}\)(aq) can be used to distinguish phenylalanine from benzene.

Observation when Br\({}_{2}\)(aq) is added to benzene: orange bromine remains.

Recall that

1. -NH\({}_{2}\) is electron-donating by resonance and activates the benzene ring so multiple substitution will occur.

### Physical Properties

* Amides are **neutral** solids, because the lone pair of electrons on nitrogen atom is delocalised into the \(\mathrm{tr}\) bond of the adjacent C=O by resonance, **hence not available to accept a proton**.

* Amides have high melting and boiling points due to **intermolecular hydrogen bonding**. (Note that tertiary amides have no N-H group, so they are unable to form intermolecular hydrogen bonding.)
* Methanamide, HCONH\({}_{2}\), is a liquid at room temperature, while all other amides are white crystalline solids.

* **Lower aliphatic** amides (\(\leq\) C\({}_{4}\)) are **soluble** in water due to formation of **hydrogen bonds** with water. **Higher aliphatic** (\(\geq\) C\({}_{5}\)) and **aromatic** amides are **insoluble** in water due to **large non polar** alkyl / aryl groups present.

All amides are soluble in common organic solvents.

### 2.4 PREPARATION OF AMIDES

From acyl chlorides

Acyl chlorides undergo nucleophilic (acyl) substitution/ condensation to give amides.

The carbonyl C is highly electron deficient as it is bonded to two electronegative atoms - chlorine and oxygen.

Two molar equivalents of reagents (NH\({}_{3}\) / RNH\({}_{2}\)) are involved in the reaction with acyl chlorides

- one molecule of the reagent acts as a nucleophile,

- the second molecule acts as a Bronsted base.

## 3 AMINO ACIDS

### INTRODUCTION TO AMINO ACIDS

Amino acids are the building blocks of proteins. Of the 20 amino acids needed to make up our proteins, eight cannot be synthesised in our bodies. These eight are called essential amino acids and must be part of our diet.

An amino acid molecule has two functional groups, a **carboxylic acid group**, -COOH, and a basic **amino group**, -NH\({}_{2}\).

There are **two types** of amino acids: **Naturally Occurring** and **Synthetic**.

Naturally occurring amino acids **can** be synthesised in the human body while synthetic ones cannot.

All naturally occurring amino acids are **\(\underline{\alpha}\)-amino acids** where the \(\alpha\)-carbon is directly bonded to BOTH -COOH and - NH\({}_{2}\) groups. The general structure of an \(\alpha\)-amino acid is shown below:

The side chain, **R**, varies considerably in the 20 naturally occurring \(\alpha\)-amino acids (see p 24 - 25). The composition of the **R** group confers an individual set of properties to each amino acid, which affects the properties of the proteins in which they are found.

If the **R** group contains **one or more carboxyl group**, -COOH: **acidic** amino acid.

If the **R** group contains **one or more amino group**, -NH\({}_{2}\): **basic** amino acid.

If the **R** group contains **neutral group(s)**: **neutral** amino acid.

All amino acids, except aminoethanoic acid (glycine), have 4 different groups attached to the \(\alpha\)-carbon.

\(\Rightarrow\) exhibit enantiomerism

(_Recall:_ enantiomers _are non-superimposable mirror images of each other, rotate plane polarised light_)

E.g.

Synthetic amino acids (\(\beta\)-amino acids) are rare in nature and are **not** found in proteins.

The **-NH\({}_{2}\)** and **-COOH** groups of **\(\beta\)-amino acids** are **not** attached to the **same C atom**.

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:20]

2025 JC2 H2 Nitrogen Compounds Amino acids are very soluble in water (and other polar solvents) but not in non-polar solvents.

**Reason**: The charged ends of the zwitterions can form strong **ion-dipole attractions** with water molecules.

(c) **Acid-base Properties of amino acids**

 Amino acid zwitterions are **ambhoteric** since they contain an acidic functional group and a basic functional group

- acidic functional group is the ammonium ion : -NHs\({}^{*}\)

- basic functional group is the carboxylate ion : -COO\({}^{*}\)

The acid / base behaviour of an amino acid depends on the **pH** of the solution it is dissolved in.

By varying the pH of the solution used, a mixture of amino acids can be separated by a process known as electrophoresis.

_Fun Facts_

**Separation of Amino Acids**

Different amino acids can exist as zwitterions, positive ions or negative ions, depending on the pH of the solution. To separate the amino acids, the pH of the solution is varied slightly over time and the different amino acids will migrate to the electrodes at different pH values.

Amino acids can also be separated by paper chromatography. The different amino acids are separated based on different solubilities in a solvent as well as their molecular masses. Amino acids which are more soluble will move faster, and lighter amino acids will move faster than heavier amino acids. A reagent, ninhydrin, is then used to indicate the position of amino acids by the observation of a blue or purple colouration.

(c) 2025/ASRJC/CHEM* Amino acids will always exist in their most protonated form before they are subjected to neutralization
* pH = pK\({}_{\text{\textvis}}\) @ % equivalence point.

How are the pK\({}_{\text{a}}\) values assigned to the various acidic groups in glutamic acid and lysine?

This disperses the negative charge of the anion (conjugate base) and stabilises it to a greater extent. Hence dissociation to form H\({}^{+}\) is more favoured.

This decreases the availability of the lone pair of electron on N atom in the amine to accept a proton, hence the position of above equilibrium lies to the right, favouring the formation of H\({}_{3}\)O\({}^{+}\).

## 4 POLYPETIDES & PROTEINS

### POLYPETIDES

When two amino acids react together, the compound formed is known as a **dipeptide**.

This is a **condensation reaction** between the -COOH group of one \(\alpha\)-amino acid with the -NH\({}_{2}\) group of the other \(\alpha\)-amino acid to eliminate a (small) molecule of water.

_By convention_, the amino acid that contains the **free -NH\({}_{2}\) group** is always placed on the **left**.

The CO-NH group is also an amide functional group.

The term **peptide linkage/bond** is used when the amide functional group is formed between the \(\alpha\)-COOH and \(\alpha\)- NH\({}_{2}\) of two **amino acids**.

When either end of a dipeptide reacts with another amino acid, a **tripeptide** is formed.

Amino acids can keep reacting to form longer and longer amino acid chains, known as **polypeptides**.

Proteins are made up of one or more long polypeptide chains.

The amino acids that make up the proteins are called **residues**.

The **R** groups of the individual amino acids in a protein chain are called **side chains**.

Proteins are **polymers of high M\({}_{r}\)** made up of **long polypeptide chains** of amino acid residues.

Proteins have **open ends** structure unlike peptides.
