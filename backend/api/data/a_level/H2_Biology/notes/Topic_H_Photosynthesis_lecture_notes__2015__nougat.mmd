## 1 Autotrophs: Producers for the Earth

Photosynthesis nourishes almost all life on earth directly or indirectly. **Autotrophs** are organisms that sustain themselves without feeding on other organisms.

Autotrophs can produce their own organic (carbon-containing) compounds from carbon dioxide (an inorganic source of carbon) and other inorganic compounds obtained from the environment using the energy harnessed from the environment. As plants use light as a source of energy to synthesise these organic compounds, they are specifically known as **photoautotrophs**.

Heterotrophs feed on other organisms as they are unable to make their own organic compounds, unlike autotrophs.

**Autotrophs** undergo **photosynthesis** where **light energy** is used to **synthesize carbohydrates** from **carbon dioxide and water**. Oxygen is given out in the process as a by-product. The product formed is a sugar that is soon converted to starch for storage. There are two main stages in photosynthesis, namely the **light-dependent** and **light-independent** reactions / **Calvin cycle**.

2 Structure of the Chloroplast

The two major steps for photosynthesis take place in specific regions within the chloroplast:

1) Light-dependent reactions - _Thylakoids of the grana_

2) Light-independent reactions (the Calvin cycle) - _Stroma_

The _thylakoids_ possess the following properties which allow the _light-dependent reactions_ of photosynthesis to be carried out:

1) _Large surface area_ of thylakoid membrane

* Allows _photosystems_ and _electron carriers_ to be embedded.
* Allows _stalked particles containing ATP synthase_ to be embedded.

2) Thylakoid membrane is _impermeable to protons_
* Allows _electrochemical proton gradient_ to be set up between the thylakoid space and stroma.

The _stroma_ is a dense fluid which _contains the enzymes and dissolved substrates_ required for the _light-independent reactions_ of photosynthesis, also known as the _Calvin cycle_.

Excess carbohydrate from photosynthesis is stored as _starch grains_ in the chloroplasts. _Lipid droplets_, which are associated with the breakdown of membranes and lipids, also accumulate within the chloroplasts.

Photoysynthesis

**3. Photosynthetic Pigments**

There are 2 types of photosynthetic pigments which are the **chlorophyll**s and the **carotenoids.** These pigments are found in **photosystems (PS)** which are embedded on the thylakoid membranes. The role of the pigments is to **absorb light energy** and **convert it into chemical energy.**

**(a) Chlorophylls**

There are 2 main types of chlorophyll - **chlorophyll a** and **chlorophyll b.** They absorb mainly **red** and **blue-violet light**, reflecting green light and therefore giving plants their characteristic green colour.

Their chemical structure consists of:

\(\bullet\) a head made up of a porphyrin ring with a magnesium ion in the centre, and

\(\bullet\) a long hydrocarbon tail which is joined to its head by an ester linkage.

Different chlorophylls have different side-chains on the head and these modify their absorption spectra.

**(b) Carotenoids**

There are 2 main types of carotenoids - **carotenes** and **xanthophylls.** They are yellow, orange, red or brown pigments that **absorb strongly in the blue-violet light spectrum**. They are usually masked by the green chlorophylls.

Carotenoids **protect chlorophylls from excess light and oxidation by oxygen produced during photosynthesis**.

## 4 Absorption and Action Spectra

* Absorption spectrum
* A graph showing the relative absorbance of different wavelengths of light by a pigment.
* Action spectrum
* A graph showing the effectiveness of different wavelengths of light in stimulating photosynthesis.
* It is a record of the amount of photosynthesis occurring at each wavelength of light.

The close similarity/correlation between the absorption spectrum and action spectrum indicates that the photosynthetic pigments are responsible for absorption of light in photosynthesis.

## 5 Light-dependent Reactions

Light-dependent reactions occur in the grana. The objective of these reactions is to provide **ATP** and **reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (reduced NADP / NADPH + H')** for the light-independent reactions (Calvin cycle).

As the energy for the synthesis of ATP comes from light, it is called **photophosphorylation**. There are 2 types of photophosphorylation - **cyclic** and **non-cyclic**.

Figure 1: **How a photosystem harvests light.** When a photon strikes a pigment molecule in a light-harvesting complex, the energy is passed from molecule to molecule until it reaches the reaction center. At the reaction center, an excited electron from one of the two special chlorophyll a molecules is captured by the primary electron acceptor.

_Step 1:_

* **Light** of particular wavelengths strikes an **accessory pigment molecule** in the **light harvesting complex** of **PSil and PSI**.
* **This energy** is relayed to **neighbouring accessory pigment molecules** until it accumulates and reaches one of the two P680 chlorophyll a molecules in the reaction centre of PSI.
* **The same occurs for the P700 chlorophyll a molecules in the reaction centre of PSI.**

_Step 2:_

* **This excites one of the P680 electrons and one of the P700 electrons to a higher energy state, which subsequently gets emitted and captured by the primary electron acceptor within each PS.**
* **A positive 'hole' is left behind in each P680 and P700 chlorophyll a molecule in PSI and PSI respectively.**

_Step 3 (occurs concurrently with Step 4):_

* **Photolysis of water occurs when an enzyme catalyses the splitting of a water molecule into protons, electrons and molecular oxygen.**

* **Electrons from the photolysis of water are used to fill up positive 'holes' in the reaction centre of PSII to return P680' to ground state.**

_Step 4 (occurs concurrently with Step 3):_

* **The photoexcited electron (that was emitted by P680 in PSII previously) passes from the primary electron acceptor of PSII to P700' in PSI, to fill the positive 'hole' in P700'.**
* **This occurs via an electron transport chain made up of electron carriers, each with an energy level lower than the one preceding it.**_Step 5:_

* Energy from the _electron transfer_ down the chain of electron carriers is used to _actively_ **pump protons** from _the stroma into the thylakoid space_.
* This generates an electrochemical proton gradient for the _synthesis of ATP_.
* Protons diffuse through the _staked particle_ containing _ATP synthase_ which catalyzes the _synthesis of ATP_ from _ADP_ and \(P\).
* This process by which protons (H\({}^{+}\)) diffuse through a stalked particle for the synthesis of ATP is known as _chemiosmosis_.

**Comparison of chemiosmosis in mitochondria and chloroplasts.** In both kinds of organelles, electron transport chains pump protons (H\({}^{+}\)) across a membrane from a region of low H\({}^{+}\) concentration (light gray in this diagram) to one of high H\({}^{+}\) concentration (dark gray). The protons then diffuse back across the membrane through ATP synthase, driving the synthesis of ATP.

_Step 6:_

* **Electrons and protons** are _passed down a second electron transport chain from the primary_ **electron acceptor of PSI to** the protein _ferredoxin_ (the last electron carrier).

_Step 7:_

* The enzyme _NADP reductase_ catalyses the _transfer of electrons from _ferredoxin to oxidised_ **NADP (the final electron and proton acceptor)** to form _reduced NADP_.

**NADP\({}^{+}\) + 2e\({}^{+}\) + 2H\({}^{+}\)**NADPH + H\({}^{+}\)**The above diagram shows a current model for the organization of the thylakoid membrane. As electrons pass from carrier to carrier in redox reactions, protons removed from the stroma are pumped into the thylakoid space storing energy as a proton-motive force (electrochemical proton gradient).

The electrochemical proton gradient is established across the thylakoid membrane:

1. Higher concentration of protons in thylakoid space 1. Water undergoes photolysis in the thylakoid space, generating protons in the process. 2. As plastoquinone (Pq), a mobile carrier, transfers electrons to the cytochrome complex, protons are translocated across the membrane into the thylakoid space. 2. Lower concentration of protons in stroma 3. Protons are removed from the stroma when they are taken up by oxidised NADP.

The diffusion of H+ from the thylakoid space back to the stroma (down the electrochemical proton gradient) powers the ATP synthase. These light-driven reactions store chemical energy in NADPH + H+ and ATP, which shuttle the energy to the sugar-producing Calvin cycle.

1. [label=()]
2. _Cyclic Photophosphorylation_ In cyclic photophosphorylation, the electrons follow a different route.

 PSI is now **both a donor and acceptor of electrons**. The excited electrons in the primary electron acceptor of PSI pass to ferredoxin and back to the cytochrome complex in the electron transport chain**. The electrons eventually return to the PSI reaction centre.

Cyclic photophosphorylation **does not involve photolysis of water**.

* (c) Regeneration of RuBP **About 5/6** of the total amount of GALP has to be used to regenerate the RuBP consumed in the first reaction. This process requires energy from the hydrolysis of ATP. This regeneration of RuBP makes this process a cycle.

In order to generate 1 molecule of GALP (3C sugar) from the Calvin cycle, we require:

* 3 CO\({}_{2}\)
* 9 ATP
* 6 reduced NADP

Therefore, in order to generate 1 molecule of glucose (6C sugar), we require:

* 6 CO\({}_{2}\)
* 18 ATP
* 12 reduced NADP

## 6 Limiting Factors in Photosynthesis

A **limiting factor** is one which at its minimum value will limit the rate of the overall reaction.

The rate of photosynthesis is an important factor in crop production since it affects yields. An understanding of these factors affecting the rate is likely to lead to an improvement in crop management.

Rate of photosynthesis can be measured in terms of:

dry mass formed per unit time;

volume of oxygen evolved per unit time;

volume of carbon dioxide absorbed per unit time.

1. **Light** (i) Light intensity Light intensity is an important limiting factor in the light-dependent stage to **excite the special chlorophyll a molecules for photophosphorylation** to occur. However, it is seldom the limiting factor during daylight hours (except in the case of shaded plants). Photosynthesis results in uptake of carbon dioxide and evolution of oxygen. At the same time respiration uses oxygen and produces carbon dioxide. There will come a point when the light intensity causes photosynthesis and respiration to exactly balance each other. This is called the **light compensation point** (i.e. **light intensity at which net gas exchange is zero**). The light compensation points of plants grown in abundant sunlight is higher than those grown in shade.
2. **Wavelength of light** **Wavelength of light** **Wavelength of light** **is also a limiting factor as demonstrated by comparing the action and absorption spectra for photosynthesis. The rate of photosynthesis is **highest at the red and blue-violet regions** of the action spectrum and **lowest at the green region**.

## Appendix

### C3.C4 and CAM plants

In hot and dry conditions, plants will close their stomata to prevent loss of water. Under these conditions, oxygen gas, produced by the light reactions of photosynthesis, will concentrate in the leaves causing photorespiration to occur. Some plants have evolved mechanisms to increase the CO2 concentration in the leaves under these conditions.

C4 plants capture carbon dioxide using an enzyme called PEP Carboxylase that adds carbon dioxide to the three carbon molecule Phosphoenolpyruvate (PFP) creating the 4-carbon molecule oxaloacetic acid. Plants without this enzyme are called C3 plants because the primary carboxylation reaction produces the three-carbon sugar 3-phosphoglycerate directly in the Calvin-Benson Cycle. When oxygen levels rise in the leaf, C4 plants reverse the reaction to release carbon dioxide thus preventing photorespiration. By preventing photorespiration, C4 plants can produce more sugar than C3 plants in conditions of strong light and high temperature. Many important crop plants are C4 plants including maize, sorghum, sugarcane, and millet.

Xerophytes such as cacti and most succulents also can use PEP Carboxylase to capture carbon dioxide in a process called Crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM). They store the CO2 in different molecules than the C4 plants (mostly they store it in the form of malic acid via carboxylation of phosphoenolpyruvate to oxaloacetate, which is then reduced to malate). Nevertheless, C4 plants capture the CO2 in one type of cell tissue (mesophyll) and then transfer it to another type of tissue (bundle sheath cells) so that carbon fixation may occur via the Calvin cycle. They also have a different leaf anatomy than C4 plants. They grab the CO2 at night, when their stomata are open, and they release it into the leaves during the day to increase their photosynthetic rate. C4 metabolism physically separates CO2 fixation from the Calvin cycle, while CAM metabolism temporally separates CO2 fixation from the Calvin cycle.
