## 1. Biological Drawing

Here, we are training your observational skills. You should learn to look very closely at a specimen, and use sound Biology knowledge to choose the structures to include or omit in your drawing.

### A good biological drawing should...

* Be drawn using a sharp 2B pencil
* Cover at least 2/3 of space given
* Have a clean, clear and sharp outline
* Have **straight labeling lines** drawn using ruler (Ideally, labels should all be on one side of the drawing. Label lines also should not cross or obscure the drawing.)
* Have labels for all features of the drawing
* Have an explanatory title that is underlined
* Have accurate relative sizes of the structures drawn
* Indicate the magnification at the bottom of the diagram

Here is an example of a good biological drawing.

## How to calculate the magnification of scientific drawing?

\begin{tabular}{|c c|} \hline \hline magnification = & size of drawing (cm) \\ \hline actual size (cm) & x \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}

In summary, have you gotten STAMP'D for approval?

* at least 2/3 of space provide
* Title of drawing
* showing all details
* Magnification
* Proportion
* sharp, clear lines

## Chapter 2 Tabulating Data

When carrying out experiments, you will have to take down raw data - both qualitative and quantitative. It is therefore important for you present your data in a clear and logical manner.

**Quantitative data**: It is a good practice to draw a table **before** you begin an experiment then enter the data straight into the table on collection.

**A good table should...**

* Have independent variable in the extreme left column
* Have dependent variables or qualitative observations in the following columns
* Clear headings with units
* **Not** have units in the body of the table
* Group measurements together if experiment is repeated (So that an average of the measurement can be later calculated)

**Here is an example of a good table.**

**What are the three types of variables?**

The things that are changing in an experiment are called **variables**. There are three types of variables:

* **Independent** variable is the factor that is.
* **Dependent** variable is the factor that.
* **Constant** variables: parts of the experiment that are kept the.

### Degree of accuracy

You should use the correct number of significant figures when recording the results.

All data should be written in tables to the **same** number of decimal places. This number would be determined by the precision of the instrument used to measure the data.

The table shows some commonly used apparatus in the laboratory and the common accuracy values for each apparatus.

Updated: Feb 2023 | Biology Unit

### Degree of accuracy for calculations

The final answer for calculation should be left in the number of significant figure according to the raw data that is the **least** accurate.

Example:

Calculate the size of an object if the drawing is measured to be 24.6 cm and has a magnification of x25.

size of real object = size of image / magnification size of real object = 24.6 / 25 = 9.84 \(\approx\) 9.8 cm

**Qualitative data:** It is presented in a descriptive format. It is good practice to use simple language that everyone can understand.

### Here are some examples of good qualitative data.

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|} \hline
**Not so good observations** & **Good observations** \\ \hline (Universal indicator) The solution turned red. & The solution turned from green to red. \\ \hline (Benedict's test) The solution turned brick-red. & Brick-red ppt was formed. \\ \hline (Limewater test) The solution turned milky / & White ppt was formed. \\ chalky. & \\ \hline (Photosynthesis) Some parts of the leaf turned & The parts of the leaf that were originally green \\ blue-black. & were stained blue-black. The parts of the leaf \\ \hline (Iodine test) No change. & Iodine solution remained brown. \\ \hline (Table: Lam, P. K., Lam, E. Y., \& Lee, C. Y. (2014). G.C.E. O Level Biology Matters Practical Book. Singapore: Marshall Cavendish Education.) \\ \hline \end{tabular}

## Chapter 3.Plotting Graphs

Graphing skills can be assessed both in O-Level written papers and practical assessment.

### A good graph should...

* Have both axes clearly labelled with the quantity measured and units
* Have independent variable on the x-axis and dependent variable on the y-axis
* Have a suitable scale
* Cover at least 2/3 of the grids
* Use crosses (x) to plot the data clearly
* Use a smooth best-fit line or curve to join up the points
* **Not** have the line extending beyond the first and last points (No extrapolation)

### Here is an example of a good graph.

### How to choose a suitable scale?

You should consider the following before marking the scales:

* the maximum and minimum values of each variable
* the size of the graph paper
* whether 0.0 should be included as a data point
* do not use a difficult scale (e.g. multiples of 3, 7, 11 etc)

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:9]

In summary, make sure you aim for the ALPS in graphing!

* have labels with units
* smooth best-fit line or curve
* points plotted clearly using crosses (x)
* easy to read and covers at least 2/3 of the grids

### Cobalt chloride paper

This indicator is used to show the presence of water, or humidity, in the environment. Cobalt paper is initially blue in colour.

## 5.Planning an Experiment

As a Science student, you should be able to make use of your knowledge and practice to plan investigations to solve problems.

### A good plan should include...

* Independent, dependent, and constant variables
* A step-by-step description of the procedure
* Describe how variables are kept constant and/or changed
* Describe how the data collected can be used to reach a conclusion
* Identify risks of the experiment and state the precautions that should be taken to keep risks to a minimum

### Here is an example.

[style=MyFrame]

Describe how variables are kept constant / changed.

[style=MyFrame]

Number your steps.

Be very clear and precise.

[style=MyFrame]

**Procedures**:

1. Remove a green leaf from a plant that has been exposed to sunlight for 1 hour and another that is kept in a dark room for 1 hour.
2. Put the 2 leaves in boiling water for 2 min.
3. Put the boiled leaves in a boiling tube containing some ethanol. Place the boiling tube in a beaker of hot water. The Bunsen flame should be turned off before putting the tube in hot water.
4. Gently remove the leaves and put them into the hot water.
5. Remove the leaves and spread them evenly on a white tile.
6. Add a few drops of iodine solution to the leaves.

### Conclusion:

1. If iodine solution remains brown, starch is not present. Plant has not carried out photosynthesis.
2. If iodine solution turns blue-black, starch is present. Plant has carried out photosynthesis.

## 6 Sources of Error

### Experimental errors

Errors are uncontrolled variables that could affect your results.

Experimental errors may arise due to:

* Inconsistencies of biological specimens
* Limitation of instrument used, resulting in a lack of precision
* Influence of environmental condition, such as wind, temperature, humidity, on the experimental set-up

### Suggesting improvements

You may be asked to suggest how the investigation you have done could be improved. Your improvements should be aimed at getting more valid or reliable results to the question the investigation was trying to answer.

The improvements you could suggest are:

* Do several repeats in the experiment and calculate a mean
* Using a more precise instrument
* How to control variables that were not controlled previously

### Here are some examples of sources of errors.

\begin{tabular}{p{142.3pt}|p{142.3pt}|p{142.3pt}} \hline
**Source of error** & **Effect on results** & **Improvement to experiment** \\ \hline Specimens provided may come from different potato plants. & Different amount of catalase may be present in cells, resulting in higher or lower production of oxygen. Hence, the number of bubbles produced **may be higher or lower than expected**. & Use the same potato tuber for each concentration of solution. \\ \hline Potato slices were trapped in the froth. & As potato slices take up space and volume, the height of froth measured **may be higher than expected**. & Use one slice of potato and repeat the experiment for the second slice. Calculate the average change in height of froth. \\ \hline Potato slices tend to stick to each other. & As surface area exposed to hydrogen peroxide decreases, less oxygen **may be produced**, resulting in **lesser number of bubbles counted than expected**. & Use one slice of potato and repeat the experiment for the second slice. Calculate the average number of bubbles produced. \\ \hline Water could have evaporated from the sucrose solution. This could increase the concentration of sucrose solution surrounding the stalk. & There is an increase in net movement of water molecules out of the plant tissue, causing it to curve outwards by a lesser extent. Hence, the length of the stalk may be shorter than expected. \\ \hline \end{tabular}
