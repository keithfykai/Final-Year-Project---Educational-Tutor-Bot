### 1 The Atom and the Subatomic Particles

#### Subatomic Particles

Learning Outcome:

Identify and describe protons, neutrons and electrons in terms of their relative charges and relative masses

Describe the distribution of mass and charges within an atom

An **atom** is the smallest particle found in an element that can take part in a chemical reaction. Particles that are smaller than the atom are called **subatomic particles**. The three main **subatomic particles** that form an atom are **protons**, **neutrons**, and **electrons**. Protons and neutrons are collectively known as **nucleons**. The centre of the atom is called the **nucleus**.

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|} \hline
**Particles** & **Symbol** & **Position** & **Relative** & **Mass / amu\({}^{\star}\)** & **Actual mass / kg** \\ \hline Protons & p & Nucleus & +1 & 1 & 1.67 \(\times\) 10\({}^{-27}\) \\ \hline Neutrons & n & Nucleus & 0 & 1 & 1.67 \(\times\) 10\({}^{-27}\) \\ \hline Electrons & **e** & Orbitals & \(-1\) & \(\frac{1}{1840}\) & 9.11 \(\times\) 10\({}^{-31}\) \\ \hline \end{tabular}

\({}^{\star}\)_Atomic mass units, or amu. It is defined as \(\frac{1}{12}\) the mass of one atom of carbon-12._

Almost the whole mass of the atom is concentrated in the nucleus, which takes up an extremely small space relative to the size of the whole atom. The size of an atom is easily more than 10,000 times that of the nucleus.

#### Nuclides and Isotopes

Learning Outcome:

### Atomic Structure

#### Behaviour of Subatomic Particles in an Electric Field

Learning Outcome:

(b) Deduce the behaviour of beams of protons, neutrons and electrons in an electric field

Protons, electrons and neutrons behave differently in an electric field due to differences in their charges and relative masses.

When beams of the three types of subatomic particles with the **same speed** are all travelling through an electric field of constant strength, each beam differs in their path travelled based on:

* **Direction** of deflection
* **Angle** of deflection

#### **Subatomic particles**

**Direction of deflection**

**Proto, p**

**(positive charge)**

**Direction of deflection**

**(positive charge)**

**Direction, e**

**(negative charge)**

**Neutron, n**

**undeflected**

**zero**

**(uncharged)**

Deflection of a beam of charged particles **only starts when the beam enters the electric field**. Since an attractive force continuously acts on the charged particles in the beam, the beam travels in a **curve path** as it undergoes acceleration.

Once **out of the electric field**, not attractive force acts on the charged particles in the beam. Hence, the beam continues its path in a **straight line**.

Although electrons and protons have the same magnitude of charge, **electrons are lighter**, and are hence **deflected to a greater extent** (i.e. \(\alpha>\beta\)).

In general,

* **Direction** of deflection is dependent on charge of a particle
* **Angle** of deflection is dependent on the charge to mass ratio of a particle

\[\begin{array}{c}\mbox{angle of deflection}\propto\left|\begin{array}{c}\mbox{q} \\ \mbox{m}\end{array}\right|\\ \mbox{where q is the charge of the particle, m is the mass of the particle}\end{array}\]

Hence, particles with **smaller mass** and/or **higher charge** will be **deflected more** in the electric field.

## Atomic Structure

A Levels/2021/P1/Q1

In two separate experiments a beam of protons and a beam of electrons, travelling at the same velocity, pass through an electric field as shown.

Which statements are correct?

1 The electrons are deflected to a larger extent than the protons.

2 The electron beam is deflected in the opposite direction to the proton beam.

3 The proton beam travels in a straight path towards the negatively charged plate.

[FIGURE:S3.F1][ENDFIGURAtomic Structure

Self Check 4A

Beams of charged particles are deflected by an electric field.

In an experiment, protons are deflected by an angle of +15\({}^{\circ}\). In another experiment, under identical conditions, particle **X** is deflected by an angle of -5\({}^{\circ}\).

What could be the composition of particle **X**?

The Arrangement of Electrons

Electrons are not randomly distributed within an atom. Rather, they occupy specific volume regions, which have specific energies associated with them.

### Atomic Orbitals

Learning Outcome:

(g) Describe the shapes of s, p and d orbitals. [knowledge of wave functions is not required]

Knowing that electrons move around the nucleus, if we plot the position of a particular electron in a hydrogen atom every ten seconds over a period of time, we will see that the electron can be found anywhere within a spherical space around the nucleus, as shown in the diagram below.

The circle in the diagram demarcates the region of space in which you will be able to find the electron **95% of the time**. This region of **three dimensional space** is called an **orbital**.

In other words, an **orbital** is a region of space in which there is a high probability (95%) of finding an electron. Each orbital contains a maximum of 2 electrons. The energy of an orbital is the energy of the electrons occupying it.

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:9]

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:10]

## 3 Electronic Configuration

Learning Outcome:

State the electronic configuration of atoms and ions given the proton number (and charge)

The **electronic configuration** of an element refers to the arrangement of electrons in the principal quantum shells, subshells and orbitals.

Knowing the electronic configuration enables us to identify the electron(s) to be removed in a chemical reaction. We will be able to know which orbital the electron to be removed resides in, and consequently the amount of energy required to remove it.

### Rules for Arranging Electrons

**Rule 1: Pauli's Exclusion Principle**

Two electrons in the **same orbital** must have **opposite spins**.

Electrons are often described with a special property known as spin. This does not relate to the physical movement of the particles, but rather, their tendency to be deflected in a magnetic field. There are two possible orientations for electron spin, represented by arrows pointing in opposite directions.

Electron spin gives rise to the formation of magnetic fields. If two electrons in the same orbital have the same spin, the magnetic field created will be repulsive, causing the energy level of these two electrons to be higher, and thus being less stable as compared to a pair of electrons with opposite spins.

**Rule 2: Hund's Rule**

**Orbitals of a subshell** must be **singly occupied first with parallel spins before pairing occurs**.

For example, when filling **six** electrons into the **p subshell**,

**After filling the first three electrons:**

Orbitals are singly occupied, electrons have parallel spins

**After filling all six electrons:**

Orbitals contain paired electrons with opposite spins

This happens as electrons repel one another electrostatically. Hence, they will want to remain as far apart as possible from one another by occupying different orbitals (i.e. different regions of space) first.

**Rule 3: The Aufbau Principle**

Place electrons into orbitals, **starting with those of the lowest energy** (nearest to the nucleus) **and then working upwards**.

Electrons in their lowest energy states is known as the **ground state** (i.e. when they are not excited). Energy can be supplied to move an electron from a lower energy state to a higher energy state (i.e. the excited state).

The following diagram is a convenient way to remember the sequence of orbitals from the lowest to highest in energy level.

**highest energy**

### Electronic Configuration of an Atom

**Steps for working out electronic configuration of an atom**

1. Determine the **total number of electrons** in the atom.
2. Fill the orbitals **from the lowest energy upwards**, making sure that there are a maximum of **two electrons** in each orbital.
3. For subshells with more than one orbital i.e. p, d and f subshells, **fill all the orbitals with one electron each before putting in the second electron**.
4. If an orbital contains two electrons, the electrons must have **opposite spins**.

## 4 Factors Affecting Atomic Properties and Periodic Trends

The elements in the periodic table are arranged in order of increasing atomic number. All of these elements display similar trends in:

* Ionisation Energy
* Atomic and Ionic Radius
* Electronegativity

The following factors affect the **electrostatic forces of attraction between the valence electrons and the nucleus**, giving rise to the various trends.

### Charge of nucleus (nuclear charge)

* More protons in nucleus, larger positive charge of nucleus
* Stronger electrostatic forces of attraction between the nucleus and the valence electrons

### Number of electrons between valence electrons and nucleus (shielding or screening effect)

**Shielding or screening effect** refers to the inter-electronic repulsion between the valence (outermost) electrons and inner shell electrons.

* Inner shell electrons confer the most significant shielding. Shielding by electrons within the same shell is generally more insignificant in comparison.
* Fewer electrons in the inner shells which leads to weaker shielding effect
* Stronger electrostatic forces of attraction between the nucleus and the valence electrons

Bringing together the effects of nuclear charge and shielding effect: **Effective Nuclear Charge**

* The **effective nuclear charge** is the strength of the **net** electrostatic forces of **attraction** felt by the valence electrons after taking into account the shielding effect of the inner shell electrons.

**Effective nuclear charge = nuclear charge - shielding effect**

* (det by no. of protons) (det by no. of inner shell electrons)

### Distance of electron from nucleus

* Smaller distance between nucleus and valence electron
* Stronger electrostatic forces of attraction between the nucleus and the valence electron

## 5 Trends in Ionisation Energies

### Ionisation Energy (I.E.)

The **first** ionisation energy is the **energy required** to remove **1 mole of electrons** from **1 mole of gaseous atoms** to form **1 mole of singly charged gaseous cations**.

\(\mathrm{X(g)\to X^{*}(g)+e^{-}}\)

The **second** ionisation energy is the **energy required** to remove **1 mole of electrons** from **1 mole of singly charged gaseous cations**.

\(\mathrm{X^{*}(g)\to X^{2*}(g)+e^{-}}\)

Ionisation energy is always a **positive** value (i.e. **endothermic**) because energy is **required** to overcome the electrostatic forces of attraction between the nucleus and valence electrons.

### Trends of 1st I.E.

Learning Outcome:

Explain the factors influencing the ionisation energies of elements _(see the Data Booklet)_.

Describe and explain qualitatively the trends and variations in first ionisation energy:

Across a Period in terms of shielding and nuclear charge

Down a Group in terms of increasing number of electronic shells and nuclear charge

The following chart shows the 1st ionisation energies of elements with atomic numbers from 1 to 86.

#### 5.2.1 Across the Period (e.g. Li, Be, B, C, O, N, F, Ne)

**General increase in 1st I.E. across the period**

* Number of protons in the nucleus of the atom increases, thus **nuclear charge increases**
* Same number of inner shell electrons, thus **shielding effect** is approximately constant**
* **Increase in effective nuclear charge**
* **Increase in electrostatic forces of attraction** between the nucleus and valence electron
* **More energy needed to remove the valence electron**
* **Increase in 1st I.E. across the period**

**Exception 1: Decrease in 1st I.E. from Group 2 to Group 13 (e.g. Be to B)**

* Valence shell: Group 2: _ns\({}^{2}\)_ Group 13: _ns\({}^{2}\)_np\({}^{1}\)_
* _np electron is of a higher energy level than the _ns electron_
* Less energy is required to remove the valence _np_ electron from a Group 13 element

**Exception 2: Decrease in 1st I.E. from Group 15 to 16 (e.g. N to O)**

* Valence shell Group 15: _n\({}^{2}\)_ Group 16: _n\({}^{2}\)_ and _n\({}^{3}\)_
* There is **inter-electronic repulsion between the paired electrons in the same orbital**
* for a Group 16 element
* Less energy is required to remove the _np_ electron from Group 16 than Group 15

#### 5.2.2 Down the Group (e.g. He, Ne, Ar, Kr, Xe, Rn)

**Decrease in 1st I.E. down the group**

* **Both nuclear charge and shielding effect increase**.
* However, valence electrons are located in a shell with a larger principal quantum number, n, and are **further away from the nucleus**
* **Decrease in electrostatic forces of attraction** between the nucleus and the valence electron
* Less energy needed to remove the valence electron
* **Decrease in 1st I.E. down the group

### Successive I.E. of an Atom

Learning Outcome:

* Deduce the electronic configurations of elements from successive ionisation energy data
* Interpret successive ionisation energy data of an element in terms of the position of that element within the Periodic Table

**General Trend:**

* **Decrease in inter-electronic repulsion** and hence shielding effect decreases** as electrons are removed
* **Nuclear charge remains the same**, hence **effective nuclear charge increases**
* Resulting in **increase in electrostatic forces of attraction** between the nucleus and the remaining electrons
* **More energy needed for subsequent removal of electrons
* Successive I.E. of an atom always increases**

**Eun o i a Junior College**

#### 5.3.1 Deducing Electronic Configuration Using Successive I.E.

The following graph and table show the successive ionisation energies of an **aluminium** atom (A_l_ 1s\({}^{2}\) 2s\({}^{2}\) 2p\({}^{6}\) 3s\({}^{2}\) 3p\({}^{1}\)).

* A **large increase** in I.E. represents a **change in principal quantum shell**. Electron is removed from an inner principal quantum shell which is **closer to the nucleus**, and hence experiences **stronger** electrostatic forces of attraction.
* The **number of electrons that are removed** before the **first large increase** in I.E. indicates the **number of valence electrons** in the atom, and hence the **group** the element is in.
* Using these pieces of information, the **valence shell electronic configuration of the atom** can be deduced.

## 6 Trends in Atomic Radius, Ionic Radius, and Electronegativity

Learning Outcome:

Describe and explain qualitatively the trends and variations in atomic radius, ionic radius and electronegativity:

Across a Period in terms of shielding and nuclear charge

Down a Group in terms of increasing number of electronic shells and nuclear charge

Apart from ionisation energies, electronic configuration can help us to understand atomic radius, ionic radius, and electronegativity. This is because these properties are also dependent on the strength of attraction between the nucleus and the valence electrons or the shared electrons in a covalent bond.

**Atomic radius** is defined as _half the distance_ between the centres of two adjacent atoms found in the structure of the element.

Due to differences in inter-atomic bonding in different elements, the way atomic radius is measured for each element may be different:

\[\begin{array}{c}\textbf{metallic radius}\\ \bullet\end{array}\begin{array}{c}\textbf{covalent radius}\\ \bullet\end{array}\begin{array}{c}\textbf{The metallic radius of an atom}\\ \bullet\end{array}\begin{array}{c}\textbf{The covalent radius of an atom is half the distance between the **centres of two adjacent atoms in the metal**.

\[r_{\text{met}}=\frac{d_{\text{met}}}{2}\\ \bullet\end{array}\begin{array}{c}\textbf{covalent radius}\\ \bullet\end{array}\begin{array}{c}\textbf{van der Waals radius}\\ \bullet\end{array}\begin{array}{c}\textbf{The van der Waals' radius of}\\ \bullet\end{array}\begin{array}{c}\textbf{an atom is half the distance between the **centres of two adjacent atoms that are covalently bonded**.

\[r_{\text{cow}}=\frac{d_{\text{cow}}}{2}\\ \bullet\end{array}\begin{array}{c}\textbf{van der Waals radius}\\ \bullet\end{array}\begin{array}{c}\textbf{The van der Waals' radius of}\\ \bullet\end{array}\begin{array}{c}\textbf{an atom is half the distance between the **centres of two adjacent atoms which are adjacent atoms which are not chemically bonded**.

\[r_{\text{cow}}=\frac{d_{\text{cow}}}{2}\\ \bullet\end{array}\begin{array}{c}\textbf{van der Waals radius}\\ \textbf{Van der Waals' radius is most easily determined for non-metals, and is particularly useful for the **noble gases**.

**Ionic radius** is defined as the average distance between the nuclei of two adjacent ions of the same element.

**Electronegativity** refers to the ability of an atom to attract the shared pair(s) of electrons in a covalent bond.

### 6.1 Trends Across the Period

**Atomic radius decreases across the period**

**Number of protons in the nucleus of the atom**

**Increases, thus nuclear charge increases**

**Name number of inner shell electrons, thus shielding**

**effect is approximately constant**

**Increase in effective nuclear charge**

**Increase in electrostatic forces of attraction**

**between the nucleus and valence electron**

**Cationic radii decreases from Na+ to Si+**

**Nuclear charge increases**

**Same inter-electronic repulsion since the anions are isoelectronic (same number of electrons)**

**Stronger electrostatic forces of attraction between the nucleus and the valence electrons**

**Anion radii decreases from P- to**

**Nuclear charge increases**

**Same inter-electronic repulsion since the anions are isoelectronic (same number of electrons)**

**Stronger electrostatic forces of attraction between the nucleus and the valence electrons**

### More Observations About Ionic Radii

**Cations are smaller than their corresponding atoms**

_E.g._ Electronic configurations of Na: 1s\({}^{2}\) 2s\({}^{2}\) 2p\({}^{6}\) 3s\({}^{1}\)

Nuclear charge **remains the same**

Cation has less electrons than the atom

Inter-electronic repulsion **weaker**

**Increase** in the electrostatic forces of attraction between the nucleus and the valence electrons in cation

**Anions are larger than their corresponding atoms**

_E.g._ Electronic configurations of _Cl:_ 1s\({}^{2}\) 2s\({}^{2}\) 2p\({}^{6}\) 3s\({}^{2}\) 3p\({}^{5}\)

Electronic configurations of _Cl:_ 1s\({}^{2}\) 2s\({}^{2}\) 2p\({}^{6}\) 3s\({}^{2}\) 3p\({}^{6}\)

Nuclear charge **remains the same**

Anion has more electrons than the atom

Inter-electronic repulsion **stronger**

**Decrease** in the electrostatic forces of attraction between the nucleus and the valence electrons in anion

**The anions (P3-, S2- and _Cl_) are larger than the cations (Na+, Mg2+, Ag+, Si4+)**

_E.g._ Electronic configurations of Na+, Mg2+, Ag+, Si4+: 1s\({}^{2}\) 2s\({}^{2}\) 2p\({}^{6}\)

Electronic configurations of P3-, S2- and Cl_:_

1s\({}^{2}\) 2s\({}^{2}\) 2p\({}^{6}\) 3s\({}^{2}\) 3p\({}^{6}\)

Anions have **one more filled principal quantum shell** compared to cations

Valence electrons in anions are **further** from the nucleus than those in cations

**Weaker electrostatic forces of attraction between the nucleus and valence electrons in anions than in cations

### Annex 2 ELECTRONIC CONFIGATIONS OF D-BLOCK ELEMENTS

Up till Ca, the 4s orbital is lower in energy compared to the 3d orbitals. However, **from Sc** onwards, there is a crossover between the energies of the 3d and 4s orbitals (see Figure A below), and the **4s** becomes the **outermost (highest energy) orbital**, while the **3d** orbital is **penultimate** (2nd from the last). Hence, **when representing the electronic configuration** in writing, **3d is written before 4s**.

However, **when filling up the orbitals of an atom of a d-block element**, the **4s orbital is filled before the 3d**. For example, spectroscopic results show that Sc has the electronic configuration [Ar] 3d\({}^{1}\) 4s\({}^{2}\), instead of [Ar] 3d\({}^{3}\) or [Ar] 3d\({}^{2}\) 4s\({}^{1}\). This is due to the **3d subshell being more compact than the diffuse 4s orbital**. The most probable distance of a 3d electron from the nucleus is less than that of a 4s electron i.e. the 3d electrons are more likely to be found closer to the nucleus (see Figure B), so two 3d electrons repel each other more strongly than two 4s electrons. Hence, the more electrons occupying the **3d subshell**, the larger the electron repulsion.

For Sc, electronic configuration [Ar] 3d\({}^{1}\) 4s\({}^{2}\) is more favourable as it minimises the strong electron-electron repulsions in the 3d orbitals. Even though energy is required to have electrons populate the higher energy 4s orbital, the total energy of the atom is the least.
