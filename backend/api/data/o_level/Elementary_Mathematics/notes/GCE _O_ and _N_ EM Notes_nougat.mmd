### Number and algebra

**Positive numbers:** greater than 0. eg. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5

**Negative numbers:** less than 0. eg. \(-1\), \(-2\), \(-3\), \(-4\), \(-5\)

**Prime numbers:** have exactly two factors: 1 and itself. eg. 2, 3, 5, 7, 11

**Composite numbers:** have more than two factors. Eg. 4, 6, 8, 9, 12

\(\succ\) 1 and 0 are NOT prime numbers.

\(\succ\) 2 is the ONLY even prime number.

**Rational numbers:** Can be represented in the form of \(\frac{P}{Q}\) where \(Q\neq 0\).

**Irrational numbers:** Cannot be represented in the form of \(\frac{P}{Q}\).

**HCF** - Highest Common Factor

\(\succ\) Look at the **lowest** power.

\(\succ\) Look at the **highest** power.

**Prime factorisation**

\(\succ\) Only can divide by **prime numbers**.

**Significant figures** (5 rules)

\(\succ\) All non-zero digits are significant. (eg. 211.8 has 4sf)

\(\succ\) All zeros that are found between nonzero digits are significant. (eg. 20007 has 5sf)

\(\succ\) Leading zeros (to the left of the first nonzero digit) are not significant. (eg. 0.0085 has 2sf)

\(\succ\) Trailing zeros for a whole number that ends with a decimal point are significant. (eg. 320 can be 2sf or 3sf)

#### Number pattern

General term, \(T_{n}=an+\bar{b}\)

where

\(n\) is the term number,

\(a\) is the common difference between two consecutive terms, and

\(b\) is the starting term, which is the value of the sequence when \(n=0\).

For example, the first five terms form a number pattern: 5, 8, 11, 14, 17

Common difference: \(8-5=\mathbf{3}\)

Now, the equation is \(3n+b\).

If \(n=1\), \(3(1)+b=5\to b=5-3=\mathbf{2}\)

Hence, \(T_{n}=\mathbf{3}n+2\).

#### Rate

\(\succ\) Rate is always over time (\(s\)).

#### Speed

\(\succ\) Speed (\(m\)/\(s\)) = \(\frac{\text{Distance}\left(m\right)}{\text{Time}\left(s\right)}\)

\(\succ\) Average speed = \(\frac{\text{Total Distance}\left(m\right)}{\text{Time}\left(s\right)}\)

\(\succ\) Acceleration: It is an increase in speed over time.

\(\succ\) Deceleration: It is a decrease in speed over time.

By u/One_Wishbone_4439

#### Speed-time graphs

From the speed-time graph above,

* from 0 to \(t_{1}\), the car is **increasing** speed over time, meaning the car is **moving quickly** from \(t_{1}\) to \(t_{2}\), the car is at **constant** speed, meaning the speed **does not change** from \(t_{2}\) to \(t_{3}\), the car is **decreasing** speed over time, meaning the car is **slowing down** the **distance** travelled by the car can be determined by finding the **area under the graph** to find acceleration and deceleration (negative acceleration) of the car, find the **gradient** of the line. **gradient** for constant speed is **always zero**.

#### Displacement-time graphs

From the displacement-time graph above,

* from 0 to \(t_{1}\), the car **does not change** in speed.
* from \(t_{1}\) to \(t_{2}\), the car **does not move**.
* from 0 to \(t_{1}\), the car **does not change** in speed.
* to find the speed of the car, find the **gradient** of the line.
* gradient for stationary object is **always zero**.

**Simple interest:** It is an interest charge that borrowers pay lenders for a loan.

\begin{tabular}{|l|} \hline \hline \(I=\frac{PRI}{100}\) \\ where \\ \(P\) is the principal amount \\ \(R\) is the rate of interest \\ \(T\) is the number of years \\ \hline
**Compound interest:** It is the interest calculated on both the initial principal and all of the previously accumulated interest. \\ \hline \(A=P\left(1+\frac{r}{100}\right)^{n}\) \\ where \\ \(A\) is the total amount \\ \(P\) is the principal amount \\ \(r\) is the rate of interest \\ \(n\) is the number of years \\ \hline
**Exchange rate:** a relative price of one currency expressed in terms of another currency. \\ For example, the exchange rate between Singapore Dollars (SGD) and US Dollars (USD) is now SS1 = $0.75 USD. \\ If I want to purchase a bag that costs $300, how much will I need to pay in USD? \\ SS1 = $0.75 USD \\ SS300 = $0.75 \(\times\) $300 = **S225 USD** \\ Hence, I need to pay **S225 USD** for the same bag in Singapore. \\
**Hire purchase:** It is an arrangement made while buying expensive goods. \\ Hire purchase = Deposit + Monthly payment \\ When you cannot afford to pay the item in full amount, you pay a deposit to the seller when you first agree to buy the item. **Deposit** is usually a small percentage of the cash price. Then, you pay the remaining amount in small chucks monthly. After you have fully pay including your monthly payment, then you will get the item you want. \\
**Taxation:** It is a term for when a taxing authority, usually a government, levies or imposes a financial obligation on its citizens or residents. \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}

**Set:** A list of elements. In simple words, sets are **collection of objects** such as pile of books and bunch of keys. The collective nouns "pile" and "bunch" are sets. The words "books" and "keys" are **elements**.

For example, let \(A\) be the set of the first five prime numbers.

It will be written like this: \(A=\{2,\,3,\,5,\,7,\,11\}\). The curly brackets "\(\{\ldots\}\)" are used to show a set.

To find the number of elements in a set, we use this notation: \(n(A)\). For set \(A\), the number of elements will be \(5\).

Now let's look at this Venn diagram below.

Consider the sets \(B=\{1,\,2,\,3,\,4,\,5\}\) and \(C=\{1,\,2,\,3\}\)

How can we draw a Venn diagram to represent the sets \(B\) and \(C\) such that we do not repeat the common elements? Since all the elements are distinct, we can draw the Venn diagram as shown below.

We can see that \(C\) is completely inside of \(B\), meaning every element of \(C\) is an element of \(B\).

Now, consider the sets \(B=\{1,\,2,\,3,\,4,\,5\}\) and \(D=\{1,\,2,\,3,\,4,\,5\}\)

From this information, we can draw the set \(D\) completely inside the set \(B\).

In conclusion, we can say that \(C\) and \(D\) are subsets of \(B\), and we write \(C\subset B\) and \(D\subset B\).

In addition, we can also say that \(C\) is a proper subset of \(B\), and we write \(C\subseteq B\).

#### Matrices

Let's look at the problem below.

The table below shows the number of students from two classes, A and B who travel to school by three different transportation: walk, bus and cycle.

\begin{tabular}{|c||c|c|c|} \cline{2-4} \multicolumn{1}{c||}{} & **Walk (W)** & **Bus (B)** & **Cycle (C)** \\ \hline
**Class A** & 12 & 15 & 3 \\ \hline
**Class B** & 22 & 8 & 10 \\ \hline \end{tabular}

The table above can be represented by matrices.

We can represent the matrix by a letter such as M. Also, we can label the types of transportation and class names beside the matrix as shown below.

\[\mathbf{M}=\begin{pmatrix}12&15&3\\ 22&8&10\end{pmatrix}\begin{pmatrix}\text{Class A}\\ \text{Class B}\end{pmatrix}\]

Matrices are read in this order: horizontal by vertical. Just like reading a coordinate: \((x,y)\) where \(x\) is the horizontal axis and \(y\) is the vertical axis.

\[\mathbf{M}=\begin{pmatrix}12&15&3\\ 22&8&10\end{pmatrix}\begin{pmatrix}\text{2 rows}\\ \text{2 rows}\end{pmatrix}\]

Since matrix \(\mathbf{M}\) has 2 rows and 3 columns, we can say that the order of \(\mathbf{M}\) is 2 by 3 or 2 \(\times\) 3.

Equal matrices: Must have the same order and their corresponding elements are equal.

#### Addition and subtraction of matrices:

Must have the same order when adding or subtracting.

Addition

\[\begin{pmatrix}a&b&c\\ d&e&f\end{pmatrix}+\begin{pmatrix}u&v&w\\ x&y&z\end{pmatrix}=\begin{pmatrix}a+u&b+v&c+w\\ d+x&e+y&f+z\end{pmatrix}\]

Subtraction

\[\begin{pmatrix}a&b&c\\ d&e&f\end{pmatrix}-\begin{pmatrix}u&v&w\\ x&y&z\end{pmatrix}=\begin{pmatrix}a&-&u&b-v&c-w\\ d&-&x&e-y&f-z\end{pmatrix}\]

#### Multiplication of matrices:

When a matrix A is multiplied by a scalar \(k\), every element in A is multiplied by \(k\).

\[\text{If }\mathbf{A}=\begin{pmatrix}a&b&c\\ d&e&f\end{pmatrix}\text{, then }k\mathbf{A}=k\begin{pmatrix}a&b&c\\ d&e&f\end{pmatrix}=\begin{pmatrix}ka&kb&kc\\ kd&ke&kf\end{pmatrix}\]

#### Scalar multiple of a vector

We observe that \(\mathbf{a}=\mathbf{b}+\mathbf{b}=2\mathbf{b}\).

\(2\mathbf{b}\) is a scalar multiply of \(\mathbf{b}\).

In general,

if \(\mathbf{a}\) and \(\mathbf{b}\) are parallel vectors, then \(\mathbf{a}=k\mathbf{b}\) where \(k\neq\mathbf{0}\).

This also means that

if \(\mathbf{a}=\binom{x}{y}\), then \(k\mathbf{a}=\binom{kx}{ky}\) and \(|k\mathbf{a}|=|k||\mathbf{a}|\) for any real number \(k\).

**Collinear vectors:** Vectors are parallel to each other, have the same gradient and the points all lie on a straight line.

For example, \(\overrightarrow{PQ}=2\mathbf{a}+3\mathbf{b}\) and \(\overrightarrow{QR}=4\mathbf{a}+6\mathbf{b}\). Show that points \(P\), \(Q\) and \(R\) are collinear.

\(\overrightarrow{PQ}=2\mathbf{a}+3\mathbf{b}\) and \(\overrightarrow{QR}=4\mathbf{a}+6\mathbf{b}\)

\[=2(2\mathbf{a}+3\mathbf{b})\] \[=2P\overrightarrow{Q}\]

Since \(\overrightarrow{QR}=2\overrightarrow{PQ}\) and point \(Q\) is the common point, then points \(P\), \(Q\) and \(R\) are collinear. (shown)

**Facts about circles**

* **Centre:** A point in the middle of the circle.
* **Diameter:** A line that touches two points on the circumference of a circle and passing through the centre.
* **Radius:** A line that touches from the centre to one point on the circumference of a circle. It is also half the length of a diameter.
* **Minor sector:** A small fraction that make up a circle including a centre and two radii.
* **Minor segment:** A small fraction that make up a circle including a chord and an arc.
* **Chord:** A line that touches two points on the circumference _without_ passing through the centre.

#### Box-and-whisker diagram

**Mean:** It is the average of a set of data. It is calculated by dividing the total by the number of data. \(\frac{\sum_{i}\alpha_{i}}{\sum_{i}\alpha_{i}}\)

**Median:** It is the middle position of a series of data.

**Mode:** It is about most frequency or is the value that happens the most.

**Interquartile range:** It is a measure of how the middle 50% of the data are spread around the median. It is an appropriate measure of the spread of distribution when there are outliners.

**Standard deviation:** It is a measure of how the data are spread around the mean. It is an appropriate measure of the spread of distribution when there are **no** outliners.

\(\frac{\text{s.d.}=\sqrt{\frac{\sum_{x}x^{2}}{n}-\frac{x}{2}}}{n}\)

When the **standard deviation** or the **interquartile range** of A is higher than B, it means that A is **less consistent** than B.
