## LANOF CONSERVATION OF CHARGE

Take note that during this entire process, charges are only transferred from one object to another and charges are neither created nor destroyed.

As electrons are transferred to the amber rod through friction, the rod now has more negative charges than positive charges. Hence, it is negative charged.

The fur has lesser negative charges than positive charges, hence it is positively charged.

## TABLE NOTE

In any charging process, **only the electrons (negative charges) can be transferred.** Charging by rubbing **does not work for conductors**, as conductors can transfer excess charges to the hand holding it.

However, electrons in insulators are not free to move about, therefore charges stay after the rubbing process.

## Introduction

* Put 2 neutral metal spheres side by side, in contact with one another.
* Use a negative rod and place it near Sphere A, without actually touching it.
* Since like charges repel and unlike charges attract, electrons in Sphere A will travel away to Sphere B. This will result in an uneven charge distribution as seen in the diagram where Sphere A has more positive charges while Sphere B has more negative charges.
* While keeping the negative rod near Sphere A, separate both the spheres. When they are no longer in contact and electrons are not free to move within the spheres, remove the negative rod.

## Take Note

**Induction only works for conductors and not insulators** as electrons are free to move in conductors.

## Introduction + Earthing

* Use a negative rod and place it near the sphere, without actually touching it.
* Since like charges repel and unlike charges attract, electrons will be repelled and move the side B, leaving the positive charges in Side A.
* The sphere is then earthed with a finger touching side B, with the negative rod still in place. Electrons will flow from the sphere to the ground and making side B neutral.
* While keeping the negative rod at side A, remove the finger. The sphere is now left with a positive charge.

## Index Note

Induction+ Earthing only works for conductors and not insulators as electrons are free to move in conductors.

## Chapter 1 Charge by Contact

1. A positively charged sphere comes in contact with the neutral metal ball.
2. Upon contact, the electrons will flow from the neutral metal ball to neutralise the positively charged metal sphere.
3. Separate both the objects. Both objects are now positively charged although the sphere now is less positively charged than before.

## 2 Take Note

The sphere has to be on a insulating stand if not it will be earthed.

No fingers should come in contact with the charged object at any point as well, (the metal ball is hanged using a string.)
## Disclosure

1) **Expose to a flame**, thermal energy from the flame ionises the air particles to produce negative and positive ions, which will discharge an object.

_2) **Expose to moisture**, in moist conditions, water vapour in the air removes excess charges.

## Disclosure

1) **Earthing**. connect the object to the ground (earth) with a conducting wire or by touching it with a finger.

## Electronic Field

A region in which an electric charge experiences a force.

## Electronic Field

It is the path a positive charge will take. The direction of an electric field like follows the path of a positive charge.

BULD UP OF CHARGES DUE TO FRICION

Friction can cause a large buildup of charge that can cause sparks.

Friction between road and moving vehicle:

The types of a moving truck rub against the surface of the road and electric charges accumulate on the truck.

When there is a sudden discharge, sparks produced can ignite highly flammable load and cause an explosion.

Prevention:

* Hang a metal chain that can allow the discharge of any excess charges
* Use spurtic rubber bytes that contain carbon which can discharge excess charges

FORMATION OF LIGHTING

Thunderclouds become charged when water molecules collide with air particles. Electrons collect at the bottom of the clouds and when the accumulation is big enough, the ionized air particles form a conducting path for the charges to be discharged to the ground.

Prevention:

* Lightning conductors are placed onto of tall structures and buildings to provide a conducting path for the electrons discharged.

## Chapter 4 Photopotopier

The inside a photocopier is a drum coated with a thin layer of selenium. Photocopier makes use of selenium, a photoconductor - conductor under light, insulator in the dark.

### How it works

1. Whole surface of the drum is charged positively by rotating it near a highly charged metal wire
2. When a printed page is to be photocopied, light is reflected off the page and projected onto the drum.

White parts of the page reflect intense light to some parts of the drum and these areas become conducting and lose their charge.

Other parts of the page do not receive light and these areas on the drum remain insulating and retains their charge.
3. Drum ends up with a pattern of a charge area which is an exact copy of the pattern of printing on the original page.
4. Particles of negatively charged carbon powder (tomer) is attracted to the charged areas of the drum.
5. Tomer is transferred onto the photocopy as the drum rotates and presses against the copy paper; heat is supplied to melt the toner powder and fix it onto the paper surface.

## Appendix A Application of ELECTROSTATIC

SPRAY PAINTING

1. Paint droplets from an aerosol becomes charged by rubbing against the nozzle of the spray
2. The car's body is earthed
3. Charged paint droplets will be attracted onto the metal body
4. Droplets all have the same charge and repel each other, spreading out evenly throughout the sprayed surface
