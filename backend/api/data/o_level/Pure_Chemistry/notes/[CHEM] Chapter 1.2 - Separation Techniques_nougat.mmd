Let's get over the

3 simpler ones

first

**SEPARATING FUNNEL (IMMISCIBLE LIQUIDS)**

1) Oil and water are **immiscible** (do not dissolve with each other).

2) Oil which is **less dense** than water will float on top of water.

3) Open the tap and collect the water in a beaker.

4) Drain out the leftover water and some of the oil and throw the impure mixture away.

5) Collect the remaining oil in a separate beaker.

MAGNETIC SEPARATION

Magnetic Materials

Nickel Magnetic separation is used to separate magnetic material from a mixture with other non-magnetic materials. (Scripeyard)

## EVAPORATION TO DRYNESS

For this method, the solution is heated until all the **water** is **evaporated** completely, **leaving behind only the solid**.

However, a **limitation** to this method is that it **cannot be used for solids that decompose on heating**.

For example, sugar decomposes upon heating, salt however does not.

*A saturated solution contains the maximum amount of solute that can be dissolved in the solvent at a particular temperature.

Crystallisation is different from evaporation to dryness.

The aim of crystallisation aim is not to evaporate ALL of the water, but rather it focuses on heating it till saturation. After which, it is left to cool in order to obtain the crystals.

This is used for crystals that decompose upon heating to be collected. (ie: sugar)

Steps:

1) Heat the solution till saturation.

2) Allow the saturated solution to cool and pure solid crystals will form slowly.

3) Filter to collect the crystals.

4) Wash the crystals with cold distilled water and dry between sheets of filter paper.

Ultimately, what it boils down to the nature of the salt.

The critical question to ask is:

Will the solute **decompose under heating**?

If yes, use crystallisation.

If not, use evaporation to dryness.

Example:

Sugar decomposes under heat, crystallisation is the correct choice.

Salt has high melting & boiling point, evaporation to dryness will get the job done.

EVAPORATION TO DRYNESS VS CRYSTALLISATION

## SUBLIMATION

1) Heat the mixture (iodine+ sand) and the volatile compound (iodine) will start to sublime (solid to gas).

2) Place a cool funnel over the evaporating dish. The gaseous iodine will condense on the cool funnel and form pure iodine in solid state.

3) Collect the iodine crystals.

## 11 Simple Distillation

1) Heat the solution in a round-bottomed flask for even heat distribution. Boiling chips are added to prevent vigorous movement of liquid which ensure smooth boiling.

2) The water boils and water vapour rises and enters the condenser. The water vapour cools down in the condenser and is collected as a distillate.

3) The **distillate** is collected in a conical flask to prevent spillage.

**FRACTIONAL DISTILLATION**

1) Heat the mixture. The liquid with the lowest boiling point will be the first to be vaporised.

2) Its vapour will rise up to the top of the

fractionating column, cooled as it passes through

the condenser and be collected as the distillate.

Ensure the temperature remains the same until

all of first vapour has condensed.

3) Collect the distillate in the conical flask.

4) Repeat the process and collect the different

substances that were in the mixture.

So in which situations is simple distillation used and which situations do we use fractional distillation?

## Chapter 5 Chromatorography

Chromatography is used to separate and identify miscible solutes that are dissolved together. (Food substances, dye etc...)

The different components can be identified by comparing their **Rf values (retention factor)**.

The Rf value is the ratio of the distance travelled by the substance to the distance travelled by the solvent.

Chromatography works under this principle: **the rate at which a particular solute moves relative to the solvent is fixed**.

Given that the \(R_{t}\)value for a specific substance is constant if using the same solvent, substances in the solution can be identified by comparing their \(R_{t}\)values with known values. (_Oo, forensic scientist in the making.)

## Appendix

## Chapter 5 Chromatorography

Factors affecting the _differences in \(R_{f}\) values_

- **Solubility of the substances** in the solvent used (The more soluble it is, the easier it is for the substance to travel further and faster.)

- **Molecular masses** of the substances (The lower the molecular mass, the faster a substance travels. Refer to periodic table!)* [9] A liquid mixture contains a hydrocarbon and water. The boiling points and densities of the hydrocarbon and of water are shown in the table.

* 8. A colourless substance is made in an experiment. Which are possible methods to determine if this substance is pure? (N2020/P1/Q4)
* 1 Measure the melting point of the substance and compare with the reference value.
* 2 Measure the boiling point of the substance and compare with the reference value.
* 3 Test the substance using paper chromatography and a locating agent.
* A 1, 2 and 3 B 1 and 2 only
* 3 2 and 3 only D 2 only ( )

### Answer:

* 8. A The purity of a substance can be determined using the melting point of a solid, boiling point of a liquid and paper chromatography.
