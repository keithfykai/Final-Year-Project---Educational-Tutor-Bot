## H2 Topic O3 - Dynamics

In the 17 century, Sir Isaac Newton formulated his 3 laws of motion. The process required Newton to deploy the concept of an "external agent" that can transport action at a distance, provide instantaneous motion and not be subject to resistive forces. Newton's personal reading habits at that time resulted in him imaging these "external agents" as angels. The gradually trimmed their wings and transformed this new agent into a purely objective "Torec". Today, Newtonian mechanics is useful for many engineering efforts in our everyday scale, like how an artillery belt travels in air, and it describes many phenomena observed. Occasionally, we can take time off to mavret at the inspiration behind "force" - that the wings of angels are ever beating invisibly and constantly providing instant messaging between objects - so that forces may exist in our modern world.

### Introduction

In dynamics, we study the _forces_ that act on a body to cause motion. The vector sum of these forces gives a resultant force that causes the body to _accelerate_. This resultant force causes change in motion.

Dynamics explain the reasons behind kinematics where we describe how a body moves under _constant acceleration_.

### Newton's Third Law of Motion

**Newton's Third Law of Motion** states that when body A exerts a force on body B, body B exerts on body A a force of the same type, equal in magnitude and opposite in direction.

**True or False: the weight of the ball and the normal contact force on ball by table are Newton's 3rd law pair of action-reaction forces. Solution False.** The weight of the ball is the gravitational force that the Earth acts on the ball. By Newton's 3rd Law, the reaction force should be the gravitational force that the ball acts on the Earth.

**Newton's First Law of Motion**

**Newton's First Law of Motion** states that an object stays at rest or continues to move at constant velocity unless a resultant force acts on it.

**Newton's 1st Law gives rise to the idea _inertia_: that a body is reluctant to change its "status quo" of motion. The mass of a body is the property of a body which resists change in motion.

**9749(2023) H2 Physics**

The weight of a body is

the force acting on the body

due to a gravitational field

The mass of a body remains constant anywhere in the universe while the weight changes with gravitational field strength that the body is situated in.

**Example 2**

A fly hovers stationary in front of an open-top rail cart that is at rest. The cart starts to move forward.

Explain why the fly will hit the cart.

**Solution**

Fly is stationary so is in translational equilibrium with no resultant force. By Newton's 1st Law, it continues to be at rest.

Cart moves from rest so there is change in velocity hence acceleration. Frictional force by track acts on the wheels and cart accelerates towards the fly.

### Linear Momentum

The linear momentum of a body is

the product of its mass and its velocity.

\(p\) : linear momentum (kg m s\({}^{\text{-1}}\)) or (N s).)

\(m\) : mass (kg)

\(\nu\) : velocity (m s\({}^{\text{-1}}\))

Linear momentum is a vector quantity and it takes the same direction as the velocity of the body.

It takes work done to accelerate a body so that it gains momentum. Conversely, the more momentum a body has, the "harder" it is to reduce the momentum to zero to stop it (see Newton's 2\({}^{\text{nd}}\) Law).

**The formal definition of Newton's 2\({}^{\text{nd}}\)**

**Law reads mathematically as**

\[F_{\text{net}}=k\,\frac{\text{d}p}{\text{d}t}\]

**with** \(k\) **denoting the proportionality constant.**

**Considering SI units and regarding 1 N as the force which results in an acceleration of 1 m s**\({}^{\text{-}2}\) **when it is applied to a mass of 1 kg:**

\[F_{\text{net}}=(1)\frac{\text{d}p}{\text{d}t}\]

**If the mass is constant, then by product rule**

\[F_{\text{net}} =\frac{\text{d}p}{\text{d}t}=\frac{\text{d}}{\text{d}t}(m\nu)\] \[=m\frac{\text{d}\nu}{\text{d}t}+\nu\frac{\text{d}p\text{d}^{m}}{ \text{d}t}\text{:}\] \[=m\text{a}\]

**it reduces to a more familiar form.**

**Example 3**

**A cricket player catches a fast moving ball with his bare hands. Explain why it is preferable that his palms draw back while catching the ball.**

**Solution**

**To catch a ball is to reduce the momentum from just before touching the hands, to zero.**

\[F_{\text{net}}=\frac{\text{d}p}{\text{d}t}\approx\frac{\Delta(m\nu)}{\Delta t }=\frac{p_{\text{tnat}}-p_{\text{nntal}}}{\Delta t}=\frac{0-m\nu}{\Delta t}\]

**[N2L] For this same change in** _ball_**'s momentum** \(\Delta(m\nu)=mu-0\)**, the time interval** \(\Delta t\) **when the force is applied by hand on** _ball_ **to slow it down is lengthened.**

**[force, magnitude] By Newton's 2\({}^{\text{nd}}\) Law, the average force on** _ball_ **by hand is reduced.**

**[N3L] By Newton's 3\({}^{\text{rd}}\) Law, the average force on hand** _by ball_ **is reduced.**

**so hand experiences less pain when catching the ball.**

**Note: (i)** \(F_{\text{net}}\) **on ball is in a negative direction i.e. opposing the initial velocity of the ball - in order to slow the ball down. (ii) the body that is having the change in momentum is the body that is experiencing a net force exerted (in this case, the ball). Therefore, it is very common for explanations to demand the action-reaction pair of the force instead (in this case, the hand). Consequently, many explanation-type questions involve both N2L and N3L in a similar fashion.**

**Example 4**: In a game of dodge ball, a bouncy ball and a non-bouncy ball both of mass 0.095 kg are thrown directly towards you at the same speed of 20 m s\({}^{-1}\). After impact, the bouncy ball rebounds off in the opposite direction with the same speed and the non-bouncy ball comes to a stop. They both come into contact with your arm for 0.10 s.

Calculate the magnitudes of the forces acting on you by each ball.

**Solution**

Take direction towards "you" as positive:

\[\text{initial momentum}\ p_{\text{nist}} =mu=\big{(}0.095\big{)}(20)=1.9\ \text{Ns}\] \[\text{force on bouncy ball} =F_{\text{on bouncy}}\] \[\approx\frac{\Delta\rho}{\Delta t}=\frac{\rho_{\text{nist}}-\rho _{\text{nist}}}{\Delta t}=\frac{\big{(}-m\nu\big{)}-\big{(}mu\big{)}}{\Delta t}\] \[=\frac{\big{(}-1.9\big{)}-\big{(}1.9\big{)}}{0.10}=-38\ \text{N}\] \[\text{force on non-bouncy ball} =F_{\text{on non-bouncy}}\] \[\approx\frac{\Delta\rho}{\Delta t}=\frac{\rho_{\text{nist}}-\rho _{\text{nist}}}{\Delta t}=\frac{\big{(}-m\nu\big{)}-\big{(}mu\big{)}}{\Delta t}\] \[=\frac{\big{(}0\big{)}-\big{(}1.9\big{)}}{0.10}=-19\ \text{N}\]

By Newton's 3\({}^{\text{rd}}\) Law, there is a contact force on hand by ball that is equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. Therefore same magnitudes of force: 19 N by non-bouncy ball and 38 N by bouncy ball.

**Steps to solve dynamics problems:**

1. Sketch a labelled force diagram. Identify and label all the forces acting on body (and that body onlv).
2. Determine the net force acting on the body, which will have same direction as acceleration.
3. Equate \(\sum F_{\text{contributing}}=F_{\text{net}}=m\text{a}\). This mass is the mass of the body considered.

**Example 9**

3 blocks are connected by light, inextensible strings on a horizontal smooth surface. A force of \(T_{1}=60\) N acts to the right on \(m_{1}\). If \(m_{1}=30\) kg, \(m_{2}=20\) kg and \(m_{3}=10\) kg, find the tensions \(T_{2}\) and \(T_{3}\).

**Solution**

Consider all masses

Consider _only_\(m_{3}\):

Consider _\(m_{3}\)_ and \(m_{2}\) as a system:

**Note:** An alternative intermediate step can be to regard \(m_{2}\) and \(m_{1}\) as 1 system but the mathematics will be slightly more complicated because \(T_{3}\) will act left while \(T_{1}\) acts right. Through practice, we can learn to decide which combinations of masses to consider as a system to do less math.

**Example 10**

A car of mass 800 kg is moving up a hill inclined at 30\({}^{\circ}\) to the horizontal. The total resistive force \(F_{\text{R}}\) on the car is 1000 N. Calculate the driving force \(F_{\text{D}}\) when the car is

(a) accelerating up the incline at 2.0 m s\({}^{-2}\).

(b) moving with a steady velocity of 15 m s\({}^{-1}\) up the incline.

**Solution**

(a) \(F_{\text{net}}=ma\)

\(F_{\text{D}}-F_{\text{R}}-mg\) sin\(\theta=ma\)

\(F_{\text{D}}=ma+F_{\text{R}}+mg\) sin\(\theta\)

\(F_{\text{D}}=800\left(2\right)+1000+800\left(9.81\right)\left(\text{sin}30^{ \circ}\right)\)

\(30^{\circ}\)

\(8520\) N

\(W=mg\)

**Note:** if asked to draw a labelled force diagram, you are expected to show \(N\) (perpendicular to the incline) and \(W=mg\) (vertically down).

#### 3.3.2 Weight and "Weightlessness"

We do not measure our weight (gravitational force on us by the Earth) directly. A weighing scale measures the _normal contact force_ exerted on us when we are on it. When we are stationary, the normal contact force on us is constant, at the same magnitude as our weight.

If a lift has its cables cut and all brakes missing, the lift falls freely at acceleration of \(g=9.81\) m s\({}^{2}\). A person in the lift will feel the sensation of 'weightlessness'. This does not mean that the person has no weight.

**'Weightlessness' refers to the state where a body experiences no contact force(s).** In this case, the lift floor exerts zero contact force on the person, as both lift and person fall at the same rate.

If that person in the falling lift is originally standing on a weighing scale, the reading on the scale will read zero - recall that weighing scales do not measure our true weight. They measure the normal contact forces between our bodies and the weighing scale.

_True weight_ does not change as long as the gravitational field is constant and uniform. _Apparent weight_ is given by the reading on a weighing scale, and changes with the normal contact force between our bodies and the weighing scale.

* **Examples of "weightlessness"**
* **only true weight acts on person**
* **so person accelerates at _g_**:**
* A free-falling parachutist before parachute is deployed (ignoring air resistance)
* A free-falling bungee jumper before the cord experiences tension (ignoring air resistance)
* An astronaut inside the International Space Station (both astronaut and space station falls towards centre of Earth at the same rate)
* A scuba diver floating underwater does **not** feel weightless: diver can feel upthrust of water.
* A parachutist descending with deployed parachute does **not** feel weightless: the harness of the parachute is pulling (exerting a force upwards) on the person.

In practice near Earth's surface, states of 'weightlessness' cannot last long due to air resistance. Falling objects tend to reach a terminal velocity.

**How is terminal velocity achieved?**

**[initial conditions]** object starts with zero speed so it experiences acceleration of \(g\)

**[recall, forces]** As object accelerates, relative speed between object and air increases so magnitude of air resistance increases

**[force, magnitude]** resultant force is vector sum of downwards weight and upwards air resistance which reduces to zero when air resistance is equal to weight

no net force, no acceleration so object reaches constant velocity.

See H202 Kinematics for more treatment of motion of falling objects.

### Impulse

**Impulse** is defined as the product of force and time duration of impact.

\(\Delta p=F_{\text{net}}\Delta t\)

the product of force and time duration of impact.

\(\Delta p\) : impulse (N s) or (kg m s\({}^{\text{-1}}\))

\(F_{\text{net}}\) : net force (N)

\(\Delta t\) : time of impact (s)

We can think of _impulse_ as the area under a (net) force-time graph which _gives the change in momentum_\(\Delta p\) in this time interval. It is useful for working with force(s) that vary with time.

From Newton's \(2^{\text{nd}}\) Law,

\[F_{\text{net}} =\frac{\text{d}p}{\text{d}t}\] \[\int F_{\text{net}}\ \text{d}t =\Delta p\] \[\Delta p =\left\langle F_{\text{net}}\right\rangle(\Delta t)\ \text{for constant or average}\ F\]

This should look familiar to you because we have worked with a force which varies across displacement (rather than time) in H205 Work Energy Power. Here are the parallels:

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:14]

### Principle of Conservation of Linear Momentum

By Newton's 2nd Law of motion, when there is _no net force_ acting on an isolated system (comprising more than one body), the system must experience _no change of linear momentum_.

This is consistent with Newton's 1st Law, as the _system remains at rest or remains at constant velocity_ when no net external force acts on the system.

The above idea leads to the Principle of Conservation of Linear Momentum. For a system of 2 masses in which they collide head-on:

\[m_{i}u_{i}+m_{2}u_{i}=m_{i}v_{i}+m_{2}v_{2}\]

#### 3.5.2 Separation of objects

A single body can separate into smaller parts, usually through an explosion or a spontaneous disintegration (see topic H220 Nuclear Physics). The principle of conservation of momentum allows us to work out the directions and the speeds of the constituent pieces.

**Example 22**:

(a) Find recoil velocity of a rifle of mass 5.0 kg firing a bullet of mass 20 g at a speed of 620 m s\({}^{-1}\).

(b) Explain which between the rifle or the bullet has a higher kinetic energy.

**Solution**

Take right as positive direction,

by Principle of Conservation of Linear Momentum:

(a) \(m_{\text{the}}\,\text{U}_{\text{infle}}+m_{\text{bulet}}\,\text{U}_{\text{bulet}} =m_{\text{the}}\,\text{V}_{\text{rifle}}+m_{\text{bulet}}\,\text{V}_{ \text{bulet}}\)

(b) \(m_{\text{the}}\,\text{V}_{\text{infle}} =-m_{\text{bulet}}\,\text{V}_{\text{bulet}}\)

(c) \(V_{\text{infle}} =-620(0.02)\)

(d) \(V_{\text{rifle}} =-2.5\) m s\({}^{-1}\)

(e) \(V_{\text{rifle}} =\)

(b) \(\frac{1}{2}\,m\nu^{2}=\frac{1}{2}\,\frac{(m\nu)^{2}}{m}=\frac{p^{2}}{2m}\)

from (\({}^{*}\)), magnitude of momentum is same for rifle and bullet

take ratio:\(\frac{E_{\text{\tiny{K, bullet}}}}{E_{\text{\tiny{K, rifle}}}}=\frac{\frac{p^{2}}{2m_{\text{bulet}}}}{\frac{p^{2}}{2m_{\text{the}}}}=\frac{m_{ \text{life}}}{m_{\text{bulet}}}=\frac{5}{0.02}=250\)

Mass of rifle is 250 times the mass of the bullet, so the kinetic energy of the exiting bullet is 250 times that of the recoiling rifle

**Note:** the alternative form of \(E_{\text{\tiny{K}}}=\frac{p^{2}}{2m}\) is very useful for comparing ratios of momentum, masses and will appear quite often in H219, the topic of Quantum Physics.

#### 3.5.3 Motion of a System (of Two Bodies) - Centre-of-Mass

Since the total linear momentum of an isolated system remains constant before and after a collision, we can regard the system as a single body: we represent the system by its centre-of-mass ("COM") having a constant velocity:

We can imagine the COM as a pivot that allows us to balance the two masses on see-saw. It is akin to centre-of-gravity, the single point where the weight of a body may be considered to act. We "take moments about origin O":

considering moments about origin:

sum of moments due to each individual mass = moment due to centre of mass of system

\[m_{1}x_{1}+m_{2}x_{2} =m_{\text{total}}x_{\text{COM}}\] \[x_{\text{COM}} =\frac{m_{1}x_{1}+m_{2}x_{2}}{m_{1}+m_{2}}\]

We can then represent the system of 2 bodies via 1 single point:

Figure 2: The COM as a pivot that allows us to balance the two masses on see-saw. It is akin to centre-of-gravity, the single point where the weight of a body may be considered to act. We "take moments about origin O":For instance, if the 2 bodies are of the same mass, it should not be a surprise that the COM is in the middle of the 2 masses:

[MISSING_PAGE_POST]

**Example 23**

Two particles A and B of the same mass and same speed of 10 cm s\({}^{\ast}\) move towards each other and collide elastically head-on. Describe the changes, if any, to the centre of mass of the two particles before and after collision.

**Solution:** The total linear momentum of the isolated system is zero and there is no net external force acting on the system. The principle of conservation of linear momentum applies and by Newton's first law, the centre of mass remains in its state of rest.

**Note**: During collision, by Newton's 3\({}^{\text{rd}}\) Law both particles exert forces on each other and each particle experiences a force. But when considering the whole system, these forces are _internal_ forces within the system which cancel out.
