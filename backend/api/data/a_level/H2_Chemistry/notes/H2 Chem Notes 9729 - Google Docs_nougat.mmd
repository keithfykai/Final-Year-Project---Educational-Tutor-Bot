## I. **Mole concept and Stoichiometry**

Relative atomic mass = \(\frac{\text{\it mass of 1 atom}}{\text{\it 1/12 of the mass of 1 Carbon-12 atom}}\)

Proton = 1u, Neutron = 1u, Electron = \(\frac{\text{\it 1}}{\text{\it 1840}}\) u

Mole = amt of substance which contains as many elementary entities as in 12 grams of carbon-12

\(\text{\it 7}\) 6.02 x 10\({}^{23}\) particles

Empirical formula: simplest whole number ratio of the atoms in one formula unit of the compound.

Molecular formula: actual number of atoms present in one formula unit of the compound.

Percentage yield = \(\frac{\text{\it actual yield}}{\text{\it theoretical yield}}\) x 100%

Avogadro's hypothesis: Equal volume of gases under the same conditions of temp & pressure contain same number of molecules. (except when molecules dimerise [see chapter III. Chem Bonding])

 molar volume of gas

\(V_{\text{m}}\) = 22.7 dm\({}^{3}\) mol\({}^{\text{-1}}\) at s.t.p.

\(V_{\text{m}}\) = 24 dm\({}^{3}\) mol\({}^{\text{-1}}\) at r.t.p.

(where s.t.p. is expressed as 10\({}^{5}\) Pa [1 bar] and 273 K [0 \({}^{\circ}\)C],

f.t.p. is expressed as 101325 Pa [1 atm] and 293 K [20 \({}^{\circ}\)C])

Total \(N_{e^{-}}\) gained by reducing agent

Total \(\uparrow\)in ox. no. of one species

=

Total \(N_{e^{-}}\) gained by oxidising agent

Total \(\downarrow\)in ox. no. of another species

Oxidation number assignment rules :

1. Ox. no. of atom in elemental state = 0

2. Ox. no. of H in all compounds = +1 (except in metal hydrides [e.g NaH])

3. Ox. no. of fluorine in all compounds = -1

4. Ox. no. of oxygen = -2 (except peroxides = -1) ( except superoxides = -\(\frac{1}{2}\) )

(except \(OF_{2}\) = +2)

\(\cdot\)O\({}_{2}^{-2}\)

5. More electronegative atom = -ve ox. no.

Less electronegative atom = +ve ox. no.

6. Monatomic ions: ox. no. = charge

7. Polyatomic ions: \(\sum\)_individual ox. no. =_ charge

8. Uncharged compound: \(\sum\)_individual ox. no. =_ 0

Note: In a covalent bond, ox. no. arises because the more electronegative atom gains both \(e^{-}\), but by a different extent depending on \(\triangle\)_electronegativity_

Disproportionation rxn: a species is simultaneously reduced & oxidized in the same rxn to form 2 different pdots.

Balancing redox eqns in acidic medium

1. Construct the ox. & red. half eqns.

2. Balance the element oxidised/ reduced

3. Balance oxygen atoms (by adding \(H_{2}O\) molecules)

4. Balance hydrogen atoms (by adding \(H^{+}\) ions)

5. Balance overall charge by adding \(e^{-}\)

In basic medium

Repeat steps 1-5 as in acidic medium..

6. Neutralise \(H^{+}\) ions by adding required \(OH^{-}\) ions to both sides

7. Combine \(H^{+}\) ions and \(OH^{-}\) ions to form \(H_{2}O\)

* Formation of anions: \(e^{-}\) added to the next lowest available orbital. ( \(e^{-}\) occupy 4s orbital first because \(4s<3d\) energy level [ when both are still vacant ])
* Formation of cations: \(e^{-}\) removed from orbital with highest energy. (occupied 3d orbital repels 4s orbital to higher energy level, \(e^{-}\) taken from 4s first before 3d) ( \(3d<4s\) energy level)

## IV The Gaseous State

Ideal gas eqn: \(pV=nRT\), R= molar gas constant, \(8.31\)\(JK\)\({}^{-1}mol\)\({}^{-1}\)

Assumptions for ideal gas eqn:

* Particles have negligible vol.
* Negligible forces of attraction between particles
* Constant random motion
* Elastic collisions
* K.E (kinetic energy)\(\sim T\)

However a real gas:

* Has finite vol. and size
* Experiences intermolecular attractions

A real gas approaches ideality, however, when

1. Low \(p\)\(\rightarrow\) gas particles have negligible vol.

\(\rightarrow\) attractions negligible

2. High \(T\)\(\rightarrow\) high K.E to overcome attractions

1st I.E = energy req to remove 1 mole of \(e\)\({}^{-}\) from 1 mole of gaseous atoms to form 1 mole of singly charged +ve gaseous ions

2nd I.E = energy req to remove 1 mole of \(e\)\({}^{-}\) from 1 mole of singly charged +ve gaseous ions to form 1 mole of doubly charged +ve gaseous ions

Note: I.E and B.E values can be found in the data booklet

1st \(e\)\({}^{-}\) affinity, E.A = energy released when 1 mole of gaseous atoms acquires 1 mole of \(e\)\({}^{-}\) to form 1 mole of singly -ve charged gaseous ions.

2nd E.A = energy absorbed when 1 mole of singly charged -ve gaseous ions acquire 1 mole of \(e\)\({}^{-}\) to form 1 mole of doubly charged -ve gaseous ions.

\(\bullet\) Endothermic (\(e\)\({}^{-}\) is added to -ve ion, thus energy is required to overcome repulsion between 2 -ve charged species)

L.E = energy released, when 1 mole of solid ionic cmpd is formed from constituent gaseous ions (at \(\Theta\))

\(\Delta H_{hydration}\)\({}^{\Theta}\) = energy released when 1 mole of gaseous ions are hydrated (at \(\Theta\))

* \(\Delta G\ ^{\Theta}>0\), forward rxn not spontaneous (endergonic)

Limitations:

\(\rightarrow\) Thermodynamic feasibility = spontaneity, whether it can occur

\(\rightarrow\) kinetic feasibility = whether the rate of rxn is observable (depends on \(E_{activation}\) )

## VI Reaction Kinetics

\(Rate_{r,xn}\) ==- \(\frac{d[rxts]}{dt}\) _or_\(\frac{d[pdts]}{dt}\)

Instantaneous rate = rate at a particular time

Average rate = final \(\frac{\lambda_{\textit{max}}}{\Delta t}\)

Initial rate = instantaneous rate @ t=0

\(aA+bB\to cC+dD,\ \frac{d[D]}{dt}=\frac{d}{c}\frac{d[C]}{dt}\)

\(rate=k[A]^{\textit{m}}[B]^{\textit{n}}\), where k= rate constant, m & n are orders of rxn wrt to [A] and [B] respectively

Rate law: eqn that shows dependence of rate on [rxts]

Rate constant: constant of proportionality

\(\rightarrow\uparrow T/catalyst\rightarrow\uparrow k\rightarrow\uparrow\) rate

Half-life: time taken, t, for [rxt] to decrease to half of its initial concentration

\(\rightarrow\) for 1st order rxns, \(t_{1/2}=\frac{\textit{ln}2}{k}\)

First order rxn: \(rate=k[A]\), \(t_{1/2}\) _constant_

Second order rxn: \(rate=k[A][B]\) _or_\(k[A]^{2}\), \(t_{1/2}\) _not constant_

Zero order rxn: rate independent of [A], rate=k

Pseudo order rxn: concentration of particular rxt remains effectively constant throughout

the rxn

Presence of large excess of rxt (e.g solvent is a rxt)

Presence of catalyst ([catalyst] is constant, takes part in the rxt but is regenerated)

As such, \(rate=k^{\textit{r}}[A]\), \(where\)\(k^{\textit{r}}=k[B]\)

Overall rxn order

Initial rates method: measuring \(\Delta[rxts/pdts]\) in the first small \(\Delta t\)

Clock method: measuring t taken for ppt to form (observing visual changes)

Used for:

Rxting a fixed [pdt]

Forming a fixed [pdt]

\(rate\sim\frac{1}{t_{\textit{taken for visual change to occur}}}\)

Rxn mechanism: collection of elementary steps in the proper sequence

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:17]

* When \(T\uparrow\), peak moves to higher energies, distribution broadens out
* Area under curve remains constant
* When \(T\uparrow\), \(N_{\textit{molecules}}\)_with energy \(\geq E_{a}\)_increases

Conc vs Temp vs Catalyst

1. Conc\(\uparrow\rightarrow\) probability of collision with correct collision geometry and sufficient energy increases\(\rightarrow\uparrow\)rxn rate (given that order of rxn w.r.t said rxt \(\neq 0\) )
2. \(T\uparrow\to K\_{\textit{E}ave}\uparrow\rightarrow\) (\(N_{\textit{molecules}}\)\(energy\geq E_{a}\)) \(\uparrow\rightarrow\) rate of rxn \(\uparrow\)

Furthermore rate constant, \(k=Ae^{-\frac{E_{a}}{RT}}\), as \(T\uparrow\) size of 'k' \(\uparrow\)
3. Catalyst: \(\uparrow\)rate of rxn w/o undergoing permanent chemical change, provides an alt. pathway for rxn, \(\downarrow E_{a}\rightarrow\) (\(N_{\textit{molecules}}\)\(energy\geq E_{a}\)) \(\uparrow\rightarrow\) rate of rxn \(\uparrow\)

Furthermore rate constant, \(k=Ae^{-\frac{E_{a}}{RT}}\), as \(E_{a}\downarrow\) size of 'k' \(\uparrow\)

Catalysis

 Inhibitor: \(\downarrow\)rate of rxn

Promoter: \(\uparrow\) Effectiveness of catalyst

Catalyst poison: inhibitor of eff of catalyst

Homogenous catalyst: catalyst & rxts same phase

takes part, is converted to intermediates, and is regenerated
Heterogenous catalyst: catalyst & xts different phase

\(\rightarrow\) rat molecules adsorbed onto catalyst surface. (adsorption onto catalyst\(\rightarrow\)

weakening of covalent bonds within rxting particles) \(\rightarrow\)\(\downarrow\)\(E_{a}\)

\(\rightarrow\)\(\uparrow\)[_rxting particles_]@ catalyst surface

As such, rate of rxn \(\uparrow\)

Diffusion\(\rightarrow\) Adsorption\(\rightarrow\) Rxn\(\rightarrow\) Desorption \(\rightarrow\) Diffusion

Active sites are freed up again for cycle to repeat until all rts have rxted

Autocatalysis: pdt acts as catalyst

Initially: no catalysis

Finally: \(\downarrow\)[_rxts_] \(\rightarrow\)\(\downarrow\)rate

Enzymes: proteins which act as biological catalysts

* Globular proteins with active sites
* Effective
* Specific
* Effective at body temperatures (denatured at high T, inactive at low T)
* Work over a narrow pH range

(substrate + enzyme \(\rightarrow\) enzyme-substrate complex \(\rightarrow\) enzyme + pdts)

At low [substrate], rate of rxn is 1st order wrt to substrate.

At high [substrate], rate of rxn is 0 order wrt to substrate. (active sites become saturated)

Note: such phenomenon is similar to heterogeneous catalysis Experimental techniques:

1. Sampling \(\rightarrow\) quenching \(\rightarrow\) titrating Withdraw fixed vol of sample at steady intervals, and quench by (adding large vol of cold water, or excess of quenching agent that rts immediately with all rts or catalyst) then titrate to determine instantaneous concentration present
2. Measuring color intensity (_concentration \(\sim\) color intensity_ ) Measure color intensity (absorbance) at steady intervals, and conc of colored species is determined by comparing to calibration curve (color intensity of solns of known concentrations)
3. Measuring gas vol.
4. Measuring electrical conductivity (_Nions \(\sim\) conductivity_ )
5. Measuring pressure (_Vgas \(\sim\)Ngas_ ) Measure change in _ppartial_ of rat or pdt to determine rate 

## VII. Dynamic Eqn

Dynamic eqm: state in a reversible rxn in which \(rate_{forward}=rate_{backward}\)

* No net change in macroscopic properties observable
* Closed system
* Can be attained from either direction
* Same eqn state can be attained from any amt of rxts & pdts ( given T constant)

Reaction quotient, \(Q_{c}=\frac{[C]\ ^{c}[D]\ ^{d}}{[A]\ ^{a}[B]\ ^{b}}\)

Eqm constant, \(K_{c}=\frac{[C]\ ^{c}{}_{cqm}[D]\ ^{d}{}_{cqm}}{[A]\ ^{a}{}_{cqm}[B]\ ^{b}{}_{eqm}}\)

Eqm constant for gases, \(K_{p}=\frac{P_{C}\ ^{c}P_{D}\ ^{d}}{P_{A}\ ^{a}P_{B}\ ^{b}}\)

\(K_{forward}=\frac{1}{K_{backward}}\), \(K_{overall}=K_{1}\times K_{2}\times....\)

\(K_{overall}=K\ ^{n}\), (when eqn is multiplied by a factor of n)

\(K_{c}\) dependent only on \(\Delta T\)

Catalyst doesn't change \(K_{c}\) (changes \(K_{forward}\) but also \(K_{backward}\))

Heterogenous eqm: some rxts and products are not in the same phase (do not include such reactants in the \(K_{c}\) expression) (e.g pure solids/ liquids, or excess liquid \(H_{2}O\) when it is a solvent)

Degree of dissociation, \(\alpha=\frac{amt dissociated}{total\ initial\ amt}\)

\(\Delta G\ ^{\Theta}=-RTlnK_{c}\), R= molar gas constant

Le Chatelier's principle: when a system in eqm is subjected to change, the system will react to counteract the change to re-establish eqm.

Haber process: a reversible industrial synthesis of \(NH_{3}\)

\(N_{2}(g)+3H_{2}(g)\Leftrightarrow 2NH_{3}(g)\ \Delta H\ ^{\Theta}\) = -92 \(kJ\ mol\ ^{-1}\)

Conditions:

\(\bullet\) 450 \(\ ^{C}\)

\(\bullet\) 200 atm

\(\bullet\) Iron catalyst

\(\bullet\) Removal of \(NH_{3}\)gas

The pressure chosen for the Haber process is a compromise. A high pressure increases the percentage yield of ammonia but very high pressures are expensive.

The temperature chosen is also a compromise. A high temperature gives a fast reaction but decreases the percentage yield of ammonia. 450\(\ ^{\circ}\)C gives a reasonably fast reaction with a sufficiently high percentage yield of ammonia

Saturated vs Unsaturated: single vs double/triple bond

* **Degrees of Unsaturation* (or "Index of Hydrogen Deficiency")**

* In a hydrocarbon with no double bonds or rings, the number of hydrogens and carbons is related as follows:

#Hydrogens = (2 x #Carbons) + 2

* Each multiple bond or ring reduces the hydrogen count by 2, which we refer to as a "degree of unsaturation"

\(\alpha=\sqrt{\frac{K_{a}}{C_{o}}}\)Salt hydrolysis

Salt: an ionic cmpd formed from acid-base rns ([_Base_] ^[_Acid_] ^[_]_)

Hydrolysis occurs if

* Anion from weak acid is a strong conjugate base (e.g \(CH_{3}COO\) ^[_]_ )
* Cation from weak base is a strong conjugate acid (e.g \(NH_{4}\) ^[_]_)

Buffer solns: one which resists \(\Delta pH\) upon addn of a small amt of acid/ base

Mixture of a weak acid + one of its salt

(e.g \(CH_{3}COOH\) & \(CH_{3}COO\) ^Na ^+ )

\(CH_{3}COOH\) & \(CH_{3}COO\) ^[_]_ + \(H\) ^+

\(CH_{3}COOH\) ^Na ^+ \(CH_{3}COOH\) ^- + \(Na\) ^+

\(CH_{3}COOH\) ^- from complete ionisation of \(NH_{4}Cl\)

\(CH_{3}COOH\) ^Na ^+ oppresses forward rxn of

\(CH_{3}COOH\) & \(CH_{3}COOH\) & \(CH_{3}COOH\) ^+ \(H\) ^+

Addn of small [\(H\) ^]:

\(CH_{3}COOH\) ^+ \(H\) ^+ \(CH_{3}COOH\)

Since [\(CH_{3}COOH\) ^]large, all [\(H\) ^]removed,

\(pH\) ^= constant

Addn of small [\(OH\) ^]:

\(CH_{3}COOH\) + \(OH\) ^- \(CH_{3}COOH\) ^+ \(H_{2}O\)

Since [\(CH_{3}COOH\)]large, all [\(OH\) ^]large, all [\(OH\) ^]removed,

removed,

\(pH\) ^= constant

\(pH\) = \(pK_{a}+lg(\frac{[A\ ^{+}]}{[HA]})\) (buffer solns involving weak acids)

\(pOH\) = \(P\,K_{b}+lg(\frac{[BH\ ^{+}]}{[B]})\) (buffer solns involving weak bases)

Buffer capacity: ability to resist \(\Delta pH\)

* Absolute capacity: depends on absolute concentration of conjugate acid/ base present
* Relative capacity: max buffer capacity when (\(\frac{[salt]}{[acid/base]})\) = 1

\(pH\) = \(pK_{a}\) _or \(pK_{b}\)_

Effective buffer range: 0.1 \(\leq\frac{[salt]}{[acid/base]}\)\(\leq\) 10XIV. Solubility eqm

\(Na^{+},K^{+},Li^{+},NH_{4}^{+}\) are all soluble

\(O\) -/\(OH\) - usually insol. except abovementioned or with large grp 2

\(CrO_{4}\) 2- usually insol. except abovementioned or with small grp 2

Halides, \(X\) - usually sol. except with \(Ag^{+}\)/\(Cu^{+}\)

\(SO_{4}\) 2- usually sol. except with \(Ba^{2+}\)/\(Ca^{2+}\)

\(K_{sp}\) _of \(M_{a}X_{b}(s)=[M^{b+}(aq)]^{a}[X^{a-}(aq)]^{b}\)_

Solubility: max amt of solute which can dissolve in given amt of solvent at a particular temp

\(Ionic\)\(pdt>K_{sp}\), precipitation

\(Ionic\)\(pdt<K_{sp}\), no precipitation

Common ion effect: when a salt in a soln alr contains an ion common to the salt, increases ionic pdt above \(K_{sp}\), reducing solubility

Complex ion effect: formation of a complex ion that reduces the conc of metal ions, thus reducing ionic pdt below \(K_{sp}\), improving solubility.

Selective discharge: if more than one species can be discharged, we need to compare the electrode potential of the competing species.

* Precipitation rxns [see Chapter XIV. Solubility eqm]
* Redox rxns (refer to the Data booklet for half eqns)
* Ligand exchange: ligands forming the complex of higher \(K_{\mathit{stab}}\) replacing those forming the complex of lower \(K_{\mathit{stab}}\)

\(K_{\mathit{stab}}\): stability constant, measure of how stable Complex A is vs Complex B.

(e.g

)

Ligand strength:

\(H_{2}O<NH_{3}<S_{2}O_{3}\)\({}^{2-}<CN\)\({}^{-}<edta\)\({}^{4-}\)
### Qualitative Analysis

#### 9(c) Tests for gases

Thermal decomposition:

1. Ammonium salts \(NH_{4}Cl\)\(\Leftrightarrow\)\(NH_{3}+HCl\) Pungent \(NH_{3}\) (g) evolved, white solid on upper end of base
2. Nitrates a. \(2KNO_{3}\to 2KNO_{2}+O_{2}\) \(O_{2}\) (g) evolved religious glowing splint b. \(2Cu(NO_{3})_{2}\to 2CuO+4NO_{2}+O_{2}\) Blue solid turned black. \(O_{2}\) (g) evolved. Pungent \(NO_{2}\) (g) turned \(FeSO_{4}(aq)\) brown c. \(Zn(NO_{3})_{2}\to ZnO+2NO_{2}+\frac{1}{2}O_{2}\) \(ZnO\) (s) yellow residue remained, turned white upon cooling. Pungent \(2NO_{2}\) evolved. \(O_{2}\) evolved.
3. Carbonates a. \(CuCO_{3}\to CuO+CO_{2}\) Green solid turned black. \(CO_{2}\) (g) evolved b. \(2NaHCO_{3}\to Na_{2}CO_{3}+CO_{2}+H_{2}O\) \(CO_{2}\) (g) evolved.

Triply charged cations:

E.g \([Fe(H_{2}O)_{6}]^{3+}+3H_{2}O\)\(\Leftrightarrow\)\([Fe(OH)_{3}(H_{2}O)_{3}](s)+3H_{3}O^{+}(aq)\) Acidic enough to rxt with \(Na_{2}CO_{3}\), a weak base Amphoteric Hydroxides: \(Al\), \(Zn\), \(Cr\)
