2.2 The Bronsted-Lowry theory of acids and bases

In 1923, J.N. Bronsted and T.M. Lowry proposed the proton transfer theory of acids and bases.

Definitions

Bronsted-Lowry Acid

Bronsted-Lowry Base

A Bronsted-Lowry acid is a proton donor.

A Bronsted-Lowry base is a proton acceptor.

In this case, an acid-base reaction involves the transfer of a proton (i.e. H\({}^{+}\) ion) from the acid to the base. An acid is only an acid in the presence of a base, and a base is only a base in the presence of an acid.

Examples:

\(\begin{array}{ll}\text{HCI}(\text{q})&+&\text{NH}_{3}(\text{g})&\text{NH}_{4 }CI(\text{s})\\ \text{acid}&\text{base}\end{array}\)

\(\begin{array}{ll}\text{HCI}(\text{aq})&+&\text{H}_{2}\text{O}(I)&\text{Cl}^{ \prime}(\text{aq})+\text{H}_{3}\text{O}^{\prime}(\text{aq})\\ \text{acid}&\text{base}\end{array}\)

\(\begin{array}{ll}\text{CH}_{3}\text{COOH}(\text{aq})&+&\text{OH}^{\prime}( \text{aq})&\text{CH}_{3}\text{COO}^{\prime}(\text{aq})+\text{H}_{2}\text{O}(I) \\ \text{CO}_{3}\text{-}^{2}(\text{aq})&+&\text{H}_{2}\text{O}(I)&\text{acid} \end{array}\)

\(\begin{array}{ll}\text{\text{\text{\text{\text{\text{\text{\text{\text{ \text{\text{\text{\text{\text{\text{\text{\text{\text{\text{\text{\text{\text{ \text{ \texttexttexttexttexttexttexttexttexttexttexttexttexttexttexttext      }}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ \end{\right]

}\right.\]

}\]

### 2.3 Lewis acids and bases

In 1938, the American chemist G,N. Lewis produced a theory which extends the concept of acids and bases even further than that of Bronsted and Lowry.

Definitions

A Lewis acid is any species that can accept a pair of electrons from a base to form a dative covalent bond, i.e. **a Lewis acid is an electron-pair acceptor**.

Examples:

\(\begin{array}{ll}\text{BF}_{3}&+&:\text{NH}_{3}&\text{H}_{3}\text{N} \text{-}\text{BF}_{3}\\ \text{Lewis acid}&\text{Lewis base}&\text{H}_{3}\text{O}^{\prime}\\ \text{AICI}_{3}&+&:\text{Cl}^{\prime}&\text{Levelis base}\end{array}\)

The Lewis theory of acids and bases is much broader than the Arrhenius and Bronsted-Lowry definitions. It extends the range of acid-base reactions to include those which do not involve protons.

### Conjugate acid-base pairs

We are primarily concerned with aqueous solutions in which acid-base phenomena involve proton transfer, and so the **B**ronsted-Lowry theory of acids and bases is of most use to us.

Consider the following reaction between an acid HA and a base B.

Note:-

In the forward reaction

HA is an acid as it donates a proton to B.

B is a base as it accepts a proton from HA.

In the backward reaction

HB\({}^{*}\) is an acid since it donates a proton to A-.

A-' is a base since it accepts a proton from HB\({}^{*}\).

Conjugate acid-base pairs

HA and A-

HB\({}^{*}\) and B

Notice that in each conjugate pair, the acid and base differ from each other by a proton, H\({}^{*}\).

Examples

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|} \hline  & \multicolumn{3}{c|}{Reaction (forward reaction)} & \multicolumn{1}{c|}{acid} & \multicolumn{1}{c|}{conjugate base} & \multicolumn{1}{c|}{base} & \multicolumn{1}{c|}{conjugate acid} \\ \hline

## 5 pH Calculations for Strong Acids and Bases

### The pH scale

The concentration of hydrogen ions in a solution is a measure of acidity or alkalinity of the solution. Most hydrogen ion concentrations fall between values of 10\({}^{9}\) and 10\({}^{-14}\) mol dm\({}^{-3}\).

The Danish biochemist S.P.L. Sorensen (1909) realised that this wide range of hydrogen ion concentrations could conveniently be expressed by the numbers 0 to 14 using **the pH scale**.

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:6]

### Definition of pOH

* The pOH of a solution is the negative logarithm to base ten of the hydroxide ion concentration of the solution in mol dm\({}^{-3}\)
* If the pOH of a solution is known, the concentration of hydroxide ions (in mol dm\({}^{-3}\)) in the solution can be calculated.

### Relationship between pH and pOH at 25 \({}^{\circ}\)C

* Experimentally, it has been determined that at 25 \({}^{\circ}\)C, pH + pOH = 14
* pOH and pOH = 14
- pH at 25 \({}^{\circ}\)C.
* Refer to **Section 4** for more details.

### Calculating the pH of a solution of a strong base

* **Worked Example 3**

* **(a)** Calculate the pH of 0.100 mol dm\({}^{-3}\) KOH(aq). **(b)** Calculate the pH of 1.00 mol dm\({}^{-3}\) Ba(OH)\({}_{2}\)(aq). **Ba(OH)\({}_{2}\)**(aq) \(\longrightarrow\) Ba\({}^{2+}\)(aq) + 2OH\({}^{-}\)(aq) [OH+] = 0.100 mol dm\({}^{-3}\)
* pOH = -lg (0.100) = 1
* 1 = 13.0
* pH = -lg (2.00) = -0.30
* pH = -lg (-0.10) = 14.3
* pH = -lg (-0.10) = 14.3
* **3.8** Calculating [OH] from pH or pOH
* **Worked Example 4**

* \(\bar{\theta}\).1 = \(\bar{\zeta}\).1 [OH+] = 10\({}^{-90}\)m = 10\({}^{-3}\)m = 1.00 x 10\({}^{-3}\)mol dm\({}^{-3}\)
* **(b)** Calculating the pH of a solution
* Main methods available to determine the pH (and hydrogen ion concentration) of a solution:
* using universal indicator paper or solution for an approximate pH value.
* using a pH meter for an accurate pH determination.

* The pH values of some familiar aqueous solutions are shown in the diagram below.

* **Exercise 2 [N2005/1/9]** The pH of normal human blood is 7.4. Strenuous exercise can cause the condition called acidosis in which the pH falls. If the pH drops to 6.8, death may occur.

How many times greater is the hydrogen ion concentration in blood at pH6.8 compared with that at pH7.4?

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:9]

### Calculations involving \(K_{w}\)

By definition,

p\(K_{w}\) is the negative logarithm to base ten of \(K_{w}\).

p\(K_{w}\) can be expressed in terms of pH and pOH.

\(K_{w}\) = [H+] [OH] \(-\)[g \(K_{w}\) = \(-\)[g [H+] -g [OH+] \(\Rightarrow\) p\(K_{w}\) = pH + pOH \(\Rightarrow\) p\(K_{w}\) = pH + pOH \(\Rightarrow\) p\(K_{w}\) = pH + pOH \(\Rightarrow\) p\(K_{w}\) = pH + pOH = 4.4 \(\cdot\) pH and pOH of a neutral aqueous solution at 25 \({}^{\circ}\)C.

For an aqueous solution, \(K_{w}\) = [H+] [OH+].

For a neutral aqueous solution, [H+] = [OH+].

Consider a neutral aqueous solution at 25 \({}^{\circ}\)C.

For a neutral aqueous solution at 25 \({}^{\circ}\)C,

\(\Rightarrow\) [H+] = \(\sqrt{1.0\times 10^{-14}}\) = \(1.0\times 10^{-7}\) mol dm\({}^{-3}\)

pH = -lg [H+] = -lg (1.0\times 10^{-7}) = 7

[OH+] = [H+] = 1.0\(\times 10^{-7}\) mol dm\({}^{-3}\)

pH = pOH = -lg [OH+] = -lg (1.0\(\times 10^{-7}\)) = 7

For pure water (at 25 \({}^{\circ}\)C) which is neutral,

[H+] = [OH+] = 1.0\(\times 10^{-7}\) mol dm\({}^{-3}\)

pH = pOH = 7 (at 25 \({}^{\circ}\)C)

### The effect of temperature on \(K_{w}\)

The table below shows the variation of the ionic product of water, \(K_{w}\), with temperature.

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|} \hline Temperature / \({}^{\circ}\)C & \(K_{w}\) / mol\({}^{2}\) dm\({}^{-6}\) & pH of water : - \(I_{w}\) \\ \hline
10 & 0.29 x 10\({}^{-14}\) & 7.27 \\ \hline
20 & 0.68 x 10\({}^{-14}\) & 7.08 \\ \hline
**25** & **1.00 x 10\({}^{-14}\)** & **7.00** \\ \hline
30 & 1.47 x 10\({}^{-14}\) & 6.92 \\ \hline
40 & 2.92 x 10\({}^{-14}\) & 6.77 \\ \hline
50 & 5.48 x 10\({}^{-14}\) & 6.63 \\ \hline
100 & 51.3 x 10\({}^{-14}\) & 6.14 \\ \hline \end{tabular}.

The value of \(K_{w}\) increases with temperature as shown in the table. This is because the self-ionisation of water is an endothermic process.

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|} H\({}_{2}\)O(I) + H\({}_{2}\)O(I) \(\rightleftharpoons\) H\({}_{3}\)O\({}^{+}\)(aq) + OH\({}^{+}\)(aq) & \(\Delta H>0\) \\ or & H\({}_{2}\)O(I) \(\rightleftharpoons\) H\({}^{+}\)(aq) + OH\({}^{+}\)(aq) & \(\Delta H>0\) \\ \hline \end{tabular}.

As temperature is increased, the equilibrium position of the above reaction shifts to the right to absorb the heat added. This is in accordance with Le Chatelier's principle.

With the forward endothermic reaction favoured as temperature is increased, there will be higher concentrations of H\({}^{+}\) and OH\({}^{-}\) ions.

Since \(K_{w}\) = [H\({}^{+}\)] [OH\({}^{-}\)], the value of \(K_{w}\) increases as temperature increases.

\(\blacksquare\)**Exercise 3**\(\blacksquare\)[N2013/I/11]

The dissociation constant, \(K_{w}\), for the ionisation of water, H\({}_{2}\)O \(\rightleftharpoons\) H\({}^{+}\) + OH\({}^{-}\), at different temperatures is given below.

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|} \hline temperature/\({}^{\circ}\)C & \(K_{w}\) / mol\({}^{2}\) dm\({}^{-6}\) \\ \hline
0 & 1.15 x 10\({}^{-15}\) \\ \hline
25 & 1.00 x 10\({}^{-14}\) \\ \hline
50 & 5.50 x 10\({}^{-14}\) \\ \hline \end{tabular} What can be deduced from this information?

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|} A & Only at 25 \({}^{\circ}\)C are [H\({}^{+}\)] and [OH\({}^{-}\)] equal. & \\ B & The equilibrium lies furthest to the right at 0\({}^{\circ}\)C. \\ C & The forward reaction is exothermic. \\ D & The pH of water decreases as temperature increases.

**5.4**Calculating the pH of a weak acid

* Problem:

Consider a \(C_{0}\) mol dm\({}^{-3}\) HA(aq). Calculate its pH given the \(K_{a}\) of HA.
* Solution:

Let [H\({}^{+}\)] = x mol dm\({}^{-3}\) at equilibrium.

\begin{tabular}{c|c c c c} \hline Concentration / mol dm\({}^{-3}\) & HA(aq) & \(\rightleftharpoons\) & H\({}^{+}\)(aq) & + & A\({}^{\prime}\)(aq) \\ \hline Initial & \(C_{0}\) & \(-\) & \(-\) & \\ Change & \(-\) x & \(\neq\)x & \(+\)x & \\ Equilibrium & (\(C_{0}-x\)) & x & x & \\ \hline \end{tabular}

\begin{tabular}{c|c c c} \hline \(K_{a}\) & \(=\) & [H\({}^{+}\)] [A\({}^{-}\)] & \(=\) & \((x)\) (\(x\)) \\ \hline \([\)HA\(]\) & \(=\) & \((C_{0}-x)\) & \(=\) & \((C_{0}-x)\) \\ \hline \end{tabular}

Since HA is a weak acid with a relatively small \(K_{a}\), assume \(x<<C_{0}\).

Then \((C_{0}-x)\approx C_{0}\).

\begin{tabular}{c|c} \(K_{a}\) & \(=\) & \(\frac{x^{2}}{C_{0}}\) \\ \(\times\) & \(=\) & \(\sqrt{K_{a}C_{0}}\) \\ \hline \end{tabular}

\begin{tabular}{c|c} \([\)H\({}^{+}\)\(]\) & \(=\) & \(\sqrt{K_{a}C_{0}}\) \\ \hline \([\)H\({}^{+}\)\(]\) & \(=\) & \(\sqrt{K_{a}C_{0}}\) \\ \hline \([\)H\({}^{+}\)\(]\) & \(=\) & \(-\)lg\([\)H\({}^{+}\)\(]\) = & \(-\)lg\(\sqrt{K_{a}C_{0}}\) \\ \hline \end{tabular}

* There are two key assumptions made to simplify the arithmetic.

* The [H\({}^{+}\)] from the self-ionisation of water is negligible and ignored.
* This is usually justified since the presence of H\({}^{+}\) from HA will suppress the self-ionisation of water.
* This assumption is not valid if HA(aq) is very dilute.
* The degree of dissociation is negligible, i.e. x \(<<C_{0}\) such that \((C_{0}-x)\approx C_{0}\) where \(C_{0}=\) initial [HA] and x \(=[\)H\({}^{+}\)\(]\) = [HA]\({}_{\text{dissociated}}\).

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|} \hline Degree of dissociation, & \\ \((\frac{x}{C_{0}})\) (100\%) & Validity of assumption \\ \hline \((\frac{x}{C_{0}})\) (100\%) \(\leq\) 5\% & The assumption is valid and approximation can be used. \\ \hline \((\frac{x}{C_{0}})\) (100\%) \(>\) 5\% & The assumption is not valid and x has to be found by solving the quadratic equation.
* Note:

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|} \hline x = [H\({}^{+}\)] = \(\sqrt{K_{a}C_{0}}\) & \(-\) \\ \(\cdot\) & This formula is useful for solving multiple-choice questions. \\ \(\cdot\) & This formula is useful for checking if \((C_{0}-x)\approx C_{0}\). \\ \hline \end{tabular}

### Calculating the pH of an extremely dilute strong acid

**Worked Example 9**

**Calculate the pH of 1.0 x 10-8 mol dm**\({}^{-3}\)**HNO**\({}_{3}\)**(aq) at 298 K. Solution**

**The given nitric acid solution is very dilute. Hence the contribution of H**\({}^{+}\) **ions from the self-ionisation of water is not negligible and has to be taken into consideration in calculating the pH of the solution.**

**There are therefore two sources of H**\({}^{+}\) **ions:**

1 **from the complete dissociation of HNO**\({}_{3}\)**: HNO**\({}_{3}\)**(aq)**\(\longrightarrow\)**H**\({}^{+}\)**(aq) + NO**\({}_{3}\)**(aq) 2 **from the self-ionisation of water: H**\({}_{2}\)**O**(I)**\(\Rightarrow\)**H**\({}^{+}\)**(aq) + OH**\({}^{+}\)**(aq) **The presence of H**\({}^{+}\) **ions from the complete dissociation of HNO**\({}_{3}\) **will suppress the ionisation of H**\({}_{2}\)**O.**

**Let [H**\({}^{+}\)] from the self-ionisation of water = y mol dm**\({}^{-3}\) **Then [OH**\({}^{+}\)] due to the self-ionisation of water = y mol dm**\({}^{-3}\)**.**

**Hence [H**\({}^{+}\)]**\({}_{\rm total}\) = [H**\({}^{+}\)]**\({}_{\rm ionic\,acid}\) + [H**\({}^{+}\)]**\({}_{\rm water}\) = (1.0 x 10-8 + y) mol dm**\({}^{-3}\) **At 298 K,** \(K_{\rm ex}\) = [H**\({}^{+}\)]**\({}_{\rm total}\) **[OH**\({}^{+}\)] = 1.0 x 10-14 mol**\({}^{-6}\) **\((1.0\times 10^{-8}+y)\) **(y) = 1.0 x 10-14-**\(y^{2}+1.0x10^{-8}-y-1.0\times 10^{-14}=0\) **Solving using GC,**

**y = 9.51 x 10-4 or y = -1.05 x 10-7 (rejected since y > 0) [H**\({}^{+}\)]**\({}_{\rm total}\) = (1.0 x 10-8 + 9.51 x 10-8) = 1.051 x 10-7 mol dm**\({}^{-3}\) **\(\vdots\) **pH = -lg [H**\({}^{+}\)] = -lg (1.051 x 10-7) = 6.98**	* 6.1 Base dissociation constant of a weak base B (e.g. NH\({}_{3}\)) in which the following equilibrium is established:
* B(aq) + H\({}_{2}\)O(l) \(\rightleftharpoons\) BH\({}^{+}\)(aq) + OH\({}^{-}\)(aq) E.g.: NH\({}_{3}\)(aq) + H\({}_{2}\)O(l) \(\rightleftharpoons\) NH\({}_{4}\)\({}^{*}\)(aq) + OH\({}^{+}\)(aq)
* \(K_{\rm{c}}[\rm{H}_{2}\rm{O}]=\frac{[\rm{BH}^{+}][\rm{OH}^{+}]}{[\rm{B}]}\) Since [H\({}_{2}\)O] in aqueous medium is effectively constant, \(K_{\rm{c}}\) [H\({}_{2}\)O] is another constant. Let \(K_{\rm{b}}=K_{\rm{c}}[\rm{H}_{2}\rm{O}]\). Then \(K_{\rm{b}}=\frac{[\rm{BH}^{+}][\rm{OH}^{+}]}{[\rm{B}]}\). * For the above reaction at equilibrium, \(K_{\rm{b}}\equiv\frac{[\rm{BH}^{+}][\rm{OH}^{-}]}{[\rm{B}]}\) * \(K_{\rm{b}}\) is termed the **base dissociation constant** of the base B. * **Note:** * \(K_{\rm{b}}\) is **a measure of the basic strength** of the weak base B. * \(K_{\rm{b}}\) is a measure of the ability of the Bronsted-Lowry base B to accept a proton. * \(K_{\rm{b}}\) has units of **mol dm\({}^{-3}\)**. * The value of \(K_{\rm{b}}\) is **dependent on temperature**. * The \(K_{\rm{b}}\) and pK\({}_{\rm{b}}\) values of different bases can be used to compare the strengths of the bases. * The pK\({}_{\rm{b}}\) of a base is the **negative logarithm to base ten of the \(K_{\rm{b}}\)** * \(pK_{\rm{b}}=-\lg K_{\rm{b}}\) * **Worked Example 10**

### Relative strengths of acid and base in a conjugate acid-base pair

* Consider a conjugate acid-base pair at 298 K.

* Consider two weak acids, HA and HB.

* If HA is a stronger acid than HB, then A- is a weaker base than B-.

* Reasoning: HA is a stronger acid than HB \(\Rightarrow\)\(K_{\text{a}}\) of HA \(>\)\(K_{\text{a}}\) of HB \(\Rightarrow\)\(K_{\text{b}}\) of A \(>\)\(K_{\text{b}}\) of B- \(\Rightarrow\)\(K_{\text{b}}\) of A- \(<\)\(K_{\text{b}}\) of B- \(\Rightarrow\) A- is a weaker base than B-

* If HA is a stronger acid than HB, the reaction between HA and B- will occur to a greater extent than that between HB and A-.

* The table below shows the strengths of different conjugate acid-base pairs.

## 8 Degree of Ionisation, \(\alpha\)

8.4 Defining degree of ionisation

The degree of ionisation (or degree of dissociation), \(\alpha\), of an electrolyte can be defined as the fraction of molecules which is ionised at equilibrium.

\(\alpha=\frac{\text{number of moles of molecules which are ionised at equilibrium}}{\text{number of moles of molecules present initially}}\)

For strong acids/bases which ionise completely \(\Rightarrow\alpha=\)1

For weak acids/bases which ionise partially \(\Rightarrow\) 0 \(<\alpha<\) 1

The degree of ionisation may also be expressed in percentage.

### Variation of \(\alpha\) with concentration

Consider a weak monobasic acid HA of concentration C\({}_{\text{o}}\) mol dm\({}^{-3}\) and degree of ionisation \(\alpha\).

\(K_{\text{a}}=\frac{\left[\text{H}^{+}\right]\left[\text{A}^{-}\right]}{\cdot \left[\text{HA}\right]}=\frac{\left(\alpha C_{\text{o}}\right)\left(\alpha C_{ \text{o}}\right)}{C_{\text{o}}\left(1\cdot\alpha\right)}=\frac{\alpha^{2}C_{ \text{o}}}{\left(1\cdot\alpha\right)}\)

\(\Rightarrow\)\(K_{\text{a}}=\frac{\alpha^{2}C_{\text{o}}}{\left(1\cdot\alpha\right)}\)

Consider a weak acid in which \(\alpha\) is very small such that \(\alpha<<1\).

Then \(\left(1-\alpha\right)\approx 1\). In this case, the \(K_{\text{a}}\) expression is simplified as shown below.

\(K_{\text{a}}=\alpha^{2}C_{\text{o}}\)

Since \(K_{\text{a}}\) is constant at a given temperature, it can be seen from the last expression that for a weak acid, \(\alpha\)**increases with increasing dilution (i.e. decreasing concentration of acid)** and is therefore **not constant at a given temperature**.

For a weak base B of concentration C\({}_{\text{o}}\) mol dm\({}^{-3}\) and degree of ionisation \(\alpha\), the above equations apply with \(K_{\text{a}}\) of B replacing \(K_{\text{a}}\) of HA.

## Appendix B Salt Hydrolysis

### Types of salt solution

* A salt may be defined as a compound formed by the reaction of an acid and a base. It contains a cation which originates from the base and
* an anion which originates from the acid
* Some salts, when dissolved in water, form neutral solutions. Others form acidic or basic solutions due to salt hydrolysis, which is a reversible reaction between the salt ions and water.
* Whether a salt solution is neutral, acidic or basic depends on the type of salt. There are four types in this context as summarised in the table below.

* A salt will undergo hydrolysis (i.e. reaction with water) if its anion is a conjugate base of a weak acid and/or its cation is a conjugate acid of a weak base
* The table on the next page summaries how salt hydrolysis gives rise to acidic or alkaline solution. Note that only ions that are the conjugate bases of weak acids or conjugate acids of weak bases hydrolyse appreciably..

* **Addition of a small amount of base (i.e. OH- ions)** When a small amount of OH- ions is added to the solution, the following reaction occurs: CH\({}_{3}\)COOH(aq) + OH-(aq) \(\longrightarrow\) CH\({}_{3}\)COO-(aq) + H\({}_{2}\)O(l)
* The presence of a large reservoir of unionised CH\({}_{3}\)COOH molecules in the solution ensures that nearly all the added OH- ions are removed.
* Hence [OH-] in the solution changes very little and the pH is kept approximately constant.

### Basic buffer

* **An alkaline buffer solution consists of a mixture of a weak base and a salt containing its conjugate acid.**
* Consider an alkaline buffer consisting of a mixture of ammonia and ammonium chloride.

In this solution, ammonia, being a weak base, is only partially ionised: NH\({}_{3}\)(aq) + H\({}_{2}\)O(l) \(\rightleftharpoons\) NH\({}_{4}\)+(aq) + OH-(aq)..................(1) On the other hand, ammonium chloride, a strong electrolyte, is fully dissociated: NH\({}_{4}\)C/(aq) \(\longrightarrow\) NH\({}_{4}\)+ _Cl-_(aq)..................(2)
* In accordance with Le Chatelier's principle, the presence of NH\({}_{4}\)+ ions from the complete dissociation of NH\({}_{4}\)C/ further suppresses the ionisation of NH\({}_{3}\) such that the equilibrium position of reaction (1) lies very much to the left.
* Hence the buffer solution contains relatively high concentrations of both NH\({}_{3}\) and NH\({}_{4}\)+. The buffer solution is said to contain a large reservoir of NH\({}_{3}\) (basic species) and a large reservoir of NH\({}_{4}\)+ (acidic species).

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:30]

At equilibrium, \(K_{a}\ =\ \frac{[H^{+}]\ [A^{-}]}{[HA]}\)

Taking logarithms to base ten, \(\lg\ K_{a}\ =\ \lg\ [H^{+}]+\lg\ \frac{[A^{-}]}{[HA]}\)

Multiplying by \(-1\), \(-\lg\ K_{a}\ =\ -\lg\ [H^{+}]-\lg\ \frac{[A^{-}]}{[HA]}\)

Substituting pH = -lg [H^+] and pK\({}_{a}\) = -lg \(K_{a}\), \(\qquad pK_{a}\ =\ pH-\lg\ \frac{[A^{-}]}{[HA]}\)

Rearranging the above expression gives the following expression:

The **Henderson-Hasselbalch equation** can be used to calculate the following:

* the pH of a buffer solution,
* how much acid or salt is needed to make a buffer solution of required pH,
* the effect on the pH of a buffer solution when a small amount of acid or base is added.

### The relationship between pH, pK\({}_{b}\) and composition of a basic buffer

Consider an alkaline buffer solution containing NH\({}_{3}\) and NH\({}_{4}\)C/.

NH\({}_{4}\)C/(aq) \(\longrightarrow\) NH\({}_{4}\)*(aq) + Cl\({}^{\prime}\)(aq)

NH\({}_{3}\)(aq) + H\({}_{2}\)O(l) \(\rightleftharpoons\) NH\({}_{4}\)*(aq) + OH\({}^{-}\)(aq)

In a similar manner as that in **Section 11.1**, the following expression can be derived.

The above expression is called the **Henderson-Hasselbalch equation** for a buffer solution consisting of a weak base and its salt.

### Calculating the pH of buffer solutions

**Worked Example 18**\(\bullet\)\(\blacksquare\)

Calculate the pH of a solution containing 0.50 mol dm\({}^{-3}\) of methanoic acid, HCOOH, and 2.5 mol dm\({}^{-3}\) of potassium methanoate, HCOO\({}^{-}\)K\({}^{*}\), \(K_{\text{a}}\) for HCOOH = 1.6 x 10\({}^{-4}\) mol dm\({}^{-3}\).

Solution

HCOO\({}^{-}\)K\({}^{\prime}\)(aq) \(\longrightarrow\) HCOO\({}^{-}\)(aq) + K\({}^{\prime}\)(aq)

HCOOH(aq) \(\rightleftharpoons\) HCOO\({}^{-}\)(aq) + H\({}^{+}\)(aq)

The given solution is an acidic buffer.

For this acidic buffer, pH = p\(K_{\text{a}}\) + lg (HCOO\({}^{-}\)) = -lg (1.6 x 10\({}^{-4}\)) + lg (2.5) = 4.49

**Worked Example 19**\(\bullet\)\(\blacksquare\)

Calculate the pH of a solution that is formed by mixing equal volumes of 0.40 mol dm\({}^{-3}\) NH\({}_{3}\)(aq) and 0.20 mol dm\({}^{-3}\) NH\({}_{4}\)Cl(aq). The pK\({}_{\text{b}}\) of NH\({}_{3}\) is 4.75.

Solution

Let V dm\({}^{3}\) be the volume of each solution, NH\({}_{3}\)(aq) and NH\({}_{4}\)Cl(aq), used.

At equilibrium in the resultant solution,

[NH\({}_{3}\)] \(\approx\) initial [NH\({}_{3}\)] in the solution after mixing = \(\frac{\text{0.}\text{.}\text{.

### Calculating the change in pH of buffer solutions

\(\bullet\)**Worked Example 21**\(\bullet\)

Calculate the change in pH when 0.001 mol of solid potassium hydroxide is added to 1 dm\({}^{3}\) of water.

Solution

Since water is neutral, pH of water = 7.0 (at 298 K)

After addition of KOH,

[OH+] in the solution = 1.00 x 10\({}^{-3}\) mol dm\({}^{-3}\)

pOH = -lg [OH+] = -lg (1.00 x 10\({}^{-3}\)) = 3.00

At 298 K, pH = 14 - pOH = 14 - 3.00 = 11.0

Change in pH = final pH - original pH = 11.0 - 7.0 = + 4.00 \(\Rightarrow\) increase in pH of 4.00 units

\(\bullet\)**Worked Example 22**\(\bullet\)

Calculate the change in pH when 0.001 mol of solid potassium hydroxide is added to 1 dm\({}^{3}\) of the buffer solution prepared in Worked Example 20.

Solution

pH of the buffer solution = 4.564

Initial amount of CH\({}_{3}\)COOH present in the buffer = 0.06 mol

Initial amount of CH\({}_{3}\)COO\({}^{-}\) present in the buffer = 0.04 mol

Upon the addition of OH: \(\quad\) CH\({}_{3}\)COOH(aq) + OH\({}^{-}\)(aq) \(\longrightarrow\) CH\({}_{3}\)COO\({}^{-}\)(aq) + H\({}_{2}\)O(l)

n(CH\({}_{3}\)COOH) left = initial n(CH\({}_{3}\)COOH) - n(CH\({}_{3}\)COOH) reacted

= 0.06 - 0.001 = 0.0590 mol

\(\quad\)

n(CH\({}_{3}\)COO\({}^{-}\)) present = initial n(CH\({}_{3}\)COO\({}^{-}\)) + n(CH\({}_{3}\)COO\({}^{-}\)) formed

= 0.04 + 0.001 = 0.0410 mol

At equilibrium in the resultant solution after reaction,

[CH\({}_{3}\)COOH] = [CH\({}_{3}\)COOH] left after reaction = 0.0590 mol dm\({}^{-3}\)

[CH\({}_{3}\)COO\({}^{-}\)] present after reaction = 0.0410 mol dm\({}^{-3}\)

The resultant solution is an acidic buffer.

For this acidic buffer, pH = p\(K_{a}\) + lg (\(\frac{[CH\({}_{3}\)COO\({}^{-}\)]}{[CH\({}_{3}\)COOH]}\))

= 4.74 + lg (\(\frac{0.0410}{0.0590}\)) = 4.582

Change in pH = final pH - original pH = 4.582-4.564 = +0.018 \(\Rightarrow\) increase in pH of 0.018 units

\(\bullet\)Note: Compare the answers for Worked Examples 21 and 22.

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|} \hline Worked E.g. & Solution & Original pH & pH after addition of 0.001 mol KOH & Change in pH \\ \hline
21 & 1 dm\({}^{3}\) of water & 7.0 & 11.0 & + 4.00 \\ \hline
22 & 1 dm\({}^{3}\) of buffer & 4.564 & 4.582 & +0.018 \\ \hline \end{tabular}

There is a significantly smaller change in pH when the same small amount of KOH is added to a buffer solution than to water.

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:34]

* **Effective buffer range*
* The effective buffer range is the pH range over which the buffer acts effectively in keeping pH approximately constant, and it is related to the relative component concentrations.
* In practice, an acidic buffer is effective provided: \(0.1\leq\frac{[\text{salt}]}{[\text{acid}]}\leq 10\)

* **When** \(\frac{[\text{salt}]}{[\text{acid}]}=0.1\)
* **When** \(\frac{[\text{salt}]}{[\text{acid}]}=10\)
* **When** \(\frac{[\text{salt}]}{[\text{acid}]}=10\)
* **When** \(\frac{[\text{salt}]}{[\text{acid}]}=10\)
* **When** \(\frac{[\text{salt}]}{[\text{acid}]}=10\)
* **This means that the effective buffer range is from pH = (p_K_\({}_{\text{a}}-1\)) to pH = (p_K_\({}_{\text{a}}+1\)).** **Effective buffer range of an acidic buffer = p_K_\({}_{\text{a}}\pm 1\)

### Effect of dilution on the pH of buffer

* **For an acidic buffer containing a weak acid HA and its salt Na*A-, pH = p_K_\({}_{\text{a}}+lg\) ([HA]).
* **From the equation, it can be seen that diluting the buffer has no effect on the pH because [HA] and [A-] are reduced to the same extent (i.e. the value of [HA] is unchanged).**
* **Similarly, for an alkaline buffer containing a weak base B and its salt BH*, dilution has no effect on pH (and hence pH) since [B] and [BH*] are reduced to the same extent.**
* **However, note that dilution has a marked effect on buffer capacity. It reduces the ability of the buffer to cope with contaminating acid and base.**

### Preparing a buffer solution

* **Consider the Henderson-Hasselbach equation as applied to acidic buffers.*
* There are two terms on the right-hand side, which determine the final pH of the solution.*
* The first term is p_K_\({}_{\text{a}}\)**, whose value is responsible for the 'coarse selection' of pH.*
* **The second term involves the ratio [salt/[acid] and provides the 'fine tuning' to the final desired pH.**

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:36]

**13.1**: Equivalence point and end-point
* The aim of any titration is to determine the volumes of two solutions which just react with each other completely. This occurs at the equivalence point and it marks the completion of the titration.
* In an acid-base titration, the **equivalence point** is the stage reached when the amount of acid needed to react with the amount of base is precisely that required by the stoichiometric equation.
* In practice, the completion of an acid-base titration can be detected by a distinct colour change brought about by the use of a suitable indicator. The point during titration at which this distinct colour change occurs is called the **end-point** of the titration.
* The use of a suitable indicator will ensure that the end-point of the titration is very close to the equivalence point of the titration.

**13.2**: Use of indicators during acid-base titrations
* During an acid-base titration, there is a change in pH as the base is added to the acid or vice versa. This change in pH during the course of a titration depends largely upon the strengths of the acid and base used.
* As shown in the table below, there are four main types of acid-base titrations but only three of them can employ suitable indicators to help identify the equivalence point.
* This is essentially because, for the equivalence point of an acid-base titration to be identifiable using an indicator, the pH near the equivalence point must change sharply by several units. This does not occur in the case of a weak acid-weak base titration.
* Types of acid-base titration

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|} \hline Type of titration & Acid & Base & Region of marked & \multicolumn{1}{c|}{Suitable indicator} \\ \hline  & & & pH change & & methyl orange \\  & & & & screened methyl orange \\ strong acid - strong base & HC/(aq) & NaOH(aq) & 4 - 10 & thymol blue \\  & & & & thymolphthalein \\  & & & & phenolphthalein \\ \hline strong acid - weak base & HC/(aq) & NH\({}_{3}\)(aq) & 3.5 - 6.5 & methyl orange \\  & & & & screened methyl orange \\ \hline weak acid - strong base & CH\({}_{3}\)COOH(aq) & NaOH(aq) & 7.5 - 10.5 & thymolphthalein \\  & & & & phenolphthalein \\ \hline weak acid - weak base & CH\({}_{3}\)COOH(aq) & NH\({}_{3}\)(aq) & no marked change & no suitable indicator \\ \hline \end{tabular}

**13.3**: Acid-base indicators
* Acid-base indicators such as thymolphthalein and methyl orange are substances which change colour according to the hydrogen ion concentration of the solution to which they are added. Consequently, they are used to test for acidity and alkalinity. They are also used to detect the end point in acid-base titrations.
* Acid-base indicators are usually weak acids or weak bases. When dissolved in water, they dissociate slightly forming ions.

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:38]

* The pH ranges of selected indicators are shown in the table below: 

### (c) The pH at the end-point of a titration

For the titration experiment described in **(b)**, the end-point of the titration is reached when the indicator used gives a distinct colour change, i.e. from colour A to a colour that results from the combination of colour A and colour B.

This end-point is reached when the indicator colour observed is a combination of the two extreme colours and this occurs when: 

* Hence at the end-point of the titration, \(\mathbf{pH=pK_{in}}\) The pH at the end-point is generally the centre of the pH range of the indicator used.
* **Note:** The end-point is a property of the indicator and does not necessarily show that the reaction between acid and base is complete.

### (d) Choice of indicators

Essential characteristics of a suitable indicator: 

The colour change of the indicator must occur when the correct volume of titrant is added from the burette, i.e. the pH range over which the colour change takes place must be such as to indicate when the reaction (as shown by the equation) is complete.

The indicator must give a sharp end-point in the titration, i.e. it must change colour distinctly upon the addition of one drop of the titrant from the burette.

The choice of an indicator for an acid-base titration depends on the

type of titration carried out and

pH range of the indicator

The ideal situation would be to choose an indicator such that the end-point of the titration coincides exactly with the equivalence point of the titration. This occurs if the chosen indicator has a pK\({}_{\text{in}}\) value which is identical to the pH of the resulting solution at the equivalence point. In other words,

A suitable indicator is one where its pH range coincides with the region of rapid pH change in the titration curve (i.e. the pH range of the indicator must fall on the vertical portion of the titration curve).

### Titration curve of a weak acid-strong base titration

The graph below shows the change in pH of the reaction mixture when 0.100 mol dm\({}^{-3}\) of NaOH was added to 25.0 cm\({}^{3}\) of 0.100 mol dm\({}^{-3}\)CH\({}_{3}\)COOH (\(K_{a}\) of CH\({}_{3}\)COOH = 1.8 x 10\({}^{-5}\) mol dm\({}^{-3}\)):

1. The initial pH is not very low (1! pH!???) since a weak acid is used. (pH may be calculated using the formula [H^+}? = \sqrt{K_{a}C_{0}}\).
2. Change in pH is fairly constant due to the formation of an effective buffer when large amounts of the weak acid and its salt are present. _pH at? equiv pt (M)_ (where [HA]=[A^-]) = pK_s
3. The region of rapid pH change is shorter and occurs at a higher pH range than that for a SA-SB titration. At equivalence point E, * CH\({}_{3}\)COOH is exactly neutralised by NaOH * The resultant solution is CH\({}_{3}\)COO\({}^{-}\)Na\({}^{+}\)(aq). * pH??? as CH\({}_{3}\)COO\({}^{-}\) hydrolyses in water to give OH\({}^{-}\).
4. After **E**, the base is in excess. The titration curve flattens out at a high alkaline pH value (e.g. pH 12.5) since the excess base present is a strong base.

**Calculation of pH at various parts of the titration curve:**

\begin{tabular}{|l|} \hline
**(i)**_Initial pH = pH of weak acid_ & **(iii) pH at half-equivalence point (point M)** \\ Solution is an aqueous solution of weak acid. & Half-equivalence point is the point at which half the volume of NaOH(aq) needed for neutralisation is added. \\ \(\{\text{H}^{+}\}=\sqrt{K_{a}C_{0}}=\sqrt{1.8\times 10^{-5}\times 0.100}\) & At this point, CH\({}_{3}\)COOH is half-neutralised. \\ \(\{\text{=}\,1.342\times 10^{-3}\text{ mol dm}^{-3}}\) & n(CH\({}_{3}\)COOH) = n(CH\({}_{3}\)COO\({}^{-}\)) \\ pH = -lg [H^+] & Hence, [CH\({}_{3}\)COOH] = [CH\({}_{3}\)COO\({}^{-}\)] \\ = -lg (1.342\times 10^{-3}) & pH = pK\({}_{a}\) + lg (1) = pK\({}_{a}\) + lg (1) = pK\({}_{a}\) = 4.74 \\ \(\{\text{=}\,2.87\times 10^{-3}\text{ }}\) & **(Note: pH at half-equivalence point = pK\({}_{a}\))** \\ \hline
**(ii)**_pH of mixture when 8.00 cm\({}^{3}\) of NaOH(aq) is added. (region 2)_ & **(iv) pH at equivalence point (point E)** \\ CH\({}_{3}\)COOH + OH\({}^{-}\) + CH\({}_{3}\)COO\({}^{-}\) + H\({}_{2}\)O & At equivalence point, the mixture present is a solution of CH\({}_{3}\)COO\({}^{-}\)Na\({}^{+}\). \\ n(CH\({}_{3}\)COO\({}^{-}\)) = n(OH\({}^{+}\)) = 0.008 x0.10 = 0.0008 mol & CH\({}_{3}\)COO

### Titration Curve of Weak Base = Strong Acid Reaction

The graph below shows the change in pH of the reaction mixture when 0.100 mol dm\({}^{-3}\) of HC/ was added to 25.0 cm\({}^{3}\) of 0.100 mol dm\({}^{-3}\) NH\({}_{3}\) (\(K_{b}\) of NH\({}_{3}\) = 1.74 x 10\({}^{-5}\) mol dm\({}^{-3}\)).

1. The initial pH is not very high (7 < pH + 13) since a weak base is used. _(pOH may be calculated using the formula [OH+] = \(\sqrt{K_{b}C_{\omega}}\)_.
2. Change in pH is fairly constant due to the formation of an effective buffer when large amounts of weak base and its salt are present. _pOH at % Equiv (pt M)_ (where [B]=[BH+] = pK\({}_{b}\)_)
3. The region of rapid pH change is shorter and occurs at lower pH range than that for a SA-SB titration. At equivalence point E, * NH\({}_{3}\) is exactly neutralised by HC/
* The resultant solution is NH+C/(aq).
* pH < 7 as NH\({}^{*}\) hydrolyses in water to give H\({}^{*}\).
4. After E, the acid is in excess. The titration curve flattens out at a low acidic pH value since the excess acid present is a strong acid.

[FIGURE:S4.F1][EN* 4.5 Titration Curve of Weak Acid = Weak Base Reaction The graph below shows the change in pH of the reaction mixture when 0.100 mol dm\({}^{-3}\) of NH\({}_{3}\) was added to 25.0 cm\({}^{3}\) of 0.100 mol dm\({}^{-3}\) CH\({}_{3}\)COOH:

* Since the acid is weak, the starting pH is a fairly high value.
* There is no straight, vertical section on the graph. This shows that the change in pH at the equivalence point is not as sharp as any of the previous titrations.
* pH at E \(<\) 7, if \(K_{\text{a}}\) of WA \(>K_{\text{b}}\) of WB
* pH at E \(>\) 7, if \(K_{\text{a}}\) of WA \(<K_{\text{b}}\) of WB
* Soon after the equivalence point **E** has been passed, the titration curve flattens out at a fairly low alkaline pH value since the excess base present is a weak base.

* Sodium carbonate is a diacidic base.

* The figure on the right shows how the pH changes during the titration of 25.0 cm\({}^{3}\) of 0.10 mol dm\({}^{-3}\) Na\({}_{2}\)CO\({}_{3}\)(aq) with 0.10 mol dm\({}^{-3}\) HC/(aq). There are two equivalence points in the titration curve.
* The reaction of Na\({}_{2}\)CO\({}_{3}\)(aq) with HC/(aq) can be represented in two stages:

* If thymolphthalein is used as the indicator, it changes colour from blue to colourless when reaction (a) is completed, i.e. when Na\({}_{2}\)CO\({}_{3}\) is only half-neutralised to form NaHCO\({}_{3}\).
* If methyl orange is used as the indicator, it changes colour from yellow to orange when reaction (b) is completed, i.e. when Na\({}_{2}\)CO\({}_{3}\) is completely neutralised to give CO\({}_{2}\) and H\({}_{2}\)O.

* From the stoichiometry of the two reactions, it can be seen that

* if volume of HCI required for reaction (a) = x cm\({}^{3}\),
* then volume of HCI required for reaction (b) = x cm\({}^{3}\) and
* volume of HCI required when using thymolphthalein as indicator = x cm\({}^{3}\)
* volume of HCI required when using methyl orange as indicator = 2x cm\({}^{3}\)
* The **double indicator method** makes use of this two-stage titration to estimate the Na\({}_{2}\)CO\({}_{3}\) in a mixture of Na\({}_{2}\)CO\({}_{3}\) and NaOH or
* a mixture of Na\({}_{2}\)CO\({}_{3}\) and NaHCO\({}_{3}\)

### Titration curve of a polyprotic acid-strong base titration

* Phosphoric acid, H\({}_{3}\)PO\({}_{4}\), is a triprotic acid.

* The following three equations represent the step-wise reactions of H\({}_{3}\)PO\({}_{4}\) with NaOH.

* H\({}_{3}\)PO\({}_{4}\)(aq) + OH\({}^{*}\)(aq) \(\longrightarrow\) H\({}_{2}\)PO\({}_{4}\)(aq) + H\({}_{2}\)O(l) (1) \(\longrightarrow\) H\({}_{2}\)PO\({}_{4}\)(aq) + H\({}_{2}\)O(l) (2) \(\longrightarrow\) H\({}_{2}\)PO\({}_{4}\)(aq) + H\({}^{*}\)(aq) \(\longrightarrow\) PO\({}_{4}\)\({}^{3}\)(aq) + H\({}_{2}\)O(l) (3) \(\longrightarrow\).
* When a solution of phosphoric acid is titrated against sodium hydroxide, the titration curve shows three equivalence points corresponding to the completion of each of the above reactions:
