**Gewfactional Force/1**

**In 1687, Newton proposed in his** _Philosophian Naturalis Principia Mathematica_ **that every mass attracts another mass with a force of gravity. According to him, two seemingly unrelated phenomena - the fall of an apple from an apple tree and the orbital motion of the planets around the Sun - are due to the same reason: gravitational attraction. He came up with the Newton's Law of Gravitation. This law is universally valid and applies to any planets in the solar system and even between distant galaxies.**

**Newton's Law of Gravitation**

**Newton's Law of Gravitation**

**that is directly proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them.**

**The magnitude of the gravitational force** \(F\) **between two particles of masses** \(M\) **and** \(m\) **which are separated by a distance** \(r\) **is given by**

**where** \(G\) **is the gravitational constant with a value of** \(6.67\times 10^{-11}\) **N m**\({}^{2}\) **kg**\({}^{-2}\)**.**

**Note:**

**Newton's law of gravitation is an example of an inverse square law because** **the magnitude of the force varies inversely with the square of the separation of the particles.**

**Gravitational force is attractive in nature and some books indicate this with a negative sign in the formula**

**Example 7.1**: A man of mass 85.0 kg is standing on the surface of the Earth. Given that the Earth has a mass of \(5.98\times 10^{24}\) kg and a radius of \(6.37\times 10^{6}\) m, calculate the force that the Earth exerts on the man. Deduce the force that the man exerts on Earth.

\(F=\frac{GM_{e}m}{r_{e}^{2}}\)\((6.67\times 10^{-11})\times(5.98\times 10^{24})\times(65.0)\)

\((6.37\times 10^{6})^{2}\)

By Newton's third law, the force that the man exerts on the Earth is equal in magnitude to the force that the Earth exerts on the man, but in the opposite direction.

**Note:**

Due the mass of the Earth, we do not expect to see the Earth move:

\(F_{\text{man on Earth}}=-F_{\text{Earth on man}}\Rightarrow m_{\text{Earth}}a _{\text{Earth}}=-m_{\text{max}}a_{\text{mean}}\Rightarrow a_{\text{Earth}}=- \frac{m_{\text{max}}}{m_{\text{Earth}}}\,a_{\text{mean}}\approx 0\)

The gravitational potential at a point in a gravitational field is defined as the work done potential

per unit mass by an external force in bringing a small test mass from infinity to that point.

At a distance \(r\) from a point mass \(M\), \(U=-\dfrac{GMm}{r}\), therefore

where the mass \(m\) of the small test mass cancels out.

Raffles to the direction of displacement of the mass. (We can imagine the external force supporting the mass as it is being lowered towards the Earth.)

This results in negative work done by the external force.

Hence, based on its definition, gravitational potential (or potential energy) has a negative value.

**Note:**

Gravitational potential is a scalar quantity.

The negative sign is not an indication of direction and it cannot be omitted.

The gravitational potential at a point due to two or more masses can be found by adding of the potentials at that point due to each of the mass.

Gravitational field strength is numerically equal to the potential gradient.

The negative sign indicates that the field strength points in the direction of decreasing potential.

## 7.4 Background

Have you ever wondered if it is possible to throw an object into the air at such a high velocity that it will never fall back to Earth? This is actually plausible because the acceleration of free fall does not stay at 9.81 m s\({}^{-2}\) but decreases as the object moves away from the Earth. If this is possible, what is the value of this "escape velocity"? The solution to this problem is simple if we consider the energy of the object.

How much energy does an object of mass \(m\) need in order to escape from the Earth's gravitational influence and reach infinity? At infinity, its GPE is defined as zero. If the object has sufficient energy to _just_ reach infinity, its KE at infinity is zero. So the total energy at infinity is given by \(E_{\rm T}=E_{\rm P}+E_{\rm K}=0\).

From the principle of conservation of energy, the total energy of an object should remain unchanged throughout its motion. This means that any object with a total energy zero will be able to _just_ reach infinity and _stop_ there.

Consider an object (e.g. a rocket) of mass \(m\) being projected with a velocity \(\nu\) from the surface of the Earth. Its initial GPE and KE are:

\[U=-\frac{GMm}{R}\mbox{ and }{\rm KE}=\frac{1}{2}mv^{2}\]

Therefore, minimum energy to reach infinity is such that

\[\begin{array}{c}\mbox{Total energy }=-\frac{GMm}{R}+\frac{1}{2}mv^{2}=0\\ \mbox{\Large$\nu$}=\sqrt{\frac{2GM}{R}}=\sqrt{2gR}\\ \mbox{\Large$\nu$}=\sqrt{\frac{2GM}{R}}=\sqrt{2gR}\\ \mbox{\Large$\frac{(\nu^{\prime})}{(\nu^{\prime})}$}\end{array}\]

Note:

* The escape velocity is independent of the mass of the object
* The escape velocity for Earth is 11.2 km s\({}^{-1}\).

Example 7.8: A spacecraft of mass 5000 kg propels itself from the surface of the Earth of mass 5.98 \(\times\) 10\({}^{24}\) kg and radius 6.37 \(\times\) 10\({}^{6}\) m. If Calculate the minimum escape speed.

Solution

\[\begin{array}{ll}\nu\geq\sqrt{\frac{2GM}{R}}&\nu\geq\sqrt{2gR}\\ =\sqrt{\frac{2\times\left(6.67\times 10^{-11}\right)\times\left(5.98\times 10^{24 }\right)}{6.37\times 10^{6}}}&\mbox{OR}&=\sqrt{2\times 9.81\times\left(6.37\times 10^{6 }\right)}\\ =1.12\times 10^{4}\mbox{ m s${}^{-1}$}&=1.12\times 10^{4}\mbox{ m s${}^{-1}$}\end{array}\]

**Example 7.13**: **[N99/III/2]**

A satellite of mass 2400 kg is placed in a geostationary orbit at a distance of \(4.23\times 10^{7}\) m from the centre of the Earth.

**(a)** Calculate

1. the angular velocity of the satellite,

2. the speed of the satellite,

3. the acceleration of the satellite,

4. the force of attraction between the Earth and the satellite,

5. the mass of the Earth.

**(b)** Explain why a geostationary satellite

4. must be placed vertically above the equator,

2. must move from west to east.

**(c)** Why are such satellites often used for telecommunications?

Solutions

(a) 1. \(\omega=\dfrac{2\pi}{T}\)

\[=\dfrac{2\pi}{24\times 60\times 60}\] \[=7.27\times 10^{-5}\text{ rad s}^{-1}\] \[2. \nu=to\] \[=4.23\times 10^{7}\times 7.27\times 10^{-5}\] \[=3.08\times 10^{3}\text{ m s}^{-1}\] \[3. \theta=\dfrac{\nu^{2}}{r}\] \[=\dfrac{(3.08\times 10^{3})^{2}}{4.23\times 10^{7}}\] \[=0.224\text{ m s}^{-2}\] \[4. \ F=\dfrac{GMm}{r^{2}}\] \[=ma\] \[=2400\times 0.224\] \[=538\text{ N}\] \[5. 538=\dfrac{GMm}{r^{2}}\] \[M=\dfrac{538\times(4.23\times 10^{7})^{2}}{6.11\times 10^{-11}\times 2400}\] \[=6.56\times 10^{24}\text{ kg}\] (b) 1. Since the centripetal force on the satellite is directed towards the centre of the Earth, any circular orbit must have its centre at the centre of the Earth. If the orbit is not on the equator, the satellite must sometimes be over the northern hemisphere and sometimes over the southern hemisphere, and so cannot be geostationary.
2. For a satellite to stay above a fixed point, it must have the same direction of rotation as the Earth about its axis of rotation, ie from west to east.

**(c)** The earthbound transmitters and receivers can be aimed in a fixed direction, with no disruption to the signals.

Consider a point P located within a solid sphere a distance \(r\) from the centre of the sphere. We will prove that the "effective mass" consists of only the mass enclosed by shaded sphere within dotted sphere of radius \(r\). The approach is to prove that the rest of the mass (the unshaded portion) cancels out each other's gravitational effect such that their net force on any mass placed at P is zero.

First, consider a thin spherical shell of thickness \(L\). P experiences the gravitational field from every portion of the shell. Two pieces of mass A and B are located on the opposite sides of P as shown. If the angle they subtend at P is \(\theta\), then their areas (considering a square of sides = arc length, \(r\theta\) ) are given by \((r_{A}\theta)^{2}\) and \((r_{B}\theta)^{2}\) respectively. So their masses will be \((r_{A}\theta)^{2}L\rho\) and \((r_{B}\theta)^{2}L\rho\) respectively, where \(\rho\) is the density of the sphere. Hence, their gravitational field strength at P will be \(\underset{\theta}{G(r_{A}\theta)^{2}L\rho}\) and \(\underset{\theta}{G(r_{B}\theta)^{2}L\rho}\) respectively.

In both cases the \(r\)'s cancel away and we get \(\mathcal{G}\theta^{2}L\rho\)for both. So the gravitational field strengths of A and B are equal in magnitude at P. It is also obvious that they are opposite in direction since A and B are on opposite sides of P. So the resultant field at P due to A and B is zero. Apply this argument to every direction around P, we find that the resultant field due to the whole spherical shell is zero.

A solid sphere can be imagined to be made up of layers of spherical shells. If every shell with radius > \(r\) produces zero resultant field at P then clearly their combined effect is still zero. So the effective mass is only those within the dotted shaded sphere.
