# mechanism of cross pollination

###### Abstract

Inset-pollination insect such as bees and butterfly enters the flower for the nectar, pollen grains from the anthers stick onto the insect. When they visit other flowers, the will be transferred to the next flower sticky stigma.

## 1 Insect-pollination

Insect such as bees and butterfly enters the flower for the nectar, pollen grains from the anthers stick onto the insect. When they visit other flowers, the will be transferred to the next flower sticky stigma.

## 2 Wind-pollination

Wind-pollinated flowers have their pollen carried away by the wind when the exposed anthers shake in the wind. The pollen grains may come into contact with large feathery stigmas of another flower, they would be trapped.

**fertilisation in plants**

* **Fertilisation: The fusion of nuclei of the male gamete (pollen) and the female gamete (ovule).**

* After pollination, the pollen grains germinate in response to the **sugary fluid secreted by stigma.**
* A **pollen tube** grows out from each pollen grain. The cytoplasm and **the two nuclei** of the pollen grain, namely generative nucleus and pollen tube nucleus, pass into the pollen tube
* Pollen tube secretes enzymes to digest the surrounding tissue of the stigma and style.
* The **generative nucleus** divides to form **two male gametes.**
* The pollen tube **enters the ovule in the ovary** through the micropyle.
* Within the ovule, the tip of the pollen tubes **absorbs sap and bursts**, releasing the two male gametes.
* One male gamete **fuses** with the ovum to form the **zygote**, while the other male gamete fuses with the definitive nucleus to form the endosperm nucleus
* The **ovule** will develop into a **seed** and the **ovary** will develop into a **fruit**.
