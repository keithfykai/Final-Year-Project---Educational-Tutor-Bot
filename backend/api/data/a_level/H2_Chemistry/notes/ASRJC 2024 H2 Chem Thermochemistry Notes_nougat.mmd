## 1 Introduction

* What is enthalpy change?
* What is an exothermic reaction and an endothermic reaction?

**Thermodynamics** is the study of the interaction between matter and energy. It considers both the energy change and flow of energy from one substance to another. This is used to predict the behaviours of chemical systems - to determine whether or not a change is possible.

Chemical energy of a matter is made up of kinetic and potential energy.

_How do particles in a matter possess kinetic energy (K.E.)?_

_K.E. is the energy of motion arising from rotations, vibrations and translational movements of particles. The temperature of a system is a measure of the average kinetic energy of that system._

_How do particles in a matter possess potential energy (P.E.)?_

_P.E. is the energy that particles store within the electrostatic attractions or repulsions that they experience with one another._

According to the First Law of Thermodynamics, energy can neither be created nor destroyed; it can only be transferred. The ways to change K.E. and P.E. from one form to another are through heat or work.

Most chemical reactions or phase changes are accompanied by the absorption or release of heat. **Therochemistry** is thus the study of heat energy changes that occur during these changes.

### System and Surrounding

To study heat energy changes, we focus on a particular part of the universe, which we call the'system'. Everything else that can exchange energy with the system is called the'surrounding'.

For a chemical reaction, at the start the system is the reactants, and at the end the system is the products.

* For a neutralisation reaction between aqueous NaOH and aqueous HC_I_:

\begin{tabular}{l l} system & NaOH(aq) + HC_I_(aq) - Na_Cl_(aq) + H_\({}_{2}\)O_(_I_) \\ surrounding & everything else, including the solution, beaker, air, etc. \\ \end{tabular}

### Heat transfer

Heat is the energy that flows into or out of a system due to a difference in temperature between the system and its surroundings. When a system and its surroundings are in thermal contact, energy flows from the region of higher temperature to the one of lower temperature, until they reach the same temperature (thermal equilibrium).

### Enthalpy and Enthalpy Change

#### Enthalpy, \(H\)

* The **energy content** of a substance under constant pressure.
* The energy content includes the kinetic energy of the particles in the substance and the potential energy stored in the arrangements of the particles in the substance.
* Enthalpy of a substance reflects its stability. A substance with higher enthalpy has higher energy and is thus less stable.

_For your info: Why is a substance with higher energy content less stable?_

_Energy content is in the form of K.E. and P.E. If the particles have high K.E., they are moving faster and thus there are minimal attractive forces to keep them bonded. Similarly, if the particles have high P.E., they are further apart from one another with weak attractive forces. As a result, the substance is unstable._

#### Enthalpy Change, \(\Delta\)_H_:

* **Enthalpy change of reaction** (\(\Delta\)_H_\({}_{\textit{cm}}\)) is the **energy change** in a chemical reaction when the molar quantities of reactants specified in the chemical equation react to form products.

\[\Delta\)_H_\({}_{\textit{cm}}=\Sigma\)_H_\({}_{\textit{pds}}\)_-_\(\Sigma\)_H_\({}_{\textit{rds}}\)_where_ \(\Delta\)_H_\({}_{\textit{cm}}=\) _enthalpy change of reaction_ \(\Sigma\)_H_\({}_{\textit{pds}}=\) _sum of enthalpies of products_ \(\Sigma\)_H_\({}_{\textit{rds}}=\) _sum of enthalpies of reactants_ \(\Delta\)_H_\({}_{\textit{rds}}\)_:_ kJ mol_-1_

_All_ \(\Delta\)_H_ have accompanying signs, + or -, that indicate the direction of heat flow into or out of the system respectively._

### Endothermic and Exothermic Reactions

In a chemical reaction, bonds in reactants are broken and bonds in products are formed.

The breaking of bonds requires energy and is an endothermic process. The formation of bonds evolves energy and is an exothermic process.

The difference between quantities of heat needed to break the bonds of the reactants and that evolved during the formation of new bonds in the products give rise to the enthalpy change of a reaction.

### Standard Conditions and Standard States

* Standard Conditions

To compare energy changes, conditions under which the reaction was performed must be specified. Hence standard conditions for enthalpy changes refer to the following

* (a) Pressure: **1 bar** (\(10^{5}\) Pa)
* (b) Temperature: **298 K**
* (c) Concentration: **1 mol dm-3** (if solutions are used)

An enthalpy change stated under **standard conditions** is hence called **standard enthalpy change**, denoted by the symbol, \(\Delta H^{\text{\textregistered}}\). The \({}^{\text{\textregistered}}\) indicates that \(\Delta H\) was measured and calculated under standard conditions.

Note: Reactions need not take place under standard conditions. In this case, when quoting the enthalpy changes, temperature and pressure will be stated.

* Standard States

Under standard conditions, substances are in their standard states. **The standard state of a substance is its most stable form under standard conditions.**

Elements in their standard states under standard conditions are assigned **zero enthalpy**.

E.g. H\({}_{2}\)(g), O\({}_{2}\)(g), C(s), Na(s).

Note: If an element exists in more than one form under standard conditions, the most stable form of the element is usually used. For example, graphite (not diamond) is the standard state for carbon.

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:7]

### Standard Enthalpy Change of Formation, \(\Delta H^{\circ}\)

The amount of heat **absorbed or evolved** when **one mole** of a substance is formed from its **constituent elements**, all in their standard states at **298 K and 1 bar**.

E.g. Standard enthalpy change of formation of ethanol: 2C(s) + 3H2(g) + %O2(g) - C2H5OH(_l_) \(\Delta H^{\circ}\) = -298 kJ mol\({}^{-1}\) Standard enthalpy change of formation of water: H2(g) + %O2(g) - H2O(_l_) \(\Delta H^{\circ}\) = -286 kJ mol\({}^{-1}\)

* Enthalpy changes of formation are often theoretical. Such reactions may not take place in practice. E.g. C2H5OH cannot be formed by just mixing C, H2 and O2.
* Such enthalpy changes of formation are usually calculated indirectly from other enthalpy changes of reaction.
* **The enthalpy change of formation of elements in their standard states, at 298 K and 1 bar, is by definition zero.** E.g. \(\Delta H^{\circ}\) of H2(g) = 0, \(\Delta H^{\circ}\) of He(g) = 0, \(\Delta H^{\circ}\) of Na(s) and \(\Delta H^{\circ}\) of Br2(g) = 0
* \(\Delta H^{\circ}\) is a measure of the energetic stability of the substance relative to their constituent elements.
* **Positive**\(\Delta H^{\circ}\) implies that the substance is **stable relative to its constituent elements.** Hence, more likely for decomposition of the substance to its constituent elements.
* **Negative**\(\Delta H^{\circ}\) implies that the substance is **stable relative to its constituent elements**. Hence, less likely for decomposition of the substance to its constituent elements.
* \(\Sigma\Delta H_{t}\)(reactants)

_Refer to page 33 for the derivation and application of the equation._
Example 2.2.1

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|} \hline Compound & HF & HC\(I\) & HBr & HI \\ \hline \(\Delta H/\) kJ mol\({}^{-1}\) & - 271.1 & - 92.3 & - 36.2 & + 26.5 \\ \hline \end{tabular}

Comment on the stability of the hydrogen halides from HF to HI.

Solution:

Energy

\(\Delta H\) of the hydrogen halides become **less exothermic**

This implies that the hydrogen halides become **less stable** down the group (Group 17).

### Standard Enthalpy Change of Combustion, \(\Delta H_{\text{c}}\)\({}^{\text{o}}\)

The amount of heat **evolved** when **one mole** of a substance in its standard state is **completely burned** in excess oxygen under standard conditions of **298 K and 1 bar**.

E.g. Standard enthalpy change of combustion of methane:

CH\({}_{4}\)(g) + 2O\({}_{2}\)(g) \(\xrightarrow{}\) CO\({}_{2}\)(g) + 2H\({}_{2}\)O(\(I\)) & \(\Delta H_{\text{c}}\)\({}^{\text{o}}\) = - 802 kJ mol\({}^{-1}\)

Standard enthalpy change of combustion of methanol:

CH\({}_{3}\)OH(\(I\)) + \(\dfrac{3}{2}\) O\({}_{2}\)(g) \(\xrightarrow{}\) CO\({}_{2}\)(g) + 2H\({}_{2}\)O(\(I\)) & \(\Delta H_{\text{c}}\)\({}^{\text{o}}\) = - 726 kJ mol\({}^{-1}\)

\(\Delta H_{\text{c}}\) is **always negative (exothermic)** as heat is always evolved in the combustion.

\(\Delta H_{\text{c}}\)\({}^{\text{o}}\) can be used to identify substances with large \(\Delta H_{\text{c}}\)\({}^{\text{o}}\) as sources of fuel, and to determine calorific value of foodstuff e.g. fats and calculation of enthalpy change of reaction and formation.

Incidentally,

C (s) + O\({}_{2}\) (g) \(\xrightarrow{}\) CO\({}_{2}\)(g) \(\xrightarrow{}\) H\({}_{2}\)(g) + \(\forall\) O\({}_{2}\) (g) \(\xrightarrow{}\) H\({}_{2}\)O(\(I\))

\(\Delta H^{\text{o}}\) of CO\({}_{2}\) = \(\Delta H_{\text{c}}\)\({}^{\text{o}}\) of C

\(\Delta H^{\text{o}}\) of H\({}_{2}\)O = \(\Delta H_{\text{c}}\)\({}^{\text{o}}\) of H\({}_{2}\)

For any chemical reaction,

e.g. A + B \(\xrightarrow{}\) C +D \(\Delta H_{\text{c}}\)

the \(\Delta H_{\text{c}}\) can be determined if the \(\Delta H_{\text{c}}\) of A, B, C and D are known, using the following general equation

\[\boxed{\Delta H_{\text{r}}=\underline{\Sigma\Delta H_{\text{c}}\,(\text{reactants})- \Sigma\Delta H_{\text{c}}\,(\text{products})}}\]

_Refer to page 31 for the derivation and application of the equation._

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:10]

### Standard Enthalpy Change of Atomisation, \(\Delta H_{\rm at}\)o

(a)\(\Delta H_{\rm at}\)o of an Element

The amount of heat **absorbed** when **one mole** of free gaseous atoms** is formed from its element under standard conditions of **298 K and 1 bar**.

E.g. Standard enthalpy change of atomisation of sodium: Na(s) Na(g) \(\Delta H_{\rm at}\)o(Na) = +108.4 kJ mol-1 Standard enthalpy change of atomisation of chlorine: \(\gamma_{2}Cl_{2}\)(g) C(g) \(\Delta H_{\rm at}\)o(C\(l_{2}\)) = +122 kJ mol-1

* Enthalpy changes of atomisation are **always positive (endothermic)**, because energy must be absorbed to pull the atoms far apart and break all the bonds between them.
* Enthalpy changes of atomisation of the noble gases = 0 kJ mol-1 Reason: Elements are already in the form of free gaseous atoms under standard conditions.
* Enthalpy change of atomisation is **NOT** always the same as the enthalpy change of vaporisation. Atomisation (I atoms formed) : \(\gamma_{2}\)I(s) I(g) \(\Delta H^{\rm F}\) = +107 kJ mol-1 Vaporisation (I\({}_{2}\) molecules remained) : I\({}_{2}\)(\(l\)) I\({}_{2}\)(g) \(\Delta H^{\rm F}\) = +42 kJ mol-1 In the **atomisation of I\({}_{2}\)**, I\({}_{2}\) molecules are no longer present as I-I covalent bonds are broken to form **I atoms**.
* However in **vaporisation of I\({}_{2}\)**, I\({}_{2}\) molecules are still present**. Only the instantaneous dipole-induced dipole attraction is weakened which results in the I\({}_{2}\) molecules being further apart from each other.

(b)\(\Delta H_{\rm at}\)o of a Compound

The amount of heat **absorbed** when **one mole of compound** in its standard state is broken into **gaseous atoms** of its **constituent elements** under standard conditions of **298 K and 1 bar**.

E.g. Standard enthalpy change of atomisation of ethanoic acid: CH\({}_{3}\)CO\({}_{2}\)H(\(l\)) 2C(g) + 4H(g) + 2O(g) \(\Delta H_{\rm at}\)o(CH\({}_{3}\)CO\({}_{2}\)H) Standard enthalpy change of atomisation of ammonium nitrate: NH\({}_{4}\)NO\({}_{3}\)(s) 2N(g) + 4H(g) + 3O(g) \(\Delta H_{\rm at}\)o(NH\({}_{4}\)NO\({}_{3}\))

### Bond Energy

\begin{tabular}{|l|} \hline Bond energy of a covalent bond is the **average** amount of heat **absorbed** to break **one** mole of the **covalent bond** in **gaseous state.** \\ \hline E.g. & Bond energy of C\(I\)-C\(I\) bond: \\  & C\(I_{2}\)(g) \(\qquad\) 2C\(I\)(g) \(\qquad\) BE(C\(I\)-C\(I\)) = +244 kJ mol\({}^{-1}\) \\  & Bond energy of H-F bond: \\  & HF(g) \(\qquad\) H(g) + F(g) \(\qquad\) BE(H-F) = +570 kJ mol\({}^{-1}\) \\ \hline \end{tabular}

* In the _Data Booklet_, most bond energy values are provided but not accompanied by signs.
* Bond energies are **always positive (endothermic)** because energy is required to break covalent bonds. Conversely, the same amount of energy is given off (exothermic) when one mole of the covalent bonds is formed in the reverse process.
* Bond energy only applies for **covalent** molecules and is an indication of bond strength. The stronger the covalent bond, the larger the bond energy. _Refer to Chemical Bonding lecture notes for the factors affecting the strength of covalent bond._
* For polyatomic molecules with identical bonds, the bond dissociation energy of individual bonds varies. 

* All the bond dissociation energies have different values since the electronic environment of the bond within the different species (CH\({}_{4}\), CH\({}_{3}\), CH\({}_{2}\), CH) is different.
* The average bond energy BE(C-H) in CH\({}_{4}\) is calculated from the energy required to break all the bonds homolytically. 

* This value (+416) is different from the value in the _Data Booklet_ (+410) since the value in the _Data Booklet_ is determined by considering the C-H bond dissociation energies in various molecules.
* **Important!!** The bond energy of a particular type of covalent bond as given in the _Data Booklet_ is the **average bond dissociation energies** of that particular bond for all types of molecules.

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:13]

Relationship between BE and enthalpy change of atomisation of diatomic gases:

\begin{tabular}{l l l} C\(l\)-C\(l\)(g) & 2CI(g) & BE(C\(l\)-C\(l\)) = +244 kJ mol\({}^{-1}\) \\ \(\%\) C\(l_{2}\)(g) & \(\cdot\) & \(\cdot\) \\ Hence, BE(C\(l_{2}\)) & \(\underline{2}\) x \(\Delta H_{\text{at}}\)(C\(l_{2}\)) & \\ \end{tabular}

Therefore, for **diatomic gases**, X\({}_{2}\), **BE(X\({}_{2}\)) = 2 \(\Delta H_{\text{at}}\)(X\({}_{2}\))

Note:

BE(X\({}_{2}\)) will not be twice of \(\Delta H_{\text{at}}\)(X\({}_{2}\)) if X\({}_{2}\) is not a gas under standard conditions.

For example:

Bromine is a liquid at standard conditions.

\begin{tabular}{l l l} Br-Br(g) & 2Br(g) & BE(Br-Br) = +193 kJ mol\({}^{-1}\) \\ \(\gamma_{2}\)Br\({}_{2}\)(\(l\)) & Br(g) & \(\Delta H_{\text{at}}\)(Br\({}_{2}\)) = +112 kJ mol\({}^{-1}\) \\ Hence, BE(Br\({}_{2}\)) is not equal to 2 x \(\Delta H_{\text{at}}\)(Br\({}_{2}\)) & \\ \end{tabular}

By Hess' law,

\(\Delta H_{\text{at}}\)(Br\({}_{2}\)) = \(\Delta H_{\text{xopisation}}\)(H\({}_{2}\)) + \(\gamma_{2}\) BE(Br-Br)

_You will be able to appreciate the energy cycle diagram after Part 5 (Hess' law) is covered._

## 3 Experimental method to determine enthalpy change

How can we measure the heat change in a chemical or physical process?

### Calorimeter

* The enthalpy change of a reaction can be determined by measuring the heat given out or taken in during the reaction. A calorimeter is an apparatus designed to measure such heat change. A simple calorimeter can be constructed using poor thermal conductor such as a polystyrene cup.
* For an exothermic reaction, assuming that there is no loss of heat to the air (surrounding), the heat evolved from the system (the chemical reaction) increases the temperature of the solution (surrounding) in the cup. Hence, the heat change of a reaction can be determined by measuring the rise in the temperature of solution.
* Similarly, for an endothermic reaction, assuming that there is no gain of heat from the air (surrounding), the heat absorbed by the system (the chemical reaction) decreases the temperature of the solution (surrounding) in the cup. Hence, the heat change of a reaction can be determined by measuring the fall in the temperature of solution.

Using the equation below:

Heat evolved (or absorbed) from (or by) the system = heat gained (or loss) by the solution of the reaction mixture.

\[\textbf{Q = mc}\Delta\textbf{T = C}\Delta\textbf{T}\]

The enthalpy change of the reaction, \(\Delta H\), can be determined:

For an exothermic reaction:

\[\Delta H_{t}=-\frac{Q}{n} \Delta H_{t}=+\frac{Q}{n}\]Assumptions made in calculating the enthalpy change using the above equations:

* No other forms of heat loss to the air (or heat gain from the air) due to insulation (i.e. **100% efficient**)
* The cup does not absorb or lose heat (i.e. heat capacity of the cup is omitted).
* The density of the solution of the reaction mixture unless otherwise stated, approximates to that of water i.e. 1 g cm\({}^{-3}\).
* The specific heat capacity of the solution of the reaction mixture unless otherwise stated, approximates to that of water i.e. 4.18 J g\({}^{-1}\)K\({}^{-1}\).

Example 3.1.1

When 50 cm\({}^{3}\) of 1 mol dm\({}^{-3}\) of HC\(I\) were added to 100 cm\({}^{3}\) of 1 mol dm\({}^{-3}\) of NaOH in a plastic beaker, there was a temperature rise of 4.5 \({}^{\circ}\)C. Assuming it takes 4.18 J to raise the temperature of 1 g of solution by 1.0 \({}^{\circ}\)C, calculate the enthalpy change of neutralisation.

\[\begin{array}{l}\text{NaOH(aq)}+\text{HC}/\text{(aq)}\\ \end{array}\]

\[\begin{array}{l}\text{NaC}/\text{(aq)}+\text{H}_{2}\text{O}(l)\\ \end{array}\]

Solution

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|} \hline Steps & Working \\ \hline (1) Determine Q & Q = mc\(\Delta\)T \\  & = (50+100)(1.00) x 4.18 x 4.5 \\  & = 2821.5 J \\ \hline (2) Determine no of moles reagents added & n(HC\(I\)) added = \(\frac{50}{1000}\times 1\) = 0.05 mol \\  & n(NaOH) added = \(\frac{100}{1000}\times 1\) = 0.1 mol \\  & Since 0.05 mol HCl\(I\) reacts with 0.05 mol NaOH, NaOH is in excess and HC\(I\) is the limiting reagent. \\ \hline (3) Determine the enthalpy change of neutralisation & n(H\({}_{2}\)O) formed = n(HC\(I\)) reacted = 0.05 mol \\  & Recall definition (n = n(water)) \\  & Determine if the reaction is \\  & exothermic or endothermic and \\  & indicate it with the correct sign \\  & \(\Delta H_{\text{\emph{no}}}\)= - \(\frac{2821.5}{0.05}\) \\  & = - 56400 J mol\({}^{-1}\) \\  & = - 56.4 kJ mol\({}^{-1}\) \\ \hline \end{tabular}

_How do we know that the reaction is exothermic (i.e. \(\Delta H_{\text{\emph{no}}}\)= <0)?_

The increase in temperature of the solution (surrounding) indicates that the system (the neutralisation reaction) had released heat to the solution (surrounding).

### Temperature Correction

* A graphical method involving temperature correction can be used to account for heat loss to the surrounding or heat gain from the surrounding or slow response of the thermometer or reaction.
* An experiment is performed by measuring the temperature of the solution of the reaction mixture at regular time interval. A graph of temperature against time is plotted and extrapolation is performed to determine the maximum (or minimum) temperature at the time of mixing.
* The process of extrapolation looks like the following for an exothermic reaction and an endothermic reaction respectively:

Example 3.2.1

In an experiment to determine the enthalpy change of reaction between magnesium and hydrochloric acid, the following procedure was followed.

* The temperature of 40 cm\({}^{3}\) of 1 mol dm\({}^{-3}\) hydrochloric acid was recorded for 2.5 minutes.
* 0.25 g of magnesium powder was added to the acid at **3 minutes.**
* The temperature of the mixture was recorded at regular intervals from 3.5 minutes.

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:19]

### Experimental method to determine enthalpy change of combustion

The heat evolved from the combustion of a fuel can be used to heat up a known volume of water. Enthalpy change of combustion of the fuel can be determined by measuring the temperature rise of the water. Fuel used could be organic compound such as ethanol, propanol, octane, etc.

\[\text{fuel}(l)+\text{O}_{2}(\text{g})\quad\quad\quad\quad\text{CO}_{2}(\text{g})+ \text{H}_{2}\text{O}(l)\quad\quad\quad\quad\Delta H_{c}\]

The figure below shows a simple apparatus to measure the enthalpy change of combustion (\(\Delta H_{c}\)) of a liquid fuel.

Since the setup is not insulated, not all the heat released from the combustion process is absorbed by the water in the can.

Example 3.3.1: An experiment was conducted to determine the enthalpy change of combustion of ethanol. When 1.00 g of ethanol was burned under a container of water, it was found that 100 g of water was heated from 15 \({}^{\circ}\)C to 85 \({}^{\circ}\)C. Assuming the process is 80% efficient; calculate the enthalpy change of combustion of ethanol.

Solution

\begin{tabular}{|p{142.3pt}|p{142.3pt}|} \hline Steps & Working \\ \hline (1) & Determine Q, the heat absorbed by water \\ \hline (2) & Determine the heat released by combustion \\ \hline (3) & Determine no of mole of fuel combusted \\ \hline (4) & Determine the enthalpy change of combustion \\ \hline \end{tabular}

Note: efficiency of the process = total heat absorbed by water \(\times\)**100**%

total heat released from combustion

## 4 Entthalpy changes involving ionic compounds

What are some heat changes in a chemical or physical process?

### Ionisation Energy, IE

The first IE of an element is the energy absorbed to remove one mole of electrons from one mole of the gaseous atoms to form one mole of singly charged gaseous cations.

### Electron Affinity, EA

First EA

The amount of heat absorbed or evolved when 1 mole of electrons is added to one mole of gaseous atoms to form one mole of singly charged gaseous anions.

First electron affinity of oxygen:

O(g) + e\({}^{-}\) O\({}^{-}\)(g)

1\({}^{\mathrm{st}}\) EA = - 141 kJ mol\({}^{-1}\)

First EA is **mostly negative (exothermic)** as the energy released when the nucleus attracts an electron is larger than the energy taken in to overcome inter-electronic repulsion.

The stronger the affinity for the electron, the greater the amount of energy is given off in the formation of the anion and hence the more negative (exothermic) the EA is.

Second EA

The amount of heat **absorbed** when **1 mole of electrons** is added to **one mole of gaseous singly charged gaseous anions** to form **one mole of doubly charged gaseous anions**.

Second electron affinity of oxygen:

O\({}^{-}\)(g) + e\({}^{-}\) O\({}^{-}\)(g)

2\({}^{\mathrm{nd}}\) EA = + 790 kJ mol\({}^{-1}\)

Second EA is **always positive (endothermic)** because energy is required to overcome the electrostatic repulsion of the second electron by the single negative charge on the anion.

Note: 2\({}^{\mathrm{nd}}\) EA is **NOT** O(g) + 2e\({}^{-}\) O\({}^{2}\)(g)

This equation shows the sum of the 1\({}^{\mathrm{st}}\) and 2\({}^{\mathrm{nd}}\) EA

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:22]

Based on the ionic model, the magnitude of lattice energy is dependent on two factors:

* Charge of ion As **charge of ion increases**, (q_+ x q-) **increases*
* **electrostatic attraction*
* between the ions becomes **stronger*
* (strength of ionic bond increases)
* **lattice energy becomes more*
* Radius of ion As **size of ion increases**, **inter-ionic distance**, (r\({}^{+}\) + r), **increases*
* **electrostatic attraction*
* between the ions becomes **weaker*
* (strength of ionic bond decreases)
* **lattice energy becomes **less*
* **Example 4.3.1*
* Lattice energies (kJ mol\({}^{-1}\)) of some ionic solids are given below:
* **B**r\({}^{-}\) **C**_I_\({}^{-}\) **F**^- Na**+ -742 -771 -915
* -2414 -2489 -2883
* Why does the lattice energy become more exothermic along the series NaBr, NaC_I_ and NaF?
* Why is the lattice energy of MgBr**2*
* more exothermic than NaBr? Solution
* Along the series,
* q-, q- and r, are the same but **radius*
* of the anion **decreases*
* from Br\({}^{-}\) to F-. **Inter-ionic distance*
* between the Na\({}^{+}\) and halide anion **decreases**. **Electrostatic forces of attraction*
* between the Na\({}^{+}\) and halide anion becomes stronger.
* Lattice energy becomes more exothermic.
* has a **larger charge*
* and a **smaller cationic radius*
* than Na\({}^{+}\).
* **Inter-ionic distance*
* between Mg**2
* and Br\({}^{-}\) is shorter.
* **Electrostatic forces of attraction*
* between the Mg**2
* and Br\({}^{-}\) is **stronger**.
* Lattice energy becomes more exothermic.

### Standard Enthalpy Change of Hydration, \(\Delta H_{\rm hyd}\)\({}^{\rm o}\)

(a) Definition

The amount of heat **evolved** when **one mole** of free **gaseous ions** is **dissolved** in a **large amount of water** forming a solution at infinite dilution at **298 K and 1 bar**.

E.g. Standard enthalpy change of hydration of sodium ion: Na\({}^{+}\)(g) Na\({}^{+}\)(aq) \(\Delta H_{\rm hyd}\)\({}^{\rm o}\) = \(-\)406 kJ mol\({}^{-1}\) Standard enthalpy change of hydration of chloride ion: Cl\({}^{\prime}\)(g) \(\mathcal{C}l^{\prime}\)(aq) \(\Delta H_{\rm hyd}\)\({}^{\rm o}\) = \(-\)381 kJ mol\({}^{-1}\)

\(\Delta H_{\rm hyd}\)\({}^{\rm o}\) is **always negative (exothermic)**.

Reason: Heat is produced when **ion-dipole attractions** are formed between the ions and polar water molecules.

Diagram showing the positive and negative ends of the water dipoles orientated towards Cl\({}^{\prime}\) and Na\({}^{+}\) ions respectively

(b) Factors affecting the magnitude of \(\Delta H_{\rm hyd}\)\({}^{\rm o}\)

\(\Delta H_{\rm hyd}\)\({}^{\rm o}\) is a measure of the **strength of ion-dipole attraction**. The stronger the attraction, the more negative (exothermic) the \(\Delta H_{\rm hyd}\)\({}^{\rm o}\).

The magnitude of the hydration energy depends on the

(i) the charge of the ions

charge density of ion, q

(ii) the radius of the ions

A **higher charge** and **smaller ionic radius** (i.e. higher charge density) will lead to

\(\gamma\) stronger ion-dipole attractions between the ion and water molecules

Explain the trend of \(\Delta H_{\rm hyd}\)\({}^{\circ}\) among the cations and that of the anions.

Solution

\(\Delta H_{\rm hyd}\)\({}^{\circ}\) for cations from Na\({}^{*}\) to A\({}^{\beta*}\) become **more exothermic.**

Reason:

An **increase** in **ionic charge** and a **decrease** in the **ionic radius** from Na\({}^{+}\) to A\({}^{\beta*}\),

resulting in an increase in charge density of cations.

Hence, forming **stronger ion-dipole** attractions between cations and

\(\Delta H_{\rm hyd}\)\({}^{\circ}\) for anions from C\(I^{-}\) to \(\Gamma^{-}\) become **less exothermic**.

Reason:

An **increase** in the **ionic radius** from C\(I^{-}\) to \(\Gamma^{-}\),

resulting in a decrease in the charge density of anions.

Hence, forming **weaker ion-dipole** attractions between anions and water molecules.

### Standard Enthalpy Change of Solution, \(\Delta H_{\rm sol}\)\({}^{\circ}\)

Method 1: Energy Cycle

General steps in constructing an energy cycle

1. Write the balanced equation representing the enthalpy change of reaction that you are required to calculate. (Need to follow the definition and also include state symbols)
2. Write the balanced equations with state symbols that illustrate the other enthalpy changes that are given in the question.
3. Inspect the equations in step 2 for common species linked to the reactant or product in the equation in step 1.
4. Create an alternative pathway by linking the common species in the equations in step 1 and step 2.
5. Apply Hess' law to calculate the required enthalpy change of reaction.

To solve

Example 5.1.4

Phosphorus can react with chlorine to form phosphorous pentachloride and phosphorus trichloride. Some thermochemical data related to these elements and compounds are shown below:

Data:

Enthalpy change of formation of gaseous PC\(l_{3}\) = -315 kJ mol-1

Enthalpy change of formation of gaseous PC\(l_{5}\) = -408 kJ mol-1

Enthalpy change of atomisation of phosphorus = +314 kJ mol-1

**(a)**: By using the relevant data given above, construct a labeled energy level diagram to help to determine the average P-Cl bond energy in PC\(l_{3}\). [+332]
**(b)**: Calculate the enthalpy change for the reaction given below and hence obtain a second estimate of the mean bond energy of P-Cl. [+93; +169]

Solution:

(a) Energy / kJ mol-1

(b) \(\Delta\)H\({}_{\alpha n}\)\({}^{\phi}\) = \(\Delta\)H\({}^{+}\)(PC\(l_{3}\)) - \(\Delta\)H\({}^{+}\)(PC\(l_{3}\)) = -315 - (-408)

= **+93 kJ mol-1**

Let the bond energy of P-Cl bond in PC\(l_{5}\) be \(x\) kJ mol-1

\(\Delta\)H\({}_{\alpha n}\)\({}^{\phi}\) = **ZBE(bonds broken) - ZBE(bonds formed)**

+93 = 5x - [3 BE(P-Cl) + BE(C/-Cl)]

+93 = 5x - [3 (332) + 244]

\(x\) = **+169 kJ mol-1**

By Hess' law,

\[\begin{array}{ll}\Delta H^{\mathrm{eq}}&=\Delta H_{\mathrm{sat}}\)*(Na) + \(\Delta H_{\mathrm{sat}}\)*(Cl) + 1*1 IE(Na) + EA(Cl) + LE \\ LE &=\Delta H^{\mathrm{eq}}\) - [ \(\Delta H_{\mathrm{sat}}\)*(Na) + \(\Delta H_{\mathrm{sat}}\)*(Cl) + 1*1 IE(Na) + EA(Cl) ] \\ &=(-411) - [ 109 + 121 + 494 + (-364) ] \\ &=**-771 kJ mol\({}^{-1}\)**By Hess's law, -411 = +109 + 494 + 121 - 364 + LE LE = -771 kJ mol-1 OR By inspection, \(\left|\mathrm{LE}\right|=\left[411+109+121+494\right]\) - 364 \(=+771\) kJ mol-1 LE = - 771 kJ mol-1
