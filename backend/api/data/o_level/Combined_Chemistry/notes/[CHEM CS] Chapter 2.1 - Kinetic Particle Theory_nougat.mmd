KINETIC PARTICLE THEORY OF MATTER

The theory states that:

all matter consist of **particles** that are too small to be directly visible,

the particles are always in a constant state of **random motion** at varying speeds.

## 6 Freezing (LIQUID TO SOLID)

At A, the particles have lost enough kinetic energy and freezing starts.

The particles after losing most of their kinetic energy, **no longer have enough energy to overcome the forces of attraction** between themselves and would **return to their fixed position.**

Between A and B, the freezing process is ongoing. The **temperature remains constant** because **heat energy is being released to the surroundings.** The release of heat energy negates the cooling effect resulting in the temperature remaining is constant.

A mixture of solid and liquid is present during this stage.

## Conclusion (Gas to Liquid)

At A, the particles lost much of its kinetic energy and condensation starts.

During condensation, the particles **loses most of its energy to that was used to overcome the forces of attraction** between themselves resulting in them coming closer together.

**Heat energy is released** to the surroundings as particles slow down and become more closely packed. The **release of heat energy negates the cooling effect** resulting in the **temperature remaining constant.**

A mixture of gas and liquid is present during this stage.
