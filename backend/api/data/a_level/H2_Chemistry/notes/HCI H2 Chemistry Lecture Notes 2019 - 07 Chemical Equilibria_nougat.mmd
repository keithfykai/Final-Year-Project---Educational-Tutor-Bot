## 11 Reversible and irreversible reactions

### 11 Irreversible Reactions

Many chemical reactions appear to occur completely, converting reactants to products until the limiting reactant is used up. The products have little or no tendency to re-form the reactants. Such reactions are said to be **irreversible**:

_Examples of irreversible reactions_:

C\({}_{2}\)H\({}_{4}\)(g) + 3O\({}_{2}\)(g) \(\rightarrow\) 2CO\({}_{2}\)(g) + 2H\({}_{2}\)O(\(l\))

MnO\({}^{+}\)(aq) + 8H\({}^{+}\)(aq) + 5Fe\({}^{2+}\)\(\rightarrow\) Mn\({}^{2+}\)(aq) + 5Fe\({}^{3+}\)(aq) + 4H\({}_{2}\)O(\(l\))

### 11 Reversible Reactions

There are also many chemical reactions which do not occur to completion.

A reversible reaction can occur in **both directions** at the same time, where a mixture of reactants and products are obtained. Reversible sign is indicated by.

### 11.3 Concentration-versus-Time Profile for Reactions

For Figure 1(a), concentration of the limiting reactant, A, decreases to zero as the reaction proceeds to completion: For Figure 1(b), concentration of limiting reactant, C, does not decrease to zero.

Figure 4(a) is an analogy of **dynamic equilibrium**. Child is ascending an escalator at the same rate as the escalator descends. At the balance point (i.e. the equilibrium position), the child and the escalator are moving at the same rate in opposite directions. The position of the child appears unchanged.

Figure 4(b) is an analogy of **static equilibrium**. Children on a see-saw. At the balance point, the opposing processes ceased to occur, Positions of the children remain unchanged.

#### Dynamic equilibrium can only be achieved in a closed system

A closed system is one in which there is no loss or gain of materials to or from the surroundings. An open system may allow matter to escape or to enter. The latter cannot reach equilibrium.

Figure 5(a) shows an **open** steel reaction container where strong heating breaks down CaCO3 completely because the gaseous product CO2 escapes and is not present to react with the other product, CaO, Reaction goes to completion, Equilibrium is not achieved in the open system.

Figure 5(b) shows a **closed** container where CaCO3 breaks down in the forward reaction while CO2 reacts with CaO and re-form CaCO3 in the reverse reaction. At a given temperature, the reaction eventually reaches equilibrium when the forward and reverse reaction rates become equal. There is no further change in the quantities of reactants and products.

Figure 5: Equilibrium can only be achieved in a closed system

Figure 6: Pressure vs time graphs for the reaction, \(N_{2}\)(g) + 3\(H_{2}\)(g) = 2\(NH_{3}\)(g)

In Figure 6(a), the equilibrium is approached beginning with only N\({}_{2}\) and H\({}_{2}\).

In Figure 6(b), the equilibrium is approached beginning with only NH\({}_{3}\).

The equilibrium can be attained from either direction", beginning with only the materials on either side of the equation. In fact, the equilibrium can be attained beginning with any amounts of reactants and products (all present initially).

### Homogeneous and Heterogeneous Equilibria

Homogeneous equilibria are systems in which participating substances are in one phase only.

Examples of homogeneous equilibria:

(a) \(\mathrm{Gaseous\ phase\ }\mathrm{N_{2}O_{4}(g)}\)\(\mathrm{2NO_{2}(g)}\)

(b) \(\mathrm{Liiquid\ phase\ }\mathrm{CH_{3}CO_{2}H(J)}\)\(\mathrm{C_{2}H_{5}OH(J)}\)\(\mathrm{CH_{3}CO_{2}C_{2}H_{5}(J)}\)\(\mathrm{+H_{2}O(J)}\)

Heterogeneous equilibria are systems in which participating substances are present in different phases.

Examples of heterogeneous equilibria:

(a) \(\mathrm{CaCO_{3}(s)}\)\(\mathrm{CaO(s)}\)\(\mathrm{+CO_{2}(g)}\)

(b) \(\mathrm{CO_{2}(g)}\)\(\mathrm{+H_{2}O(J)}\)\(\mathrm{H_{2}CO_{3}(aq)}\)

### Position of equilibrium

The **position of equilibrium** refers to the relative proportion of products to reactants in an equilibrium mixture.

At equilibrium, if [reactant] < [product] \(\Rightarrow\) position of equilibrium lies towards the right.

If [reactant] > [product] \(\Rightarrow\) position of equilibrium lies towards the **left**.

For graph **(a)**, the position of equilibrium lies more to the right (favouring products). **(b)**, the position of equilibrium lies more to the left (favouring reactants).

Figure 7: Concentration vs. time graphs for the reaction, reactant \(\Rightarrow\) product, under different conditionsFigure 8: Effect of a change in concentration on a system at equilibrium, \(N\)(g) + 3\(h\)(g), 2NH(g)

Note that from _Figure 8_, at the new state of equilibrium (after t\({}_{2}\)), concentrations of the three gases are not the same as those in the previous equilibrium (before t\({}_{3}\)). Indeed, the position of equilibrium can only shift to _partially_ remove the disturbance.

### Effect of Presence of a Catalyst

A catalyst is a substance that increases the rate of a reaction, but itself is chemically unchanged at the end of the process.

When a catalyst is added to an equilibrium system, it increases both the forward and reverse reaction rates by the same extent. This is because the catalyst lowers the activation energy of both forward and backward reactions to the same extent.

Thus, a catalyst shortens the time needed to attain the same final equilibrium concentrations, it does not affect the position of equilibrium nor the equilibrium composition. It only enables the state of equilibrium to be reached more quickly.

### 4.4 \(K_{\rm c}\) and \(K_{\rm p}\) values as an Indication of the Position of Equilibrium

The **magnitude of \(K_{\rm c}\)** or \(K_{\rm p}\) is a useful indication of the **extent of a reaction** (how _far_ the forward reaction occurs).

In general,

However, the **magnitude of \(K_{\rm c}\)** or \(K_{\rm p}\) gives no information about the rate of reaction** (how _fast_ the reaction occurs).

A large value of \(K_{\rm c}\) indicates a high proportion of products to reactants while low value of \(K_{\rm c}\) indicates otherwise. It merely tells us how far, but not how fast the reaction goes.

### \(K_{\rm c}\) or \(K_{\rm p}\) values are only affected by temperature

The value of \(K_{\rm c}\) or \(K_{\rm p}\) is a **constant at a given temperature**. The value changes only if the temperature is changed.

The value of \(K_{\rm c}\) or \(K_{\rm p}\) is **unaffected by catalysts**. A catalyst shortens the time needed to attain the _same_ final equilibrium concentrations. It changes the rate but not the extent of the reaction or the yield of the reaction at equilibrium. Catalyst increases the rate of forward and the backward reaction to the same extent.

The value of \(K_{\rm c}\) or \(K_{\rm p}\) is **unaffected by changes in concentrations or partial pressures of the reactants or products**.

## 6 HABER PROCESS

In the design of industrial chemical processes, the major concerns confronting the chemist is to convert reactants into products

* a _kinetics_ problem
- to maximise the _rate_ of reaction, i.e., rate of product formation;
* an _equilibrium_ problem
- to maximise the proportion of product, i.e., the yield in the equilibrium mixture.

The solution to each of these problems requires a careful choice of reaction conditions such as temperature, pressure and the use of catalyst. The large-scale manufacture of ammonia by the Haber Process is a practical method of making ammonia. Raw materials for the process are nitrogen and hydrogen. (Nitrogen is obtained from the fractional distillation of liquefied air. Hydrogen is obtained from reacting natural gas, mainly CH\({}_{4}\), with steam over a catalyst.)

Figure 11: Schematic diagram of the Haber process for the industrial production of ammonia \(\Gamma\)U \(\Gamma\). \(N_{\text{z}}\)(g) + 3H\({}_{\text{z}}\)(g) = 2NH\({}_{\text{z}}\)(g) \(\Delta\)H, = \(-\)92 kJ mol\({}^{-1}\)
Overall, the **yield** of ammonia is increased by continuously removing the ammonia product as it forms, shifting the position of equilibrium forward.

Figure 12: Simplified schematic diagram of the Haber process

Figure 13: Effect of temperature and pressure on percentage yield of NH\({}_{3}\) in the Haber process.

The graphs show that higher yield of NH\({}_{3}\) is produced by low temperature and high pressure.

## 7 Equilibrium Constant and Gibbs Energy (connecting Equilibrium and Thermodynamics)

Recall in Topic 5: _Chemical Energetics & Thermodynamics_, that standard Gibbs free energy change of reaction (\(\Delta\)G\({}^{\text{O}}\)) is the change in Gibbs free energy needed to convert reactants into products at 1 bar and constant temperature. Its sign can be used to predict the position of equilibrium (POE) for a reversible reaction.

A negative value for \(\Delta\)G\({}^{\text{O}}\) represents a driving force in the forward direction; and POE lies to the right. A positive value represents a driving force in the reverse direction, and POE lies to the left.

For a reversible reaction taking place under non-standard conditions, the Gibbs free energy change; \(\Delta\)G, is related to the _standard Gibbs free energy change_, \(\Delta\)G\({}^{\text{O}}\), according to this equation;

\[\Delta\text{G}=\Delta\text{G}^{\text{O}}+\text{RT In Q}\]

\(R\) is the gas constant

\(T\) is temperature in Kelvin

\(Q\) is the reaction quotient

For a reaction at equilibrium, \(Q=K\) and \(\Delta G=0\), and the previous equation may be written as

\[\Delta\text{G}^{\text{O}}+\text{RT In K}\]

Rearranging the equation gives us:

\[\Delta\text{G}^{\text{O}}=-\text{RT In K}\]

This equation provides a useful link between these two essential ideas, standard Gibbs free energy change and equilibrium constant both are measures of the extent of a reversible reaction.

The table below shows how the sign for \(\Delta\)G\({}^{\text{O}}\) can provide information on POE.

**For your information - Real life applications of Chemical Equilibria**

**Restoration of ozone**

The ozone layer is a protective blanket of gas that shields us from harmful UV radiation emitted by the Sun. At the stratosphere, there is an equilibrium established between \(O_{2}\) and \(O_{3}\):

\[3\;O_{2}\;(g)\;\Rightarrow\;2\;O_{3}\;(g)\]

The reaction of decomposition of ozone is slow in the stratosphere. As the UV radiation from the sun breaks up ozone into an oxygen atom and oxygen molecule, the oxygen atom quickly combines with another oxygen molecule to produce ozone. The catalytic decomposition of ozone by chlorine radicals from chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) due to man's activities has disturbed this equilibrium.

The ozone layer started to decline during the 1980s and in 1985 scientists spotted a seasonal hole over Antarctica, prompting governments to start taking action to prevent further decline. It's known that gases such as CFCs (chlorofluorocarbons) which were commonly used in products such as refrigerators and aerosols--can accelerate the depletion of ozone in the Earth's stratosphere, so scientists and politicians across the globe put their heads together in a bid to reduce their use. AONG

In 1987, almost 200 countries signed the Montreal Protocol which was designed to phase out the use of ozone-depleting substances.

The ozone layer continued to decline throughout the early 1990s but has remained relatively unchanged since 2000. Now, thanks to the significant decrease in the atmospheric abundance of ozone-depleting gases, it is finally starting to show signs of future recovery. Without the Montreal Protocol, it is estimated that atmospheric levels of these gases could have increased tenfold by 2050. Furthermore, according to the United Nations Environment Programme, the protocol will have prevented some two million cases of skin cancer annually by 2030, alongside protecting wildlife and agriculture.
