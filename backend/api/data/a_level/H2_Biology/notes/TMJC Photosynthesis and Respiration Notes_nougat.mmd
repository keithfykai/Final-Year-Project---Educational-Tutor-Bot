## Topic Synopsis

This core idea describes how energy is obtained, transformed and utilised in biological systems. The following questions should help you frame you learning:

* How do organisms obtain and use energy in order to live, grow and survive?

### Energy is needed to drive biochemical processes in organisms

To maintain life-sustaining processes, organisms require materials and energy from their environment. Nearly all energy that sustains life ultimately comes from the sun. Plants and other photosynthetic organisms make use of sunlight to synthesise carbohydrates from carbon dioxide and water during the process of photosynthesis. Light energy from the sun is converted into chemical energy in the form of carbohydrates. This chemical energy may be used to form plant matter or subsequently released to fuel activities within the plants.

All other organisms depend on autotrophs for energy, either directly, by feeding on autotrophs such as plants; or indirectly, as energy is passed along food chains from one organism to the next. Food provides a source of carbohydrates which are broken down to release energy to phosphorylate ADP to ATP during aerobic respiration. Anaerobic respiration follows a different and less efficient chemical pathway to provide ATP. ATP obtained from respiration is used to drive various essential cellular processes.

In eukaryotes, photosynthesis and respiration occur in membrane-bound organelles. Many steps in photosynthesis and respiration are controlled by enzymes sequestered in these organelles and therefore are also limited by similar factors that will affect enzymatic reactions.

## Learning Outcomes

### Core Idea 3A: Transformation of Energy between the Environment and Organisms

_Plants and other photosynthetic organisms use sunlight to synthesise carbohydrates from carbon dioxide and water during the process of photosynthesis. The light-dependent (cyclic and non-cyclic photophosphorylation) and light-independent stages of photosynthesis facilitate the conversion of light energy to chemical energy in the form of carbohydrates. Carbohydrates produced from photosynthesis can be assembled into macromolecules or broken down subsequently to fuel activities within the plants. Carbon fixation occurs during the light-independent stage and the Calvin cycle ultimately results in the synthesis of sugars in plants._

_As heterotrophs consume plant matter, energy from the plants is transferred to them. Chemical processes occur during aerobic respiration whereby carbohydrates are broken down to release energy to phosphorylate ADP to ATP during aerobic respiration. The energy is transferred between interacting molecules through the four stages of aerobic respiration when oxygen is present. In the absence of oxygen, fermentation occurs with the release of fewer ATP molecules and the formation of either lactate or ethanol depending on the cell type._

## 1 Introduction: Overview on the transformation of energy

### 1.1 The need for energy

* Living organisms are able to exist because of a continual input of energy.
* Most of the energy is used for cellular metabolism, growth and reproduction.
* Remainder of the energy is lost as heat.
* The primary source of energy for most living organisms is **light** from the sun.
* **Autotrophs** (producers: green plants and photosynthetic bacteria) carry out photosynthesis. It is a process where **light energy** from the sun is used to produce **organic molecules** (e.g. carbohydrates such as glucose) from **inorganic raw materials** (e.g. carbon dioxide and water). **Oxygen** is released as a waste product (Fig. 1.1).

The chemical equation for photosynthesis is:

\[6\text{CO}_{2}+6\text{H}_{2}\text{O}+\text{ sunlight}\]

\[\text{C}_{6}\text{H}_{12}\text{O}_{6}+6\text{O}_{2}\]

More specifically, the light energy captured is first converted to **chemical energy** in the form of **ATP and NADPH** (more details will be covered in Section 2.3), which are then used for the formation of organic molecules (more details will be covered in Section 2.4).
* **Heterotrophs** (consumers) obtain food by eating plants or other animals that feed on plants. These **organic food molecules** in turn undergo multiple catabolic reactions via **respiration** to convert the stored chemical energy to **ATP**, which is needed for metabolic functions (Fig. 1.1).

Figure 1.1: Photosynthesis converts light energy into chemical energy, while respiration converts the stored chemical energy into ATP.

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:6]

b) The **energy** released through the **hydrolysis of ATP** is used for many purposes. Example:

**(i)**: **Movement of organelles** within the cells:

 Movement of ER vesicles from the Endoplasmic Reticulum to the Golgi Apparatus.

 Movement of secretory vesicles from the Golgi Apparatus to the cell surface membrane.

 Movement of centrioles to the opposite poles of the spindle axis during nuclear division _(Topic: Cell cycle)_.

 Movement of chromosomes to the metaphase plate during nuclear division _(Topic: Cell cycle)_.
**(ii)**: **Active transport** of substances across membranes:

 Proton pump on lysosomal membrane - pumps protons (H+ ions) from cytosol into lysosome, against the concentration gradient.

 Endocytosis, Exocytosis, Pinocytosis and Phagocytosis at the cell surface membrane.
**(iii)**: **Formation of chemical bonds**

 Amino acid activation during translation _(Topic: Gene expression)_.

 Formation of deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates for DNA replication _(Topic: DNA replication)_.

 ATP is converted to cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) by adenylyl cyclase. cAMP binds and activates protein kinases responsible for phosphorylating other proteins _(Topic: Cell signalling)_.

### 2.2 Chloroplast structure in relation to function

* The leaf (Fig. 2.2) is the main photosynthetic structure of a plant, although stems and sepals may also photosynthesize. 
* **Chloroplasts** (Fig. 2.2 and 2.3) are found mainly in mesophyll cells of leaves.
* These chloroplasts are discoid in shape and circular in surface view with a size of 3-5um and have a composition of 40%-60% proteins, 25%-35%, lipids, 5%-10% chlorophyll and 12% DNA.
* Each chloroplast has **two membranes** (**outer membrane and inner membrane**), enclosing a central aqueous space known as the **stroma** (Fig. 2.4 and 2.5).
* In the stroma are a series of membranous sacs called the **thylakoid membranes**. (Hence there are three membranes in the structure of chloroplasts) (Fig. 2.4 and 2.5).
* The thylakoid membranes have an internal aqueous space, known as the **thylakoid space**.
* Thylakoids may form stacks called **qrana** (singular: **granum**) (Fig. 2.4 and 2.5).

### Light-Dependent Reactions of Photosynthesis

**Key Concepts:**

Light-dependent reactions occur on the thylakoid membranes.

Light dependent reactions involve photoactivation followed by photophosphorylation.

Light-dependent reactions convert light energy to chemical energy (in the form of ATP and NADPH) for the light-independent reactions. Oxygen is released as a by-product.

* Light-dependent reactions are **directly dependent** on **light Intensity**.

* It is a series of reactions that take place on the **thylakoid membranes** of chloroplasts. It involves membrane proteins on the thylakoid membrane (Section 2.3.1)

* Light-dependent reactions involve:

\(\circ\) **Photoactivation of chlorophyll** (Section 2.3.2), followed by

\(\circ\) **Photopphosphorylation (Cyclic or Non cyclic)** (Section 2.3.3)

* Purpose of light-dependent reactions:

\(\circ\) **Synthesis of ATP and NADPH** for light-independent reactions.

\(\circ\) **Oxygen** is released as a by-product.

#### Roles of Thylakoid Membrane proteins

* The thylakoid membrane consists of membrane proteins (Fig. 2.6) as follows:

**A.** Photosystems (PSII and PSI)

**B.** Electron carriers (Note: names of electron carriers are _not_ required)

**C.** Proton pumps (Cytochrome complex)

**D.** NADP reductase (enzyme)

**E.** Stalked particles (ATP synthase)

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:13]

A Photosystems

Key Concepts:

Photosynthetic pigments are organised into photosystems. A photosystem consists of light-harvesting complexes surrounding the reaction centre.

There are two types of photosystems - PSI and PSII.

Photosynthetic pigments

1. Chlorophyll

Examples: Chlorophyll a and Chlorophyll b Absorbs mainly red and blue-violet light. Reflects green light (which explains why most leaves appear green to our eyes).

Chlorophyll a is the most abundant photosynthetic pigment and is of universal occurrence in all photosynthetic plants.

Functions of chlorophyll:

Chlorophyll a is known as the primary pigment

the only pigment that can act directly to convert light energy to chemical energy.

Chlorophyll b is an accessory pigment.

It absorbs light energy and transfers it to chlorophyll a. It does not convert light energy to chemical energy.

2. Carotenoids

Functions of carotenoids:

Yellow, orange, red and brown pigments that strongly absorb in the blue-violet range of light act as accessory pigments.

They can absorb wavelengths of light that chlorophyll a cannot, thus broaden the spectrum of colours from which the plant can obtain energy to drive photosynthesis.

* A photosystem consists of light harvesting complexes surrounding the reaction centre (Fig. 2.7). **Light harvesting complex**
* Consists of various photosynthetic pigments bound to proteins. These are the **accessory pigments*
* that absorb red and blue-violet wavelengths of light. Examples:
* Absorb red (650-680nm) and blue-violet (440-500nm) wavelength of light.
* E.g. chlorophyll b.

* Absorb blue-violet (440-500nm) wavelength of light.
* E.g. \(\beta\) carotene and xanthophyll.
* **Reaction Centre*
* Consists of an association of proteins holding together:
* **a pair of special chlorophyll a molecules (a\({}_{\text{eso}}\) or a\({}_{\text{r}00}\))**, which are the **primary pigments**. They are able to use harvested light energy to **excite one of their electrons to a higher energy level**, and then transfer them to the primary electron acceptor. **special chlorophyll a**-*
* special chlorophyll a**+**e*
* **a primary electron acceptor**, which is able to **capture excited electrons*
* from special chlorophyll a and becomes reduced.

Figure 2.7: Side View of a Photosystem (diagrammatic representation), comprising the (I) light harvesting complex and (II) reaction centre.

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:16]

### Electron carriers

* Electron carriers are molecules that can undergo many redox reactions. They receive electrons and pass them on to other molecules.
* An **electron transport chains (ETC)*
* can be found on the thylakoid membrane of chloroplasts.
* It is a **sequence of electron carrier molecules*
* (membrane proteins) of **progressively lower energy levels.*
* It functions to **transport electrons*
* through a **series of redox reactions**, from **higher to lower energy levels.*
* As electrons move from one electron carrier to the next, **energy is released**.
* The ETC between PSil and PSI is made up of the electron carrier plastiquinone (pq), a cytochrome complex, and a protein called plastocyanin (Pc). The ETC between PSI and NADP reductase is made up of the protein ferredoxin (Fd) (Fig. 9). _(Note: Names of electron carriers are not required)_

### Proton Pumps (Cytochrome complex)

* **Harness energy released from electron transport chain** is used to **pump protons (H+) from stroma into thylakoid space** against a concentration gradient, via **active transport** (Fig. 9).
* This creates a **proton gradient*
* across the thylakoid membrane that will subsequently **drive ATP synthesis*
* (more details in section 2.3.3 on Chemiosmosis).
* Thylakoid space: High proton (H+) concentration
* Stroma: Low proton (H+) concentration
* **Building Links - Protons (H+ ions) are actively pumped from the stroma into the thylakoid space to create a proton gradient. Why is it possible for H+ ions to accumulate within the thylakoid space?**

Figure 9: The electron transport chains (ETC) present on the thylakoid membrane consists of a sequence of electron carriers of progressively lower energy levels. As electrons move from one carrier to the next, energy is released. The proton pumps harness the energy released from the ETC to pump protons from the stroma into the thylakoid space, via active transport. This creates a proton gradient across the thylakoid membrane.

### NADP Reductase

* A membrane-bound **enzyme** that catalyses the **formation of reduced NADP/NADPH** from NADP+: \[\text{NADP}^{\text{+}}+2\text{e}^{\text{-}}+2\text{H}^{\text{+}}\] reduced NADP / NADPH + H+
* Reduced NADP produced is used as a **reducing agent** in the **light-independent reactions (**Calvin cycle**).

NADP/NADPH (FYI: NADPH - Reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate)
* NADP/NADPH is a molecule that can undergo many redox reactions.
* It acts as a **coenzyme** required for **redox reactions** occurring during photosynthesis. \(\circ\)_Recall topic on Enzymes_: Coenzymes are small, organic, non-protein and vitamin-derived molecules that are loosely associated with the enzyme during reactions.
* It exists in two forms: an oxidised form and a reduced form (Fig. 10). \(\circ\)The **light-dependent reactions** require the **oxidised form** (NADP / NADP+). They are at a lower energy level and function as **hydrogen/electron acceptors**. \(\circ\)The **light-independent reactions** require the **reduced form** (NADPH / reduced NADP). They are at a higher energy level and function as **electron carriers/donors**.

Figure 10: In photosynthesis, NADP+ accepts electrons from special chlorophyll a and becomes reduced, forming NADPH. NADPH then transfers the electrons to molecules in the Calvin cycle, thereby reducing that molecule and itself reoxidized to NADP+.

#### Light-Dependent Reactions: Photoactivation of Chlorophyll

**Key Concept:**

Photoactivation of chlorophyll uses the light energy absorbed by accessory pigments to excite electrons from special chlorophyll a molecules.

* **Light energy** absorbed by the different **accessory pigments** (chlorophyll and carotenoids) is **passed from one pigment to another** until it reaches the pair of **special chlorophyll a molecules** in the reaction centres **P680** (Photosystem II) and **P700** (Photosystem I).
* **Light energy excites an electron** of each special chlorophyll a molecule to a **higher energy level**, leaving the chlorophyll a molecule positively charged. The excited electrons are then captured by the **primary electron acceptor** (Fig. 2.12).

Figure 2.12: Photoactivation of chlorophyll on the Thylakoid membrane.

#### Light-Dependent Reactions: Photophosphorylation

**Key Concepts:**

Photopphosphorylation uses the high energy electrons released to synthesise ATP.

There are two types of photophosphorylation - non-cyclic (involves both PSII and PSI)

and cyclic photophosphorylation (involves only PSI).

It is the **synthesis of ATP** from **ADP and inorganic phosphate (P)** using **light energy** in photosynthesis via **chemiosmosis**.

There are two types of photophosphorylation that can occur at the thylakoid membrane:

1. Non-cyclic photophosphorylation and
2. Cyclic photophosphorylation

Both types of photophosphorylation occur in plants. They are alternative pathways for electron transfer during the process of photosynthesis. Photophosphorylation can switch between the non-cyclic and cyclic pathway, depending the needs of the plant.

FYI: For example, when concentration of carbon dioxide in leaf in the light becomes very low, fixation of carbon dioxide during light-independent reaction comes to a standstill. As a result, reduced NADP accumulates in the stroma and NADP disappears. Without a continuous supply of NADP, photosystems II and I are no longer able to operate together. In this situation, cyclic phosphorylation occurs to form ATP.

a) Non-cyclic photophosphorylation
* Non-cyclic photophosphorylation involves both photosystem II (PS II) and photosystem I (PS I) in a 'Z scheme' of electron flow.
* Process of non-cyclic photophosphorylation (the numbered points correspond with the numbers on Fig. 2.14): 1. **Photoactivation** occurs first (Fig. 2.13): 1. **Light energy** is absorbed by the **accessory pigments** of both photosystems, **PS II and PS I**. 2. This light energy is passed via accessory pigments to **special chlorophyll a** molecules in the respective **reaction centres (P680 and P700)**. 3. **Excited electrons** are **emitted** from the primary pigments of both reaction centres and transferred to the **primary electron acceptors**. 2. These **electrons** absorbed by primary electron acceptors are passed along a chain of **electron carriers and proton pumps** in the **electron transport chain** of **progressively lower energy levels** through redox reactions. 3. The **energy released** during this process is used by **proton pumps** to **transport protons (H+ ions) from the stroma into the thylakoid space against a concentration gradient** via **active transport**. This creates a **proton gradient** across the thylakoid membrane, where the concentration of H+ is higher in the thylakoid space than the stroma. 4. **Protons (H+ ions)** move **from thylakoid space back into the stroma** through the **ATP synthase** (stalked particle), via **facilitated diffusion down a concentration gradient**.

6. **PS I** receives **replacement of electrons** from **PS II**.
7. **PS II** receives a **replacement of electrons** from **photolysis of water** which produces **electrons, H+** and **oxygen** (as a by-product). Hence, **water** is the **electron donor** for non-cyclic photophosphorylation.

3. **Excited electrons** are **emitted** from **special chlorophyll a (electron donor)** and **transferred** to the **primary electron acceptors**.
2. The **excited electrons** are then passed along a chain of **electron carriers and proton pumps** in the **electron transport chain** of **progressively lower energy levels via a series of redox reactions. Eventually they are passed back to **special chlorophyll a (final electron acceptor)** in reaction centre **P700**.

The **energy released** from the passage of electrons is used to **transport protons (H+ ions) from the stroma into the thylakoid space against a concentration gradient**, via **active transport**.

This creates a **proton gradient** across the thylakoid membrane, where the concentration of H+ is higher in the thylakoid space than the stroma.
3. **Protons (H+ ions)** move **from thylakoid space back into the stroma** via the **ATP synthase** (stalked particle), via **facilitated diffusion down a concentration gradient**.

1. **ATP synthase** harnesses the **proton-motive force** to **generate ATP** from **ADP and P1**.
2. The process where the proton gradient created is used to drive ATP synthesis (from ADP and P1) is known as **chemiosmosis**.
3. **ATP** generated during cyclic photophosphorylation is also used in the **light-independent reactions (Calvin cycle)**.

* The light-independent reactions (Calvin Cycle) occurs in the **stroma** of the chloroplast.
* The process utilises **ATP** and **NADPH** from the **light-dependent reactions**. Hence, it is **dependent on the rate of light dependent reactions** (but not _directly_ dependent on light intensity).
* as the Calvin cycle fixes carbon dioxide from the atmosphere to form organic molecules.
* as it is catalysed by enzymes.
* Occurs in 3 main stages (Fig. 2.17 and 2.18):

#### Carbon dioxide fixation

* the most abundant plant enzyme in the world).
* This **6C intermediate** is **unstable**, hence it will break down to give **two molecules** of **3C glycerate-3-phosphate (GP) / 3-phosphoglycerate (PGA)**.

#### PGA reduction

* Each molecule of **PGA/GP receives 1 additional phosphate group** from an **ATP** molecule (from the light-dependent reactions) to form **glycerate-1,3-bisphosphate / 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate** (Fig. 2.18).
* Each molecule of **glycerate-1,3-bisphosphate** is **reduced by NADPH** from the light-dependent reactions (ie. NADPH provides reducing power and becomes oxidised). **Glycerate-1,3-bisphosphate** also **loses a phosphate group** to form **glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (GALP) / triose phosphate (TP)** (3C sugar with phosphate) (Fig. 2.18).
* **GALP/TP** is the **first carbohydrate** product of photosynthesis (hence, this pathway of carbon fixation is called the C\({}_{3}\) pathway).
* **NADP, ADP and P\({}_{i}\)** are **recycled** at the thylakoid membrane for the **light-dependent reactions.**

#### Ribulose bisphosphate (RuBP) regeneration

* **A small proportion of GALP/TP** produced **exits the Calvin Cycle**, and is used as the starting material for metabolic pathways that **synthesize organic compounds** (e.g. glucose) (Fig. 2.19).
* **Majority of the GALP/TP** produced **remain in the Calvin Cycle**, and is used to regenerate RuBP. **ATP** from the light dependent reactions provides energy and phosphate for the **rearrangement of carbon atoms** between sugar phosphates to regenerate a **5C RuBP** from the 3C sugar molecules.
* **ADP and P\({}_{i}\)** are **recycled** at thylakoid membrane for **light-dependent reactions.**

**ii. Temperature** (Fig. 2.24)
* Photosynthesis is affected by **temperature** because reactions of the **Calvin Cycle** are catalyzed by **enzymes**.
* When the temperature is below the optimum, for each **rise of 10\({}^{\circ}\)C** (relate to the Q\({}_{10}\) temperature coefficient of enzymatic reactions), the **rate of enzymatic activities doubles**, causing a doubling in the rate of photosynthesis.
* When the temperature is above the optimum, enzymes start to **denature**, causing the photosynthetic rate to decrease.

**iii. Carbon dioxide concentration** (Fig. 2.25)

* At **low carbon dioxide concentrations** (<0.04%) [Note: atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration is 0.035%), carbon dioxide concentration is a **limiting factor** to **Calvin Cycle**. Hence, rate of photosynthesis increases linearly with increasing carbon dioxide concentrations.
* At **high carbon dioxide concentrations**, **carbon dioxide saturation** occurs as **all RUBISCO active sites are occupied** (carbon dioxide fixation is a rate-determining step).

**iii. Carbon dioxide concentration** (Fig. 2.25)

* At **low carbon dioxide concentrations** (<0.04%) [Note: atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration is 0.035%), carbon dioxide concentration is a **limiting factor** to **Calvin Cycle**. Hence, rate of photosynthesis increases linearly with increasing carbon dioxide concentrations.
* At **high carbon dioxide concentrations**, **carbon dioxide saturation** occurs as **all RUBISCO active sites are occupied** (carbon dioxide fixation is a rate-determining step).

**Fig. 2.25**: Effect of CO\({}_{2}\) concentration on photosynthesis.

**iv. Oxygen concentration**

* Atmospheric oxygen concentration is approximately 21%. The current concentration does not limit photosynthesis.
* **Increasing oxygen concentration decreases rate of photosynthesis as oxygen outcompetes carbon dioxide to bind to the active site of RUBISCO** (Ribulose Bisphosphate Carboxylase Oxygenase).
* This **prevents carbon dioxide** from **binding with RUBISCO** hence leading to a **decrease** in the rate of **Calvin Cycle**, resulting in the lowering of the rate of photosynthesis. This phenomenon is known as photorespiration.

**v. Water content**

* **Low amounts of water** will be a **limiting factor** due to the **closure of the stomata** which **limits carbon dioxide uptake** for photosynthesis.
* Decreased carbon dioxide uptake leads to a **decrease in rate of Calvin Cycle**, hence lowering the rate of photosynthesis. _[Note: It is NOT due to having insufficient water for photolysis.]_

Food molecules are broken down in three stages (Fig. 3.1):

**Stage 1: Digestion** (_the focus of 'O' Level syllabus_)

* The enzymatic breakdown of food molecules in intestine or in cellular lysosomes
* Large polymeric molecules of food are **hydrolysed** into monomeric subunits > Protein \(\rightarrow\) Amino Acids > Polysaccharides \(\rightarrow\) Sugars > Fats \(\rightarrow\) Fatty Acids + Glycerol
* Amino acids, glucose, fatty acids are absorbed into the blood and delivered to all cells in the body. When absorbed by cells and enter the cytosol, the next stage begins.

**Stage 2 and 3: Cellular Respiration**

**Key Concept:**

Cellular respiration is a process in which **organic molecules** are **oxidised** in stages to release chemical potential energy for the **synthesis of ATP.** ATP is needed for cellular activities such as **metabolic reactions**, **active transport** of substances and **mechanical work**.

* **Oxidising** glucose to carbon dioxide and water releases a relatively large amount of energy in one step. In cells, the energy contained in glucose is released in a **stepwise manner** through a large number of reactions, in a process called **respiration**.
* Two types of cellular respiration can occur in a cell (Fig. 3.2) \(\circ\) Aerobic respiration \(\circ\) Anaerobic respiration

### (A) Aerobic Respiration

* Occurs when O\({}_{2}\) is available, and comprises four main processes: > Glycolysis > Link Reaction > Krebs Cycle > Oxidative phosphorylation
* A limited amount of ATP is synthesized in glycolysis and the Krebs cycle via a process called **substrate-level phosphorylation**.

### ATP as the Product of Cellular Respiration

* Significance and role of ATP as the product of respiration:
* The hydrolysis of ATP to ADP and inorganic phosphate (P\({}_{i}\)) yields **30.6 kJ mol\({}^{\text{-1}}\) of free energy*
* ATP + H\({}_{2}\)O
* ADP + P\({}_{i}\) + energy
* This energy released from hydrolysis of ATP is used to drive biochemical processes in the cell.
* Examples of processes driven by energy released from hydrolysis of ATP include:
* anabolic reactions (e.g. synthesis of proteins)
* active transport
* maintenance of body temperature
* phosphorylation in the initial stages of glycolysis
* Hence, ATP is known as the source of "cellular energy".
* ADP and inorganic phosphate can be converted back to ATP by a **condensation reaction**. This requires the input of 30.6 kJ of energy per mole of ATP formed. The addition of a phosphate to ADP is also known as **phosphorylation**.

### Aerobic Respiration

**Key Concept:**

Four major enzyme-catalysed processes are involved in the **oxidation of glucose** to release energy for ATP synthesis:

1. **Glycolysis** _(Section 3.5.1)_
2. **Link Reaction** _(Section 3.5.2)_
3. **Krebs Cycle** _(Section 3.5.3)_
4. **Oxidative phosphorylation** _(Section 3.5.4)_

#### 3.5.1 Glycolysis

* Glucose taken into the cell is constantly channelled into **glycolysis**. Hence, a steep glucose gradient is maintained between the inside and outside of cell.
* Glycolysis **occurs in the cytosol** and is the common initial pathway for both aerobic and anaerobic respiration.
* This process takes place in ten steps and each step is catalyzed by specific enzyme that breaks down a glucose molecule (6C) into 2 molecules of pyruvate (3C) (Fig. 3.8).
* The ten steps are categorized into **four types of reactions processes**, namely (Fig. 3.8):

1. Phosphorylation of hexose
2. Splitting / lysis of 6C sugar bisphosphate
3. Oxidation/ Dehydrogen of triose phosphate
4. Substrate Level Phosphorylation of 3C sugar bisphosphateFigure 3.8: Glycolysis reaction and the number of NADH and ATP generated per glucose.

**Note:** you are NOT REQUIRED to remember the name/structure of the intermediate molecules.

Process of Glycolysis (Fig. 3.8):

## 1 Phosphorylation of Hexose

* **Glucose** is **phosphorylated** by 1 molecule of **ATP** to give **glucose-6-phosphate** (6C). This is to make glucose more reactive.
* **Glucose-6-phosphate** (6C) is **isomerized** to give **fructose-6-phosphate** (6C)
* **Fructose-6-phosphate** (6C) is further **phosphorylated** by 1 molecule of **ATP** to give **fructose-1,6-bisphosphate** (6C)

## 2 Splitting / Lysis of 6C sugar bisphosphate

* **The 6C fructose-1,6-bisphosphate splits** into 2 molecules of **triose phosphate** (3C) (dihydroxyacetone phosphate and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate).
* **Dihydroxyacetone phosphate** is converted to **glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate**.

## 3 Oxidation/ Dehydrogen

* **Oxidation / dehydrogenation** of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (GALP) by **NAD\({}^{+}\)** forms 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate.
* **NAD\({}^{+}\)** are **reduced** to NADH (reduced NAD). As 1 glucose molecule gives 2 GALP molecules, 2 molecules of NADH are generated per molecule of glucose.
* **The NADH produced by glycolysis are channelled to the **electron transport chain** (see section 3.5.4)

## 4 Substrate Level Phosphorylation (Fig. 3.9)

* **Substrate level phosphorylation** is the **formation of ATP** by a **direct enzymatic transfer of a high-energy phosphate group to ADP** from an organic substrate (Fig. 3.8).
* **1,3-bisphosphoglycerate** undergoes a series of steps to form the final product, **pyruvate**. In the process, **2 molecules of ATP** are generated via substrate level phosphorylation. Thus, 4 molecules of ATP are generated per molecule of glucose

* **Products of Glycolysis:**

* **1 glucose molecule** \(\rightarrow\) **net** & 2 ATP & \(\rightarrow\) used to drive cellular processes & 2 NADH & \(\rightarrow\) channelled to oxidative phosphorylation & 2 pyruvate & \(\rightarrow\) enters Link reaction, converted to acetyl CoA

Figure 3.9: Substrate level phosphorylation

#### Link Reaction

* Occurs in the **mitochondrial matrix**.
* Pyruvate from glycolysis is actively transported from the cytoplasm into the mitochondrial matrix by the **mitochondrial pyruvate carrier** (Fig. 10).
* In the **matrix**, pyruvate undergoes **oxidative decarboxylation**, where pyruvate is **oxidised** to **acetyl CoA** by NAD+ with the removal of CO2. This reaction catalysed by **pyruvate dehydrogenase** (Fig. 10).
* The sequence of the Link reaction (Fig. 10): 1. CO2 is removed from the substrate molecule. 2. Protons and electrons are transferred to NAD+, forming reduced NAD (**NADH**). 3. The remaining 2C compound **combines with coenzyme A** (CoA) to give **acetyl CoA**.
* Products of link reaction: 1 glucose 2 pyruvate 2 CO2 diffuse out of cell 2 NADH 2 acetyl CoA 2 enters Krebs cycle

Figure 10: The Link reaction.

#### Krebs Cycle

* Also known as the Tricarboxylic Acid Cycle or Citric Acid Cycle.
* Krebs cycle is a closed pathway of enzyme-catalysed reactions, which occurs in the **mitochondrial matrix**.
* The Krebs cycle, which takes place in 8 steps, is the **complete oxidation of acetyl CoA to CO2 and H2O** with the **release of energy** (Fig. 3.10).
* Importance of the Krebs Cycle: 1. It is the pathway where **glucose**, in the form of acetyl CoA, is **completely oxidised** to give CO2 and H2O with the **release of energy** in the form of **NADH and FADH2**.
2. The Krebs Cycle **provides reducing power** for the electron transport chain, in the form of **reduced NAD (NADH)** and **reduced FAD (FADH2)**. Energy from the transfer of electrons is used to set up a proton gradient for oxidative phosphorylation to synthesise ATP.
3. It is the pathway by which all carbon atoms from carbohydrates, lipids and amino acids are oxidised. When glucose is in short supply, **amino acids** and **fatty acids** are channelled into Krebs cycle to be oxidised for ATP production
4. In the Krebs Cycle, carbohydrate intermediates can be converted to amino acids or fatty acids.

Figure 3.11: Krebs Cycle: Note the reactions where NADH, FADH2, ATP and CO2 are produced. _Note to students: You are REQUIRED to know the_ **names** _of the intermediates._* Three major types of reactions occur in the following sequence: \(\succ\) Oxidative decarboxylation \(\succ\) Substrate-level phosphorylation \(\succ\) Dehydrogenation / Oxidation
* Steps in the Krebs Cycle (Fig. 3.11): 1. (**2C**) **acetyl CoA** is taken up by (**4C**) **oxaloacetate** to form (**6C**) **citrate**. (Oxaloacetate is the acceptor of acetyl CoA.)
2. (**6C**) **citrate** undergoes **isomerisation** to form (**6C**) **isocitrate**.
3. (**6C**) **isocitrate** undergoes **oxidative decarboxylation** to produce (**5C**) **\(\alpha\)-ketoglutrate**, with the **removal of CO2**. **NAD+** is the **oxidising agent**. Hydrogen atoms are removed from isocitrate and added to NAD+, forming reduced NAD.
4. (**5C**) **\(\alpha\)-ketoglutrate** is undergoes further **oxidative decarboxylation** to form (**4C**) **succinyi CoA** with the production of **reduced NAD** and **CO2**.
5. (**4C**) **Succinyl CoA is converted to (4C) succinate**. **ATP is produced by substrate-level phosphorylation**.
6. (**4C**) **Succinate** is oxidised to (**4C**) **fumarate** by coenzyme FAD. Reduced FAD is formed.
7. (**4C**) **Fumarate** is converted to **malate** (**4C**) with the addition of one water molecule.
8. (**4C**) **Malate** is oxidised to **oxaloacetate** (**4C**) by **NAD+** with the release of 2 hydrogen atoms to form **reduced NAD (NADH)**. **Oxaloacetate** is regenerated to take up another acetyl-CoA.

* Products of Krebs cycle per glucose molecule (after two turns of the cycle): 1 glucose \(\rightarrow\) 2 acetyl CoA \(\rightarrow\) 6 NADH \(\rightarrow\) channelled to oxidative phosphorylation \(\rightarrow\) 2 FADH2 \(\rightarrow\) channelled to oxidative phosphorylation \(\rightarrow\) 2 ATP \(\rightarrow\) formed by substrate level phosphorylation \(\rightarrow\) 4 CO2 \(\rightarrow\) diffuse out of cell \(\rightarrow\) 2 oxaloacetate \(\rightarrow\) regenerated and combine with acetyl CoA

#### Electron Transport Chain and Oxidative Phosphorylation

* The oxidation of glucose via glycolysis and the Krebs cycle yields a net total of 4 ATP molecules by substrate-level phosphorylation. The **majority of the ATP molecules** are subsequently formed via a process called **oxidative phosphorylation**.
* Oxidative phosphorylation produces (90%) 34 out of 38 ATP per glucose molecule oxidised.
* Definition of oxidative phosphorylation:
* _The NADH and FADH\({}_{2}\) (formed in glycolysis, conversion of pyruvate to acetyl CoA and the Krebs cycle) transfer their electrons to O\({}_{2}\) through a series of electron carriers of progressively lower energy levels, present on the inner mitochondrial membrane. The energy released from this electron transfer is used to create a proton gradient across the inner mitochondrial membrane. The electrical potential energy of this proton gradient is used for the synthesis of ATP._*

## The Electron Transport Chain

* The electron transport chain consists of a series of electron carriers located on the **inner mitochondrial membrane*
* (Fig. 3.12).
* Most of these are proteins, with prosthetic groups that shift between **reduced*
* and **oxidised*
* states as they accept and donate electrons.
* The electron carriers are of **progressively lower energy levels**. Electrons are transferred from NADH or FADH\({}_{2}\) to the series of carriers and finally to O\({}_{2}\) by a series of redox reactions. (Fig. 3.12)
* The **final electron acceptor*
* is **O\({}_{2}\)**, which is then **reduced to H\({}_{2}\)O*
* (Fig. 3.13).

Figure 3.12: The electron transport chain. Electrons from NADH and FADH\({}_{2}\) enter the ETC and are transferred by a series of electron transport proteins of progressively lower energy levels. The energy released from the passage of electrons is used to pump protons from the matrix into the intermembrane space, generating a proton gradient across the inner membrane.

* The energy released from this transfer of electrons is used to **actively transport protons (H+ ions) from the matrix of mitochondrion into the intermembrane space**.

### Stalked Particles / ATP Synthase

* The stalked particles / ATP synthase (Fig. 3.13) on the inner mitochondrial membrane are protein complexes comprising of

* **F\({}_{0}\) Transmembrane hydrophilic channel*
* embedded within the inner mitochondrial membrane for **diffusion of H\({}^{+}\) down its concentration gradient*
* from intermembrane space to mitochondrial matrix
* **F\({}_{1}\) ATP synthase head portion*
* faces the mitochondrial matrix.
* binds ADP and P\({}_{1}\).
* The head portion rotates as H\({}^{+}\) ions passes through the hydrophilic channel.
* The electrical potential energy released from diffusion of H\({}^{+}\) is used to synthesise ATP.

#### Production of lactic acid in animal cells

* Also known as **lactate fermentation**.
* From glycolysis, one molecule of Glucose \(\to\) 2 pyruvate + 2H\({}_{2}\)O + 2ATP + 2 reduced NAD.
* Lactate fermentation is the conversion of pyruvate to lactate / lactic acid, catalysed by **lactate dehydrogenase** (Fig. 3.18).
* Purpose: **To regenerate the pool of NAD\({}^{+}\) in the cytoplasm so that ATP can be continuously synthesized by glycolysis**
* This occurs so that cellular activities can still continue in the absence of oxygen.
* When energy demand is great and oxygen supply is limited, anaerobic respiration is used in addition to aerobic respiration, to power muscle. As a result, lactic acid builds up in the muscle and blood.
* The muscle is said to be incurring an oxygen debt, which causes muscular pain, fatigue and cramps.
* When muscular activity slows down and **aerobic condition** returns, lactate is removed from the muscle and carried by the blood to the liver. In the **liver** cells, **lactate is converted back to pyruvate** through a pathway that is the reverse of glycolysis.
* The liver oxidises 20% of the incoming lactate to carbon dioxide and water. The remainder of the lactate is converted to **glycogen** by the liver.
