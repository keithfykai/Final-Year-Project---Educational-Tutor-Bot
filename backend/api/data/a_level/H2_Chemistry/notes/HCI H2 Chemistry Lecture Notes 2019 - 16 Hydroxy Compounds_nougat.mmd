### Classification of alcohols

Alcohols can be subdivided into three different classes (similar to halogenoalkanes). An alcohol is classified as primary (1*), secondary (2*), or tertiary (3*) according to the number of carbon atoms bonded to the carbon that bears the -OH group:

Each class of alcohol undergoes chemical reactions differently. When asked to identify the alcohol functional group in a compound, you should state whether it is a primary, secondary or tertiary alcohol explicitly and not just a generic "alcohol".

### Nomenclature

Alcohols are named by replacing the terminal -**e** of the corresponding alkane name with -**o**.

The longest carbon chain containing the hydroxy group is considered the parent structure.

Number the alkane chain beginning at the end nearer the hydroxy group, and use the appropriate number to indicate the position of the -OH group.

Number any substituents according to their positions on the chain, and list the substituents in alphabetical order.

### Isomerism in alcohols

Alcohols can exhibit constitutional isomerism, as well as enantiomerism. Of the five isomers with the formula C\({}_{4}\)H\({}_{3}\)OH, two (**A** and **B**) are primary alcohols, two (**C** and **D**) are secondary alcohols, and one (**E**) is a tertiary alcohol.

### Boiling Points

Alcohols and phenols have significantly higher boiling points than those of corresponding (isoelectronic) hydrocarbons.

While the strength of the dispersion forces in the alcohol and in the alkane is about the same due to the similar sizes of the electron clouds, more energy is required to overcome the intermolecular hydrogen bonding in alcohols which is stronger than the dispersion forces in alkanes.

The boiling point of alcohols increases as the alkyl chain length increases.

While the strength of intermolecular hydrogen bonding remains largely similar for all the alcohols, the size of the electron cloud increases as the length of the alkyl chains increases. More energy is thus required to overcome the stronger dispersion forces between the alcohol molecules.

### Solubility in water

Alcohols are more soluble in water compared to their corresponding alkanes due to their ability to form hydrogen bonds with water molecules.

The solubility of alcohols in water decreases with increasing carbon number due to the increasing length of the non-polar alkyl chain.

As the length of the alkyl chain increases, the strength of the dispersion forces between alcohol molecules increases. Energy released from hydrogen bonding formed between the alcohol molecule and water is less able to overcome the increasingly stronger dispersion forces, as well as the existing hydrogen bonding in water. In addition, the hydrogen bonding with water is disrupted by the larger non-polar alkyl chain.

Phenols are only moderately soluble in water due to their large non-polar aryl group; but dissolve completely when warmed.

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:8]

The reactivity of the \(-\)OH group allows alcohols to be versatile starting materials for the preparation of a variety of organic compounds. The alcohol functional group can undergo various reactions involving the cleavage of either the C-O or O-H bonds of the \(-\)OH group.

All alcohols burn well in air to form carbon dioxide and water, but only the combustion of ethanol has significance in everyday life:

\[\mathrm{CH_{3}CH_{2}OH(\textit{I})+3O_{2}(\textit{g})\to 2CO_{2}(\textit{g})+3H_{2}O( \textit{I})}\qquad\Delta H_{\mathrm{c}}=-1367\ \mathrm{k}\ \mathrm{l}\ \mathrm{mol}^{-1}\]

### Acid-Base reactions of alcohols and Phenols

_[0.11.5(e): explain the relative acidies of water,phenol and ethanol in aqueous medium (interpict as transsted-Lowry Acids)_]_

Due to the presence of the \(-\)OH group, alcohols and phenols can act as either Bransted acids or Bransted bases. The electron-deficient hydrogen can be removed in the presence of a sufficiently strong base, while the electron-rich oxygen can be protonated in the presence of a sufficiently strong acid.

While this section mainly focuses on alcohols and phenols acting as Bransted acids, we do see alcohols acting as Bransted bases later in Section 4.3.

In general, the strength of an acid depends on the stability of the conjugate base formed after dissociation. When a more stable conjugate base is formed, it is less likely to accept a proton to reform the acid. Hence, the extent of dissociation is greater, resulting in a stronger acid and a larger \(K_{\mathrm{s}}\) (Topic 15 Acid-Base Equilibria).

#### 4.2.1 Activity of Alcohols

In alcohols, the O-H bond can break to give H+ and R-O- (alkoxide ion). The extent of dissociation is lower than that of water. Therefore alcohols do not turn blue litmus red.

Alkyl groups are inductively electron-donating and will **intensity** the negative charge on the alkoxide ion. The alkoxide ion has a greater tendency to accept a proton to re-form the alcohol molecule. Thus the alkoxide ion is said to be **destabilised**, and deprotonation of the alcohol does not take place as easily. (Note the length of the alkyl chain does not have a significant impact on the acidity.)

**Effect of substituents on acidity of alcohols**

The presence of electron-withdrawing groups (e.g. -NO2, -F, -C7, -Br, -I, -COCH3, -CO2H, -CN, -CO2R, -NH2, -OH, -OCH3) help to stabilise the alkoxide ion formed by dispersing the negative charge on the alkoxide ion, thus promoting the ionisation of the alcohol.

However, the presence of electron-donating groups (e.g. -CH3) decreases the acidic strength of alcohols by intensifying the negative charge on the alkoxide ion, destabilising the alkoxide ion.

The distance of the electron-withdrawing group from the alkoxide group also affects the degree of dispersion of the negative charge on the alkoxide group, as the inductive effect decreases with increasing distance. Thus, the nearer the electron-withdrawing group is to the alkoxide group, the greater the degree of dispersion of the negative charge and the greater the acid strength of the alcohol.

#### 4.2.2.2 **Acidity of Phenols**

Phenols are more acidic than alcohols (and water). The pH of a 0.1 mol dm\({}^{-3}\) phenol solution in water is 5.4, so a solution of phenol will turn blue,litmus red.

The negative charge on the phenoxide ion can be delocalised over the benzene ring as shown in the following diagrams.

In the phenoxide ion, a orbital of the oxygen atom is able to overlap with the \(\pi\)-electron cloud of the benzene ring. The negative charge is able to delocalise into the benzene ring to some extent, thus the phenoxide anion is **stabilised by resonance**. The phenoxide anion is less likely to accept a proton to re-form phenol. This makes phenols stronger acids than both aliphatic alcohols and water.

### Effect of ring substituents on acidity of phenols

Similar to alcohols, the presence of electron-withdrawing groups (e.g. \(-\)NO\({}_{2}\), \(-\)F\({}_{1}\), \(-\)Br\({}_{2}\)=I, \(-\)COCH\({}_{3}\), \(-\)CO\({}_{2}\)H, \(-\)CN, \(-\)CO\({}_{2}\)R) in the ring enables the ring in turn to withdraw more electron density from the oxygen, thus stabilising the phenoxide ion further and promoting the ionisation of the phenol.

The presence of electron-donating groups (e.g. \(-\)CH\({}_{3}\), \(-\)NH\({}_{2}\), \(-\)OH, \(-\)OCH\({}_{3}\)) decreases the acid strength of phenols by reducing the delocalisation of the negative charge on the oxygen atom into the ring (or by intensifying the negative charge on the phenoxide ion), thus destabilising the conjugate base.

#### 4.2.3 Acid-metal Reaction with sodium (redox)

Alcohols and phenols react with Group 1 metals such as sodium and potassium to form alkoxides or phenoxides respectively and hydrogen gas. This reaction involves the breaking of the O-H bond.

Alcohols and phenols both act as acids, liberating H+, which is then reduced by sodium to H2. Both reactions are similar to that of sodium with water. However, alcohols react more slowly as they are weaker acids than water. Phenols, being stronger acids than water, react more vigourously.

#### 4.2.4 Acid-base reaction with sodium hydroxide

Phenols are acidic enough to react with bases like sodium hydroxide (and potassium hydroxide) to yield phenoxide salts and water. Phenol will form a cloudy mixture when mixed with water due to its poor solubility. Upon addition of aqueous NaOH, the phenol will dissolve to form a homogeneous colourless solution.

Note that phenols are not acidic enough to react with carbonates to liberate CO2 gas.

#### 4.3 Nucleophilic substitution (mechanism not required)

Alcohols can be converted to halogenalkanes by nucleophilic substitution. In this reaction, the C-O bond is broken.

We have seen in Topic 13 Halogen Derivatives that the OH- ion can attack a halogenoalkane, e.g. RC/, to form an alcohol. In this reaction, the halide ion, \(C\Gamma\), is called the **leaving group**.

Recall also from Topic 15 Acid-Base Equilibria, that \(C\Gamma\) and OH ions are conjugate bases of acids HC/ and H\({}_{2}\)O respectively.

Since HC/ is a stronger acid than H\({}_{2}\)O, its conjugate base \(C\Gamma\) is a weaker base than OH-Weaker bases are generally better leaving groups. Hence \(C\Gamma\), being a better leaving group than OH-, is readily substituted by OH- ions in halogenoalkanes to form alcohols in nucleophilic substitutions. This also applies to Br- and \(\Gamma\).

On the other hand, as OH- is a poor leaving group, the conversion of alcohols to halogenoalkanes involves reagents such as acid or SOC\(I_{2}\). These reagents first convert the -OH group into a better leaving group before the halide ion attacks, forming the halogenoalkane.

#### 4.3.1 Nucleophilic substitution with hydrogen halides

##### Reaction with hydrochloric acid

Tertiary alcohols react readily with concentrated hydrochloric acid upon shaking at room temperature to form the corresponding chloroalkane.

\begin{tabular}{c c}  & Reagents \& Conditions: concentrated HC/, room temperature \\  & Observation: & solution turns cloudy \\ \end{tabular}

Primary and secondary alcohols also can react with concentrated hydrochloric acid, but at a slower rate. Anydrugus zinc chloride must be added as a catalyst, and the reaction mixture must be heated.

\begin{tabular}{c c}  & HWA CHONG & HWA CHO \\ \end{tabular}

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:16]

#### 4.3.3 Nucleophilic substitution with thinyl chloride

Another good reagent to convert alcohols to chloroalkanes is thinyl chloride, SOCl\({}_{2}\). Thionyl chloride and PCCl\({}_{5}\) will react with both alcohols and carboxylic acids, liberating HCl in the process. The use of thinyl chloride confers an additional advantage over the use of PCCl\({}_{5}\) in that both byproducts are acidic gases and are hence more easily separated from the chloroalkane product. Also, since both byproducts are gases, the reaction is entropically driven (entropy change more positive, reaction more thermodynamically feasible).

#### 4.3.4 Non-reactivity of phenols towards nucleophilic substitution

Phenols are very much less susceptible towards nucleophilic substitution, in which the -OH group is replaced by a halide, thin alcohols. Extremely harsh conditions are required for conversion of phenols to halogenoarenes (which will not be discussed in this syllabus).

## Reasons for the inertness of phenols towards nucleophilic substitution

There are several reasons for the reduced susceptibility of phenols to form halogenarenes. These reasons are similar to those given for the reduced susceptibility of halogenoarenes to nucleophilic substitution reactions (see Topic 13 Halogen Derivatives).

1. The lone pair of electrons on the O atom in phenol delocalises into the benzene ring, resulting in partial double bond character in the C-O bond. The C-O bond strength in phenols is higher than in alcohol, making it more difficult to break.
2. Sterically, the approach of a nucleophile to the rear side of the C-O bond in phenols is hindered by the benzene ring. The \(\pi\)-electron cloud of the benzene ring will also repel the lone pair of electrons on the approaching nucleophile.

These two factors make the attack by the nucleophile difficult.

### 4.4 Dehydration (Elimination)

Dehydration of alcohols is carried out by heating the alcohol in the presence of a suitable catalyst. The loss of the hydroxy group together with a H atom bonded to an adjacent carbon will result in the formation of an alkene and a water molecule.

Dehydration may form a mixture of alkenes, depending on the position of the hydroxy group. Consider the reaction of butan-2-ol with excess concentrated sulfuric acid:

Note: There are some similarities and differences between the dehydration reaction of alcohols and elimination of halogenalkanes. In both cases, an alkene is formed, but the differences are in the reagents used, as well as formation of H\({}_{2}\)O and HX in the cases of alcohols and halogenalkanes respectively, (See Topic 13 Halogen Derivatives)

If there are no hydrogen atoms bonded to the carbon atom thats adjacent to the carbon atom bearing the hydroxy group, dehydration cannot take place:

### Condensation with carboxylic acids

Alcohols will react with carboxylic acids in a slow and reversible reaction, with a few drops of concentrated sulfuric acid as catalyst, to form the ester with the condensation of a water molecule. Note that concentrated sulfuric acid acts as a catalyst for both dehydration (to alkenes) and condensation. In this case, only a few drops of concentrated sulfuric acid are used, making the sulfuric acid less likely to act as a dehydrating agent.

Unlike alcohols, phenols cannot react with carboxylic acids in a similar condensation reaction. This is due to the delocalisation of the lone pair of electrons on the oxygen atom into the benzene ring. The lone pair of electrons is thus less available to attack the carboxyl carbon of the carboxylic acid to form the ester.

#### 4.5.2 Condensation with acyl chlorides

Acyl chlorides react much more readily with alcohols in condensation reactions than their corresponding carboxylic acids. No heating and no catalysts are required, and the reaction goes to completion instead of establishing an equilibrium.

Figure 8: Comparison of the adsorption of the carboxylic acid to form the ester with the condensation of a water molecule.

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:21]

#### 4.6.1 Oxidation of Primary Alcohols

Primary alcohols are readily oxidised to aldehydes on heating. With excess oxidizing agent, the reaction proceeds further, yielding carboxylic acids. The oxidation pathway for ethanol is shown below.

Once the aldehyde is formed in the reaction vessel, it will come into contact with more oxidant and this will lead to further oxidation, forming a carboxylic acid. This can be avoided by distilling the aldehyde away from the reaction mixture as soon as it forms. This is possible as the aldehyde lacks intermolecular hydrogen bonding and thus has a lower boiling point than the corresponding alcohol.

The distillation setup is shown in diagram below.

Figure 2: Experimental setup for the distillation of aldehydes by oxidising primary alcohols. (Diagram token from Chemistry for Advanced Level by P. Cann and P. Hughes; Hadder Murray)To obtain carboxylic acids from primary alcohols, the reacting solution needs to be heated under reflux. This prevents the aldehyde formed from evaporating and allows further oxidation to the carboxylic acid.

The reflux setup is shown in the diagram below.

Figure 3: Example of a typical reflux setup

#### 4.6.2 Oxidation of Secondary Alcohols

Secondary alcohols are oxidised to ketones which are resistant to further oxidation.

Oxidation as a distinguishing test to identify primary, secondary and tertiary alcohols [1011,5(b): suggest characteristic distinguishing reactions for the different classes of alcohols (primary, secondary and tertiary alcohols), e.g. mild oxidation

Oxidation may be used as a method to distinguish between the various classes of alcohols (primary, secondary or tertiary), based on the products of oxidation (if any). The alcohol is first **heated under reflux** with **excess** potassium dichromate(VI) and dilute sulfuric acid. Tertiary alcohols will not be oxidised by \(\mathrm{K_{2}Cr_{2}O_{7}}\), so the colour of the reaction mixture remains orange.

Primary and secondary alcohols will be oxidised by \(\mathrm{k_{2}Cr_{2}O_{7}}\) to carboxylic acids and ketones respectively, causing the orange solution to turn green. To distinguish between these two classes of alcohols, the organic product must be isolated (e.g. by distillation), and distinguishing tests for the carboxylic acid or the ketone should be carried out on the product to identify the class of alcohol. (These distinguishing tests will be covered in Topic 17 Carbonyl Compounds and Topic 18 carboxylic Acids and Derivatives.)

Note that in simple chemical tests, reflux and distillation setups are not used.

### The Tri-lodomethane (iodoform) Test

_10 11.5(c): deduce the presence of a CH\({}_{3}\)CH(OH)- group in an alcohol from its reaction with alkaline aqueous iodine to form tri-iodometatine_

Alcohols with a CH\({}_{3}\)CH(OH)- group will react with warm alkaline aqueous iodine. In this reaction, the carbon bearing the hydroxy group is oxidised to a carboxyl carbon.

All of these alcohols are secondary alcohols, with the exception of ethanol(primary alcohol), where the R group is replaced by a hydrogen atom.

Note that this reaction involves the **breaking of a C-C bond** with the removal of the methyl (-CH\({}_{3}\)) group. It is therefore a useful method to **shorten a carbon chain by a single carbon** (known as a **step-down reaction**).

[FIGURE:S4.F1][EN

Figure 1: The **Tri-lodomethane (iodoform) Test**

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:28]

* [2] The -OH group is strongly activating and 2,4- directing, which may result in **multi-substituted products** at the 2-, 4-, and 6- positions easily.

Note: as the -NH\({}_{2}\) group in phenylalanine is even more strongly activating than the -OH group in phenol, similar observations will be made regarding electrophilic substitution of the benzene ring in phenylalanine (to be covered in Topic 19 Nitrogen Compounds).

### Electrophilic substitution with nitric acid (nitration)

When phenol is treated with dilute aqueous nitric acid at room temperature, mono-substitution occurs to form a mixture of 2- and 4-nitrophenol.

If concentrated nitric acid at room temperature is used, 2,4,6-trinitrophenol is produced.

### Electrophilic substitution with bromine (bromination)

Phenol will react with **aqueous bromine** at room temperature to form a white precipitate of 2,4,6-tribromophenol. No Lewis acid catalyst is required.

### 2,4,6-tribromophenol

Figure 8: Editions: aqueous bromine (bromine water); room temperature (Observation; yellow orange solution decolourised, white ppt formed)

#### 4.8.2 Complex formation with iron(III) chloride

When a neutral solution of iron(III) chloride is added to a dilute solution of a phenol, a coloured complex is formed. (The reason for the complex having colour will be discussed in Topic 22 Chemistry of the Transition Elements.) The colour of the complex depends on the other substituents (if any) on the benzene ring. With phenol, aviolet colour is observed.

This reaction is used as a distinguishing test for the presence of a phenolic group in an organic compound.
