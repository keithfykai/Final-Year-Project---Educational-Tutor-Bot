1. **The Periodic Table - An Introduction** "_The periodic table is a systematic method of classifying all elements, according to_proton _number and_ electronic_ configuration. There are horizontal rows known as_ periods _(hence the name 'periodic table'). Elements in the same period have the same_ number of electron shells_ As such, they also have similar atomic radii. There are also vertical columns known as_ groups_ Elements in the same group have the same_ number _of_ valence electrons_ As such, they have similar, but not identical, chemical properties."_
2. **Metals Versus Non-Metals** The periodic table can be divided into two main sections - metals and non-metals.

4. Group I Elements: Alkali Metals

Group I elements have **one valence electron**, and have a tendency to.... lose one electron.... to form ions with an ionic charge of....

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|} \hline
**Period** & **Element** & **Electronic** & **Melting** & **Boiling** & **Density** & **Reactivity** \\  & & **Configuration** & **Point** & **Point** & **(g/cm\({}^{3}\))** & **Reactivity** \\ \hline \hline
2 & lithium & 2, **1** & 180 \({}^{\circ}\)C & 1330 \({}^{\circ}\)C & 0.53 & least \\
3 & sodium & 2, 8, **1** & 98 \({}^{\circ}\)C & 890 \({}^{\circ}\)C & 0.97 & \\
4 & potassium & 2, 8, **8, 1** & 64 \({}^{\circ}\)C & 760 \({}^{\circ}\)C & 0.86 & \\
5 & rubidium & 2, 8, 18, 8, **1** & 38 \({}^{\circ}\)C & 688 \({}^{\circ}\)C & 1.53 & \\
6 & caesium & 2, 8, 18, 18, 8, **1** & 28 \({}^{\circ}\)C & 671 \({}^{\circ}\)C & 1.93 & \\
7 & francium & 2, 8, 18, 32, 18, 8, **1** & 27 \({}^{\circ}\)C & 677 \({}^{\circ}\)C & 1.87 & most \\ \hline \end{tabular}

Physical Properties:

Like most other metals, Group I elements have a shiny, silver appearance and are able to conduct electricity in any state. They are also malleable and ductile, and are cut easily with a knife.

However, unlike most other metals, Group I elements have a.... low density...., with some even being able to float on water; and also.... low melting and boiling points...., with some even readily turning into liquid at room temperature.

Reactivity:

Compared to the other metals, group I metals are the **most reactive** because of.... the ease of.... losing one electron.... As a result, they seldom exist in element form, and oxidizes (tarnishes) readily when exposed to air. To store a pure sample of a group I metal, e.g. sodium, it has to be.... kept away from oxygen & moisture, i.e. in container of oil / noble gas....

As we move down the group, the valence electron gets further from the positive nucleus. Thus the ease of giving away the valence electron increases, leading to greater reactivity.

Reaction With Cold Water:

Alkali metals react vigorously with cold water, forming alkalis (hydroxides) and hydrogen gas. The reaction gets **increasing violent** as we move down the group. For example, the reaction between potassium and water:

\[\textbf{2 K (s) + 2 H}_{2}\textbf{O (I)}\]

 2 KOH (aq) + H\({}_{2}\) (g)

In the above reaction, we would observe that the potassium melts into a liquid ball, as the heat produced if sufficient to bring the metal above its melting point. A illac flame is also observed. The liquid metal 'darts' around the surface of the water, due to its low density allowing it to float. Vigorous effervescence of hydrogen gas is produced.

Complete the table to show the chemical equations for the reaction of alkali metals with water.

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|} \hline
**Period** & **Element** & **Chemical Equation** & **Observation** \\ \hline
2 & lithium & 2 Li + 2 H\({}_{2}\)O & 2 LiOH + H\({}_{2}\) & moderate \\  & & & effervescence \\ \hline
3 & sodium & 2 Na + 2 H\({}_{2}\)O & 2 NaOH + H\({}_{2}\) & effervescence, \\  & & & occasional sparks \\ \hline
4 & potassium & 2 K + 2 H\({}_{2}\)O & 2 KOH + H\({}_{2}\) & effervescence, \\  & & & illac flame \\ \hline
5 & rubidium & 2 Rb + 2 H\({}_{2}\)O & 2 RbOH + H\({}_{2}\) & violent reaction \\ \hline
6 & caesium & 2 _Cs_ + 2 H\({}_{2}\)O & 2 _Cs_OH + H\({}_{2}\) & explosive reaction \\ \hline
7 & francium & 2 Fr + 2 H\({}_{2}\)O & 2 FrOH + H\({}_{2}\) & explosive reaction \\ \hline \end{tabular}

Group Trends:

As we move down the alkali metals group, we observe that:

* number of electron shells... increases...,
* atomic radii... increases...,
* valency... remains the same...,
* melting and boiling points...generally decrease...,
* density...generally increases, and
* reactivity...increases...

5. **Group VII Elements: Haloqens** Group I elements have **seven valence electrons**, and have a tendency to _gain_one_electron. to form ions with an ionic charge of 1.

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|} \hline
**Period** & **Element** & \multicolumn{2}{c|}{**Electronic Configuration**} & **State at r.t.p.** & **Colour** & **Reactivity** \\ \hline
2 & fluorine & 2, **7** & gaseous & yellow & most \\
3 & chlorine & 2, 8, **7** & gaseous & greenish-yellow & \\
4 & bromine & 2, 8, 18, **7** & liquid & reddish-brown & \\
5 & iodine & 2, 8, 18, 18, **7** & solid & purple & \\
6 & astatine & 2, 8, 18, 32, 18, **7** & solid & black & least \\ \hline \end{tabular}

Physical Properties:

As elements, the halogens typically form only one covalent bond, and thus normally exist as _diatomic molecules_, i.e. F\({}_{2}\), Cl\({}_{2}\), Br\({}_{2}\), I\({}_{2}\) and At\({}_{2}\). This simple covalent structure leads to properties such as relatively **low melting and boiling points** (compared to ionic compounds and macromolecules), and **poor electrical conductivity** in all states.

In addition, they have **distinctive colours**; such as the _reddish-brown_ colour of liquid bromine, or the _purplish_, colour of iodine. They are also **very soluble in water**.

Reactivity:

Compared to the other non-metals, group VII elements are considered **very reactive** because of _the ease of gaining one_ electron_. For example, chlorine has a very strong oxidizing effect.

As we move down the group, the valence shell gets further from the positive nucleus. Thus the ease of taking in an additional electron decreases, leading to lower reactivity.

As we move down the alkali metals group, reactivity _increases_.

As we move down the halogen group, reactivity _decreases_.

Displacement Reactions:

Halogens can take part in displacement reactions, where a more reactive halogen can displace a less reactive halogen from its salt. The reverse, however, may not occur. For example, the reaction that occurs when chlorine gas (more reactive halogen) is bubbled through a solution of sodium bromide (a less reactive halogen ion, or halide):

\[\textbf{2 NaBr (aq) + Cl}_{2}\textbf{ (g)}\xrightarrow{}\textbf{2 NaCl (aq) + Br}_{2}\textbf{ (aq)}\]

What we observe is that a greenish-yellow gas is bubbled through a colourless solution, forming a reddish-brown solution (since the bromine dissolves readily into the water present). It is important to note that while halogens are coloured (i.e. in element form), most halide solutions (i.e. in an ionic compound) are colourless.

Complete the table with the chemical equations for the displacement reactions, if any.

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|} \hline
**Halogen** & **Salt** & **Chemical Equation** \\ \hline bromine & sodium iodide & 2 NaI + Br\({}_{2}\) & 2 NaBr + I\({}_{2}\) \\ \hline chlorine & magnesium astatide & \(MgA\)T\({}_{2}\) + \(Cl_{2}\) & \(MgCl_{2}\) + \(A\)T\({}_{2}\) \\ \hline iodine & iron(III) fluoride & No reaction. \\ \hline fluorine & potassium chloride & 2 KCl + F\({}_{2}\) & 2 KF + \(Cl_{2}\) \\ \hline chlorine & aluminium bromide & 2 AlBr\({}_{3}\) + 3 \(Cl_{2}\) & 2 AlCl\({}_{3}\) + 3 Br\({}_{2}\) \\ \hline bromine & caesium astatide & 2 CsAt + Br\({}_{2}\) & 2 CsBr + \(A\)T\({}_{2}\) \\ \hline \end{tabular}

Group Trends:

As we move down the halogens group, we observe that:

* number of electron shells increases,
* atomic radii increases,
* valency remains the same,
* melting and boiling points increase,
* colour intensity increases, and
* reactivity decreases.
