## H2 Topic O5 - Work, Energy and Power

**Richard Feynman in 1961 said. _There is a fact, or if you wish, a law, governing all natural phenomena that are known to date. There is no known exception to this law-it is exact so far as we know. The law is called the conservation of energy. It states that there is a certain quantity, which we call energy that does not change a manifold changes which nature undergoes. That is a most abstract idea, because it is an mathematical principle. It says that there is a numerical quantity which does not change when something happens. It is not a description of a mechanism, or anything concrete; it is just a strange fact that we can calculate some number and when we finish watching nature go through her ticks and calculate the number again, it is the same._**.**

### Introduction

Sometimes, trying to analyse Physics scenarios using forces can be very complicated - there may be many forces or there are many interactions between various forces. Using the relationships between work, energy and power can be an alternative to deciphering the Physics.

### Work

In Physics, work has a very specific meaning:

\begin{tabular}{|p{142.3pt}|p{142.3pt}|} \hline
**Work done by a force** is the product of the force and the displacement in the direction of the force. & As both force \(F\) and displacement \(s\) are vector quantities, the angle \(\theta\) helps to manage the information concerning direction. \\ \hline \hline \(W_{\text{by force}}=F\text{s}\cos\theta\) & Mathematically, the operation is known as the dot product or scalar product of 2 vectors: \(W=F\text{s}\) \\ \hline \end{tabular}

We can interpret the above either of two ways:

\begin{tabular}{|p{142.3pt}|p{142.3pt}|} \hline the product of & the product of \\ \(\bullet\) the displacement and & \(\bullet\) the force and \\ \(\bullet\) the _component of force_\(F_{//}=F\cos\theta\) along the same direction as the displacement & and \\ \(\bullet\) the _component of force_\(F_{//}=F\cos\theta\) along the same direction as the force & \(\bullet\) the _component of displacement_ _s_// = _s_\(\cos\theta\) along the same direction as the force \\ \hline \end{tabular}

The S.I. unit for work done is _joule_ (J). 1 J is defined as the work done when a force of 1 N moves its point of application through a distance of 1 m in the direction of the force.

**Notes:** Work is a _process_ that causes _energy transfer_ to or from a body.

Positive work done on a body result in mechanical energy being transferred to the body, and hence the body gains energy.

Negative work done in (d) and (e) show mechanical energy being transferred away from the body. So, if the body was already moving to the right with constant speed (therefore constant kinetic energy) and then a leftward braking force is applied across 2.0 m of displacement - the body will lose kinetic energy.

#### 5.1.1 Work Done by a Varying Force

In general:

If a force is constant, then

* area under the _F_-s graph is a simple rectangle
* the area can be found by
* length \(\times\) height"
* which reduces to the equation given in 5.1.

#### 5.1.2 Work Done by an Expanding Gas

Consider a gas enclosed in a cylinder of cross-sectional area \(A\) fitted with a light, frictionless piston. When the gas expands against an external pressure, it does work against external pressure.

We imagine the gas "exerting" a force against external pressure as the piston is displaced "outwards"

The equation above assumes that the external pressure remains constant. In the event that pressure is not constant, we can apply the same principle as Section 5.1.1, and the work done by the expanding gas is given by the **area under the pressure-volume graph**.

### Energy

When dealing with problems involving the motion of a body, we typically consider the mechanical energy, which includes kinetic energy and potential energy.

#### 5.2.1 (Translational) Kinetic Energy

For H2 Physics, we concentrate on translational motion and the associated kinetic energy. H2 Physics does not equip us with sufficient tools to analyse rotational motion, such as the rotational kinetic energy associated with a cylinder rolling down a slope.

Students who are interested can read up about moment of inertia, angular momentum, and the Newton's 2nd Law equivalent for rotation. You may also wish to consider offering H3 Physics.

**Derivation**

Consider a mass \(m\) that is displaced by a displacement \(s\) by a constant net force \(F\) on a smooth, horizontal surface. It has an initial velocity \(u\) and final velocity \(v\).

Mass experiences constant acceleration

due to constant force

\[v^{2}=u^{2}+2as\to s=\frac{v^{2}-u^{2}}{2a}\]

Work done on mass by force \(F\) is

\[W =Fs=(m\alpha)s\] \[=(m\alpha)\bigg{(}\frac{v^{2}-u^{2}}{2a}\bigg{)}\] \[=\frac{1}{2}mv^{2}-\frac{1}{2}mu^{2}\]

Since work done by force \(F\) results in the object's kinetic energy (only, not potential energy) thus \(W=\Delta E_{\kappa}=E_{\kappa,\,\text{final}}-E_{\kappa,\,\text{initial}}\)

If mass is initially at rest (\(u=0\)) then \(E_{\kappa,\text{initial}}=0\) and kinetic energy of the object, \(E_{\kappa}=\frac{1}{2}mv^{2}\)

#### 5.2.2 Gravitational Potential Energy

\begin{tabular}{|c|} \hline
**Gravitational potential energy** is the energy of a mass due to its position in a gravitational field. \\ \hline \end{tabular}

The above equation \(E_{\mathrm{p}}=mgh\)does not provide an absolute value for the gravitational potential energy. The zero reference for height \(h\) can be chosen and is often taken to be at Earth's surface.

\begin{tabular}{|c|} \hline
**Derivation** \\ \hline \end{tabular}

Consider a mass inside a uniform gravitational field of field strength \(g\) that is displaced upwards by \(h\) due to a constant net force \(F\) at constant speed:

\begin{tabular}{|c|} \hline
**Mass has constant speed so no net upward force** \\ \hline \end{tabular}

**Note**: The constant speed ensures that the kinetic energy remains constant; and that the work done by the force does not transfer energy to or from the body's kinetic energy. The work done in this case affects purely the gravitational potential energy only.

#### 5.2.3 Elastic Potential Energy

\begin{tabular}{|c|} \hline
**Elastic potential energy is** \\ \hline \end{tabular}

**the ability to do work by the object** \\ \hline \end{tabular}

**Deformation above can mean change in shape, being compressed, being stretched or being strained.**

**Recall that "elastic" in Physics conveys a meaning of being able to return to original state. So in a spring, elastic deformation implies that the spring returns to original length when the external force is removed.**

**Example 2**

A force \(F\) is applied to an extended spring such that its extension increases from \(x_{i}\) to \(x_{2}\).

Which shaded area(s) represent the

(a) energy stored in spring when it has extension of \(x_{2}\)?

A + B

(b) increase in elastic potential energy when its extension

increases from \(x_{i}\) to \(x_{2}\)?

B

**Example 3**

The diagram shows an external force \(F\) stretching a material by an extension of \(x_{i}\) where the upper path is taken. The force is then removed and the lower path is taken.

(a) Which shaded area(s) represent the

(i) work done by the external force in stretching the

material?

B+C

(ii) elastic potential energy stored in the spring?

C (=recoverable energy)

(b) What does area B represent?

energy dissipated (e.g. heat) in material after

undergoing the whole process of stretching and removal

of the external force.

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:8]

**Example 4**: Two cylinders of different masses \(m_{\text{i}}>m_{\text{2}}\) are connected by a light inextensible string passing over a fixed smooth pulley. Which of the following options correctly describes the changes in energies of the both masses after they are released from rest?

**C.** We apply perspective 2 and note that this is a scenario where there is no work done on system: Mass \(m_{\text{i}}\) accelerates downwards while \(m_{\text{2}}\) accelerates upwards with the same magnitude.

gain in \(E_{\text{\kappa}}=\)loss in \(E_{\text{p}}\)

We can also regard the net effect as the centre of gravity between \(m_{\text{i}}\) and \(m_{\text{2}}\) accelerating down.

**Example 5**: Two blocks each of equal mass are connected by a light inextensible string passing over a smooth fixed pulley. When released from an initial state of rest, \(m_{\text{2}}\) falls vertically down while \(m_{\text{i}}\) moves up the smooth plane inclined at \(\theta=30^{\circ}\) to the horizontal. Calculate the speed of the masses when \(m_{\text{i}}\) moves 2.0 m up the plane.

**Solution**

\(\Delta h=2\)\(m_{\text{i}}\) gained 1.0 m in height

By Principle of Conservation of Energy

\[\frac{1}{2}\,m_{\text{i}}v^{2}+\frac{1}{2}\,m_{\text{2}}v^{2}+m_{\text{g}} \Delta h=m_{\text{g}}gh_{\text{stop}}\]

\[\nu=\sqrt{\frac{2mg\big{(}h_{\text{stop}}-\Delta h\big{)}}{2m}}=\sqrt{g\big{(} h_{\text{stop}}-\Delta h\big{)}}\]

\[=\sqrt{\big{(}9.81\big{)}\big{(}2.0-1.0\big{)}}=3.1\,\text{m s}^{-1}\]

**Example 6**

A car of mass 2000 kg reaches point A, the foot of a hill, with initial speed of \(u=20\) m s\({}^{-1}\). The engine is cut and the car coasts up the hill. The car reaches point B, which is 10 m above the elevation of point A with a final speed of \(\nu=5.0\) m s\({}^{-1}\). The distance between A and B is 40 m. Calculate the average resistive force acting on the car when it coasts.

**Solution**

(Perspective 1) by Principle of Conservation of Energy

\[E_{\text{\tiny K, initial}}+E_{\text{\tiny P, initial}}+\left(-W_{\text{\tiny measure, on car}}\right) =E_{\text{\tiny K, final}}+E_{\text{\tiny P, final}}\]

\[E_{\text{\tiny K, initial}}+E_{\text{\tiny P, initial}}=E_{\text{\tiny K, final}}+E_{\text{\tiny P, final}}+W_{\text{\tiny against resistive force}}\]

\[\frac{1}{2}\,mu^{2}+0 =\frac{1}{2}\,m\nu^{2}+mgh+F_{\text{\tiny resistive}}s\]

\[F_{\text{\tiny resistive}} =\frac{m\left(u^{2}-\nu^{2}-2gh\right)}{2s}=\frac{\left(2000 \right)\left(20^{2}-5.0^{2}-2(9.81)(10)\right)}{2(40)}\] \[=4470\text{ N}\]

(Perspective 2) by Principle of Conservation of Energy

Loss in \(E_{K}\) = Gain in \(E_{P}\) + Work Done against resistive force

\[\frac{1}{2}\,m\left(u^{2}-\nu^{2}\right)=mgh+Fs\]

\[F =\frac{-1}{s}\left(\frac{1}{2}\,m\left(\nu^{2}-u^{2}\right)+mgh\right)\] \[=\frac{m\left(u^{2}-\nu^{2}-2gh\right)}{2s}=\frac{\left(2000 \right)\left(20^{2}-5^{2}-2(9.81)(10)\right)}{2(40)}\] \[=4470\text{ N}\]

**Note**: There is no "hard and fast" rule on which perspective to use. For this example, we deliberately kept all terms positive. Both perspectives are equally valid as long as you keep track of the energy changes properly.

## Example 7

A car of mass 2000 kg goes up a slope, with initial speed of \(u=10\) m s\({}^{-1}\). The engine continues to provide a constant driving force as the car goes up the hill. The car reaches the top of the slope, which is 12 m vertically above point where it enters the slope, with a final speed of \(\nu=8.0\) m s\({}^{-1}\). The distance the car traversed along the slope is 50 m.

Calculate the driving force acting on the car as it goes up the hill.

## Solution

(Perspective 1) by Principle of Conservation of Energy

\[E_{\text{K, initial}}+E_{\text{p, initial}}+W_{\text{driving, on car}}=E_{\text{K, final}}+E_{\text{p, final}}\]

\[\frac{1}{2}m\nu^{2}+F_{\text{driving}}\mathbf{S} =\frac{1}{2}m\nu^{2}+mgh\] \[F_{\text{driving}} =\frac{m\big{(}\nu^{2}+2gh-\nu^{2}\big{)}}{2s}=\frac{\big{(}2000 \big{)}\big{(}8.0^{2}+2(9.81)(12)-10^{2}\big{)}}{2(50)}\] \[=3990\text{ N}\]

(Perspective 2) by Principle of Conservation of Energy

Loss in \(E_{K}\) + Work Done by driving force = Gain in \(E_{p}\)

\[\frac{1}{2}m\nu^{2}-\frac{1}{2}m\nu^{2}+F_{\text{driving}} \mathbf{S} =mgh\] \[F_{\text{driving}} =\frac{m\big{(}2gh+\nu^{2}-\nu^{2}\big{)}}{2s}=\frac{\big{(}2000 \big{)}\big{(}2(9.81)(12)+8.0^{2}-10^{2}\big{)}}{2(50)}\] \[=3990\text{ N}\]

**Note**: An assumption was made in arriving at the answer. Can you spot it?

\begin{tabular}{|c|} \hline
**Power is the** \\ work done per unit time. \\ \hline \end{tabular}

**Power is a scalar quantity. The S.I. unit for power is** _watt_ **(W). 1 W is the rate when 1 J of work is done per 1 s.**

**Power can also be viewed as the**

**(i)** **rate of work done or**

**(ii)** **rate of transfer of energy, or**

**(iii)** **rate of conversion of energy.**

**Sometimes, power can be expressed as the product of a force** \(F\) **and**

**\(P=FV\)**

**velocity** \(\nu\) **in the direction of the force:**

**Derivation**

**When power is defined as rate of work done, then**

\[P =\frac{\mathrm{d}W}{\mathrm{d}t}\] \[=\frac{F.\mathrm{d}s}{\mathrm{d}t}\;\;\text{where $\mathrm{d}s$ is the displacement in the direction of $F$}\] \[=FV\;\;\text{where $\nu$ is the velocity in the direction of $F$}\]

**Average power over a time interval is equal to the total work done or the energy transferred / converted divided by the time interval:**

\[\left\langle P\right\rangle=\frac{\text{twork done OR energy transferred/converted}}{\text{time taken}}\]

\[=\frac{\Delta W}{\Delta t}=\frac{\Delta E}{\Delta t}\]

\[\left\langle P\right\rangle :\text{average power }(W)\] \[W :\text{work done }(J)\] \[\Delta E :\text{energy transferred / converted }(J)\] \[\Delta t :\text{time interval }(s)\]

**Example 8**: A bicycle dynamo attaches to the wheel and converts kinetic energy into electrical energy. A particular dynamo starts operating at time \(t=0\) s. In the first 5.0 s, the total energy transformed by the dynamo increases as shown in the graph.

For the first 5.0s, calculate the

1. maximum instantaneous power, and
2. average power

**Solution**

1. Gradient of graph gives rate of energy \(E\) converted, or the rate of work done by the dynamo. In other words, gradient gives the instantaneous power.

Max instantaneous power is where gradient is steepest, which happens between \(t=2.0\) s and \(t=3.0\) s.

\[P_{\max} = \left(\frac{\mathrm{d}E}{\mathrm{d}t}\right)_{\max}\] \[= \frac{0.40-0.10}{3.0-2.0}\] \[= 0.30\ \mathrm{W}\]
2. \[\left<P\right> = \frac{\mathrm{total\ work\ done}}{\mathrm{time\ taken}}\] \[= \frac{\Delta E}{\Delta t}=\frac{E_{s.0}-E_{s.0}}{5.0-0.0}\] \[= \frac{0.50-0.0}{5.0}\] \[= 0.10\ \mathrm{W}\]

**Note**: since gradient is instantaneous power, you could also think of average power as the 'average gradient' in the time interval.

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:14]

**Example 10**: A lift of mass 1000 kg can carry a maximum load of 800 kg. During operation, a constant frictional force of 4000 N opposes upward motion. Calculate the minimum power that the motor needs to deliver such that a fully-loaded lift can ascend at a constant speed of 3.0 m s-1.

**Solution**:

\begin{tabular}{l l}  & constant speed \\  & so lift is in translational equilibrium \\  & during upwards motion. \\  & no resultant force upwards so \\  & lift \\  & magnitude of \(T=F_{r}+W\) \\  & \(=F_{r}+m_{\text{max}}g\) \\  & magnitude of \(T=\) magnitude of \(F_{\text{motor}}\) \\  & \(P=F_{\text{motor}}\nu\) \\  & \(=\big{(}4000+(1000+800)(9.81)\big{)}(3.0)\) \\  & \(=6.50\times 10^{4}\) W \\ \end{tabular}

**Example 11**: A small motor is used to raise a weight of 2.0 N through a vertical height of 0.80 m. The efficiency of the motor is 20%. Calculate the minimum energy required by the motor to raise the weight.

**Solution**

efficiency \[=\frac{\text{useful work done}}{\text{energy input}}\times 100\,\%=20\,\%\] energy input \[=\frac{100}{20}\big{(}\text{useful work done}\big{)}=5(mgh)\] \[=5Wh=5\big{(}2.0\big{)}\big{(}0.80\big{)}\] \[=8.0\ \text{J}\]

**Example 12**: Over a section of the Niagara Falls, water flows at a mass rate of \(\,5.0\times 10^{6}\,\,\text{kg s}^{-1}\,\) and falls 50 m.

1. Calculate the power generated by the falling water.
2. If a hydropower plant with 95% efficiency is situated here, how many 50 W bulbs can be lit?

1. power \[=\frac{\text{conversion of energy}}{\text{time taken}}=\frac{ \Delta E_{p}}{\text{time taken}}=\frac{mgh}{t}=\frac{m}{t}gh\] \[=\big{(}5.0\times 10^{6}\big{)}\big{(}9.81\big{)}\big{(}50 \big{)}\] \[=2.45\times 10^{9}\ \text{W}\]
2. let \(n\) be the number of bulbs \[\text{efficiency} =\frac{\text{power output}}{\text{power input}}\times 100\,\%=95\%\] power output \[=\frac{95}{100}\big{(}\text{power input}\big{)}\] \[50n =\frac{95}{100}\big{(}2.45\times 10^{9}\big{)}\] \[=4.66\times 10^{7}\ \text{bulbs}\]

**Example 13**

A car has a mass of 800 kg. It has an efficiency rated at 18%. The petrol that is pumped into its tank has a chemical potential energy value of \(5.0\times 10^{7}\) J kg\({}^{-1}\). Calculate the mass of petrol burnt to accelerate the car from rest to \(30\) m s\({}^{-1}\).

**Solution**

\[\text{efficiency} =\frac{\text{useful work done}}{\text{energy input}}\times 100\%=18\%\] \[\frac{\Delta E_{\text{x}}}{\text{energy input}} =\frac{18}{100}\] \[\text{energy input} =\frac{100}{18}\bigg{(}\frac{1}{2}mv^{2}\bigg{)}=\frac{100}{18} \bigg{(}\frac{1}{2}\big{(}800\big{)}\big{(}30\big{)}^{2}\bigg{)}\] \[=2.0\times 10^{6}\text{ J}\]

\[\text{mass of petrol burnt} =\frac{2.0\times 10^{6}}{5.0\times 10^{7}}=0.040\text{ kg}\]

**Note:** The mass of petrol burnt is insignificant (5 orders of magnitude smaller) so we can take that the mass of the car is effectively constant during the acceleration.

**Example 14**

NASA's Perseverance Mars rover carries a multi-mission radioisotope thermoelectric generator (MMRTG) of mass 45 kg to supply electricity. A MMRTG is essentially a nuclear battery that reliably converts heat from the decay of plutonium-238 into electricity. A particular MMRTG is designed to provide 125 W of electrical power at the start of a mission, which falls linearly to 100 W after 14 years. Calculate the energy density (i.e. energy contained per unit mass) of the MMRTG in the 14-year lifespan. Compare the value with the energy density of a 3.7 V battery in a typical smartphone.

**Solution**

\[\text{total energy output in 14 y} =\big{\langle}P\big{\rangle}t=\bigg{[}\frac{1}{2}\big{(}125+100 \big{)}\bigg{]}\bigg{[}14\big{(}365\big{)}\big{(}24\big{)}\big{(}60\big{)}^{2 }\bigg{]}\] \[=4.97\times 10^{10}\text{ J}\] energy density in MMRTG =\frac{\text{energy}}{\text{mass}}=\frac{4.97\times 10^{10}}{45}\] \[=1.10\times 10^{8}\text{ J kg}^{-1}\] stored chemical potential energy = \[QV\approx\big{(}4000\text{ mAh}\big{)}\big{(}3.7\text{ V}\big{)}=\big{(}4000\times 10^{-3}\big{)}\big{(}60^{2}\big{)} \tag{3.7}\] \[=53\text{ 280 J}\] mass of smartphone energy density in smartphone \[\approx\frac{\text{energy}}{\text{mass}}=\frac{53\text{ 280}}{200\times 10^{-3}}\] \[=266\text{ 400 J kg}^{-1}=2.66\times 10^{5}\text{ J kg}^{-1}\]

Energy density in a MMRTG is about 3 orders of magnitude greater than smartphone battery.
