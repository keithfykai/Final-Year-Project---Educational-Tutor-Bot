\begin{tabular}{c c}
**Cell structure** & How it is adapted to its function \\ \end{tabular}

**Biconcave**, increases **surface area to volume ratio**, so oxygen can **diffuse** in/out of it faster
* Lacks a nucleus hence has **more space** for more **haemoglobin**, to transport more oxygen
* **Flexible**, so it can squeeze through tiny capillaries
* Can become **bell-shaped** in capillaries, further increasing **surface area to volume ratio**
* No **end walls** to allow **unobstructed** flow of water
* No protoplasm, to allow **unobstructed** flow of water
* Walls are **lignified** to prevent collapse of xylem vessels

* Has a **long**, **narrow** protrusion (root hair), that increases **surface area to volume ratio**, for faster absorption of water and mineral salts

## 2 Movement of substances in nutrient uptake and gas exchange

Nutrients such as glucose, amino acids and triglycerides **diffuse** into epithelial cells of villi in the small intestine

After **diffusion** no longer occurs, these substances are pumped in via **active transport*** Mineral salts are pumped from the soil into root hair cells **via active transport**, to maintain a high concentration of mineral salts in their vacuoles
* This creates a region of lower **water potential** than the surrounding soil, so that water flows in by **osmosis**
* \(\mathbf{O_{2}}\) **dissolves** into the thin film of moisture lining the **alveolar air space**, then
* \(\mathbf{diffuses}\) into the **blood plasma**
* Conversely, \(\mathbf{CO_{2}}\) **diffuses** from the **blood plasma** into the **alveoli air space**
* \(\mathbf{O_{2}}\) **diffuses** from the **intercellular air spaces** of the leaf to the surrounding air, through the **stomata**
* \(\mathbf{CO_{2}}\) **diffuses** from the surrounding air into the **intercellular air spaces** of the leaf, through the **stomata**

## 4 Bonus: Factors affecting rate of diffusion

* **Surface area to volume ratio:** The higher the SA:V, the higher the diffusion rate
* **Temperature:** Higher temperature, molecules have more **kinetic energy**, hence move faster and diffuse down the concentration gradient faster
* **Steepness of concentration gradient:** The steeper the gradient, the higher the diffusion rate
* **Distance:** The shorter the distance that molecules need to travel/diffusion distance, the higher the diffusion rate

* Lock and key hypothesis, enzyme-substrate complex, optimum temperature/pH
* Kinetic energy, chance of collision
* Weak bonds, denature

## Chapter 1 Mode of action

* Enzymes: Biological catalysts that speed up chemical reactions by providing an **alternative pathway** of **lower activation energy**, and remain chemically unchanged after the reaction.
* Activation energy: The energy needed to start a chemical reaction.

* a **specific** substrate (key) is **complementary** to and binds to the **active site** of the enzyme (lock), and bind,
* forming an **enzyme-substrate complex**.
* The enzyme then **catalyses** the reaction (by breaking/forming the bond in context)*
* After reaction, products are **no longer complementary** to the **active site**, hence they leave the **active site**.
* The enzyme remains **chemically unchanged** and can accept a new substrate.

* _Pro Tip: If the question was on 'explain the mode of action of sucrase', state here that sucrase catalyses the reaction by breaking the bond between glucose and fructose_ [Memory Shortcut]_

* Mode of action of enzymes [Be Careful Red Light Unchanged]
* enzyme and substrate **B**inds
* **C:** forming an enzyme-substrate Complex
* **R:** Reaction is catalysed

## 2 Effect of Temperature and pH

Effect of increasing temperature on enzyme activity 

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:23]

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:24]

*_Pro Tip: Short polypeptides is more accurate than just 'polypeptides', since it distinguishes between the length of the polypeptide (undigested proteins are folded polypeptides, giving this even more ambiguity). An even more specific term to use would be'short peptides'._

2. Peristalsis
3. Structure and function of willi
4. Liver functions and its associated blood vessels

* Peristalsis, antagonistic
* Bile salts, emulsify, fat globules
* Protoplasm, digested food substances
* Deamination, detoxification, blood glucose concentration
* Addictive, depressant, reaction time, cirrhosis, haemorrhage, social responsibilities

### 5.3 Main parts of the alimentary canal and enzymes involved

#### Definitions of processes

1. **Ingestion:** The intake of food through the mouth.
2. **Digestion:** The physical or chemical breakdown of larger food molecules into smaller and soluble molecules that can be absorbed by body cells.
3. **Absorption:** The uptake of digested food substances into body cells.
4. **Assimilation:** Digested food substances are converted to new protoplasm or used for energy.
5. **Egestion:** The removal of undigested food waste from the body.

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:29]

* Stores **bile** (an alkaline yellow-green liquid)
* Bile is secreted into the **duodenum** via the **bile duct** during digestion
* **Bile salts** in bile **emulsify** large fat droplets into smaller ones, increasing **SA:V** for **lipase** to digest **triglycerides** into **glycerol** and **fatty acids**

* **Pancreas secretes pancreatic** pancreatic **juice** (alkaline) containing **LAT** enzymes into duodenum
* Pancreatic Lipase: **fats/triglycerides** -> glycerol
* Pancreatic **A**mylase:starch -> maltose
* Trypsin: **proteins** -> short polypeptides
* **Pro Tip: Pancreatic juice actually contains trypsinogen. Once in the small intestine, enterokinase produced by epithelial cells activates trypsinogen to trypsin. For simplicity, we just say pancreatic juice contains trypsin.**

* **Has many folds, increasing SA:V** Large intestine absorbs water and mineral salts** Undigested food (**faeces**) are temporarily stored in the **rectum**
* **Faeces** is expelled

## Chapter 2 Peristalsis

### 2.1 Definition (in digestion):

Rhythmic, wave-like muscular contractions in the wall of the allimentary canal that moves food forward

* Peristalsis propels food forward ensuring it moves in the right direction,
* also mixes food with digestive juices

### How it works:

* At the region before the food mass, **circular muscles** contract while **longitudinal muscles** relax, narrowing the **lumen** and pushing food forward
* At the food mass, **circular muscles** relax while **longitudinal muscles** contract, widening the **lumen**, allowing food to pass through easily
* The above also applies for the region just in front of the food mass
* **Circular muscles** and **longitudinal muscles** are **antagonistic** (i.e. when one contracts, the other relaxes)

*_Pro Tip: Peristalsis occurs throughout the allimentary canal, not just in the oesophagus_

**Where digested substances are absorbed:**

* **Glucose and amino acids** diffuse into **blood capillaries** of **villi** to be transported to the **liver**.
* **Glycerol** and **fatty acids** diffuse into the **epithelial cells** of **villi**, where they **reform** into **triglycerides**, then enter the **lacetal** as **fat globules**.
* **_Pro Tip: Villus is singular, will is plural._

**Adaptations for fast absorption:**

* **Villi** are **finger-like projections** in the small intestine, increasing **SA:V**
* **Are lined with a **one-cell-thick** layer of **epithelial cells**, minimising **distance** digested food substances have to travel
* **Epithelial cells** have **microvilli**, further increasing **SA:V**
* **Absorbed substances that enter the **lacetal** and **blood capillaries** are constantly transported away, maintaining a steep **concentration gradient** between the **lumen** and **villi** to maximise **diffusion** rate of digested substances into villi.
* **_Pro Tip: After diffusion has reached equilibrium, active transport is needed to further absorb digested substances_**

**What happens to absorbed digested food substances:**

* **Hepatic portal vein** transports glucose and **amino acids** from small intestine to the **liver**
* **Glucose** is converted to **glycogen** and stored in the **liver** and **muscles**, or transported around the body for cells to uptake and use for energy
* **Amino acids** are transported around the body and taken up by cells during **assimilation**, to build new cell parts/**protoplasm**
* **Deamination:** The process where **amino groups** are removed from **excess amino acids** and converted into **urea**, in the liver.
* **Fats** are transported around the body to be stored/used for energy

**Functions of**

**liver**

**Bile production**

**The liver **produces bile**, which is stored in the **gall bladder**.

**Haemoglobin** from old RBCs are broken down, the **iron** from **iron** from **iron** to **which is stored in liver, to be used for making new red blood cells.

**Blood Glucose**

**regulation**

**glycogen**

**Detoxification**

**the process where **harmful substances**

(e.g. hydrogen peroxide, alcohol) are converted into **harmless** ones

* How to remember which is coagulation and agglutination
* Agglutination: Due to Antibodies in the blood
* Coagulation: blood Clotting

How blood clots (Coagulation)

* When blood vessels are damaged, damaged tissues and platelets release Thrombokinase.
* Thrombokinase converts Prothrombin to Thromb, in the presence of Calcium ions.
* Thromb then converts Fibrinogen into Fibrin, forming long insoluble Fibrin threads,
* Which trap red blood cells, forming a **clot** at the site of injury.

_[Memory hack]_

* Blood clotting process:
* starting point is thromboKinase
* end point is Eibrin
* this requires the presence of **C**alcium ions

## 3 Blood groups and their compatibilities

**How to remember intuitively:**

* The body will naturally produce **antibodies** of the other blood types, except against its own RBC's **antigens** (or it will kill its own RBCs!)
* If you transfer blood into a recipient who does not have **antibodies** against the donor's blood type, the transfusion will be safe.
* **Special blood types:*
* AB is the **universal acceptor*
* - can receive from all, but cannot donate to any
* O is the **universal donor*
* - can donate to all, but cannot receive from any
* Carries blood away from the heart
* Usually carry oxygenated blood, except for pulmonary artery
* Have thick, elastic muscular walls to accommodate and maintain the high blood pressure exerted by the heart
* Arteries branch out into arterioles, then into capillaries
* Are present near almost every cell in the body
* Walls are made of endothelial cells
* Endothelium is one-cell thick, to minimise diffusion distance, increasing diffusion rate
* Capillaries branch repeatedly, increasing SA:V, hence increasing rate of diffusion of substances in and out of them 

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:43]

* **Capillaries** bring **nutrients** and **O2**, which **diffuse** from the **blood plasma** to the **tissue fluid**
* These then **diffuse** from **tissue fluid** into cells
* Conversely, **waste products** and **CO2** **diffuse** out of the cells into the **tissue fluid**, then into the **blood plasma** of capillaries.

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:45]

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:46]

* Blood is **representised** after passing through heart the second time, so blood is pumped to the rest of the body at **high pressure**, hence blood is distributed **faster**
* Advantages of ** pulmonary circulation** (see table below)

* As walls of RV has thinner **muscular walls**, blood is pumped at a **lower pressure**, hence moves at **lower speed**
* Lower speed allows **more time** for blood to get rid of more CO\({}_{2}\) and take in more O\({}_{2}\), more efficient gas exchange
* As LV has thicker **muscular walls**, blood is pumped at **high pressure**, hence blood moves at **higher speed**, to be quickly distributed to the rest of the body (Link for the above GIF to visualise heartbeat:

**From Graph:**

(1) Atrioventricular valves close

(2) Semi-lunar valves open

(3) Semi-lunar valves close

(4) Atrioventricular valves open

* **Systole** = contraction
* **Diastole** = relaxation
* **RA** = **Right atrium**, **LA** = **Left atrium**, **RV** = **Right ventricle**, **LV** = **Left ventricle**

**Atrial systole** (+Ventricular diastole)

* Both atria contract, pushing blood past the **atrioventricular valves** into the ventricles
* **LA** pumps blood past the **mitral/bicuspid valve** to the **LV**
* **RA** pumps blood past the **tricuspid valve** to the **RV**

* **_Pro Tip: AV valves were already open before atrial systole, as they opened near the end of ventricular diastole._

**Ventricular systole** (+Atrial diastole)

* Ventricles contract * **Pulmonary semi-lunar valve** is forced open, blood moves from **RV** to the **pulmonary artery**, and is sent to the lungs.
* **Aortic semi-lunar valve** is forced open, blood moves from **LV** to the **aorta**, and is sent to the rest of the body.
* At the same time, **atrioventricular valves** close, preventing **backflow** of blood from ventricles to the atria.
* This causes the first '**lub**' sound.
* Meanwhile, atria relax,
* Blood from **pulmonary vein** flows into **LA**
* Blood from **vena cava** flows into **RA**

**Ventricular diastole (+Atrial diastole)**

* Ventricles relax
* **Semi-lunar valves** close, preventing **backflow** of blood from the **pulmonary artery** and **aorta** back into the ventricles.
* This causes the second '**dub**' sound.
* Blood fills the relaxed atria and ventricles again

* Typical duration of each cardiac cycle: 0.8s = 75 beats per min
* **_Pro Tip: When the heart pumps faster, such as during exercise, the duration of each cardiac cycle will be shorter_.

## 8 Coronary artery disease

* **Atherosclerosis:** The disease where fatty deposits accumulate on the inner walls of arteries, narrowing the lumen.
* **Coronary artery:** An artery that branches out of the aorta, sending oxygen and nutrients to the heart muscles.
* **Coronary artery disease:** When atherosclerosis occurs in a coronary artery.

**Heart attack**

* If a **fatty deposit** ruptures in a **coronary artery**, a **blood clot** (**thrombosis** = a blood clot in a blood vessel) could form, blocking the **artery.**
* Blood with **oxygen** and **nutrients** cannot reach the **heart muscles**, which **die**, resulting in a **heart attack**.

**Preventive measures**

* Adopt a diet low in **saturated fats** and **cholesterol**
* Not smoking * **Carbon monoxide** in cigarette smoke damages the **endothelium**, increasing rate **fatty deposits** accumulate.
* **Nicotine** stimulates **adrenaline** release, increasing **blood pressure**, which also increases the rate **fatty deposits** accumulate
* **Stress management**
* **Regular exercise**

* **Long**, **cylindrical** and **vertically** arranged, so that many of them can be packed together, increasing the total amount of light absorbed by their **chloroplasts**
* Fewer chloroplasts than palisade mesophyll cells
* Consists of **irregularly** shaped cells that have **large intercellular air spaces** between cells
* Mesophyll cells are coated with a **thin film of moisture**, which allows **CO2 to dissolve** in it before
* **diffusing** into mesophyll cells.
* **Intercellular air spaces** have large **SA:V**, for **carbon dioxide** and **oxygen** to quickly **diffuse** in and out of mesophyll cells

Consists of:
* **Xylem:** Brings water and mineral salts absorbed from the soil from the roots to leaves for photosynthesis
* **Phloem:** Translocation of food made by the leaves to the rest of the plant 

**Definition:** The process whereby carbon dioxide and water are converted into glucose and oxygen, in the presence of light energy and chlorophyll.

**Light stage:**

* **Light energy** is absorbed by **chlorophyll**, then converted into **chemical energy**
* **Photolysis** of water occurs: **water** is split into **hydrogen** and **oxygen** atoms, forming \(O_{2}\)

**Dark stage:**

* Using **hydrogen atoms** and **chemical energy** obtained from the light stage, \(CO_{2}\) is **reduced** to form **glucose**
* **Glucose** can be stored as other carbohydrates like **starch**, or converted to other molecules like **fats** and **amino acids**.

* _Pro Tip: Enzymes are involved in both the light and dark stages_

**3. Factors affecting rate of photosynthesis: light intensity, \(CO_{2}\) concentration, temperature**

**Limiting factor:** A factor that directly affects the process if its quantity is increased

**Light intensity**

* As light intensity increases, more **light energy** is absorbed by **chlorophyll** and converted into **chemical energy**, increasing **photosynthesis** rate.
* At very high light intensity, further increasing it has **no effect** on rate. Light intensity is **no longer a limiting factor** (some other factor is limiting).

**Co\({}_{2}\) concentration**

* As CO\({}_{2}\) concentration increases, there is more CO\({}_{2}\) available to be **reduced** into **glucose**, increasing **photosynthesis** rate.
* At very high CO\({}_{2}\) concentration, increasing it further has **no effect** on rate. CO\({}_{2}\) concentration is **no longer a limiting factor** (some other factor is limiting).

***_Pro Tip: Atmospheric concentration is around 0.03-0.04%, while concentration where CO\({}_{2}\) no longer becomes limiting is 0.13% onwards._**

**Temperature**

* Since **enzymes** are involved in photosynthesis, the photosynthesis-temperature graph looks the **same** as an enzyme-temperature graph.

## 4 Bonus: Procedure for leaf starch test in experiments (useful for practical).

* Place plant in dark room for 2 days, this **de-starches** the plant
* Carry out the experiment (e.g. whether photosynthesis works if leaf is placed in a sealed bag)
* Place the leaf in **boiling water** for 2min to kill the cells, **stopping further photosynthesis**.
* Place the leaf in a boiling tube with **ethanol** into boiling water bath, **removing chlorophyll** so that the green colour of chlorophyll does not affect any colour change later on
* Place leaf into **boiling water** for 1 min to **soften the leaf** and **remove alcohol**
* Add a few drops of **iodine** onto the leaf to **test for starch**

* _Pro Tip: Variegated leaves which have a white outer layer will only have starch on the inside when tested._

\begin{tabular}{c|c|c} \hline Type of & & \\ vascular & Xylem & phloem \\ tissue & & \\ \hline \end{tabular}

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:64]

## 3 Outline how water is transported from roots to leaves

* Water is transported up the xylem in 3 ways: Root pressure, Capillary action, Transpiration pull.

**Root pressure:** The upward pressure generated by constant osmosis of water from living cells into xylem vessels at the roots, due to the active transport of mineral salts.

* Water enters root hair cells via **osmosis** --> root hair cells have higher **water potential** than the inner **cortex** cells, water moves via **osmosis** to inner cells
* This process of osmosis repeats until water reaches the **xylem vessels**

**Capillary action:** The phenomenon in which water tends to move up narrow tubes

* This is due to the cohesive and adhesive forces of water
* Capillary action aids in the movement of water up the xylem

**Transpiration pull**

* Transpiration pull is the main force that pulls water from the roots to leaves
* **Transpiration:** The loss of water vapour from the aerial parts of a plant, mainly through the stomata in its leaves
* Transpiration is a **consequence** of **gaseous exchange**, in the presence of light **stomata** open wider to allow more CO2 to enter for **photosynthesis**, however this also increases the rate that **water vapour diffuses** out
* In leaves, water moves out the **mesophyll** cells, forming a **thin film of moisture**, which **evaporates** into **water vapour** in the **intercellular air spaces**
* It **diffuses** out of leaves via **stomata**, down its **concentration gradient**.
* **Water potential** of mesophyll cells has decreased, hence water moves from **xylem vessels** in leaves to **replace** water lost in mesophyll cells
* This causes a **whole column of water** to be pulled up xylem vessels from roots to leaves, by **transpiration pull**

* **Transpiration pull:** The suction force created due to transpiration that pulls water and mineral salts up the xylem * Transpiration process [Fake Vampire Drinks Red Water]
* F: thin Film of moisture
* V: water Vapour
* D: Diffuses out via stomata
* R: water in xylem Replaces water lost from mesophyll cells
* W: causes Whole column of water to be pulled up

## 4 Effects of temperature, light intensity, humidity and wind of transpiration rate

* As temperature increases, kinetic energy of water molecules increases
* Water evaporates faster from the **thin film of moisture*
* into **intercellular air spaces**, more water vapour diffuses out of **stomata**, increasing transpiration rate
* **Light intensity*
* As light intensity increases, **guard cells*
* become **turgid**, opening the **stomata*
* This allows **water vapour*
* to **diffuse*
* out of the leaf faster, increasing transpiration rate

* The amount of water vapour already in the air
* As humidity increases, **concentration gradient*
* of **water vapour*
* between **intercellular air spaces*
* and surrounding air becomes **less steep*
* Water vapour **diffuses*
* out slower, decreasing transpiration rate
* **Wind/air movement*
* More wind/air movement blows water vapour away from air around leaves, decreasing humidity
* **Concentration gradient of water vapour*
* between intercellular air spaces and surrounding air becomes steeper
* Water vapour diffuses out faster, increasing transpiration rate

## 5.2 **Wilting**

* **Usually, mesophyll cells of the leaf are turgid*
* This keeps leaves firm and spread widely for maximum surface area
* keeps the plant upright to reach for maximum sunlight (especially plants with non-woody stems)
* **Wilting occurs when rate of transpiration > rate of water uptake*
* Due to a **net loss*
* of water to the plant, **central vacuoles*
* of cells shrink, mesophyll cells lose **turgor pressure*
* and become **flaccid*
* This results in the wilted look of the plant

* Too high light intensity
* Too high heat
* Too much fertiliser that lowers soil **water potential*
* below that of root cells, resulting in water leaving the roots
* **Pros and cons of wilting*
* Pros: Reduced **leaf surface area + flaccid*
* guard cells close **stomata*
* reduces **transpiration rate**, which helps conserve water
* Cons: Due to closed **stomata**, less CO\({}_{2}\) enters leaves. Due to reduced **leaf surface area**, less light is captured, leading to reduced photosynthesis rate.

## 1 Aerobic and anaerobic respiration

* Living things need to respire to release energy for cellular activities, such as:
* Muscular contractions, cell division, active transport, etc.
* **Aerobic respiration:*
* The process where food substances are broken down into carbon dioxide and water, in the presence of oxygen, releasing a large amount of energy.
* Glucose + oxygen --> carbon dioxide + water + large amount of energy
* C6H12O6+6O2-->6CO2+6H2O+large amount of energy
* **Anaerobic respiration (yeasts):*
* The process where food substances are broken down into carbon dioxide and ethanol, in the absence of oxygen, releasing a small amount of energy.
* Glucose --> carbon dioxide + ethanol + small amount of energy
* This process is also called **alcoholic fermentation**
* **Anaerobic respiration (mammals):*
* The process where food substances are broken down into lactic acid, in the absence of oxygen, releasing a small amount of energy.
* Glucose --> Lactic acid + small amount of energy
* **The effect of lactic acid in muscles*
* During vigorous exercise, muscles demand more **energy*
* than can be generated by **aerobic respiration*
* **Additional energy*
* is generated by **anaerobic respiration**, resulting in accumulation of **lactic acid*
* in muscles
* An **oxygen debt*
* is incurred
* This causes **fatigue*
* and **muscular pain**
* **Converting lactic acid back into glucose*
* **Lactic acid*
* is removed from muscles via the bloodstream and transported to the liver.
* **Oxygen debt:*
* The amount of oxygen needed to **oxidise*
* lactic acid built up in the body back into **glucose**, at the liver.
* The conversion of some lactic acid back into glucose releases energy, and this energy is then used to **oxidise*
* the remaining lactic acid to glucose.
* Hence immediately after exercise, the person consumes more oxygen compared to at rest, to repay the **oxygen debt.**

## 4 Transport of \(\mathbf{O_{2}}\)and \(\mathbf{CO_{2}}\)

Oxygen
* A small percentage (2%) **dissolves** and is transported by **blood plasma*** Most O\({}_{2}\) (98%) is transported by **RBCs**
* When O\({}_{2}\) concentration is high, O\({}_{2}\) combines with **haemoglobin** (forming oxyhaemoglobin)
* When blood passes through oxygen-poor areas, O\({}_{2}\) **dissociates** from **haemoglobin** and **diffuses** into the **tissue fluid**, then into cells

Carbon dioxide
* A small percentage (5%) **dissolves** in and is transported in **blood plasma**
* Some CO\({}_{2}\) (25%) binds to **haemoglobin** (forming carbaminohaemoglobin) and is transported by **RBCs**
* Most CO\({}_{2}\) (70%) is transported as **bicarbonate ions/hydrogen carbonate ions**, HCO\({}_{3}\)-
* **Carbonic anhydrase*
* in RBCs combine CO\({}_{2}\) and H\({}_{2}\)O to form H\({}_{2}\)CO\({}_{3}\), **carbonic acid**
* This then **dissociates*
* into H\({}^{+}\) and HCO\({}_{3}\)-
* HCO\({}_{3}\)- ions **diffuse*
* out of RBCs into the **plasma**, where they are carried to the lungs
* At the lungs, the reverse process occurs, CO\({}_{2}\) **diffuses** out of the capillaries into **alveolar air space** and is expelled during **exhalation**

Breathing Rate
* Is controlled by (and directly proportional to) blood CO\({}_{2}\) concentration
* During exercise, **muscle** cells undergo more **aerobic respiration** more, more CO\({}_{2}\) is released by cells into the blood
* Breaths become **faster** and **deeper** to quickly remove excess CO\({}_{2}\)

## 5 Smoking

Negative Effects

smoke* **Addictive**, resulting in social problems

* **Increases ease of blood clotting**, increasing the risk of heart attacks
* **Pro Tip: This also increases rate of fatty deposits accumulating in arteries**.
* **Binds irreversibly** with **haemoglobin** such that it cannot transport O2 anymore, reducing the ability of blood to transport O2
* **Damages endothelium** of blood vessels, hence increasing the rate that **fatty deposits** accumulate in **arteries**, increasing the risk of **heart attacks
* **Paralyses cilia**, dust particles cannot be expelled, which can result in:
* **Chronic bronchitis*
* (where the **epithelium*
* lining the airways are inflamed + persistent coughing)

## 10. Excretion

Learning Outcomes:

1. Importance of excretion
2. Structure of kidneys and nephrons
3. Osmoregulation and ADH
4. Dialysis

Keywords:
* Anabolic, catabolic, metabolism, waste/excretory products, urea
* Basic functional unit, afferent/efferent arteriole, ultrafiltration, high (hydrostatic) blood pressure
* Selective reabsorption, filtrate, more permeable to water
* Osmoregulation, osmoreceptors, osmotic pressure, permeability
* Kidney failure, partially permeable, dialysate

## 1. Importance of excretion

* **Excretion:** The process whereby metabolic waste products and toxic substances are removed from the body
* **Importance:** They must be excreted as they can harm the body if they accumulate to high concentrations.
* Our **metabolism** results in metabolic waste products/excretory products
* **Anabolic** = smaller molecules form a larger molecule
* **Catabolic** = large molecule broken down into smaller molecules

_[Memory hack]_

* How to remember anabolic vs catabolic
* In the movie Frozen, **Anna** (Elsa's sister) always wants to build a snowman. So **Anabolic** = building, small molecules form a larger molecule.

Examples of excretion in humans
* Unicellular organisms use **diffusion** for excretion, multicellular organisms need organs
* **Lungs** excrete CO2 during **expiration*** **Urea** (product of deamination) is filtered out by **kidneys** and excreted in **urine**
* **Excess water** excreted by **sweating**, **expiration** and in **urine**
* **Bile pigment** excreted through **faeces**

## 2 Structure of kidneys and nephrons

* **Renal artery** brings blood to kidney, **renal vein** carries blood away
* **Kidneys** act as filters, removing unwanted substances
* **Ureter** carries urine to **bladder** where it is temporarily stored
* **Urethra** carries urine outside of body 

**Formation of urine**

* A **nephron** is the **basic functional unit** of the kidney that filters and removes waste substances from the blood to form urine.
* The processes involved that make this possible are **ultrafiltration** and **selective reabsorption**.

**Ultrafiltration:**The process where most of the blood plasma and dissolved substances are forced out of the glomerulus into the bowman's capsule byhigh (hydrostatic) blood pressure.

* Blood enters the **glomerulus** through the **afferent arteriole** and leaves through the **efferent arteriole**
* **Lumen** of **efferent arteriole** is smaller, generates **high (hydrostatic) blood pressure** which forces out most of the **blood plasma** and its **dissolved substances** (glucose, amino acids, mineral salts, urea, toxins, medicine).
* These substances enter the **Bowman's capsule*** Large molecules such as blood cells, platelets and proteins cannot pass through the **basement membrane** that lines the glomerular capillaries

**Selective reabsorption:** The process where certain substances are reabsorbed from the filtrate back into the blood as they pass through nephrons.

* Useful substances are **selectively reabsorbed** while unwanted substances (or substances in excess) stay in the **filtrate** and become urine
* Water is reabsorbed
* via **osmosis*
* _"Pro Tip: Since water is not reabsorbed using energy, do not say it is "selectively reabsorbed", only "reabsorbed"_
* Glucose, amino acids, and some mineral salts are reabsorbed via **diffusion** and **active transport**

**Osmoregulation:** The process where the amount of water and concentrations of solutes in blood are controlled to maintain constant water potential in the body.

* Osmoreceptors are cells in the **hypothalamus** that detect changes in blood **water potential**
* More/less **Antidiuretic Hormone (ADH)*** is secreted by the pituitary gland in response to a change detected

* _"Pro Tip: How to remember what ADH does? A diuretic is something that makes you pee more. Therefore Anti-diuretic means anti-pee, so you pee less and urine becomes more concentrated._
* Kidneys are considered **osmoregulatory** as they aid in **osmoregulation**

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:85]

**Procedure**

* Patients with **kidney failure*
* need to use a **dialysis machine*
* to filter waste products out of their blood
* \(\sim\)3 times per week, 4h each time
* Blood is drawn from the **vein*
* in patient's arm into a **partially permeable*
* Tube does not allow large substances such as blood cells and platelets to pass through, but allows small substances such as waste products to diffuse out.
* Tube enters machine where it is bathed in **dialysis fluid/dialysate*
* Dialysate contains zero waste products, hence waste products from blood **diffuse*
* out down their concentration gradients.
* Dialysate has same concentration of useful substances (glucose, amino acids, mineral salts) as healthy blood, so there is no **net diffusion**.
* Tubing is **long**, **narrow** and **coiled**, increases **SA:V**, increasing **diffusion** rate.
* Dialysate flows **opposite direction** to blood, so that a concentration gradient for diffusion of waste products is maintained along the entire length of the tube.
* Cleaned blood is returned via the **vein** in patient's forearm.

_[Memory shortcut]_

* use the brain as reflex centre, e.g. Blink reflex, accommodation reflex, pupil reflex, sneezing, coughing
* **Reflex arc:** The shortest pathway for nerve impulses to travel from receptor to effector during a reflex action.
* Examples of reflex actions: Knee jerk reflex*, pupil reflex, touching hot/sharp object, blink reflex, grasp reflex, cough reflex, sneeze reflex, production of gastric juice, production of saliva, secretion of adrenaline
* ***_Pro Tip: For the knee jerk reflex, this is a stretch reflex. When there is a tap on the tendon below the knee, stretch receptors detect this and result in the contraction of the quadriceps muscle (to prevent the muscle from overstretching and being injured)_**

Pathway of nerve impulses questions:
* When (incident), (receptors) detect this, **nerve impulses** are generated and travel along a sensory neurone.
* They are **transmitted across a synapse** to a **relay neurone,** in the (either brain/spinal cord), which is the **reflex centre.**
* Nerve impulses are then transmitted across another synapse to a **motor neurone.**
* They travel along it until they reach its **axon terminals**, chemicals/neurotransmitters are released across the **motor end plate/neuromuscular junction** (synapse)*.
* ***_Pro Tip: Motor end plate is a special synapse, where the effector is a muscle_**

## 3 Fertilisation

**Fertilisation:** The fusion of nuclei of a sperm and ovum, forming a diploid zygote.

* **Occurs in the oviduct/fallopian tube**

**Implantation:** The process whereby the embryo embeds itself in the uterine lining.

* **Zygote** travels toward uterus via **peristaltic action** of the **oviduct** walls and **sweeping action** of **cilia**
* The zygote undergoes **mitosis**, forming an **embryo** (a ball of cells)
* Embryo reaches uterus 5 days after fertilisation, floats around for 2 days. On Day 7, **embeds** itself into uterine lining during **implantation**.
* The placenta, amniotic sac and footus then develops.

## 4 Foetal development

* After implantation, **finger-like projections**, called **villi**, grow into the uterine lining, forming the **placenta**.
* Placenta secretes **progesterone** to maintain thickness of the uterine lining, supporting pregnancy.
* **Oxygen** and **nutrients** such as glucose, amino acids **diffuse** from maternal to foetal capillaries
* **Metabolic waste products** such as urea and carbon dioxide **diffuse** from foetal to maternal capillaries* Some antibodies diffuse from maternal to foetal capillaries, giving the foetus immunity against some diseases
* Maternal and foetal blood do not mix, because:
* Mother's blood pressure > foetus, would kill foetus
* Mother and foetus may have incompatible blood types

**Amniotic sac/Amnion**

* Contains amniotic fluid and the foetus
* Amniotic fluid
* and **cushions*
* foetus by absorbing shock
* Allows some movement, promoting **muscular development*
* birth canal during childbirth
* Trains the **digestive*
* system, as the foetus drinks the fluid and urinates it *_Pro Tip: When a pregnant woman's 'water bag' bursts nearing labour, it means the amniotic sac broke._

**Umbilical cord**

* Carries nutrients and oxygen from **placenta** to **foetus**
* Carries **metabolic waste products** from foetus to placenta
* Umbilical cord has 2 arteries *(from foetus to placenta) and 1 vein (toward foetus)

*_Pro Tip: Umbilical arteries carry deoxygenated blood, because artery carries blood away from foetus' heart, to placenta_

## 5 Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV).

* HIV is a sexually transmitted infection (STI)
* HIV attacks a certain type of white blood cells, decreasing their number
* The resulting condition = **Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome** (AIDS) as the immune system is weakened, and body is susceptible to common infections that would otherwise not be as severe.

**Modes of HIV transmission:**

* Unprotected sexual intercourse with infected individual
* Where **semen** containing HIV comes into contact with the **mucous membrane** of an uninfected female's **vagina**, ORWhen **vaginal fluids** containing HIV come into contact with the **mucous membrane** of an uninfected male's **urethra**.
* Sharing of contaminated needles
* **Blood transfusions** where the donor's blood has the virus
* _Pro Tip: This is why in professional/public health services, donated blood is always screened._
* Passed from mother to foetus during **pregnancy**

**STIs can be prevented by:**

* Abstinence (no sexual intercourse)
* Have only 1 sexual partner/avoiding casual sex
* Using condoms (physical barrier prevents transmission)
* Not sharing needles/sterilising needles whenever used

* Usually occurs in **diploid** cells
* **Diploid:** Having two complete sets of chromosomes, one from each parent.
* Before mitosis occurs, **DNA replication** occurs

### Importance

## Meiosis I

* Before Meiosis I, **DNA replication** occurs
* Meiosis I is also known as **reduction division**, as it results in daughter cells having half the number of chromosomes as before
* **Homologous chromosomes:*
* A pair of chromosomes, one from each parent. They have the same length, centromere position, and same gene loci, although they may have different alleles.
* In diploid cells, there are 2 chromosomes for each chromosome number
* Each of these pairs is called a **homologous*
* **Importance of reduction division:*
* During **fertilisation**, nuclei of **gametes*
* fuse into 1 nucleus
* gametes (23 chromosomes) fuse to give a **diploid*
* zygote (46 chromosomes), restoring the **diploid condition*
* This ensures that chromosome number stays constant and does not double with every successive generation

* **Synapsis** occurs: **Homologous chromosomes** pair up
* **Crossing over:*
* During **Prophase I**,crossing over may occur, exchanging **corresponding sections*
* of DNA between **non-sister chromatids*

## 4 Genetic variation

* Genetic variation is advantageous as the species is less susceptible to sudden environmental changes as it can better adapt and survive

**Independent assortment of chromosomes during metaphase**

* **Orientation** of homologous pairs of chromosomes is independent of other pairs
* Maternal/paternal chromosome could be **segregated** into either daughter cell
* (As a result, there are 2\({}^{\wedge}\)23 possible genetic combinations for human sperm and ovum.)

**Crossing over**

* During **Prophase I**, **crossing over** may occur, exchanging **corresponding sections** of DNA between **non-sister chromatids** of **homologous chromosomes**,* resulting in **new combinations of alleles** and **forming chiasmata**, increasing the **genetic variation** of the gametes

**Random fertilisation**

* Each parent produces **genetically different** gametes
* During fertilisation, a random sperm and a random egg meet, increasing the number of **offspring variants**

* **Chromosome**: A chromosome is a very long strand of DNA.
* In the nucleus, chromosomes are not yet condensed, and are in the loose form of chromatin. Chromosomes condense during cell division.

## 2 DNA to Protein

**Transcription:** The process where DNA is used as a template to synthesise a strand of mRNA.

* The 2 strands of DNA are separated
* One of the strands are used as a template to make a complementary strand of mRNA
* On mRNA, each **Thymine** (T) base is replaced with a **Uracil** (U) base.

**Translation:** The process where mRNA is used as a template to synthesise a sequence of amino acids, forming a polypeptide.

* mRNA leaves the nucleus to the cytoplasm
* **Ribosomes** attach to the mRNA, and read the sequence to decide how to synthesise the polypeptide
* Every 3 nucleotides of mRNA is called a **codon**, and mRNA codon codes for an **amino acid**
* mRNA dictates the **sequence of amino acids** in the **polypeptide**, which in turn determines the structure and function of the protein.

\({}^{\dagger}\)_Pro Tip: Do not worry about the details of transcription and translation. Only a brief understanding is needed to answer questions._

## 3 Genetic Engineering

**Genetic Engineering:** The technique used to transfer genes from one organism to another.

* Requires a **vector** (a vehicle that transfers genes)
* A commonly used vector is a **plasmid** (small, extrachromosomal circular DNA found in bacteria)
* **Transgenic organism:** An organism which contains foreign genes after gene transfer.

**Restriction enzymes**

* Naturally found in bacteria as defences against viruses
* Recognise a specific short nucleotide sequence, the **restriction site**
* They cut DNA there, resulting in **sticky ends** (where unpaired nucleotides can complementary base pair with another such strand to form double stranded DNA)

**Inserting gene into plasmid**

* A restriction enzyme is used to cut a section of DNA containing the human insulin gene, creating **sticky ends**
* The same **restriction enzyme** is used to cut a **plasmid**, creating **sticky ends**
* Plasmid and DNA are mixed, allowing them to **anneal** via **complementary base pairing** at the sticky ends
* **DNA ligase** is added to bond them together, the result is a **recombinant plasmid** which carries the insulin gene

**Inserting recombinant plasmid into bacteria**

* **Heat/electric shock** treatment is applied to the bacteria that create **pores** in their **plasma membranes** so they can uptake the **recombinant plasmids**
* Those bacteria become **transgenic** bacteria, and will produce insulin as part of their **metabolic processes**

_*Pro Tip: Only a small percentage of bacteria will successfully uptake plasmids. They can be isolated by mixing with an antibiotic that the recombinant plasmids make them resistant to._

**Gene:** A unit of inheritance that determines a specific trait in an organism. It is a sequence of nucleotides that codes for specific polypeptide, and has a particular gene locus.

* **Gene locus:** The location of a gene along a chromosome

**Genotype:** The combination of alleles an individual has for a trait

**Phenotype:** The trait that is expressed as a result of genotype

**Allele:** One of the alternative forms of a gene

* **Homozygous:** Two copies of an allele for a trait are present
* **Heterozygous:** One of each allele for a trait is present* _"Pro Tip: AA = homozygous dominant. aa = homozygous recessive. Aa = heterozygous, there is no such thing as heterozygous dominant/heterozygous recessive._
* **Dominant allele:** Always expressed regardless whether the individual is homozygous or heterozygous for the trait
* **Recessive allele:** Only expressed if the individual is homozygous recessive for the trait

**Co-dominance*:**When two different alleles for a particular trait are both expressed in an organism and influence phenotype.

* Let allele for red flower be \(\mathrm{I}^{\mathrm{R}}\)
* Let allele for white flower be \(\mathrm{I}^{\mathrm{W}}\)
* In a **heterozygous** individual (\(\mathrm{I}^{\mathrm{R}\mathrm{I}^{\mathrm{W}}}\)), if the phenotype turns out to be flowers with both red and white petals, these alleles are **co-dominant**.

**Incomplete dominance*:** When two different alleles are expressed resulting in phenotype being an intermediate between the two.

* Let allele for red flower be \(\mathrm{I}^{\mathrm{R}}\)
* Let allele for white flower be \(\mathrm{I}^{\mathrm{W}}\)
* In a **heterozygous** individual (\(\mathrm{I}^{\mathrm{R}\mathrm{I}^{\mathrm{W}}}\)), if the phenotype turns out to be pink flowers, these alleles show **incomplete dominance**.

* _"Pro Tip: Co-dominance and incomplete dominance can only be observed if individual is heterozygous for the trait._

**Multiple alleles:** When three or more alleles exist for a gene.

* e.g. for blood type there are the alleles: \(\mathrm{I}^{\mathrm{A}}\)\(\mathrm{I}^{\mathrm{B}}\)\(\mathrm{I}^{\mathrm{O}}\)* 1A1B are co-dominant
* 1O is recessive to IA and IB
*_Pro Tip: For co-dominance, incomplete dominance, multiple alleles and sex-linked inheritance, we represent alleles with superscripts, such as IR, IW._

## 2 Monohybrid cross

* Monohybrid cross involves 1 trait, with 2 alleles
* Genetic crosses can predict expected offspring ratios

**Discrepancy between observed and expected ratios**

* As **fertilisation** is a **random** process, the **genotype** of each offspring is based on **chance**
* The smaller the **sample size** of offspring, the greater the **discrepancy** would be

**Cross #1: 2 homozygous parents (pure-bred) with different alleles**

* *_Pro Tip: Pure-bred means offspring are homozygous for certain traits_

Let T represent allele for tall plant (dominant)

Let t represent allele for tall plant (recessive)

* *_Pro Tip: If letter used has capital and small letters which look very similar, (e.g. c and C), use c for the recessive allele to avoid ambiguity_

**Test Cross**

* Used to determine the **genotype** of an individual, as **heterozygous** and **homozygous dominant** individuals appear the same
* The individual is crossed with a **homozygous recessive** individual, eg?? X tt
* If individual is **homozygous dominant**, offspring would all express the dominant phenotype
* If individual is **heterozygous**, offspring ratio would be 1:1

* Hence they **survive** and **reproduce** better (passing on HbS allele)
* Thus the sickle-cell **allele** is most abundant in malaria-stricken regions (e.g. sub-Saharan Africa)

Down Syndrome

* During formation of sperm/egg, **non-disjunction/non-separation\({}^{*}\)** results in the resultant **gamete** having two copies of chromosome 21
* This can happen during anaphase I or anaphase II
* ***_Pro Tip: The older the mother, the higher the chance of non-disjunction occurring_**
* **Fertilisation** with a normal **gamete** then results in **zygote** having three copies of chromosome 21, causing Down Syndrome.
* Symptoms: Eyes that slant upward, flattened face, short neck, small ears, small hands and feet

6. Variation

\begin{tabular}{p{56.9pt} p{113.8pt} p{113.8pt}} \hline
**Type of variation** & **Discontinuous** & **Continuous** \\ \hline Phenotypes & **Few and distinct** & A range of phenotypes, with many intermediate forms \\ \hline \end{tabular}

## 7 Natural and Artificial Selection

**Natural selection:** The process whereby organisms better adapted to their environment tend to survive and reproduce.

* **Variation** exists between individuals
* Organisms face **selection pressures*
* eg. competition for limited resources, predators, disease outbreaks
* Individuals with favourable traits have a **selective Advantage**
* And are more likely to **Survive and reproduce**
* Hence passing on their **favourable alleles** to their **offspring**
* Over **Time**, more and more of the population have the favourable trait
* [OR, if question says evolution occurred, replace the above statement with this]: Accumulation of new genes by **mutation** and **natural selection** resulted in the evolution of the **species**.
* **"_Pro Tip: Natural selection is needed for evolution to occur, but natural selection can occur without evolution._**

_[Memory shortcut]_

* Explaining natural selection process [VAST]
* **V:** Variation exists between individuals
* **A:** selective Advantage
* **S:** Survive and reproduce, passing favourable alleles to offspring
* **T:** over **Time**, more and more of the population has the favourable trait

**Artificial selection:** The process whereby humans select and breed species to have desirable traits.

* Is also known as **selective breeding**
* Is done either through **hybridisation** or **inbreeding*** Examples where artificial selection is used:
* Wolves with desirable traits (docile/small/cute) were selectively bred, over time resulting in today's modern dogs.
* Soybeans with high oil content
* Breeding wagyu cows, for wagyu beef

**Hybridisation**

* Crossing different varieties (of the same species) to produce new varieties which have desired traits from both parents
* E.g. crossing a plant which has good fruit flavour with another that has attractive flower colour to yield plants that have both of the desired traits.

**Inbreeding**

* Plants/animals with desirable traits (e.g. higher yield crops/cuter animals) are chosen, and bred together
* **Offspring** with desired traits are **inbred** repeatedly over many generations (**inbreeding** involves crossing **closely related varieties**)

* **Pro Tip:**_Inbreeding is often used following hybridisation._

### 1. Food chains and food webs

* **Population:** A group of organisms of the same species that live together in a habitat
* **Habitat:** The place an organism lives
* **Community:** Comprises all the populations living and interacting with one another in a habitat
* **Ecosystem:** A community of organisms interacting with one another and with its abiotic environment
* **Biotic environment:** All the living organisms that an organisms interacts with in its habitat
* **Abiotic environment:** The climate and physical features of the surroundings in the habitat

**Food Chain:** A series of organisms through which energy is transferred in the form of food

* -> Tertiary Consumer etc.
* Each step in the food chain is a **trophic level** (the diagram above has 4 trophic levels)
* **Trophic level:** The feeding position that an organism occupies in a food chain.
* **Producers:** Organisms that make their own food from inorganic materials
* **Consumers:** Organisms that obtain food by feeding on other organisms

**Food Webs:**

* Made of interlinked food chains
* Shows the feeding relationships in a community

**2. Non-cyclic energy flow**

* **Producers are photosynthesising** plants that obtain their energy from the Sun
* This energy is transferred up the food chain in the form of **carbon compounds** when **producers** are eaten by **consumers**
* Some energy is used by organisms for **growth** and **repair*** The rest is **lost*
* As **heat*
* to the surroundings due to **cellular respiration*
* As chemical energy trapped within **excreted*
* and **egested*
* substances (eg. urine and faeces)
* As chemical energy trapped in the **uneaten parts*
* when an organism dies (e.g. bones)
* *_Pro Tip: Decomposers will use the above substances for cellular respiration, releasing energy as heat._
* Therefore, only **10%** of energy is actually passed on from one **trophic level** to the next
* Energy flow is thus linear and non-cyclic
* As energy is lost to the abiotic (non-living) environment, energy must be constantly provided (by the sun) to maintain ecosystems

## 3 Ecological pyramids

Pyramid of Energy
* Since energy is lost each round, the pyramid gets narrower further up
* As energy transfer is \(\sim\)10% efficient, energy of trophic level is 1/10th that of the trophic level under it

Pyramid of Biomass
* Biomass at each trophic level = total mass of all individuals of that organism type
* Usually, populations lower down the food chain are larger, their biomass is larger. This is why biomass pyramids are often upright
* Exception: Marine ecosystems, which have a smaller producer biomass (phytoplankton) compared to primary consumer (zooplankton).

*_Pro Tip: At any one point in time, when measured, the biomass of phytoplankton is smaller than zoo plankton. That is due to the fast rate that phytoplankton are being eaten. The ecosystem is still sustainable because phytoplankton reproduce very quickly, and many of them can be eaten by each zooplankton. The pyramids of energy and numbers for this food chain is still an upright one._

Pyramid of Numbers
* Usually, this pyramid is upright, as there are fewer organisms the higher the trophic level
* However if the producer is very large (e.g. a tree), can support large number of small consumers, pyramid shape will vary.
*_Pro Tip: The pyramid of biomass and energy are still upright for this food chain._
* A skewed shape also frequently occurs when the top predator is fed on by parasites, eg lice, such that the number of lice is a lot greater than the number of predators

**Carbon entering the Biotic system**

* \(\text{CO}_{2}\) from the atmosphere is absorbed by plants, **reduced** to form **glucose** during **photosynthesis**
* Glucose is also converted to other **carbon compounds** (e.g. starch)
* When consumers eat plants, **carbon** is transferred up the **food chain**
* Allowing **energy** to passed from one organism to another in the form of **carbon compounds**

**Carbon re-entering the Abiotic system**

* \(\text{CO}_{2}\) is released into atmosphere during **aerobic respiration** by producers, consumers and decomposers
* This maintains \(\text{CO}_{2}\) concentration in the atmosphere, so there is a constant supply of \(\text{CO}_{2}\) for **photosynthesis**
* **Fossil fuels** come from dead **organic matter** buried over long periods of time. When burnt for energy (**combustion**), it releases \(\text{CO}_{2}\) into the atmosphere

**Carbon Sink:** An area which stores carbon as carbon compounds indefinitely, and releases less carbon than it takes in.

* Trees take in CO2 through **photosynthesis*
* and use it to grow
* Trees can be buried and become **fossil fuels*
* after they die

* Carbon is used to make **shells*
* of shellfish such as clams, and the **exoskeletons*
* of corals, which stores carbon even after the organism has died
* take in CO2from the air during **photosynthesis**, and transfer their carbon to other organisms in the ocean when eaten
* As CO2 is **soluble in water**, it **dissolves*
* into the ocean
* Dead organisms may be buried at the **seabed*
* and become **fossil fuels**

**5. Impact of Man on the Ecosystem**

**Pollution:** The addition of substances to the environment that damage it, making it unfit for life.

**Bioaccumulation:** The process where certain substances are not excreted, and accumulate in the bodies of organisms over time.

* Toxic chemicals are taken up by organisms in contaminated water/when they eat food or prey containing these chemicals.
* Some toxic chemicals cannot be **exrected**, so they accumulate in organisms' bodies, **bioaccumulation** has occurred.
* These substances are usually non-biodegradable
* Biodegradable = capable of being decomposed by bacteria or other living organismsBioamplification/Biomagnification:** The process where a substance increases in concentration higher up the food chain.

* **Consumers** in each **trophic level** have to consume many organisms of the lower trophic level (due to inefficient energy transfer).
* Hence they ingest the toxic chemicals present in multiple organisms, and toxic chemicals accumulate in high concentrations within consumers. **Bioamplification/biomagnification** has occurred.
* The top consumer is most affected by the toxic chemicals as they are present in the highest concentrations, and could die if present in lethal concentrations.

Deforestation
* **Soil erosion*
* Tree roots hold soil together, and the forest canopy protects topsoil from force of rain
* With less trees, soil is more likely to be washed away

* Eroded soil may be deposited in rivers, blocking the flow of water
* Water level rises and floods surrounding areas

* After topsoil is eroded, barren land cannot support plant life
* Loss of **biodiversity*
* Organisms lose their habitats and may become extinct
* Increased **global warming*
* With fewer trees to absorb CO2 via photosynthesis, more CO2 would remain in the atmosphere
* Cutting of trees also releases CO2 when the remains are decomposed
* Since CO2 is a **greenhouse gas**, more of it in the atmosphere increases global warming

Uncontrolled fishing
* Catching too much fish leads to decline of their populations
* Eventually, certain species of fish may go extinct

**Eutrophication:** The process where a body of water receives excessive nutrients, leading to excessive growth of algae and floating water plants.

* Untreated sewage is dumped/fertilisers are washed by rain into a body of water * **Nutrients (Nitrates and phosphates)** in the untreated sewage/fertilisers allow **algae**/floating water plants to grow rapidly across the water surface (algae bloom)
* They block **sunlight** from reaching below, **submerged plants** have insufficient light for **photosynthesis** and die
* Other animals also die due to the lack of **dissolved oxygen**.
* **Aerobic bacteria** decomposes the dead **organic matter**, further decreasing **dissolved oxygen**.
* Hence, many organisms in the river die due to the lack of **dissolved oxygen** in area.

Sewage treatment

[noitemsep]

### Separation

* First, large materials are separated from sewage
* Solids suspended in sewage are then allowed to settle at the bottom of a tank (the **primary settlement tank**), these solids are called **sludge**

**Liquids**

* Liquid at the top flows into an **aeration tank**, where air is pumped in.
* The air provides **oxygen** for **aerobic bacteria** to break down **organic pollutants** in the water
* The cleaned water, called **effluent**, is then discharged into water bodies and will not cause **eutrophication**.

**Solids**

* Meanwhile, **sludge** at the bottom of the **primary settlement tank** is moved into an **anaerobic digester**.
* **Anaerobic bacteria** breakdown **organic matter** into **biogas** (mostly methane) which can be used as **fuel**.
* The remaining **sludge** is used as **fertiliser** or **incenerated**

**Environmental Biotechnology:** The use of biological processes to solve environmental problems.

* Eg. the use of microorganisms in sewage treatment
* Eg. using bacteria to clean up oil spills

**6. Conservation**

**Reasons for conservation**

* To preserve **biodiversity** (the range of species found in an ecosystem)
* **Extinction** of one species could affect the balance of the ecosystem
* Useful information can be obtained through scientific research of diverse organisms
* We rely on wild plants for certain medicines
* For obtaining food and raw materials sustainably (eg. fish, timber)
* Our crops rely on natural **pollinators** to reproduce
* Conserving **biodiversity** maintains a large **gene pool**, allowing us to improve crops and livestock by **cross-breeding** different varieties of wild plants with **favourable traits**
* Preserve natural scenery, which also brings economic benefits through tourism

**Means of conservation**

* Conserving fisheries* Ban fishing of **endangered species**
* Raise endangered species in **hatcheries**, then release them into **fishing grounds** to increase their population size
* Limit the periods of time when fishing can be done to allow fish to repopulate
* Ban **drift nets/dredges** as they trap all kinds of marine life **indiscriminately**
* Regulate size of fishing ships to limit how much they can catch
* Use nets of larger **mesh size** so young fish are not caught
* Conserving forests
* Cut trees selectively at a controlled rate
* Do not cut down young trees
* Plant seedlings to replace trees cut down
* Set up protected forest reserves
