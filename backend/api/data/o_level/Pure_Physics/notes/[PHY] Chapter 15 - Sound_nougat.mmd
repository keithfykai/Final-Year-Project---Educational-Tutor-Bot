When vibrating object alternately pulls or pushes on the layers of air adjacent to it, it causes small but rapid changes in air pressure.

**Compressions** are regions where particles are pushed closer together, resulting in higher pressure.

**Rarefactions** are regions where particles are pulled further apart, resulting in lower pressure.

ULTRASOUND

Ultrasound allows imaging because of the difference in time taken for the waves to return from different depths of the medium.

**Application:**

- Pre-natal scanning

- Sound navigation and ranging (sonar) to measure distances in air or water

- Quality control in manufacturing
- detector monitors strength of ultrasonic

signals

**ULTRASOUND**

An ultrasound is a type of sound wave that is above 20kHz.

**Human audible frequency** is between 20kHz and 20kHz.
