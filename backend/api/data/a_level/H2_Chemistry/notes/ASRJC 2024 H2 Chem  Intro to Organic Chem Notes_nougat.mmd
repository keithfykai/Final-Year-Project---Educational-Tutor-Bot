## II GENERAL PROPERTIES OF ORGANIC COMPOUNDS

1. Melting point and Boiling point Organic molecules generally have low melting points and boiling points. They are held by weak intermolecular forces of attraction (i.d.-i.d., p.d.-p.d. or hydrogen bonds) which can be overcome easily by heating.
2. Solubility Low solubility or insoluble in polar solvents (e.g. water) except when polar groups such as -OH, -COOH and -NH\({}_{2}\) are present in the molecule. Most organic compounds are only soluble in non-polar organic solvents, such as benzene and ether.
3. Thermal stability Organic compounds are usually thermally unstable, decomposing into smaller molecules when heated to temperatures above 500 \({}^{\circ}\)C. Example, when heated, butane-1,4-dioic acid decomposes as follows: 4. Flammability Many organic compounds are flammable and burn exothermically in a plentiful supply of air to yield carbon dioxide and water. Thus most fuels are organic compounds (e.g. oil, petrol and natural gas), and their combustion is our main source of heat energy. e.g. C\({}_{2}\)H\({}_{5}\)OH + 3O\({}_{2}\)\(\longrightarrow\) 2CO\({}_{2}\) + 3H\({}_{2}\)O
5. Reactivity Rate of organic reactions are usually slow compared to inorganic reactions. They usually require heating or the use of a catalyst to speed up reactions in the laboratory or in the industry. This is due to the high activation energy to break strong covalent bonds. For example, concentrated H\({}_{2}\)SO\({}_{4}\) is used as a catalyst in the esterification reaction.

## III Hybridisation in Organic Compounds

Covalent bonds are formed when atomic orbitals overlap. However, when one tries to derive the shape of a molecule using the overlap of atomic orbitals, sometimes its geometry does not correspond to the geometry as predicted by the VSEPR model (which is observed experimentally). For instance, in CH\({}_{4}\), if all the bonds on CH\({}_{4}\) are formed using s and p orbitals in C atom, since the three 2p orbitals that carbon used in bond formation are perpendicular to each other, wouldn't three of the four C-H bonds be 90\({}^{\circ}\) to each other? Why is there a tetrahedral arrangement of the four C-H bonds and all the bond angles 109.5\({}^{\circ}\) instead?

Hybridisation is a solution that reconciles the overlap of atomic orbitals with the VSEPR model to explain what is observed experimentally. It is essentially the mathematical mixing of atomic orbitals to create new orbitals (known as hybrid orbitals) which are used to form **sigma bonds** in bonding. (This will be illustrated in the examples on pages 5 to 10)

Combinations of different numbers of atomic orbitals give rise to different types of hybrid orbitals.

The hybrid orbitals take up a distinctive shape and relative orientation, depending on the number and type of atomic orbitals that have been mixed. The total number of atomic orbitals on an atom remains constant, and so the number of hybrid orbitals on an atom equals the number of atomic orbitals mixed.

In organic chemistry, our focus is hybridisation in molecules containing the carbon atom, although hybridisation can also be applied to molecules containing other atoms.

The first step in constructing the hybrid orbitals is the process of **excitation** where a 2s electron is promoted to a vacant 2p orbital of higher energy.

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|} energy & & \\ \hline
2p & excitation & 2p \\ \hline
2s & & 2s \\ \end{tabular}

The **3 types** of hybridisation (**sp\({}^{3}\)**, **sp\({}^{2}\)**, **sp**) will be illustrated using different compounds as examples.

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|} \hline  & Type of hybridisation & Example \\ \hline (a) & sp\({}^{3}\) & ethane, C\({}_{2}\)H\({}_{6}\) and methane CH\({}_{4}\) \\ \hline (b) & sp\({}^{2}\) & ethene, C\({}_{2}\)H\({}_{4}\) \\ \hline (c) & sp & ethyne, C\({}_{2}\)H\({}_{2}\) \\ \hline \end{tabular}

In short, to determine the hybridisation state of an atom, we can also make use of the following guidelines:

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|} \hline
**number and type of** & **number of** & **a** **S**hape about & **atomic** & **type of** & **hybrid** & *** **\% of s** \\
**number and type of** & **e**lectron & **hybridised C** & **orbitals** & **atomic** & **orbital** & **B**ond** & **character** \\
**bonds around atom** & **regions (bond** & **pairs + lone** & **electron** & **undergoing** & **orbitals** & **formed /** & **angle** & **in** \\
**pairs + lone** & **pairs)** & **e**lectron & **e**reigns & **hybridisation** & **unhybridised** & **hybridisation** & **state of atom** & **orbital** \\ \hline
4 single bonds & & & & & & & & \\ OR 4 \(\sigma\) bonds & & & & & & & & \\ H & 4 & & & & & & & \\ H & 4 & & & & & & & \\ E.g. & & & & & & & & \\ \hline
2 single bonds and 1 & & & & & & & & \\ double bond QR 3 \(\sigma\) bonds and 1 \(\pi\) bond & 3 & & & & & & & \\ H & 4 & & & & & & & \\ H & 4 & & & & & & & \\ E.g. & & & & & & & & \\ \hline
1 single bond and 1 & & & & & & & & \\ triple bond QR 2 \(\alpha\) bonds and 2 \(\pi\) bonds & 2 & & & & & & \\ E.g. H & 4 & & & & & & & \\ E.g. H & 4 & & & & & & & \\ \hline \end{tabular}

**Note:**

\({}^{\rm A}\)The hybridisation state of the carbon atom can be deduced from the shape about the C w.r.t number of electron regions (and vice versa). % s character is calculated based on relative contribution of s orbital in hybrid orbital. E.g. sp\({}^{3}\) hybrid orbitals is made up of one s orbital and three p orbitals. hence, one s orbital out of four orbitals in total is 25% s character. More details can be found on page 14.

### Checkpoint 2

What is the number of sp\({}^{2}\) hybridised carbon atoms present in the organic molecule **Y** as shown below?

### Note

The 2s and 2p orbitals of O and N atoms in molecule **Y** above can hybridise in the same way as the 2s and 2p orbitals of C atoms.

Here's the hybridisation state of O and N atoms in the above example.

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|} \hline \multirow{2}{*}{**Atom**} & \multicolumn{2}{c|}{**number of**} & \multirow{2}{*}{**Shape about the atom**} & \multirow{2}{*}{**Hybridisation**} \\  & **electron regions** & & \\  & **(bond pairs + lone pairs)** & & \\ \hline O & 3 & Trigonal planar & sp\({}^{2}\) \\ \hline N & 2 & Linear & sp \\ \hline \end{tabular}

### Effect of hybridisation on covalent bond strengths

One of the factors affecting bond strength is the hybridisation state of bonding atom.

* Hybrid orbitals are formed on mixing atomic orbitals of the same atom. Hence, a hybrid orbital formed on mixing the s orbital and p orbitals has partial s and p character.

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|} \hline \multirow{2}{*}{**Hybrid**} & \multicolumn{2}{c|}{**\% character in hybrid**} \\  & **orbital** & \\ \cline{2-3}  & **s** & **p** \\ \hline \(sp^{3}\) & 25 & 75 \\ \hline \(sp^{2}\) & 33 & 67 \\ \hline \(sp\) & 50 & 50 \\ \hline \end{tabular}

Recall in Chemical Bonding: Why are C-C bonds in graphite stronger than those in diamond?
* Carbon in graphite is sp\({}^{2}\) hybridised while the one in diamond is sp\({}^{3}\) hybridised.
* Greater s character in the hybrid orbital used to form bond will lead to:
* more effective overlap of the orbitals when forming bonds
* stronger bond formed
* shorter bond length
* Reason: Electrons in s orbitals are held more closely to the nucleus than electrons in p orbitals. Hence, hybrid orbital that has more s character will have its electrons held more closely to the nucleus and more strongly attracted to it, compared to one that has less s character.

Checkpoint 3 (N2008/119)

The bond lengths in buta-1,3-diene differ from those which might be expected.

The carbon-carbon bond length in ethane is 0.154 nm and in ethene 0.134 nm. The central single bond in buta-1,3-diene (C2-C3), however, is shorter than the single bond in ethane: it is 0.147 nm.

Which helps to explain this C2--C3 bond length?

* It is an _sp\({}^{2}\)_--_sp\({}^{2}\)_ overlap.
* It is an _sp\({}^{2}\)_--_sp\({}^{3}\)_ overlap.
* The electrons in the filled \(p\) orbitals on C2 and C3 repel each other.
* bond) overlap.

Answer:

Reason:

Both C2 and C3 have hybridised orbitals which have character resulting in effective overlap than the overlap in ethane molecule.

## IV. Classification of organic compounds

The simplest organic compounds are **hydrocarbons**, compounds containing only carbon and hydrogen. All other organic compounds (e.g. containing O, N, and halogen atoms) are derivatives of hydrocarbons.

1. **Saturated** hydrocarbons are hydrocarbons that contain only single bonds between the atoms.
2. **Unsaturated** hydrocarbons are hydrocarbons that contain double or triple bonds between atoms.
3. **Aromatic** hydrocarbons are hydrocarbons that contain at least one benzene ring. (We will discuss aromatic compounds in Arenes chapter.)
4. Non-aromatic hydrocarbons are often referred to as **aliphatic** hydrocarbons.
5. **A cyclic** (or alicyclic) hydrocarbon is one in which a chain of carbon atoms has formed a ring.

Many organic compounds consist of a hydrocarbon chain with one or more reactive groups attached. These reactive groups responsible for a characteristic chemical behaviour are called **functional groups**.

Each functional group has characteristic reactions, and are relatively unaffected by the size and shape of the hydrocarbon skeleton it is attached to. The characteristic reactions of the different functional groups will be covered in detail in subsequent topics.

For a compound containing more than one functional group, its properties as a whole can be predicted by considering the effect of each functional group present in the molecule.

Common functional groups:

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|} \hline
**Name of** & **Functional** & **General** & **Example** \\
**homologous series** & **group** & **formula** & **Example** \\ \hline Alkane & C-C & C\({}_{n}\)H\({}_{2n+2}\) & CH\({}_{4}\), C\({}_{2}\)H\({}_{6}\) \\ \hline Alkene & C=C\({}_{n}\)H\({}_{2n}\) & CH\({}_{2}\)=CH\({}_{2}\) \\ \hline Arene & C & Ar -- & \\ \hline Halogenoalkane & -- X (F, C\(l\), Br or I) & R -- X & CH\({}_{3}\)CH\({}_{2}\)Br \\ \hline Alcohol & -- OH & R -- OH & CH\({}_{3}\)CH\({}_{2}\)OH \\ \hline \end{tabular}

A **homologous series** is a series of organic compounds, with the same functional group, varying only in the length of the carbon chain.

Homologues are successive members of the series, with similar chemical properties since they contain the same functional group.

The molecular formulae of members of the series fit the same general formula. For adjacent members of the series, their molecular formulae differ by a fixed group of atoms.

While the length of carbon chain has little effect on the chemical reactivity of the functional group, it does affect physical properties (such as solubility, melting point and boiling point). Thus the physical properties change throughout the series in a regular way.

e.g. (straight-chain alkanes):

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|} \hline
**Name** & **Formula** & **Boiling point / \({}^{o}\)C** \\ \hline Methane & CH\({}_{4}\) & -164 \\ \hline Ethane & CH\({}_{3}\)CH\({}_{3}\) & -89 \\ \hline Propane & CH\({}_{3}\)CH\({}_{2}\)CH\({}_{3}\) & -42 \\ \hline Butane & CH\({}_{3}\)CH\({}_{2}\)CH\({}_{2}\)CH\({}_{3}\) & 0 \\ \hline \end{tabular}

_In our syllabus, the focus is not on naming a compound. Rather, it is being able to work from the name to the correct structural formula._

To work out the correct structural formula from the name, it is often easier to work backwards from the 'parent' hydrocarbon.

### **V. Types of representation**

Many organic compounds are more complex structurally than inorganic compounds. Several different types of formulae can be used to represent organic compounds, depending on the amount of information required.

1. **Empirical formula** - shows which elements are present in the compound, and the simplest ratio of the number of atoms of the elements present in one molecule. e.g. CH\({}_{2}\)O
2. **Molecular formula** - a multiple of the empirical formula; shows the actual number of atoms of each element present in one molecule. e.g. C\({}_{3}\)H\({}_{6}\)O\({}_{3}\)
3. **Structural formula** - shows how constituent atoms of a molecule are joined toether in a molecule. Can be _condensed_, _displayed_, _skeletal_ or _stereochemical_. e.g. CH\({}_{3}\)CH(OH)CO\({}_{2}\)H When answering questions, you need to show clearly how the groups of atoms are positioned in the molecule for an unambiguous structure, e.g. CH\({}_{3}\)CH\({}_{2}\)CH\({}_{2}\)OH for propan-1-ol, not C\({}_{3}\)H\(\prime\)OH.

**(i) Condensed formula** - each carbon atom is written separately, along with the atoms or groups attached to it. The bonds around each carbon atom are not explicitly shown.

C=C double bonds are shown in condensed formulae, where this makes the structure clearer. Branches in the carbon chains are indicated in brackets.

e.g.

**(ii) Full structural or Displayed formula** - detailed structure of molecule showing the relative placing of atoms and the number of bonds between them (single / double / triple).

e.g.

**(iii) Skeletal formula** - simplified representation of an organic formula derived from the structural formula by removing hydrogen atoms (and their associated bonds) and carbon atoms from alkyl chains, leaving just the carbon-carbon bonds in the carbon skeleton and

5. **Condensation** (or addition-elimination) - occurs when two reactants react to form a single product, with the elimination of a small molecule (such as water or HC_I_). e.g.
6. **Redox reactions in organic compounds** 1. **Oxidation** - a reaction in which the oxidation number of the reactive carbon/atom in the functional group increases. e.g. CH3CH2OH + 2 [O] CH3COOH + H2O
2. **Reduction** - a reaction in which the oxidation number of the reactive carbon/atom in the functional group decreases. e.g. CH3CN + 4 [H]  CH3CH2NH2

In equations for organic redox reactions, the symbols [O] and [H] are acceptable.

(iii) **Determination of Oxidation number of elements in organic species** Unlike metals, which are almost always in a positive oxidation state, the oxidation state of carbon can vary widely in organic species. When assigning oxidation numbers, the following rules apply:

* If atoms of the same element are bonded, 0 is assigned. 1. e.g. For C=C, oxidation number of each C is 0.
* For bonds between atoms of different elements, assign -1 to the more electronegative atom for each pair of bonding electrons. The other atom is assigned +1. e.g. C\(-\)H C\(-\)O N\(-\)H O\(-\)H C=O -1 +1 -1 -1 +1 -1 +1 +2 -2

## VIII. Applications

When you picked up your notes, your muscles were doing chemical reactions on sugars to give you the energy you needed. As you read these words now, your eyes are using an organic compound to convert visible light into nerve impulses and as you understand the notes, gaps between your brain cells are being bridged by simple organic molecules (neurotransmitter amines) so that nerve impulses can be passed around your brain. You did all that without consciously thinking about it! And all of these are related to organic chemistry!

Organic Chemistry is also known as the 'Chemistry of Life'. The clothes we wear, the plastics we use, the new drugs we take are all extension of organic chemistry. Here are some applications of organic chemistry in our daily lives.

### Example 1: SUNSCREEN

We all know how harmful the UV rays can be to our skin. Over exposure to the sun can result in pre-mature aging, skin cancer wrinkles, severe burns and age spots. Excessive exposure may also impede the body's immune system. Protection from UV rays makes the use of sunscreen important.

The useful principal ingredients in sunscreens are usually **organic** aromatic molecules conjugated with carbonyl groups.

Some common organic molecules found in sunscreen are avobenzene, octyl salicate and dioxybenzene.
