## Topic Synopsis

An understanding of _Genetics and Inheritance_ that would help make sense of the transition from molecular to organismal level. _Genetics and Inheritance_ provides the molecular basis to the understanding of how variations in populations arise and this is important in the study of biological evolution. At the cellular level, expression of genes involves cellular structures such as the nucleus, endoplasmic reticulum and ribosome. Many essential products of gene expression are enzymes involved in biochemical pathways which control physiological functions. As such, mutation of genes may give rise to dysfunctional proteins which in turn could result in diseases. Sickle cell anemia and cancer are raised as examples of a monogenic and a multigenic disease respectively.

The following questions should help students frame their learning:

* How does the genetic make-up of an organism and the environment influence the organism's appearance, behavior and survival?
* How does the inheritance of genetic information ensure the continuity of human as a species?

Mutation arises from imperfect replication of genetic information; together with other biological processes, such mutations increase genetic variation

Mutation, meiosis and sexual reproduction give rise to genetic variation within a population. Besides these, environmental factors are known to influence the phenotype of organisms. There are two kinds of genetic variations: continuous variation involves many genes, which have an addictive effect in controlling a characteristic; discontinuous variation involves one or just a few genes in controlling a characteristic. Besides these, environmental factors are known to influence the phenotype of organisms.

Expression of genes gives rise to functional products that affect biochemical reactions and physiological functions of organisms. This demonstrates how the genotype and phenotype of an organism are related. Besides its genotype, the environment also plays a role in determining the phenotype of an organism and this is related to the field of epigenetics. Some environmental factors include availability of nutrients and changes in temperature.

The chromosomal basis of inheritance sheds light on the pattern of transmitting genes from parents to offspring

When Gregor Mendel first started his investigations into inheritance, the concept of genes had not been used. He used the term 'traits' in place of genes. By using genetic diagrams, the phenotypic and genotypic ratios of filial generations can be predicted for crosses involving monohybrid or dihydrid inheritance. In line with Mendelian genetics, pedigree diagrams can be used to predict the probability of inheriting genetic diseases, such as haemophilia and Huntington's disease.

Non-Mendelian inheritance involves more complex traits. For example, alleles of some genes exhibit co-dominance or incomplete dominance and some genes have multiple alleles or are found on the sex chromosomes. Furthermore, phenotypes may depend on interactions between two or more genes, e.g. epistasis. In addition, inheritance of linked genes does not follow Mendelian laws; in predicting the phenotypic and genotypic ratios of filial generations for linked genes, the occurrence and frequency of crossing over has to be considered.

## Learning Outcomes

### Core Idea 2F: Inheritance

_This concept includes both Mendelian and non-Mendelian inheritance. Besides genetics, the environment also plays a role in determining the phenotype of an organism. Statistical tests, such as the chi-squared test, allow scientists to test the significance of differences between observed and expected results of genetic crosses._

Candidates should be able to:

**a)**: Explain the terms: locus, allele, dominant, recessive, codominant, incomplete dominance, homozygous, heterozygous, phenotype, genotype and linkage.
**b)**: Explain how genes are inherited from one generation to the next via the germ cells or gametes.
**c)**: Explain how genotype is linked to phenotype.
**d)**: Use genetic diagrams to solve problems in dihybrid crosses, including those involving codominance, incomplete dominance, multiple alleles, sex linkages, autosomal linkage and epistasis.
**e)**: Use genetic diagrams to solve problems involving test crosses.
**f)**: Explain the meaning of the terms linkage and crossing-over and explain the effect of linkage and crossing over on the phenotypic ratios from dihybrid crosses.
**g)**: Describe the interaction between loci (epistasis) and predict phenotypic ratios in problems involving epistasis. (Knowledge of the expected ratio for various types of epistasis is not required; focus of this section is on problem solving).
**h)**: Explain how the environment may affect the phenotype (including how diet affects the differentiation of honey bees and how temperature affects fur color of Himalayan rabbits).
**i)**: Explain the difference between genetic variation that is continuous (many, additive, genes control a characteristic) and discontinuous (one or few genes control a characteristic).
**j)**: Use the chi-squared test to test the significance of differences between observed and expected results.

## 1 Introduction

**Learning Outcome:**

**a)**: Explain the terms: locus, allele, dominant, recessive, codominant, incomplete dominance, homozygous, heterozygous, phenotype, genotype and linkage.
**b)**: Explain how genotype is linked to phenotype.

### 1 Definitions of terms

**a)**: Homologous chromosomes

**\(\bullet\)**: A diploid organism has two sets of chromosomes, one from each parent (Fig.** 1**).**

* Chromosomes of a homologous pair:

* **pair with each other during** **probphase I** of meiosis
* **have exactly the same order of gene loci**
* **have** **entromeres** in the same position and arms of the same length

Homologous chromosomes contain genes code for the same characteristics at the same gene loci. In this example, both chromosomes have all the same genes in the same locations (represented with colored strips), but alternative forms of those genes (represented by the different shades of each color).

**Fig.** 1**: A karyotype of a female (left) and a male (right) human. Note that in female, there are 23 pairs of homologous chromosomes, which includes the XX sex chromosomes. In male, there are 22 pairs of homologous chromosomes and XY sex chromosomes which are not homologous. Short segments at either end of the Y chromosome are the only regions that are homologous with the corresponding regions of the X. These homologous regions allow the X and Y chromosomes in males to pair and behave like homologous chromosomes during meiosis in the testes

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:6]

#### d) Allele

* Allele is an **alternative form of the same gene** responsible for variation in a particular characteristic.
* ** Allele of a gene** occupy the **same gene locus** on homologous chromosomes (Fig. 4).
* Allele s cause variation due to a **slight difference in the nucleic acid sequence**, which give rise to **different forms of the protein**. E.g. normal haemoglobin allele and mutated haemoglobin allele (Fig. 5a).
* Allele s occur in **pairs** in a **diploid individual**, and only **one of a pair** is represented in a **gamete**.
* Dominant allele
* An allele that is **fully expressed*
* in the **phenotype*
* even in the presence of an alternative allele, i.e. expressed **in both homozygous and heterozygous condition**. The allele is said to be **completely dominant*
* over the other.
* In a genetic diagram, this is often represented by an upper case letter (Fig. 4, PP for homozygous condition and Bb for heterozygous condition).
* Recessive allele
* An allele which is expressed in the **phenotype*
* only in the presence of another identical allele, i.e. expressed **only in homozygous condition**.
* The expression of the recessive allele is **masked*
* in a **heterozygote**.
* In a genetic diagram, this is often represented by _lower_ case letter (Fig. 4, aa for homozygous recessive and Bb for heterozygous condition).

Figure 5a: The mutated haemoglobin allele is a result of a single-base substitution that causes glutamic acid (GAA) to be replaced by valine (GUA). This change in amino acid sequence causes haemoglobin molecules to crystallize when oxygen levels in the blood are low. As a result, red blood cells sickle and get stuck in small blood vessels.

* Multiple alleles (_details in Section 3.3_)
* Gene that exists in **more than two allelic forms*
* in a **given population**.
* Regardless of the number of different alleles, **only two*
* of which can be present in a **diploid*
* E.g. the gene responsible for the ABO blood group of the human population exists in three forms - I\({}^{\text{A}}\), I\({}^{\text{B}}\) and I\({}^{\text{O}}\) (Fig. 1.5b).
* (_details in Section 3.1_)
* The phenomenon in which two alleles which are **expressed equally in the phenotype** of a heterozygote. They are said to be **codominant** with each other.
* E.g. blood group AB in humans is due to the expression of both the I\({}^{\text{A}}\) and I\({}^{\text{B}}\) alleles (Fig. 1.5).

#### 6.1.1 Incomplete dominance (details in Section 3.2)

* The phenomenon in which one allele for a specific trait is **not completely dominant** over the other allele, resulting in heterozygote offspring having a **phenotype** which is **intermediate** of that of the homozygous parents.
* E.g. crossing red snapdragon plants (RR) with white ones (rr) results in pink offspring (Rr).
* The presence of only one allele (R) does not provide enough pigment to give the flower a fully red colour, but only enough pigment to give the flower pink colour of the heterozygote (Rr).

Figure 1.5b: Codominance of allele I\({}^{\text{A}}\) and I\({}^{\text{B}}\) in the ABO blood group of humans and how the genotypes translates into the respective phenotypes. Note: \(P\) can be written as \(i\)

#### 1.1.1 Geneotype

* Genotype of the **genetic makeup of an organism** with respect to the alleles under consideration.
* Genotype of an organism can either be:
* Homozygous - It is the diploid condition at which the **alleles at a given locus*
* are **identical*
* (Fig. 1.4: _PP_ and _aa_, Fig. 1.5b: \(\hat{PA}\), \(\hat{PA}\) and \(\hat{PA}\))
* Heterozygous - It is the diploid condition at which the **alleles at a given locus*
* are **different*
* (Fig. 1.4: _Bb_, Fig. 1.5b: \(\hat{PA}\) and \(\hat{PA}\))

#### 1.1.2 Phenotype

* Phenotype is the **observable characteristics of an individual**. This is dependent on the genotype. In some cases, expression of the phenotype is determined by the interaction between the genotype and the environment (e.g. height). However, in others, environment does not affect the expression (e.g. eye colour).

#### 1.1.3 Pure line / breed true / pure breeding / truebreeding

* Members of a pure line are **homozygous at the gene loci** and are said to **breed true** (Fig. 1.6).
* The individual is either homozygous dominant or homozygous recessive, and **never heterozygous**. E.g. AABB, AAbb, aaBB.

#### 1.1.4 F\({}_{1}\) generation

* First filial generation produced by crossing 2 parental stocks (Fig. 1.6).

#### 1.1.5 \(\mathbf{F_{2}}\) generation

* Second filial generation produced by crossing two different \(\mathbf{F_{i}}\) organisms or by self-fertilization of the same \(\mathbf{F_{i}}\) organism (Fig. 1.6).

Figure 1.6: Crossing two true-breeding parents results in \(\mathbf{F_{i}}\) generation all exhibiting the dominant trait and \(\mathbf{F_{2}}\) generation exhibiting dominant and recessive traits in the ratio of 3:1

#### 1.1.1 Test cross

* An organism which shows the effect of a dominant allele can have two possible genotypes.
* For example, a pea plant which produces smooth seeds could either be homozygous dominant (SS) or heterozygous (Ss) for the gene.
* It is often necessary to determine the genotype accurately. This can be achieved by a **test cross**.
* A test cross is the **crossing of an organism having an unknown genotype with a homozygous recessive organism to determine the unknown genotype within one breeding generation**.
* A homozygous recessive individual is used because all its gametes will contain the recessive allele at the gene locus, which will not have any effect on the phenotype of the offspring.
* The phenotypic ratio of offspring from a cross involving a homozygous dominant individual and a heterozygote is different (Fig. 1.7).

#### 1.1.2 Reciprocal cross (Details in Section 4.3.3)

* A cross where the same genetic features are used but the **sexes are reversed**.
* A reciprocal cross is carried out **to determine whether the trait is sex-linked**. For sex-linked genes, reciprocal crosses give different F\({}_{1}\) results whereas for autosomal genes, the same F\({}_{1}\) results are expected.

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:11]

* From the data gathered, he published his paper "Experiment in Plant Hybridization" in 1866.
* Initially, his work was not well-received and created little impact. It was only in 1900, when his work was rediscovered by Hugo de Vries and Carl Correus, which led to the revelation of the **two fundamental principles of Heredity**. They are now known as the **Law of Segregation** and the **Law of Independent Assortment**.

Figure 1.9: Artificial cross breeding between varieties of pea plants

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:13]

* In Mendel's experiment (Fig. 2.2)
* A pure-breeding tall pea plant was crossed with a pure-breeding short pea plant. This is referred to as the parent generation.
* Seeds from the above cross were sown.
* The seeds germinated and developed into tall offspring. This is referred to as the first filial generation (F\({}_{1}\) generation).
* The F\({}_{1}\) plants were selfed.
* Seeds resulting from the selfing of F\({}_{1}\) were sown and the offspring were examined, classified and counted. This is called the second filial generation (F\({}_{2}\) generation).
* Results of Mendel's experiment:
* All the F\({}_{1}\) offspring were tall.
* About 75% of the F\({}_{2}\) generation were tall and 25% were short. In other words, the ratio of tall to short plants was approximately 3:1.
* About 25% of the F\({}_{2}\) offspring were of genotype TT, 50% were Tt and 25% were tt.

Figure 2.2: Mendelâ€™s pea experiment

* **Example 2.1a:** Genetic diagram illustrating the Law of Segregation In the garden pea, _Pisum sativum_, the allele for talliness is dominant to that for shortness. A pure-breeding tall plant was crossed with a pure-breeding short plant, producing the first generation offspring. Selling of the first generation plants produced the second generation offspring. Using suitable symbols, construct a genetic diagram to show the results of selfing the first generation plants.
* **Remarks (for your understanding)** _This has to be determined at the start if the symbols have not been given by the question. The capital letter represents the dominant allele and the lower-case letter represents the recessive allele._

* **Remarks (for your understanding)** _This has to be determined at the start if the symbols have not been given by the question. The capital letter represents the dominant allele and the lower-case letter represents the recessive allele.

* Test cross \(\circ\) For an organism displaying a dominant phenotype, its genotype may be homozygous (e.g. TT) or heterozygous (e.g. Tt). \(\circ\) For an organism displaying a recessive phenotype, it must have a genotype which is homozygous for the recessive allele (i.e. tt) \(\circ\) It may be of interest to a breeder to know the genotype of an organism displaying a dominant phenotype and the only way the genotype can be determined is to carry out a test cross. \(\circ\) **Test cross is the crossing of an organism having an unknown genotype with a homozygous recessive organism** to determine the unknown genotype within one breeding generation.
* **Example 2.1b**: Test cross From Mendel's experiment on the height of pea plants, the genotype of tall plants could either be TT or Tt. Explain, using a genetic diagram, how the results of a test cross allowed Mendel to determine if a tall plant is homozygous (TT) or heterozygous (Tt). _Scenario 1: If the genotype of a tall pea plant is TT..._

* _Practice Question 2.1a_ A breeder wanted to know the genotype of a black spotted female Dalmatian. In Dalmatian dogs, the allele for black spots is dominant to the allele for brown spots. The black spotted female was crossed with a brown spotted male, and a litter of 2 black puppies was produced. The breeder concluded that the female Dalmatian was homozygous for black spots. Explain if the breeder's conclusion was correct. _Genetic diagram:_ Key: **B** represents the allele for black spot **b** represents the allele for brown spot  The allele for black spot is dominant to the allele for brown spot _Scenario 1_ **Parental phenotype:** **Parental genotype (2n):** **Meiosis:** **Gametes (n):** **F**, genotype (2n):** **F**, phenotype:** **F**, phenotypic ratio:** _Scenario 2_ **Parental phenotype (2n):** **Meiosis:** **Gametes (n):** **F**, genotype (2n):** **F**, phenotype:** **F**, phenotypic ratio:** _Conclusion_* **Practice Question 2.1b*
* A species of poppy plant may have plain petals or petals with a large black spot near the base.
* If any two plants with spotted petals were crossed, the offspring always have spotted petals.
* If an unspotted plant is crossed with a spotted plant, the offspring can either be all unspotted or half will be spotted and half unspotted.

Explain this phenomenon with genetic diagrams.

For (a), spotted petals must be the recessive trait and hence plain petals the dominant trait.

For (b), the unspotted petal plant could either be homozygous to result in all offspring being unspotted or heterozygous to result in half of the offspring spotted or unspotted.

**A.**: 23
**B.**: 4
**C.**: 2
**D.**: 1

### 2.2 Dihybrid inheritance & Mendel's 2nd law - Law of Independent Assortment

1. Mendel identified his second law by following **two characteristics at the same time** - seed colour (yellow or green) and seed shape (round or wrinkled). From monohybrid crosses, Mendel knew that the allele for yellow seed is dominant while the allele for green seed is recessive. Similarly, the allele for round seed is dominant to the allele for wrinkled seeds.

 Biology Unit, Tampines Meridian JC

Figure 2.3: Mendelâ€™s Second Law â€“ Law of Independent Assortment. Figure shows movement of chromosomes during meiosis I and II and how the alleles of the two genes segregate independently in the process. The 2 genes, with their respective alleles (i.e. Y & y, R & r) are present on two different pairs of homologous chromosomes.

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:22]

* Relating Example 2.2a to Mendel's First and Second Laws,
* Each gamete carries only one allele of every pair of alleles (i.e. one allele for colour, one allele for shape).
* The gametes of the first parent carry one R allele and one Y allele.
* The gametes of the second parent carry one r allele and one y allele.
* The gametes of an F\({}_{t}\) individual come in four possible combinations: RY, Ry, rY, ry. There is a **1 in 4 chance*
* of a gamete containing any of the four combinations of alleles.
* From the Punnett square, the probability each of the F\({}_{2}\) phenotype is as follows:
* round and yellow seeds = 9/16
* round and green seeds = 3/16
* wrinkled and yellow seeds = 3/16
* wrinkled and green seeds = 1/16

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:25]

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:26]

### 2.3 Summary of Mendel's hypotheses

The six points below summarize the nature of Mendelian genetics (Fig. 2.3):

1. **Each characteristic** of an organism is **controlled by a pair of alleles**.
2. If an organism has two different alleles for a given characteristic, one may be expressed (**dominant allele**) to the total exclusion of the other (**recessive allele**).
3. During meiosis, **each pair of alleles segregates** and **each gamete receives one of each pair of alleles** [Law of Segregation].
4. During meiosis / gamete formation, **the segregation of a pair of alleles is independent of the segregation of another pair of alleles** [Law of Independent Assortment].
5. **Each allele is transmitted** from generation to generation **as a discrete unchanging unit**.
6. Each organism inherits **one allele** for **each characteristic** from **each parent**.

**NOTE:** The mechanism of dihybrid inheritance only applies to characteristics controlled by genes on **different** chromosomes (i.e. unlinked genes). Genes situated on the 1. sex chromosome (i.e. sex linkage, _Section 4.3_) and 2. same autosome (i.e. autosomal linkage / linked genes, _Section 4.1_) do not show this pattern of independent assortment.

Figure 2.4: Movement of chromosomes during meiosis I and II and how the alleles are segregated independently in the process.

## 3 Interaction between Alleles of a Gene

**Learning Outcome:**

**c)** Use genetic diagrams to solve problems in dihydrid crosses, including those involving codominance, incomplete dominance, multiple alleles.

### _Codominance_

* In _Section 2_, the dominant allele shows complete dominance over the recessive allele. However, for some other genes, alleles may show different degrees of dominance and recessivity in relation to each other.
* Alleles of a gene may be **expressed equally in the phenotype of the heterozygote**. This condition is known as **codominance**.
* Examples include: blood type AB in humans and coat colour in cattle.
* In cases where codominance of alleles exists, the gene should be designated by an upper case letter and the alleles be indicated by appropriate superscript upper case letter. \(\circ\)\(\mathrm{I}^{\mathrm{A}}\) and \(\mathrm{I}^{\mathrm{B}}\) for the blood antigen A and blood antigen B respectively. \(\circ\)\(\mathrm{C}^{\mathrm{R}}\) and \(\mathrm{C}^{\mathrm{W}}\) for the red coat and white coat of cattle respectively.

**Example 3.1**

The molecular basis of the human ABO blood group is shown below:

A woman with blood group A, whose father is blood group O, marries a man with blood group AB. Construct a genetic diagram to show the blood group of their children.

_Genetic diagram:_

\begin{tabular}{l l l l l} \multicolumn{6}{l}{_Genetic diagram:_} \\ \multicolumn{6}{l}{Parental phenotype:_} \\ \multicolumn{6}{l}{Parental genotype:_} \\ \multicolumn{6}{l}{Gametes produced:} \\ \multicolumn{6}{l}{Genotype of offspring:_} \\ \multicolumn{6}{l}{H\(\mathrm{A}^{\mathrm{O}}\)} \\ \multicolumn{6}{l}{H\(\mathrm{B}^{\mathrm{O}}\)} \\ \multicolumn{6}{l}{Phenotype of offspring:_} \\ \multicolumn{6}{l}{Blood grp A} \\ \multicolumn{6}{l}{Blood grp A} \\ \multicolumn{6}{l}{Blood grp AB} \\ \multicolumn{6}{l}{Blood grp B} \\ \multicolumn{6}{l}{Phenotypic ratio:} \\ \multicolumn{6}{l}{2A:1AB:1B} \\ \end{tabular}

Figure 3.1: How the ABO blood group works.

Explanation for codominance:

* The four blood groups (A, B, AB and O) is a result of different combinations of 3 alleles I\({}^{\text{A}}\), I\({}^{\text{B}}\) and I\({}^{\text{O}}\)
* I\({}^{\text{A}}\) codes for an enzyme the converts antigen H to antigen A on red blood cells
* I\({}^{\text{B}}\) codes for another enzyme that converts antigen H to antigen B on red blood cells
* I\({}^{\text{O}}\) codes for a non-functional enzyme. Antigen H remains as it is (blood group O).
* The **alleles I\({}^{\text{A}}\) and I\({}^{\text{B}}\)** are **codominant**. A heterozygote (I\({}^{\text{A}}\)I\({}^{\text{B}}\)) produces both enzymes, resulting in both antigen A and B on red blood cells.
* Both alleles I\({}^{\text{A}}\) and I\({}^{\text{B}}\) are dominant to the I\({}^{\text{O}}\) allele

### Incomplete dominance

* Incomplete dominance describes the general situation in which the phenotype of a heterozygote is **intermediate** between the two homozygous parents.
* At the molecular level, incomplete dominance is generally caused by a **quantitative effect** of a **wild-type** (normal/non-mutated) **allele**. i.e. the amount of protein synthesized.
* Crossing a red snapdragon plant with a white one results in offspring which are pink.

* Biochemical basis of incomplete dominance in snapdragon plant:

* R represents the allele that codes for an enzyme that synthesizes red pigment
* r represents the allele that codes for a non-functional enzyme that cannot synthesize any pigment
* RR genotype
* Sufficient enzymes present > large amount of red pigments synthesized > red colour
* R genotype
* Insufficient enzymes present > small amount of red pigments synthesized > pink colour
* rr genotype
* No enzymes > No pigments synthesized. Hence, white colour.

## 4 Linkage

**Learning Outcome:**

**c)** Use genetic diagrams to solve problems in dihybrid crosses, including those involving sex linkages, autosomal linkage.

**d)** Explain the meaning of the terms linkage and crossing-over and explain the effect of linkage and crossing over on the phenotypic ratios from dihybrid crosses.

### Autosomal linkage

* Mendelian genetics deal with inheritance of genes situated on **different** chromosomes. However, it does not explain inheritance of genes situated on the same chromosome.

**Key concept 3:**

* Genes situated on the **same chromosome** are said to be **linked**. All genes on a single chromosome form a linkage group and usually pass into the same gamete and are inherited together. As a result of this, **genes belonging to the same linkage group usually do not show independent assortment**.

**Example 4.1** - _Morgan's experiment_ shows how linkage between genes (i.e. genes on the same chromosome) affects the inheritance of the two different characteristics:

\begin{tabular}{l l} \hline \hline \multicolumn{1}{c}{_Unlinked genes vs linked genes:_} \\  & [http://bcs.whfreeman.com/thelfewire/content/chp10/1002002.html](http://bcs.whfreeman.com/thelfewire/content/chp10/1002002.html) \\ \hline \(\circ\) & Morgan studied two characteristics of the fruitfully (_Drosophila melanogaster_), body colour and wing length. The normal flies have the dominant alleles for grey body and normal wings. The mutant flies have the recessive alleles for black body and vestigial wings. \\ \(\circ\) & When true breeding flies having grey body (b\({}^{+}\)) and normal wings (vg\({}^{+}\)) were mated with flies having black body (b) and vestigial wings (vg), all F\({}_{1}\) offspring had grey body and normal wings. \\ \(\circ\) & The female F\({}_{1}\) flies were then mated with a **homozygous recessive** male (a test cross). \\ \(\circ\) & If the genes for body colour and wing length were _located on different chromosomes_ and _assorted independently_ (i.e. unlinked), explain the expected result of the test cross using a genetic diagram. \\ \multicolumn{1}{c}{_Genetic diagram (test cross):_} \\  & Parental Phenotype: & grey body, normal wing & x \\  & Parental Genotype (2n): & b\({}^{+}\) b vg\({}^{+}\) vg & b b vg\({}^{+}\) vg \\  & Gametes (n): & \({}^{+}\) vg\({}^{+}\) vg & b vg\({}^{+}\) vg \\  & Genotype (2n) & & Black body, \\  & And phenotype & & \\  & Of offspring: & & \\The actual result from Morgan's experiment, however, differed from the expected Mendelian ratio (Fig. 4.1).
* There were **disproportionately large numbers of offspring with parental phenotypes -** grey body/normal wings and black body/vestigial wings.
* Offspring with **non-parental** (also known as **recombinant**) **phenotypes**, grey body/vestigial wings and black body/ normal wings were **present in small numbers**.

Morgan's explanation:

* The genes for these 2 characteristics are on the **same chromosome** (i.e. they are **linked**).
* They are therefore usually **inherited together**.
* The appearance of the **non-parental (recombinant) phenotypes is due to crossing over during **prophase I of meiosis**.
* There will be **no fixed ratio** for offspring of different phenotypes.

Figure 4.1: Results of Morganâ€™s experiment â€“ expected VS observed ratios

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:34]

* Crossing over results in **genetic recombination**. The gamete that contains the recombinant chromatid is known as **recombinant gamete**. The offspring that exhibits new combinations of characteristics that are different from their parents are known as **recombinant**.
* This sequence of events accounts for the occurrence of recombinant phenotypes in Morgan's test cross.

**Key concept 4:**

* If the two genes are **tightly linked** (i.e. very close together on the same chromosome), they would be **inherited as one unit**. There would not be recombinants as **crossing over is very unlikely to occur** between the two loci.

**Key concept 5:**

* The **further apart the linked genes** are on the chromosomes, the **greater the possibility of crossing over** occurring between them. Therefore, the **greater the cross over frequency** (in percentage):

Based on Morgan's experiment (Fig. 4.1), recombination frequency is calculated by:

\begin{tabular}{c c c c c} No. of individuals showing recombination & \(\times\) & 100\% & = & (206 + 185) & \(\times\) & 100\% & = 17\% \\ Total no. of offspring & & & & & \\ \end{tabular}

_Test Yourself_

In a particular species of plants, 'round seeds' and 'hairy leaves' are genes which are **tightly linked** (i.e. adjacent to each other). Pure bred, round-seeded, hairy leaves plants are crossed with pure bred, flat-seeded, hairless plants to produce only round-seeded, hairy plants in the \(F_{i}\) generation. These \(F_{i}\) plants were then test-crossed.

Which phenotypic ratio would be expected from the test cross?

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|} \hline  & Round seed & Round seed & Flat seed & Flat seed \\  & Hairy & hairless & hairy & hairless \\ \hline
**A** & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\

### 4.3 Sex linkage

* Genes carried on the sex chromosomes are said to be **sex-linked**.
* The Y chromosome is smaller than the X chromosome, and carries very few genes compared to the X chromosome, which carries over 1,000 genes. There is a portion of the X chromosome with no homologous region on the Y chromosome.
* Characteristics that are determined by genes carried on the non-homologous region of the X chromosome will appear in males even if they are recessive (Fig. 4.7). Thus, males have a higher tendency to inherit sex-linked diseases as they only have one X chromosome, whereas females have two X chromosomes.

* Examples of sex-linked conditions:

* Representing sex-linked characteristics in a genetic diagram:
* Capital letters X and Y represent the sex chromosomes.
* Superscript capital letter represents a dominant allele carried on the X chromosome (e.g. **X\({}^{\textbf{a}}\)**).
* Superscript small letter represents a recessive allele carried on the X chromosome (e.g. **X\({}^{\textbf{a}}\)**).
* In all sex-linked traits, **females** who are **heterozygous** are described as **carriers** of the trait. They are **phenotypically normal** but half of their gametes carry the recessive allele.
* The possible genotypes and phenotypes for sex-linked traits:

* the disease-causing allele is recessive_

### Identifying inheritance pattern

* **Autosomal dominant (Fig.** 5.3**)** 

* This trait is determined by a dominant allele because

every affected individual has at least an affected parent

it appears in every generation

* This trait is autosomal (i.e. not sex-linked) because

equal numbers of males and females are affected

male (III-4) passes the trait to his son (IV-1). In sex-linked, father contributes the Y-chromosome to his son hence does not pass on the X-linked disease to his son.

* This trait is determined by a recessive allele because

an affected individual (II-3) may have unaffected parents (I-1 and I-2)

the recessive trait skipped a generation

This trait is autosomal (i.e. not sex-linked) because

Unaffected heterozygote parents (I1 and I2) each passed a copy of the recessive allele to the affected daughter (II3). If the recessive allele is sex-linked, the daughter (II3) would **not** be affected as she would inherit the dominant allele on the X chromosome (normal) from the unaffected father (I1).

Figure 5.4: A pedigree showing a pattern of inheritance for an autosomal recessive trait

Figure 5.3: A pedigree showing a pattern of inheritance for an autosomal dominant trait* This trait is determined by a sex-linked recessive allele because
* none of the sons of an affected male (and an unaffected female) is affected
* sons of an affected female are affected (not shown in Fig. 5.5)
* more males than females are affected
* Sex-linked dominant (Fig. 5.6)
* This trait is determined by a sex-linked dominant allele because
* All daughters of an affected male individual are affected.
* An affected male does not pass the disease to his sons, since sons receive Y chromosome from their father.

## 6 Gene Interactions

**Learning Outcome:**

**c)** Use genetic diagrams to solve problems in dihydrid crosses, including those involving epistasis.

**f)** Describe the interaction between loci (epistasis) and predict phenotypic ratios in problems involving epistasis. (Knowledge of the expected ratio for various types of epistasis is not required; focus of this section is on problem solving).

* In the patterns of monohybrid and dihydrid inheritance covered thus far, the focus was on the development of a **single characteristic** governed by **one gene locus** (_monohybrid inheritance_) or **two characteristics** governed by **two gene loci** (_dihydrid inheritance_).

**Key concept 6:**

* The development of a **single characteristic** may also be due to the interaction between **two or more genes**, rather than just a single gene. This phenomenon is known as **gene interaction**.

### Two-Gene interaction can produce a 9:3:3:1 ratio

* A cross involving a **two-gene interaction** (interaction of their products) can produce a **9:3:3:1** ratio in offspring when **four distinctive phenotypes** of a characteristic/trait are produced.

**Example 6.1** - Inheritance of shape of comb in domestic fowl (_N07/P2/QS_)

The genotype R-pp gives a rose comb, rrP- gives a pea comb, R-P- gives a walnut comb and rpp gives a single comb. The dash (-) indicates the presence of either the dominant or recessive allele. List all the genotypes which will produce a walnut phenotype.

Bateson and Punnett demonstrated gene interactions by crossing chickens with rose combs (pure line) with chickens with pea combs (pure line). All the resulting F1 offspring differed from both the parents and has walnut combs. When pairs of these F1 offspring were allowed to interbreed, they produced the resulting F2 ratio:

9 walnut comb : 3 pea comb : 3 rose comb : 1 single comb

Explain the above crosses using a genetic diagram.

### Conclusion

* shape of comb (unlike Mendelian dihybrid inheritance)
* The alleles of these two genes interact to give rise to four phenotypes:
* Pea comb is determined by presence of dominant P allele
* Rose comb is determined by presence of dominant R allele
* Walnut comb is determined by presence of at least one of each dominant allele for pea and rose comb (i.e. P-R-)
* Single comb is determined by homozygous recessive condition (i.e. pprr)

### Epistasis produces modified 9:3:3:1 ratios

**Key concept 7:**

**Epistasis** is used to describe the situation in which the product of one gene (Gene A) can inhibit / interfere with the phenotypic effects of a different gene (Gene B).

Gene A is said to be **epistatic** to Gene B.

Gene B is said to be **hypostatic** to Gene A.

**Key concept 8:**

Many different ratios can result from different cases of epistasis (Fig. 6.1), but they are, in essence, modified form of the 9:3:3:1 Mendelian dihybrid ratio when a **cross is conducted between 2** heterozygotes (AaBb X AaBb).

#### 6.2.2 Plumage colour in chicken - 13:3 ratio

In the inheritance of feather colour in chickens there is an interaction between two autosomal gene loci, **ii** and **C/c**. Individuals carrying the dominant allele, **i**, have white plumage even if they also carry the dominant allele, **C**, for coloured plumage.

White Leghorn chickens have the genotype **IICC**, while white Wyandotte chickens have the genotype **iicc**. A white Leghorn is crossed with a white Wyandotte.

Use a genetic diagram to show the expected genotypes and phenotypes and their ratios in the **F**\({}_{1}\) and **F**\({}_{2}\) generations.

_Gene coding for white plumage (ii locus)_

* The product of allele I inhibits the phenotypic effect of the C allele.
* Allele I is **epistatic*
* to the colour gene C. This is known as **dominant epistasis*
* (the presence of **one*
* copy of the epistatic dominant allele interferes with the phenotypic expression of the hypostatic gene).
* Individuals that carry the dominant allele, I, have white plumage even if they carry the dominant allele C for colour (I-C-).
* Individuals which are homozygous recessive for the colour gene (--cc) will also have white plumage.
* For coloured plumage to develop, individuals must have genotype iiC-.

#### Colour of summer squash- 12:3:1 ratio

In the inheritance of fruit colour in summer squash, there is an interaction between two autosomal gene loci, **W**w**w and **Y**f**y. Plants carrying the dominant allele, **W**, develop white fruits even if they also carry the allele, **Y**, for yellow fruits or **y**y for green fruits.

A plant homozygous dominant for the two genes is crossed with a plant homozygous recessive for the two genes. Predict the phenotypic ratio of the F\({}_{2}\) offspring.

_Gene coding for inhibition of colour deposition (W/w locus)_

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:56]

* Biochemical basis and conclusion:
* **Duplicate recessive genes -*
* The same phenotype is produced as long as **one gene locus is homozygous recessive (aa--, --bb, or aabb).*
* When dominant alleles of both loci are present together (A-B-), they **complement*
* each other to produce a different phenotype.
* The two precursor molecules (X and Y) of the purple pigment authocyanin are colourless.
* Conversion of X to Y is catalysed by an enzyme C, while conversion of Y to anthocyanin is catalysed by an enzyme P.
* Synthesis of functional products C and P is directed by alleles C and P respectively. Alleles C and P synthesize non-functional enzymes.
* Plants with at least one C and one P allele (C-P-) would have purple flowers.
* Plant with genotype --pp has white flowers since it cannot produce functional enzyme P.
* Plant with genotype cc-- has white flowers since it cannot product functional enzyme C.
* Plant with genotype ccpp has white flowers since both enzymes C and P are non-functional.

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:58]

* Biochemical basis and conclusion:
* Both genes code for enzymes that influence the fruit shape equally.
* In the absence of dominant alleles (aabb), no enzymes are synthesized to convert the precursor molecules, hence the fruit is long.
* A **dominant allele at either locus*
* (A---- or ----B) will code for either enzyme A or B which ensures a sphere-shaped fruit.
* If the **dominant allele*
* from **both loci*
* (A-B-) are present, both enzymes are synthesized to flatten the fruit into a disc shape. This is known as **duplicate genes with cumulative effect**.

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:64]

(Step 6)

Given that the number of degrees of freedom = 1, the value of \(\chi^{2}\) = 4.0 is larger than the critical value of 3.84, i.e. probability values smaller than 0.05 (5%).

This means that the probability that the deviation is due to chance is less than 5% (i.e. P < 0.05).

The deviation is therefore significant, and not due to chance. Reject Null Hypothesis.

(Step 7)

_Conclusion:_

There difference between the observed and the expected results is significant.

Hence we cannot assume that the parents are heterozygous.

_Example 8.2_

Domestic chicken with walnut combs were crossed with each other. In the event, the 160 offspring produced 93 individuals with walnut combs, 24 with rose combs, 36 with pea combs and 7 with single combs. Do these results show that the parents were heterozygous?

## 8 Variations

**Learning Outcome:**

**g)**: Explain how the environment may affect the phenotype (including how diet affects the differentiation of honey bees and how temperature affects fur color of Himalayan rabbits).
**h)**: Explain the difference between genetic variation that is continuous (many, additive, genes control a characteristic) and discontinuous (one or few genes control a characteristic).

* The term **variation** describes the difference in characteristics shown by organisms belonging to the same natural population or species. Variation contributes to diversity among organisms.
* Variation is a result of genes, environment, and interaction between genes and environment.
* A study of the phenotypic differences in any large population shows that two forms of variation occur, discontinuous and continuous. Studies of variation in a character involve measuring the expression of that characteristic in a large number of organisms within the population, such as height in humans. The results are plotted as histograms or a graph which reveals the frequency distribution of the variations of that characteristic within the population (Fig. 8.1).

### 8.1 Discontinuous variation

* There are certain characteristics within a population which exhibit variations which are **discrete**. Discrete variation produces individuals **showing clear cut differences with no intermediates** between them. Examples include blood groups in humans, wing lengths in _Drosophila_ and sex determination in animals and plants.
* It is usually **controlled by one or two major genes** with 2 or more allelic forms. In discontinuous variation, phenotypic expression is **relatively unaffected by the environment**. It is also known as **qualitative inheritance** and is an important type of inheritance in unravelling the laws of heredity.

Figure 8.1: (Left) A bar chart representing frequency distribution of discontinuous variation and (right) a histogram representing continuous variation

### Continuous variation

* **Continuous variation** can be defined as a type of variation where the characteristic shows a **complete gradation** from one extreme to the other without any break. This is illustrated most clearly by characteristics such as mass, height, shape and colour of organs and organisms
* Continuous variation is produced by the **combined effect of many genes (polygenes) and the environment.** The effect of each of these individual genes is too small to be of any significant impression on the phenotype. There is however infinite variety produced by the combined effects of all these genes (polygenes). It is thus known as **quantitative inheritance**.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|p{113.8pt}|p{113.8pt}|p{113.8pt}|} \hline Features & Discontinuous variation & Continuous variation \\ \hline  & Determined by **one or a few** genes and the effects of each gene is discernible. & Determined by **many** genes i.e. polygenic trait. \\ Number of genes & Different alleles at a single gene locus have **large effects** & These different gene loci have the same and often **additive effect** on the phenotype. Different alleles at a gene locus have small effects. \\  & Different gene loci have quite different effects on the phenotype. & Hence the phenotypic expression is the result of the combined effect of all these genes (or alleles). \\ \hline Types of phenotypic classes & Discrete groups & A range of values between two extremes. \\ \hline Method of measurement & By recognition of **different qualities** and summation of all the traits. & By recognition of **quantity** through measurement e.g. mean, standard deviation. \\ \hline Type of inheritance & Qualitative & Quantitative \\ \hline Effects of environment & No effect & Affected by environment Phenotype = Genotype + Environment \\ \hline Examples & Blood groups, wing length in _Drosophila_, sex determination in animals and plants & Height, number of eggs laid, amount of milk production \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 8.1: Comparison between discontinuous and continuous variation.

### Sources of variation

As a result of the interaction between continuous and discontinuous variations and the environment, no two organisms will possess identical phenotypes. Many factors contributed to this variation within a population:

* Gene reshuffling
* Gene mutation
* Chromosomal mutation/aberrations
* Environment

#### 8.3.1 Gene reshuffling

* Gene reshuffling is the basis for continuous variation. The mechanisms that contribute to genetic variation during meiosis and fertilization during sexual reproduction include:

* Crossing over during promise I of meiosis.
* Independent assortment and segregation of homologous chromosomes during metaphase I and anaphase I of meiosis respectively
* Independent assortment and segregation of chromatids during metaphase II and anaphase II of meiosis respectively (if crossing over occurred previously)
* Random fertilization of gametes

* Crossing over during prophase I of meiosis
* During prophase I of meiosis:

* Homologous chromosomes pair up.
* Chiasmata form between non-sister chromatids of homologous chromosomes.
* Corresponding non-sister chromatids may break and rejoin at any point along their length where chiasmata formed.
* As a result, corresponding alleles are exchanged (Fig. 8.2)
* Chiasmata can occur almost anywhere on the chromatids, and the number of chiasmata may vary from zero to as many as eight. The amount of genetic variation resulting from this reshuffling of alleles between homologous chromosomes can be infinite.
* This produces new linkage groups and so provides a major source of genetic recombination of alleles. The exact genotypes produced depend on the number of chiasmata and the positions of the genes relative to the sites of crossing over. (Fig. 8.3)
* Crossing over is **not the same as mutation** as crossing over does not create new genes / alleles. It merely reshuffles the alleles.

Figure 8.3: Chiasmata can form at various positions between the two non-sister chromatids, resulting in variation in the genotype of gametes at the end of meiosis

Figure 8.2: Crossing over during problem I results in non-genetically identical gametes (parental and recombinant genotypes) at the end of meiosis

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:71]

d) Random fertilization of gametes
* The random nature of fertilization (Fig. 8.6) adds to the genetic variations arising from crossing over and independent assortment and segregation of chromosomes in meiosis.
* A zygote is formed when an ovum (1 of approximately 8 million) is fertilized by a single sperm cell (1 of approximately 8 million possible combinations).
* Without considering crossing over, random fusion of sperm and egg will produce a zygote with any of the over 70 trillion diploid combinations (2\({}^{23}\) x 2\({}^{23}\)).
* If crossing over is considered, the number of possibilities is infinite.

Figure 8.6: Together with independent assortment and segregation, random fertilization adds on to the genetic variation of offspring. (2n = 4) is used here as an illustration.

Figure 8.5: Independent assortment and segregation of chromatids at metaphase II and anaphase II further result in different chromosomal combinations. Note that crossing over has occurred during promise I.

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:73]

## 9 Effect of Environment on Phenotypes

* In natural systems, organisms face a multitude of ecological challenges and often respond with phenotypic shifts. Because organisms experience multiple selective and/or inducing agents, observed phenotypes generally reflect the influence of multiple environmental variables, in addition to other evolutionary factors (e.g. gene flow, genetic drift, genetic/developmental constraints).
* Environmental influences on traits can arise via genetically based responses to selection. Regardless of the adaptive nature or the form of genetic basis of phenotypic variation, environmental effects on phenotypes can be complex
* The product of a genotype is generally not a rigidly defined phenotype, but a **range of phenotypic possibilities** over which there may be variation due to **environmental influence**.
* Environment contributes to the quantitative nature of these characteristics (e.g. continuous variation of skin colour). Such characteristics are multifactorial, meaning many factors, both genetic and environmental, collectively influence phenotype.

### Case study 1: Honey bees - Workers VS Queen (Nutritional effect)

* In spite of their identical, clonal nature at the DNA level, they are strongly differentiated across a wide range of characteristics including anatomical and physiological differences, the longevity of the queen and reproductive capacity.
* Larva bee fed with royal jelly becomes the queen. Larva bee fed with other diet becomes workers.
* Royal jelly suppresses the expression of DNA methyltransferase (Dnmt3) gene.
* Dnmt3 is needed for DNA methylation, which silences other genes (_Topic 6: Control of gene expression_).
* Hence, genes essential for queen development is not methylated and are expressed in the larva bee who fed with royal jelly.
