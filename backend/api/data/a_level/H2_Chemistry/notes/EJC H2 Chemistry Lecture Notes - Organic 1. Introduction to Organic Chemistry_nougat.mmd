## 3 Classification of Organic Compounds

[leftmargin=*]

LO **(b)** interpret, and use the following terminology associated with organic reactions:

functional group

degree of substitution: primary, secondary, tertiary, quaternary

Organic compounds are thought of as consisting of a relatively unreactive backbone, _e.g.,_ a chain of sp\({}^{3}\) hybridised carbon atoms, and one or several functional groups. Names of organic compounds are derived from the functional group(s) and main carbon chain.

### Nature of structure

We can categorise organic compounds based on the nature of their carbon skeletons:

* **saturated**: compounds such as alkanes, whose molecules contain only _single bonds_, are referred to as saturated compounds **because these compounds contain the maximum number of hydrogen atoms that the carbon compound can possess**
* **unsaturated**: compounds with _multiple bonds_, such as alkenes, alkynes, and aromatic hydrocarbons, are said to be unsaturated because they possess **fewer than the maximum number of hydrogen atoms**, and are capable of reacting with hydrogen under the proper conditions
* **aliphatic**: acyclic (compounds with no ring of atoms) or cyclic (compounds containing ring of atoms), saturated or unsaturated carbon compounds, excluding aromatic compounds
* **aromatic**: a cyclically conjugated molecular entity with a stability (due to delocalisation) significantly greater than that of a hypothetical localised structure is said to possess aromatic character; In the traditional sense, 'having a chemistry typified by benzene'

### Functional groups

The **functional group** is an atom, or a group of atoms that has similar chemical properties whenever it occurs in different compounds. It defines the characteristic **physical and chemical properties** of families of organic compounds.

The carbon atom on which the functional group is attached to is known as the **alpha (\(\alpha\)) carbon**. The naming continues as beta (\(\beta\)), gamma (\(\gamma\)), delta (\(\delta\)),..., until the last carbon in the chain, which is termed the omega (\(\omega\)) carbon.

A series of compounds with the **same functional group**, where each member differs from the next member by **a constant CH\({}_{2}\) unit** is called a **homologous series**. Members of a homologous series are called homologs.

**All compounds in any one homologous series**

* can be represented by a general formula
* have a relative molecular mass 14 (corresponding to one CH\({}_{2}\) unit) greater than the preceding compound in the series
* can be prepared by similar methods
* have similar chemical properties
* exhibit a regular gradation of physical properties (due to the increasing size of hydrocarbon chain)

Here are the common functional groups you will encounter:

**Hydrocarbons** (compounds that contain only carbon and hydrogen atoms)

\begin{tabular}{l} \hline \hline
**Alikanes** \\ \hline single CC bond \\ \hline \end{tabular}

\begin{tabular}{l} \hline \hline
**Technically, alkanes do not** \\ \hline have any functional group. \\ \end{tabular}

From the electrostatic potential maps for ethane, ethene, ethyne and benzene, it can be seen that ethane is **non-polar** (generally green), while there are regions of **higher electron density** (yellow\(\rightarrow\)red) in the other three due to the \(\pi\)**bond/system**.

\begin{tabular}{l} \hline \hline
**This is generally true for alkanes in that the C--C and C--H bonds are essentially non-polar and hence they are unreactive towards polar (charged) reagents, and forms the unreactive skeleton of most organic compounds.**

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:9]

### Alkyl and Aryl Groups

When a hydrogen atom is removed from an alkane, this gives an **alkyl group**. The symbol **R** is used to represent a general alkyl group (_i.e.,_ a methyl, ethyl, etc. group).

Alkanes have the general formula, C\({}_{n}\)H\({}_{2n+2}\). So **the general formula for alkyl chains is C\({}_{n}\)H\({}_{2n+1}\)--**.

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|} \hline alkane & alkyl group & abbreviation & bond-line & ball-and-stick model \\ \hline CH\({}_{3}\)--H & H\({}_{3}\)C-- & Me- & -- & \\
**methane** & **methyl** & & & \\ \hline CH\({}_{3}\)CH\({}_{2}\)--H & CH\({}_{3}\)CH\({}_{2}\)-- & Et- & & \\
**ethane** & **ethyl** & & & \\ \hline CH\({}_{3}\)CH\({}_{2}\)--H & CH\({}_{3}\)CH\({}_{2}\)-- & Pr- & & \\
**propane** & **propyl** & & & \\ \hline CH\({}_{3}\)CH\({}_{2}\)CH\({}_{2}\)--H & CH\({}_{3}\)CH\({}_{2}\)CH\({}_{2}\)-- & Bu- & & \\
**butane** & **butyl** & & & \\ \hline \end{tabular}

_FV: Ball-and-Stick Model_

\(\bullet\) Displays both the three-dimensional position of the atoms and the bonds between them

\(\bullet\) Atoms are typically represented by spheres, bonds are represented by rods

Similarly, groups derived from arenes by removal of a hydrogen atom from an aromatic ring carbon atom are known as **aryl groups**. The symbol **Ar** is used to represent a general aryl group.

When a benzene ring is attached to some other group of atoms in a molecule, it is called a **phenyl group**, and it is represented in several ways:

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|} \hline  & or & C\({}_{6}\)H\({}_{5}\)-- & or & Ph-- & or Ar-- \\  & & & & (if ring substituents \\  & & & & \\  & & & & \\  & & & & \\ \end{tabular}

### Degree of Substitution

Degree of substitution in an organic molecule is based on the **number of carbon atom(s)** (generally also the **number of alkyl group(s)**) bonded to the atom of interest.

In the case of alkanes:

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|} \hline  & & & \\ \hline A primary (or 1\({}^{9}\)) & A secondary (or 2\({}^{9}\)) & A tertiary (or 3\({}^{9}\)) & A quaternary (or 4\({}^{9}\)) \\ carbon is & carbon is & carbon is & carbon is \\ bonded to one & bonded to two & bonded to three & bonded to four \\ other carbon & other carbons & other carbons & other carbons \\ \hline \end{tabular}

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:12]

## 4 Organic Nomenclature

LO **(a)** interpret, and use the nomenclature, general formulae and displayed formulae of hydrocarbons, halogen derivatives, hydroxyl compounds, carbonyl compounds, carboxylic acids and derivatives, nitrogen compounds

The **IUPAC** (International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry) name of an organic compound is composed of **three** parts.

\begin{tabular}{c c} What **substituents** (_e.g.__minor_ functional groups) & What is the length \\ are on the main chain & of the main carbon chain? \\ and _where_ are they? & \\ \end{tabular}

There are **four** key steps in naming organic compounds.

1. Find the **longest carbon chain** and name this as an **alkane**. This is the **parent** name.
2. Identify the **major functional group**. Replace -_ane_ (in the alkane) with a **suffix** (see Table 1). If there is **more than one functional group** present in the molecule, the one of **highest priority** as stated below is the **principal functional group**, and is named by the **suffix**. All other function group(s) are substituents, and will be named using the prefix(es). **Refer to this list for the functional group priorities:** 

3. Number the atoms in the main chain. Begin at the end nearer the **major** functional group and give this the **lowest** number. For alkanes, begin at the end nearer the first branch point.
4. Identify the **substituents** (_e.g._ minor functional groups) on the main chain and their number. The substituent name and position is the **prefix** (see Table 1).

### Esters

These are named in two parts. The first part represents the **R\({}^{\dagger}\) group attached to oxygen** (Note: **This R\({}^{\dagger}\) group comes from the alcohol**). The second represent the **R\({}^{2}\)CO\({}_{2}\) (Note: R\({}^{2}\) group comes from the carboxylic acid)** portion which is named as an alkanoate (_i.e._ the suffix is \(-\)date). A space separates the two parts of the name.

Each type of hybrid orbital has different characteristics depending on its original atomic orbitals.

Overlapping of the 2p orbitals can take place either between (i) C1 and C2, C3 and C4, C5 and C6; or between (ii) C1 and C6, C2 and C3, C4 and C5, leading to the two Kekule structures for benzene that involve alternating double and single bonds.

However, such a structure does not support the differences benzene displays compared to alkenes. Rather, a more probable structure of benzene is one in which **all** six adjacent 2p orbitals could overlap, resulting in the formation of an annular \(\pi\) electron cloud, above and below the plane of the ring:

As the 2p electrons are no longer held between just two carbon atoms but are spread over the entire ring, the electrons are said to be **delocalised**. To represent the unique structure of benzene, we use the following symbol:
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|} \hline \multicolumn{2}{|c|}{Directional} & \multicolumn{1}{c|}{} & \multicolumn{1}{c|}{} & \multicolumn{1}{c|}{} \\ \hline hybridisation & no. of bonds & shape & bond angle \\ \hline sp\({}^{3}\) & \begin{tabular}{l} 4 \(\sigma\) bond (4 regions of \\ electron densities) \\ \end{tabular} & tetrahedral & 109.5\({}^{\text{o}}\) \\ \hline sp\({}^{2}\) & \begin{tabular}{l} 3 \(\sigma\) bond, 1 \(\pi\) bond (3 regions \\ of electron densities) \\ \end{tabular} & trigonal & 120\({}^{\text{o}}\) \\ \hline sp &

Hence, a benzene (C\({}_{\text{e}}\)H\({}_{\text{e}}\)) molecule is planar in shape. \(\blacksquare\) I am able to appreciate that the carbon-carbon bond in benzene has a bond order of 1.5 due to the delocalisation of electrons around the six carbon atoms in the benzene.

Alternatively, one atom may hold on to both electrons, leaving none for the other, resulting in the formation of an ion pair, consisting of a negative and a positive ion; this is referred to as heterolytic fission or cleavage of the bond.

When R and X are not identical, the fission can take place in either of two ways, depending on whether R or X retains the electron pair.

To show the movement of a pair of electrons, a full arrow is used.

[MISSING_PAGE_POST]

#### 6.2.2 Types of Reagents in Organic Reactions

All polar reactions take place between an electron-poor site and an electron-rich site. Such reactions involve the **donation of an electron pair** from a **nucleophile** to an **electrophile**.

The types of reagents involved in polar reagents are:

* **electrophiles**: (also known as 'electron-loving') are electron-poor species that can form a covalent bond by accepting an electron pair from an electron-rich site.
* **nucleophiles**: (also known as 'nucleus-loving') are electron-rich species that can form a covalent bond by donating an electron pair to an electron-deficient site.

#### 6.2.2.1 Relative Strength of Electrophiles and Nucleophiles

**Electrophiles** are _often_ **positively charged** (cations) although they can also be sites on neutral species carrying a **partial positive charge** (\(8+\)).

For example, electron-rich (and hence nucleophilic) phenol can be attacked by electrophiles such as the positively charged nitronium cation, \(\text{NO}_{2}^{+}\), and the electron-deficient nitrogen atom of nitric acid (\(\text{HNO}_{3}\)) or dinitrogen pentoxide (\(\text{N}_{2}\text{O}_{5}\)):

(Note: \(8+++\) simply means three \(8+\) added together. It is just to indicate that the electron deficiency arises from three electronegative oxygen atoms.)

The relative electrophilic strength (or electrophilicity) of a cation, or electrophilic site within a neutral molecule depends on the **level of electron deficiency**.

* An electrophile with a positive charge is always a **stronger** electrophile than its conjugate base (which is neutral).

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:32]

It is possible for a species to be either a nucleophile or an electrophile, depending on the circumstances. It is said to be an **amiphiphile**. For example, water can act as a nucleophile in one reaction, and as an electrophile in another:

In Radical Reactions

A **radical**, also known as a free radical, is an atom, molecule, or ion that has at least one unpaired valence electron.

Reactions involving **radicals** as the reactive entities are also known. These are much less susceptible to variations in electron density in the substrate than are reactions involving polar intermediates.

They are however greatly affected by the addition of small traces of substances that either produce or consume radicals.

Electrophile

I know how to identify and name the following organic reactions:

free-radical

 electrophilic

 electrophilic

substitution

 nucleophilic

 nucleophilic

substitution

addition

elimination

oxidation

reduction

condensation

I know the difference between electrophiles, nucleophiles and radicals.

I know that polar reactions involve the flow of electrons from electron-rich to electron-poor sites. Such reactions involve the donation of an electron pair from a nucleophile to an electrophile.

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:34]

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:36]

Compounds 1 and 2 can be regarded as non-interconvertible as changing from one form to the other will involve **breaking the \(\pi\) bond** (\(\sim\)240 kJ mol\({}^{-1}\)), rotation about the \(\alpha\) bond, followed by reforming the \(\pi\) bond:

For _cis_-but-2-ene (1) and _trans_-but-2-ene (2), the enthalpy of hydrogenation is \(-\)119.6 kJ mol\({}^{-1}\) and \(-\)115.5 kJ mol\({}^{-1}\), respectively (both give butane upon hydrogenation).

Since the _cis_-isomer 1 releases about 4 kJ mol\({}^{-1}\) more energy on hydrogenation than does 2, it follows that _cis_-isomer 1 is more unstable because the methyl groups are closer together, resulting in greater **steric strain** (resulting in interelectronic repulsion).

With larger substituents, differences greater than 4 kJ mol\({}^{-1}\) are encountered, with the _trans_-alkene being more stable than the corresponding _cis_-alkene.

**(i)**: deduce the possible isomers for an organic molecule of known molecular formula
**(j)**: identify chiral centres and/or cis-trans isomerism in a molecule of given structural formula

A sp\({}^{3}\) hybridised tetrahedral carbon atom that is attached to four different entities (atoms or groups) is known as an asymmetric carbon atom.

A molecule with an asymmetric carbon atom (denoted by an asterisk (*) on the C), as in the diagram below, **cannot be superposed on its mirror image**.

This is the same property that a right hand, say, placed in front of a plane mirror possess.

Molecules such as the one shown above and our hands are said to be **chiral** (or handed), from the Greek word 'cheir' for hand.

**Chirality** then is the property of handedness. It is the geometric property of a rigid object (or spatial arrangement of points or atoms) of being **non-superposable on its mirror image**. The adjective 'chiral' refers to the molecule as a whole, rather than to a particular atom.

Molecules such as CC_l_, CH\({}_{2}\)_C_l_ and CHFC_l_ that can be superposed on their mirror images are said to be '**achiral**'.

## Introduction to organic chemistry

How to determine whether a molecule is chiral?

The ultimate way to test for molecular chirality is to construct models of the molecule and its mirror image and then determine whether they are superposable. We can apply this test with actual models, or by attempting to superpose them in our minds.

There are other aid that can assist us in recognising chiral molecules.

We have seen one already: the presence of a **single chiral centre**.

However, when there are more than one chiral centres in a molecule, it may sometimes lead to an achiral molecule due to the presence of a plane of symmetry. _Meso_-tartaric acid (see below) has two chiral centres but it possesses an internal plane of symmetry, hence it is **achiral (or not chiral)**.

A plane of symmetry (also called a mirror plane) is defined as an imaginary plane that bisects a molecule in such a way that the two halves of the molecule are mirror image of each other.

However, the absence of a plane of symmetry does not necessarily guarantee that a molecule is chiral, although it is true in many cases.

In short, to determine if a molecule is chiral, we generally consider the following factors:

1. Contains one or more chiral centres
2. Should not have internal plane of symmetry

### Optical Activity

Light may be regarded as a wave motion that contain oscillating perpendicular electric and magnetic fields, at right angles to the direction of propagation of the light wave:

In normal light, the electric and magnetic fields of light oscillates in all planes. Considering only the electric field components:

When a beam of normal light is passed through a device called a **polariser**, that in effect acts as a filter, only light waves that are oscillating in a single plane are allowed to pass through. The polariser thus serves to block the passage of light that is oscillating in all other planes. The light that emerges from the polariser is said to be **plane polarised**.

In 1815 the French physicist Biot made the important observation that when a beam of **plane polarised light** is passed through a solution of certain naturally occurring organic compounds, the plane of polarised light is rotated either to the left or to the right.

Molecules that are able to rotate the plane of polarisation of a beam of transmitted plane-polarised light is said to possess **optical activity** (or to be **optically active**).

An enantiomer causing rotation in a clockwise direction (when viewed in the direction facing the oncoming light beam) under specified conditions is called dextrorotatory and its chemical name or formula is designated by the prefix (+)-; one causing rotation in the opposite sense is leavorotatory and designated by the prefix (-)-.

#### 7.2.3 Biological Importance of Stereochemistry

LO (h) recognise that different stereoisomers exhibit different biological properties, for example in drug action

The origin of biological properties relating to chirality is often likened to the specificity of our hands for their respective gloves; the binding specificity for a chiral molecule (like a hand) at a chiral receptor site (a glove) is only favourable in one way.

If either the molecule or the biological receptor site had the wrong handedness, the natural physiological response (_e.g.,_ neural impulse, reaction catalysis) would not occur.

A diagram showing how only the (+)-isomer in a pair of enantiomers can interact in an optimal way with a hypothetical binding site (_e.g.,_ in an enzyme) is shown below.

Because of the chiral centre of the enantiomer, three-point binding can occur with proper alignment for only one of the two enantiomers.

Chiral molecules can show their handedness in many ways, including the way they affect human beings.

The (+)-enantiomeric form of a compound called limonene is primarily responsible for the odour of oranges and the other (-)-enantiomer for the odour of lemons.

The (+)-enantiomer of a compound called carvone is the essence of caraway, and the other is the essence of spearmint.

The activity of drugs containing chirality centres can similarly vary between enantiomers, sometimes with serious or even tragic consequences.

For several years before 1963 the drug thalidomide was used to alleviate the symptoms of morning sickness in pregnant women. In 1963 it was discovered that thalidomide was the cause of horrible birth defects in many children born subsequent to the use of the drug.

Even later, evidence began to appear indicating that whereas one of the thalidomide enantiomers (the right-handed molecule) has the intended effect of curing morning sickness, the other enantiomer, which was also present in the drug (in an equal amount), may be the cause of the birth defects.

The evidence regarding the effects of the two enantiomers is complicated by the fact that, under physiological conditions, the two enantiomers are interconverted.

Now, however, thalidomide is approved under highly strict regulations for treatment of some forms of cancer and a serious complication associated with leprosy. Its potential for use against other conditions including AIDS and rheumatoid arthritis is also under investigation.

#### 7.2.4 Number of Stereoisomers

The **maximum** number of stereoisomers possible for a molecule with \(n\) **chiral centres** is given by 2\({}^{n}\).

The **actual number may be fewer since some of the isomers may possess internal symmetry elements**.

_E.g.,_ consider tartaric acid, HO\({}_{2}\)C CO\({}_{2}\)H

There are two pairs of mirror images possible:

The **maximum** number of stereoisomers possible for a molecule with _m cis-trans_ double bond** is also given by 2\({}^{m}\).

Again, the actual number may be less as some of the isomers are in fact the same compound due to the presence of internal symmetry elements.

In addition, it is not possible to have _cis-trans_ isomerism for double bond in a small ring system.

_E.g._ for 1,2-dimethylcyclohexene, CH\({}_{3}\), the two methyl groups can only assume a _cis_-configuration, since it is geometrically **not** possible to bend the ring to be in a _trans_-configuration \(\left(\begin{array}{c}\text{H}_{3}\text{C}\\ \text{CH}_{3}\end{array}\right)\).

For a molecule with \(n\) **chiral centres** and _m cis-trans_ double bond**, the **maximum** number of stereoisomers possible is given by 2\({}^{n\text{-}m}\).
