Singapore-Cambridge General Certificate of Education Advanced Level Higher 1 (2025)

Mathematics

(Syllabus 8865)

(First year of examination in 2025)

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:2]

## Preamble

The applications of mathematics extend beyond the sciences and engineering domains. A basic understanding of mathematics and statistics, and the ability to think mathematically and statistically are essential for an educated and informed citizeny. For example, social scientists use mathematics to analyse data, support decision making, model behaviour, and study social phenomena.

H1 Mathematics provides students with a foundation in mathematics and statistics that will support their business or social sciences studies at the university. It is particularly appropriate for students without O-Level Additional Mathematics because it offers an opportunity for them to learn important mathematical concepts and skills in algebra and calculus that were taught in Additional Mathematics. Students will also learn basic statistical methods that are necessary for studies in business and social sciences.

## Syllabus Aims

The aims of H1 Mathematics are to enable students to:

**(a)**: acquire mathematical concepts and skills to support their tertiary studies in business and the social sciences
**(b)**: develop thinking, reasoning, communication and modelling skills through a mathematical approach to problem-solving
**(c)**: connect ideas within mathematics and apply mathematics in the context of business and social sciences
**(d)**: experience and appreciate the value of mathematics in life and other disciplines.

## Assessment Objectives (AO)

The assessment will test candidates' abilities to:

AO1 **Use mathematical techniques and procedures**: Recall facts, formulae and notation and use them directly. Read and use information from tables, graphs, diagrams and texts. Carry out straightforward mathematical procedures. AO2 **Formulate and solve problems including those in real-world contexts**: Select relevant mathematical concept or strategy to apply. Formulate problems into mathematical expressions or models. Integrate mathematical concepts to solve mathematical problems. Translate between equivalent forms of mathematical expressions or statements. Interpret results in the context of a given problem. AO3 **Reason and communicate mathematically**: Explain the choice of mathematical models or strategies. Make deductions, inferences and generalisations. Formulate conjectures and justify mathematical statements. Construct mathematical arguments and proofs.

Approximate weightings for the assessment objectives are as follows:

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|} \hline AO1 & 40\% \\ \hline AO2 & 55\% \\ \hline AO3 & 5\% \\ \hline \end{tabular}

## Use of a Graphing Calculator (GC)

The use of an approved GC without computer algebra system will be expected. The examination papers will be set with the assumption that candidates will have access to GC. As a general rule, unsupported answers obtained from GC are allowed unless the question states otherwise. Where unsupported answers from GC are not allowed, candidates must present the mathematical steps using mathematical notations and not calculator commands. For questions where graphs are used to find a solution, candidates should sketch these graphs as part of their answers. Incorrect answers without working will receive no marks. However, if there is written evidence of using GC correctly, method marks may be awarded.

Candidates should be aware that there are limitations inherent in GC. For example, answers obtained by tracing along a graph to find roots of an equation may not produce the required accuracy.

## List of Formulae and Results

Candidates will be provided in the examination with a list of formulae and results.

## Integration and Application

Notwithstanding the presentation of the topics in the syllabus document, it is envisaged that some examination questions may integrate ideas from more than one topic, and that topics may be tested in the contexts of problem solving and application of mathematics.
