## Chapter 01-Acid

An acid is a substance which produces \(H^{+}\) ions in aqueous Solution. Strong Acids completely ionise in water to give high concentration of \(H^{+}\) ions in aqueous solution. Weak acids partially ionise in water to give low concentration of \(H^{+}\) ions in aqueous solution

### Base

A base is a substance which reacts with acid to produce salt and water only.

* Bases include metal oxides, metal hydroxides and aqueous ammonia
* Bases can be soluble or insoluble in water
* Alkalis are soluble bases

#### Alkali

An alkali is a substance which produces \(OH^{\scalebox{0.5}{$\neg$}}\) ions in aqueous solution. Strong alkalis completely ionise in water to give high concentrations of \(OH^{\scalebox{0.5}{$\neg$}}\) in an aqueous solution. Weak alkalis partially ionise to give low concentrations of \(OH^{\scalebox{0.5}{$\neg$}}\) in aqueous solutions.

Sample Planning Qns:
1. Plan an experiment to prepare clean dry crystals of sodium chloride
2. Describe a suitable method to prepare a clean dry sample of barium sulfate
3. Outline the steps to determine the water of crystallisation in a sample of hydrated copper (II) sulfate

**SAMPLE:**

_X can be used to make lead (II) sulfate._

_Starting from X, describe a method that can be used to make a pure, dry sample of lead (II) sulfate._

_You are given a solution of lead (II) nitrate. You can assume that all the apparatus and reagents normally found in a school laboratory are available. [5]_

**Precipitation of lead (II) nitrate**

1. Add an excess of aqueous silver nitrate to X.

_Thought Process: Excess silver nitrate needed to precipitate as much chloride as possible. Silver chloride will be formed. Silver chloride is insoluble. Aqueous barium nitrate should not be used as insoluble barium sulfate will be formed._

2. Filter the mixture.

_Thought Process: Residue is silver chloride, filtrate contains silver ions, sulfate ions and nitrate ions._

3. Keep the filtrate.

4. Add an excess of aqueous lead (II) nitrate to the filtrate.

_Thought Process Insoluble lead (II) sulfate will be formed. The remaining solution contains silver ions, lead (II) ions and nitrate ions._

5. Filter the mixture.

6. Keep the residue.

_Thought Process Residue is lead (II) sulfate, filtrate contains lead (II) ions, silver ions and nitrate ions._

**Purification of lead (II) nitrate**

1. Rinse the residue with a small volume of cold distilled water.

2. Dry the residue between pieces of clean dry filter papers.

### Experiments on qualitative analysis

Qualitative analysis experiments may involve identification of unknown ionic compound(s). More than 1 chemical test will be required.

**Practical tips**

* Tests for ions and gases are given in the 'Notes for Qualitative Analysis' provided at the back of the practical exam paper.
* It is advisable to memorise as many of the tests as possible.
* Record all observations and conclusions, including negative results.
* For negative results, write no visible change/ reaction or no gas produced.
* For any unknown chemical tests, perform the chemical test following the instructions given and record your observations (for example, colour of ppt or solution, effervescence, smell of gas). You do not need to write conclusions.

### Tests for gases

* When effervescence is observed, cover the test tube opening with your thumb to prevent gas from escaping.
* Test for the most likely gas based on your knowledge of the compound. If you are not sure what gas is produced, try all tests for gases.

**Test for ammonia and chlorine**

1. Put one drop of distilled water on one piece of litmus paper to moisten it before use.

2. You should smell the pungent smell of ammonia or chlorine gas.

3. Insert the damp litmus paper into the test tube or place it near the opening of the test tube

4. Make sure that the damp litmus paper does not touch the opening or sides of the test tube

5. If ammonia gas is present, the damp red litmus paper will turn blue.

6. If chlorine gas is present, the damp red or blue litmus paper will turn white.

1. Use a measuring cylinder to measure and pour 30cm\({}^{3}\) of 2.0mol/dm\({}^{3}\) HCl into a conical flask
2. Weigh 1.0g of magnesium powder _(any reasonable value that is constant)_
3. Pour all the magnesium powder into the conical flask. Immediately connect to empty gas syringe and start stopwatch. _(correctly drawn and labelled diagram)_
4. Record the volume of gas in the gas syringe every 10s for a total of 1 min. _(any reasonable alternatives between 5s to 30s. Use of datalogger to continuously record vol. of gas over time also accepted.)_

#### 4.1.1 Determining Rate of Reaction

1. Plot a graph of volume of gas against time for each metal
2. Find the gradient of each graph at the start time (time = 0s) _The gradient gives rate of reaction. Gradient = \(\frac{\mbox{volume of gas}}{\mbox{time}}\)_

Or

1. Calculate the rate of reaction _Rate of Reaction = \(\frac{\mbox{volume of gas}}{\mbox{time}}\)_

#### 4.1.2 Experiments on rate of reaction

Rate of reaction experiments usually involve 1 factor. Any factor, except pressure, may be tested in experiments.

The reaction in the question may be familiar or unfamiliar. Familiar reactions include reactions involving acid or alkali, redox reactions, displacement reactions. Displacement reactions are redox reactions.

The method to measure the rate of the reaction depends on the reaction. If the question involves an unfamiliar reaction, the method to measure the rate of reaction may be mentioned in the question.

All experiments on rate of reaction require a stopwatch to measure the time taken for the reaction to occur.

### Practical tips

Pressure will not be tested due to lack of apparatus to measure gas pressure. Pressure may be tested in the planning question. Loss in mass will usually not be tested due to insufficient electronic balances in the laboratory. Most common way to measure the rate of reaction in the school laboratory is to measure the time taken for the reaction to finish or reach an end-point]

Dilution may be done to vary the concentration. Follow the steps or dilution table in the experiment to prepare the different concentrations. The mass and appearance of a catalyst at the end of a reaction remains the same as before the reaction

OTHER TYPES OF PLANNING:

* A sample of 5 antacid tablets were accidentally left exposed to the air for a week. They absorbed water and became damp, forming solids with the formula \(CaC0_{3}.xH_{2}O\). Outline a method to determine the value of \(x\). Note any assumptions that you made.

**Assumptions:**

* Each antacid tablet contains the same mass of calcium carbonate.
* Each antacid tablet contains the mass of calcium carbonate calculated
* Increase in mass of tablets is due to water only
* Each antacid tablet gained the same mass of water
* All the water absorbed by the tablets combined with the calcium carbonate only

**Finding the mass of water**

1. Measure the initial mass of 5 damp antacid tablets
2. Heat the 5 damp antacid tablets gently in a crucible or evaporating dish
3. Measure the final mass of 5 tablets
4. The different in mass is the mass of water 

**Determining the value of \(x\).**

1. Calculate the number of moles of water in 5 tablets \(Number\ of\ moles\ =\ \frac{mass\ of\ water}{18}\).
2. Divide by 5 to get the number of moles of water by the number of moles of calcium carbonate to obtain \(x\).
