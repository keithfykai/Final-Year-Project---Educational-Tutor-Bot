## 3. Tangent Theorem

The line perpendicular to the tangent at the point of contact passes through the centre of the circle

Tangents drawn from an external point to a circle are equal 
**Take Note:**

This is a highly tested theorem! Many students struggle to find and use this Theorem in their solutions.
