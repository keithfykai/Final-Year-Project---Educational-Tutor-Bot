## Chapter 1 Introduction

### 1.1 Introduction

Direct circuit

Direct current (in short d.c.) refers to current which flows in one direction only. In contrast, alternating current (in short a.c.) refers to current which changes direction periodically.

Direct current must be one-directional, not necessarily constant magnitude, i.e. it need not be a steady current

In Fig. 1.1, Graph (a), Graph (b) and Graph (c) show examples of direct current

whereas Graph (d) and Graph (e) show examples of alternating current

## Appendix B Series and parallel arrangement

### Resistors in Series

* Resistors connected in series have the same current flowing through them i.e. any charge that flows through one resistor must flow through the others.
* Derivation (not required): Consider an e.m.f. \(E\) of negligible internal resistance applied across \(n\) resistors connected in series, as shown in the circuit diagram on the left of Fig. 15.6. \[\begin{array}{c}\includegraphics[width=150.0pt]{150.0pt}{Fig15.6}\\ \end{array}\] The resistors have resistances \(R_{1}\), \(R_{2}\),... \(R_{n}\), and the potential difference across each resistor are \(V_{1}\), \(V_{2}\),... \(V_{n}\) respectively. Since the same current \(I\) flows through all the \(n\) resistors, using the relation \(V=IR\), the potential difference across each resistor can be expressed as \(IR_{1}\), \(IR_{2}\),... \(IR_{n}\). Since \(E=V_{1}+V_{2}+...+V_{n}\), we have \(E=IR_{1}+IR_{2}+....+IR_{n}=I\left(R_{1}+R_{2}+...+R_{n}\right)\). If a resistor of equivalent resistance \(R_{\mathrm{eff}}\) is used in place of the \(n\) resistors in series as shown in the circuit diagram on the right of Fig. 15.6, using \(V=IR\), we have \(E=IR_{\mathrm{eff}}\). From the two equations, we have \(E=IR_{\mathrm{eff}}=I\left(R_{1}+R_{2}+...+R_{n}\right)\). Hence, for resistors in series, \[\begin{array}{c}\includegraphics[width=150.0pt]{150.0pt}{Fig15.6}\\ \end{array}\] The equivalent resistance \(R_{\mathrm{eff}}\) of resistors in series is always greater than any series. \[\begin{array}{c}\includegraphics[width=150.0pt]{150.0pt}{Fig15.6}\\ \end{array}\] The equivalent resistance \(R_{\mathrm{eff}}\) of resistors in series is always greater than any series.

**Anderson Seraugoon Junior College**

**Physics 9749**

If all the \(n\) resistors in series are of the same resistance \(R\), then the equivalent resistance \(R_{\text{eff}}\) is \(nR\).

When there are breaks in a series connection, the circuit is no longer closed and no current flows.

### **Resistors in Parallel**

Resistors connected in parallel have the same potential difference across the ends of the each resistor i.e. left end of each resistor is connected to a common point and right end of each resistor is connected to another common point.

Derivation (not required):

Consider an e.m.f. \(E\) of negligible internal resistance is applied across \(n\) resistors connected in parallel, as shown in the circuit diagram on the left of Fig. 15.7.

**Fig. 15.7**

The resistors have resistances \(R_{1}\), \(R_{2}\),.... \(R_{n}\), and the current flowing through each resistor are \(I_{1}\), \(I_{2}\),... \(I_{n}\) respectively.

Since the potential difference across each resistor is \(E\), using the relation \(V=IR\), the current flowing through each resistor can be expressed as \(\frac{E}{R_{1}}\), \(\frac{E}{R_{2}}\),... \(\frac{E}{R_{n}}\).

Since \(I=I_{1}+I_{2}+...+I_{n}\), we have \(I=\frac{E}{R_{1}}+\frac{E}{R_{2}}+...+\frac{E}{R_{n}}=E\) (\(\frac{1}{R_{1}}+\frac{1}{R_{2}}+...+\frac{1}{R_{n}}\)).

Physics 9749

If a resistor of equivalent resistance \(R_{\text{eff}}\) is used in place of the \(n\) resistors in parallel as shown in the circuit diagram on the right of Fig. 15.7, using \(V=IR\), we have \(I=\frac{E}{R_{\text{eff}}}\).

From the two equations, we have \(I=\frac{E}{R_{\text{eff}}}=E\left(\frac{1}{R_{1}}+\frac{1}{R_{2}}+...+\frac{1} {R_{n}}\right)\).

Hence, for resistors in parallel,

\[\boxed{\frac{1}{R_{\text{eff}}}=\frac{1}{R_{1}}+\frac{1}{R_{2}}+...+\frac{1} {R_{n}}}\]

This equation allows us to use \(R_{\text{eff}}\) to represent equivalent resistance of a set of resistors in parallel.

The equivalent resistance \(R_{\text{eff}}\) of resistors in parallel is always less than the smallest resistance in the group of resistors.

If all the \(n\) resistors in parallel are of the same resistance \(R\), then the equivalent resistance \(R_{\text{eff}}\) is \(\frac{R}{n}\).

Current continues to flow through the remaining resistors connected in parallel even when one of resistor fails and has an open circuit across it.

**Practical technique in finding effective resistance of a network of resistors**

Steps to take:

1. [label=)]
2. Examine the circuit and redraw circuit (if necessary).
3. Replace any resistors in series (same current flowing through the resistors) with a single resistor of equivalent resistance.
4. Sketch the new circuit.
5. Replace any resistors in parallel (same p.d. across the resistors) with a single resistor of equivalent resistance.
6. Sketch the new circuit.
7. Repeat steps b) to e) until a single equivalent resistance is found.
8. If the current or p.d. across a particular resistor in the network is to be identified, start with the finding the current or p.d. across the equivalent resistor found in part f) and gradually work backwards.

**Physics 9749**

As the resistors are connected in series, the effective resistance of the circuit is

\(R_{\text{eff}}=R_{1}+R_{2}\).

Using \(V=IR\), the current through the circuit, \(I=\dfrac{E}{R_{1}+R_{2}}\).

Therefore, p.d. across \(R_{1},\ V_{1}=IR_{1}=\dfrac{E}{R_{1}+R_{2}}\ R_{1}\)

\(V_{1}=\dfrac{R_{1}}{R_{1}+R_{2}}\ E\)

Similarly, p.d. across \(R_{2},\ V_{2}=\dfrac{R_{2}}{R_{1}+R_{2}}\ E\)

In general, the p.d. across a resistor \(R\) in a branch of resistors in series is given by

**Note that the Potential Divider rule applies to any number of components in series, and not just 2.**

The resistors need not be connected directly to an e.m.f source in order to use the Potential Divider rule. We can use it as long as we know the p.d. across the branch of components in series.

**Fig. 15.9**

As the resistance of \(R_{2}\) in Fig. 15.9 varies, the p.d. across both resistors, \(V_{1}\) and \(V_{2}\) will vary.

The resistance of thermistor decreases with temperature increase.

Thermistor in a potential divider circuit can be used as a temperature sensor to detect fire and activate water sprinkler system, switch on the heater of a room when outside temperature drops and many more applications.

The resistance of LDR decreases as the light intensity falling on the LDR increases.

LDR in a potential divider circuit can be used as a light sensor to switch on light when the surrounding is dark, activate burglar alarm and many more applications.

**a resistance wire (usually of uniform cross-sectional area and resistivity) providing variable resistance**

**In Fig. 15.10, the resistance of section AC, \(R_{1}=\frac{\rho}{A}\ L_{1}\). Similarly, the resistance of section CB, \(R_{2}=\frac{\rho}{A}\ L_{2}\).**

**As the two sections of wire AC and CB are in series with each other, they form a potential divider setup.**

**Hence, p.d. across section AC, \(V_{1}=\frac{R_{1}}{R_{1}+R_{2}}\ E\)**

\[=\frac{\frac{\rho}{A}L_{1}}{\frac{\rho}{A}L_{1}+\frac{\rho}{A}L_{2}}\ E=\frac{L_{1}}{L_{1}+L_{2}}\ E\]

**Since \(L_{1}+L_{2}=L\),**

**p.d. across section AC, \(V_{1}=\frac{L_{1}}{L}\ E\).**

## Appendix D Balanced potential

* To determine the e.m.f. of a cell, there are two methods:
* using a voltmeter
* It is a fast and efficient method.
* However, a voltmeter draws some current from the circuit under investigation as it does not have infinite resistance, thus affecting the circuit to be measured. The accuracy of the results obtained depends on the resistance of the voltmeter used.
* using a potentiometer (uses balanced potential method)
* It is a bulky setup that requires the use of a resistance wire and a moving coil galvanometer.
* The galvanometer is used as a current detector. Its needle is normally at the zero mark in the centre and deflects to either side when current flows.
* Measurements are made on the potentiometer when no current passes through the galvanometer (or null deflection).
* This method measures the e.m.f. of a source accurately as no current is drawn from the circuit to be measured.

### Condition for null deflection on the galvanometer

* Consider two e.m.f. sources, \(E_{1}\) and \(E_{2}\), with their high potential ends connected together as shown in the circuit in Fig. 15.11 below. A galvanometer G is connected to detect the presence of current in the circuit, when the switch is closed.
* Depending on the e.m.f. of \(E_{1}\) and \(E_{2}\), the galvanometer will deflect according to the direction of current flow in the circuit when the switch is closed.

Figure 15.11:
**D.2 Potentiometer**

A potentiometer makes use of the balanced potential method to determine the potential difference across two points.

It is more accurate than a voltmeter as all practical voltmeters do not have infinite resistances, and hence, draws current. A potentiometer acts like a voltmeter with infinite resistance as it draws no current from the circuit to be measured.

A potentiometer setup is shown in the circuit in Fig. 15.13 below:

**Fig. 15.13**

**ANDERSON SEARANGOON JUNIOR COLLEGE**

**PHYSICS 9749**

* A potentiometer typically comprises of the following components (i) a driver cell (ii) a resistance wire (XY) (iii) a jockey (J) and (iv) a galvanometer
* The unknown p.d. to be measured is to be connected to the ends AB with the point of higher potential connected to A.
* The jockey is then tapped on the wire, causing \(V_{\text{AB}}=V_{\text{XJ}}\).
* When the jockey is moved along the length XY, we want to identify a point on XY where there is null deflection in the galvanometer, which means that no current flows through the galvanometer.
* The point on the wire where null deflection occurs is called the balanced point.
* At balanced point, and the length \(L_{\text{XJ}}\) is called the balance length.
* Therefore, p.d. across XJ, \(V_{\text{XJ}}=\dfrac{L_{\text{XJ}}}{L_{\text{XY}}}\ V_{\text{XY}}\) 

Since \(V_{\text{AB}}=V_{\text{XJ}}\), we can therefore work out that \(V_{\text{AB}}=\dfrac{L_{\text{XJ}}}{L_{\text{XY}}}\ V_{\text{XY}}\).

**Case 1 (single branch connected across AB)**

* Consider the following potentiometer setup in Fig. 15.14 where a single branch containing a secondary cell and a fixed resistor is connected across AB.

**Anderson Seraugoon Junior College**

**Physics 9749**

At balance point (or balance length), no current flows through the galvanometer.

Therefore, p.d. across XJ, \(V_{\rm XJ}\) = \(\frac{L_{\rm XJ}}{L_{\rm XY}}\)\(V_{\rm XY}\).

Since no current flows through the galvanometer, this also implies that there is no current flowing through the secondary cell \(E_{2}\) and resistor \(R\). Hence, there is no potential drop across \(R\).

The p.d. across AB \(V_{\rm AB}\) is therefore simply the e.m.f. of the secondary cell \(E_{2}\).

Since \(V_{\rm AB}\) = \(V_{\rm XJ}\), this means that \(E_{2}\) = \(\frac{L_{\rm XJ}}{L_{\rm XY}}\)\(V_{\rm XY}\).

**Case 2 (2 or more branches connected across AB)**

Consider the following potentiometer setup in Fig. 15.15 where an additional branch PQ is connected across AB.

**Fig. 15.15**

At balance point (or balance length), no current flows through the galvanometer. i.e. no current through BJ and XA.

Therefore, p.d. across XJ, \(V_{\rm XJ}\) = \(\frac{L_{\rm XJ}}{L_{\rm XY}}\)\(V_{\rm XY}\).

However, the loop ABQPA is a closed circuit, and thus current flows within this loop.

Suppose the current in the loop ABQPA is \(I\), then the p.d. across AB, \(V_{\rm AB}\) = \(E_{2}-I\)R\({}_{1}\).

**Example 1**

* Start at point Y as this point is earthed. Thus, the potential at Y, \(V_{Y}=0\) V.
* \(V_{Z}\) \(V_{Z}=-6.0\) V
* Potential at point X, \(V_{X}\) is higher than \(V_{Y}\) by 4.0 V. Hence, \(V_{XY}=V_{X}-V_{Y}=4.0\) V, \(V_{X}=4.0\) V
* Potential at point W, \(V_{W}\) is higher than \(V_{X}\) by 2.0 V. Hence, \(V_{WX}=V_{W}-V_{X}=2.0\) V, \(V_{W}=4.0+2.0\) = 6.0 V

**Example 2**

* The network of resistors can be redrawn by rearranging some resistors and you can imagine that the ends XY are connected to an e.m.f. source as shown.

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:31]

**Example 5**: (a)(i) In the dark, p.d. across 10 k\(\Omega\) resistor is

\[V_{\rm PA}=\left(\frac{10}{10+50}\right)12=2.0\,\mathrm{V}\]

Since \(V_{\rm PA}=V_{\rm P}-V_{\rm A}=2.0\,\mathrm{V}\),

\(\Rightarrow\) potential at P, \(V_{\rm P}=2.0\,\mathrm{V}\)

(\(\because\)\(V_{\rm A}=0\,\mathrm{V}\) as it is connected to a point in the circuit that is earthed)

(ii) In bright sunlight, p.d. across 10 k\(\Omega\) resistor is

\[V_{\rm PA}=\left(\frac{10}{10+2.0}\right)12=10\,\mathrm{V}\]

Since \(V_{\rm PA}=V_{\rm P}-V_{\rm A}=10\,\mathrm{V}\)

\(\Rightarrow\) potential at P, \(V_{\rm P}=10\,\mathrm{V}\)

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:34]

At balance length,

\[V_{\rm{Az}}=\frac{L_{\rm{xz}}}{L_{\rm{xx}}}V_{\rm{xx}}=\frac{L_{\rm{xz}}}{100} \times 8.0\qquad\mbox{(looking at the driver cell circuit)}\]

\[V_{\rm{AB}}=\frac{3.0}{3.0+2.0}\times 2.5=1.5\,\mbox{V}\qquad\mbox{(looking at the bottom loop)}\]

Since \(V_{\rm{xz}}=V_{\rm{AB}}\), \(\frac{L_{\rm{xz}}}{100}\times 8.0=1.5\)

\[L_{\rm{xz}}=\frac{1.5}{8.0}\times 100=18.8\,\mbox{cm}\]
