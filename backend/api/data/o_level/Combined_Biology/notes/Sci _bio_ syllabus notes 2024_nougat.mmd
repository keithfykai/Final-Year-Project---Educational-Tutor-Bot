mouth: chewing to break food into smaller pieces for increased rate of digestion by salivary amylase

salivary glands; secrete saliva containing salivary amylase via salivary duct, softens food for faster digestion by salivary amylase

oesophagus: long narrow muscular tube made up of longitudinal and circular muscles

stomach: thick distensible, peristalsis to churn, break up and mix with gastric juice, contains hydrochloride acid (pH 2), to kill harmful microorganisms in food, acidic to stop the action of salivary amylase. provide acidic medium for protease

small intestine (duodenum & ileum): peristalsis to churn and break up large pieces of food into smaller pieces, ileum - absorption, has villi (tiny finger-like protrusions) to increase surface area to volume ratio for faster rate of absorption of digested food. the small intestine is long to allow more time for absorption, richly supplied with blood capillaries to maintain a steep concentration gradient for faster rate of absorption.

when BGC increases above normal (after a heavy meal), islets of Langerhans are stimulated to produce more insulin into the bloodstream, insulin is transported by blood to the liver where it stimulates the liver to convert excess glucose into glycogen for storage. BGC decreases back to normal.

when BGC decreases below normal (starving/fasting/after exercise), islets of Langerhans are stimulated to produce more glucagon into the bloodstream, glucagon is transported by blood to the liver where it stimulates the liver to convert excess glycogen into glucose. BGC increases back to normal.

- engulf and destroy bacteria, (lymphocytes) antibody formation, cause bacteria to clump together for easier ingestion by phagocytes and tissue rejection (when transplanted organ is treated as foreign body, white blood cells produce antibodies.will not occur if transplanted organ is from the same body)
* thrombin(enzyme) converts soluble fibrinogen to insoluble fibrin threads, entangle RBCs, causing clotting, preventing excessive loss of blood or the entry of harmful microorganisms
* median septum: prevents mixing of oxygenated and deoxygenated blood (mixing decreases amount of oxygen transported
- ventricle has thicker, more muscular walls to generate more pressure as it pumps blood to a further distance (rest of body) compared to atrium (to lungs)
- presence of valves to prevent backflow of blood
- pathway of blood: oxygenated blood from the lungs are transported to the left atrium via the pulmonary vein. when left atrium contracts, it pushes blood into the left ventricle via the bicuspid valve. when the left ventricle contracts, it pushes blood out of the heart through the semi-lunar valve, via the aorta, to the rest of the body. deoxygenated blood from the rest of the body is transported via the vena cava, passes through the semi-lunar valve and enters the right atrium. when right atrium contracts, is pushed blood into the right ventricle via the tricuspid valve, when right ventricle contracts, it pushes blood out of the heart, through the semi-lunar valve and through the pulmonary artery, and it is transported back to the lungs.

sperm ducts: transport sperms from testes to urethra

prostate gland: stores sperm temporarily

urethra: passes semen and urine out of the body

penis: deposit semen, containing sperms in the vagina

fertile period is day 10-15

egg can survive for 1-2 days

sperm can survive for 5 days During menstruation (Day 1 to 5)

- Both oestrogen and progesterone levels are low, menstruation occurs.

- During menstruation, the uterine lining breaks down and is shed.

- Blood and the unfertilised egg flows out through the vagina as well.

After menstruation (Day 6 to 13)

- Oestrogen is released by the ovary for the repair and growth of the uterine lining.

- High estrogen levels lead to ovulation.

Ovalation (Day 14)

- Ovalation occurs whereby a mature egg is released from the ovary.

After ovulation (Day 15 onwards)

- Ovary produces progesterone

- It prevents ovulation and further development of eggs.

- It also causes the uterine lining to thicken further to prepare for implantation of embryo

- Oestrogen production decreases

- If there is no fertilisation, progesterone level decreases, uterine lining breaks down and the cycle repeats.

(e) describe fertilisation and early development of the zygote simply in terms of the formation of a ball of cells which becomes implanted in the wall of the uterus
