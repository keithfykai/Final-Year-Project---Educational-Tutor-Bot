## Conclusion

### Conclusion

Computation is the process by which the small energy is committed through the medium from the world to another.

There is one more movement across during the process of computation. Thermal energy is transferred through the increase in fractional kinetic energies of the atoms.

### Scaled Liquid Gas

Solid are heat resources of thermal energy than liquids and gases.

Molecule are guided close together in solids when it liquids and gases thus create energy on the transferred more quickly.

### Condactica in metals

Conduction is **far better in metals** than non-metals due collision of vibrating atoms & the movement of free electrons.

When heated, the **free mobile electrons** gain energy and move faster. Since free electrons are free to travel in the spaces between the atoms to transfer energy, conduction occurs much faster in metals.

## SEABREZE & LAND BREEZE

As land consists more solid mass while the sea is mainly water, the **land gains and loses heat faster**.

For all the koreaboods out there,

You will be familiar with ramen pot. But have you wondered about the physics behind it?

1. The material is made of nickel-silver plated aluminum. It heats up very quickly which makes the cooking process faster as water can boil quicker. (conduction)
2. The lid is also there to reduce heat loss through convection. This helps the noodles to cook faster! (convection)
3. The shiny surface reduces heat loss through radiation, keeping the noodles warm for a longer period of time! (radiation)
