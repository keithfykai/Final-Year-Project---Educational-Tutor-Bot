### How electricity works in a circuit is similar to a river.

Current flows in a river and at times, it can split into smaller streams.

When it does, the volume of water is reduced in each smaller stream.

A parallel circuit works in the same way!

Current will split into smaller volume as it enters each individual branch of the circuit.

\[\mathbf{l_{total}=1_{1}+1_{2}+1_{3}}\]

We can also use transducers like thermistor and LDR to vary the resistance according to external factors like temperature or light.

## 5 Potential Divider

It is a circuit with 2 resistors arranged in series.

The key idea is that the resistance of R, R R\({}_{2}\) are different so that will receive a different voltage.

General Formula:

But since V =R,

V is directly proportional to R,

V is directly proportional to R.

LIGHT DEPENDENT RESISTOR

LDR

A LDR is a device that decreases in resistance as light intensity increases.

At low light, resistance is high and little current will flow through it.

At bright light, resistance is low and more current can flow through it.

A LDR is used in digital cameras and is used to control the shutter speed.

When light intensity is low, the change in resistance in the LDR will be detected and the shutter takes longer to close to take in more light.

When light intensity is high, the change in resistance in the LDR will be detected and the shutter close much faster and limit the amount of light it takes in.
