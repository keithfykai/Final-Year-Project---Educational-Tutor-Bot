## Glossary of Terms Used in Physics Papers

It is hoped that the glossary will prove helpful to candidates as a guide, although it is not exhaustive. The glossary has been deliberately kept brief not only with respect to the number of terms included but also to the descriptions of their meanings. Candidates should appreciate that the meaning of a term must depend in part on its context. They should also note that the number of marks allocated for any part of a question is a guide to the depth of treatment required for the answer.

1. _Define (the term(s)...)_ is intended literally. Only a formal statement or equivalent paraphrase, such as the defining equation with symbols identified, being required.
2. _What is meant by..._ normally implies that a definition should be given, together with some relevant comment on the significance or context of the term(s) concerned, especially where two or more terms are included in the question. The amount of supplementary comment intended should be interpreted in the light of the indicated mark value.
3. _Explain_ may imply reasoning or some reference to theory, depending on the context.
4. _State_ implies a concise answer with little or no supporting argument, e.g. a numerical answer that can be obtained 'by inspection'.
5. _List_ requires a number of points with no elaboration. Where a given number of points is specified, this should not be exceeded.
6. _Describe_ requires candidates to state in words (using diagrams where appropriate) the main points of the topic. It is often used with reference either to particular phenomena or to particular experiments. In the former instance, the term usually implies that the answer should include reference to (visual) observations associated with the phenomena. The amount of description intended should be interpreted in the light of the indicated mark value.
7. _Discuss_ requires candidates to give a critical account of the points involved in the topic.
8. _Deduce/Predict_ implies that candidates are not expected to produce the required answer by recall but by making a logical connection between other pieces of information. Such information may be wholly given in the question or may depend on answers extracted in an earlier part of the question.
9. _Suggest_ is used in two main contexts. It may either imply that there is no unique answer or that candidates are expected to apply their general knowledge to a 'novel' situation, one that formally may not be 'in the syllabus'.
10. _Calculate_ is used when a numerical answer is required. In general, working should be shown.
11. _Measure_ implies that the quantity concerned can be directly obtained from a suitable measuring instrument, e.g. length, using a rule, or angle, using a protractor.
12. _Determine_ often implies that the quantity concerned cannot be measured directly but is obtained by calculation, substituting measured or known values of other quantities into a standard formula, e.g. the Young modulus, relative molecular mass.
13. _Show_ is used when an algebraic deduction has to be made to prove a given equation. It is important that the terms being used by candidates are stated explicitly.
14. _Estimate_ implies a reasoned order of magnitude statement or calculation of the quantity concerned. Candidates should make such simplifying assumptions as may be necessary about points of principle and about the values of quantities not otherwise included in the question.

Sketch, when applied to graph work, implies that the shape and/or position of the curve need only be qualitatively correct. However, candidates should be aware that, depending on the context, some quantitative aspects may be looked for, e.g. passing through the origin, having an intercept, asymptotic or discontinuity at a particular value. On a sketch graph it is essential that candidates clearly indicate what is being plotted on each axis.
* Sketch, when applied to diagrams, implies that a simple, freehand drawing is acceptable: nevertheless, care should be taken over proportions and the clear exposition of important details.
* Compare requires candidates to provide both similarities and differences between things or concepts.

The following vector and scalar quantities are usually used to describe motion:

* Distance (scalar)
* Displacement (vector)
* Speed (scalar)
* Velocity (vector)
* Acceleration (vector)

### Rectilinear Motion

_Learning Outcomes_

_(a)_ _Define displacement, speed, velocity and acceleration._

#### 2.1.1 Distance and Displacement

_Distance, d_ The total length of path covered by a moving object irrespective of the direction of motion.

Distance is a scalar quantity.

_Displacement, s_ The linear distance of the position of the moving object from a given reference point.

Displacement is a vector quantity.

Considering Figure 1 above, the **distance** travelled by the particle to move from A to B is the actual length of the irregular path (in bold). The length of the straight line that joins A to B is 9646 Physics

Topic 2: Kinematics

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:10]

### Example 2

Mr Tan travels 10 km east to Town A before turning back and travelling 18 km west to Town B. Determine the total distance travelled by Mr Tan to (i) town A, d\({}_{\rm A}\) (ii) town B, d\({}_{\rm B}\), (iii) the displacements, s\({}_{\rm A}\) and s\({}_{\rm B}\) when Mr Tan is at town A and B respectively.

### Solution

To differentiate between the east (right) and west (left) directions, take the direction towards the east to be positive:

\begin{tabular}{l l} (i) & Total distance travelled to town A from origin, d\({}_{\rm A}\) = **10 km** \\ (ii) & Total distance travelled to town B from origin, d\({}_{\rm B}\) = **10 + 18 = 28 km** \\ (iii) & The displacement of Mr Tan at town A from origin is, s\({}_{\rm A}\) = + **10 km** \\ & The displacement of Mr Tan at town B from origin, s\({}_{\rm B}\) = - **8 km** \\ \end{tabular}

#### Speed and Velocity

Speed is the distance travelled per unit time.

\begin{tabular}{l l} _Average speed, \(<\)\(u\)\(>\)_ & Average speed is the ratio of the total distance travelled to the time interval during which a particle travels over that distance. \\  & \(<\)\(\rm u\)\(>\)\(=\)\(\frac{d}{t}\) \\ \end{tabular}

Speed is a scalar quantity.

Velocity is defined as the rate of change of displacement with time. It acts in the direction of change of displacement.

\begin{tabular}{l l} _Average velocity, \(<\)\(v\)\(>\)_ & Average velocity is the ratio of displacement to the time interval during which the displacement occurs. \\  & \(<\)\(\rm v\)\(>\)\(=\)\(\frac{s}{t}\) \\ \end{tabular}

Velocity is a vector quantity.

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:13]

### Graphical Methods for Linear Motion

#### 2.2.1 Finding velocity from Displacement-Time Graphs

We can represent the displacement of any object from a reference point using a displacement - time graph. The displacement-time graph expresses how the displacement of a particle or body changes with time. Since v=\(\dfrac{\text{ds}}{\text{dt}}\), the velocity at any instant can be found from the gradient (slope) of the displacement-time graph.

The illustration below distinguishes between finding average velocity and finding the instantaneous velocity from a displacement-time graph.

The ratio \(\dfrac{\Delta s}{\Delta t}\) in Fig 2(a) gives the magnitude of the average velocity for the time interval \(\Delta\)t. The instantaneous velocity at Q is found by finding the gradient of the tangent (slope) at point Q as shown in Fig 2(b).

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:15]

#### 2.2.2 Finding displacement from Velocity-Time Graphs

We can also represent the motion of an object using a velocity - time graph.

Since v=\(\frac{\text{ds}}{\text{dt}}\)

\(\Rightarrow\overset{\rightharpoonup}{s}=\int_{0}^{t}\overset{\rightharpoonup}{v}\,dt\)

. The displacement can be calculated by finding the area under the velocity-time graph.

The shaded area in Fig 3 represents the displacement of the object from time t\({}_{1}\) to t\({}_{2}\).

Can you now sketch the displacement-time graph given the velocity-time graph? (Consider the graphs which you have sketched earlier in Example 4).

#### 2.2.3 Example 5

Determine the following information from a velocity - time graph shown below.

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|} \hline Displacement & \\ at t = 10 s & **-32 m** \\ \hline Average Velocity & \\ from t = 0 s to t = 10 s & **-3.2 m s\({}^{-1}\)** \\ \hline Instantaneous Velocity & \\ at t = 10 seconds & **20 m s\({}^{-1}\)** \\ \hline Average Acceleration & \\ from t = 0 s to t = 5 s & **-8.0 m s\({}^{-2}\)** \\ \hline Instantaneous & \\ Acceleration at t = 5 s & **0 m s\({}^{-2}\)** \\ \hline \end{tabular}

#### 2.3.1 Example 5

The displacement of the object from time t\({}_{1}\) to t\({}_{2}\).

Can you now sketch the displacement-time graph given the velocity-time graph? (Consider the graphs which you have sketched earlier in Example 4).

#### 2.3.2 Example 5

The displacement of the object from time t\({}_{1}\) to t\({}_{2}\).

Can you now sketch the displacement-time graph given the velocity-time graph? (Consider the graphs which you have sketched earlier in Example 4).

#### 2.3.3 Example 5

The displacement of the object from time t\({}_{1}\) to t\({}_{2}\).

Can you now sketch the displacement-time graph given the velocity-time graph given the velocity-time graph given the graphs which you have sketched earlier in Example 4).

Example 5

Determine the following information from a velocity - time graph shown below.

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|} \hline Displacement & \\ at t = 10 s & **-32 m** \\ \hline Average Velocity & \\ from t = 0 s to t = 10 s & **-3.2 m s\({}^{-1}\)** \\ \hline Instantaneous Velocity & \\ at t = 10 seconds & **20 m s\({}^{-1}\)** \\ \hline Average Acceleration & \\ from t = 0 s to t = 5 s & **-8.0 m s\({}^{-2}\)** \\ \hline Instantaneous & \\ Acceleration at t = 5 s & **0 m s\({}^{-2}\)** \\ \hline \end{tabular}

#### 2.3.4 Example 5

The displacement of the object from time t\({}_{1}\) to t\({}_{2}\).

Can you now sketch the displacement-time graph given

#### 2.2.3 Finding Acceleration from Velocity-Time Graphs

Since \(\ a=\frac{\alpha\nu}{dt}\), the acceleration at any instant can be found from the gradient (slope) of the velocity-time graph.

#### Example 6

Sketch the acceleration-time graph for the velocity-time graph given.

### Equations of Motion

_Learning Outcomes_

_(f) Derive, from the definitions of velocity and acceleration, equations which represent uniformly accelerated motion in a straight line._

It would be very tedious if we had to plot a velocity - time graph or displacement - time graph each time we need to solve a kinematics problem. Thankfully, we can solve kinematics questions with equations of motions derived from the graphs above. However, these equations of motions apply only to uniformly accelerated motions in a straight line.

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:18]

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:19]

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:20]

### Solution 2 - Equations of Motion

Note that acceleration is 30 m s\({}^{-2}\) for 1\({}^{\rm st}\) 6.0 seconds and zero subsequently. Kinematics equations only applies for constant acceleration motion therefore care must be taken to solve this problem in 2 segments:

For the first 6.0 seconds,

Considering the airplane, total displacement of airplane is \(100\times 6.0=600\) m

Considering Superman, given u = 0 m s\({}^{-1}\), a = 30 m s\({}^{-2}\), v = 180m s\({}^{-1}\), s=?

Using \(\nu^{2}=u^{2}+2as\),

\(180^{2}=0+2(30)\)s

\(\therefore\) s = 540 m

After the first 6.0 seconds, Superman flies 80 m s\({}^{-1}\) faster than the airplane and is 60 m away.

Therefore, time taken for Superman to catch up the plane from that point onwards is simply

\(t=60/80=0.75\)s

Hence total displacement from starting point is 6.75\(\times 100=675\) m

### Learning Outcomes

(_g_) _Solve problems using equations which represent uniformly accelerated motion in a straight line, including the motion of bodies falling in a uniform gravitational field without air resistance_.

### Steps to solve kinematics problems using the equations of motion:_

1. Define the positive direction.
2. Write down all data given with the correct sign.
3. Write down all the 3 equations of motions. Identify unknowns in each equation.
4. Find the connection between the unknown and the data given.
5. Decide which equation(s) to use, and in what order.
6. Start solving.

1. The figure below shows a simple device for measuring your reaction time. A friend holds the strip vertically, with thumb and forefinger at the dot on the top. You then position your thumb and forefinger at the other dot on the bottom, being careful not to touch the strip. Your friend releases the strip and you try to pinch it as soon as possible after you see it begin to fall. The mark at the place where you pinch the strip gives your reaction time. 1. How far from the bottom dot should you place the 50 ms? [1.23 cm] _Taking downwards as \(+ve\)_, \(\mathrm{u=0\ m\ s^{-1}}\), \(\mathrm{t=50\ ms}\), \(\mathrm{a=+g=+9.81\ m\ s^{2}}\), \(\mathrm{s=?}\) _Choose an appropriate equation of motion_ Use \(s=\mathrm{ut+\frac{1}{2}\,\mathrm{at^{2}}}\) \(s=0+\nu_{2}\,9.81\ (0.050)^{2}\) \(=\ +0.0123\ m\) 2. Explain clearly how many times higher should the marks for 100, 150, 200 and 250 ms be? [4, 9, 16 and 25 times] _Since \(s=\nicefrac{{1}}{{2}}\,g\ t^{2}\) therefore \(s\) is directly proportional to the square of time \(t\), hence the marks for 100, 150, 200, and 250 ms are at distances that are \(2^{2}\), \(3^{2}\), \(4^{2}\), and \(5^{2}\) greater than the 50 ms mark._Example 12: A boy throws a ball vertically upwards and catches it 3.0 s later at the same location Neglecting air resistance,

(a) (i) find the speed with which the ball leaves his hand,

_Taking upwards as +ve_

\(v\) = - \(u\), \(t\) = _3.0 s_, _a = - 9.81 m s\({}^{2}\)_

_Using_ \(v\) = \(u\) + at_

_-_ \(u\) = \(u\) + (-9.81)(3)_

\(u\) = _14.7 m s\({}^{\emph{-1}}\)_

_Hence speed = 14.7 m s\({}^{\emph{-1}}\)_

(ii) find the maximum height to which it rises.

_At maximum height, the ball will be instantaneously at rest._

_Taking upwards as +ve_

\(u\) = + 14.7 m s\({}^{\emph{-1}}\)_; \(v\) = _0 m s\({}^{\emph{-1}}\)_, \(t\) = _1.5 s_, _a_= - 9.81 m s\({}^{\emph{-2}}\)_

_Using_ \(s\) = _ut_ + _% at\({}^{\emph{2}}\)_

\(s\) = 14.7 (1.5) - _% 9.81 (1.5)\({}^{\emph{2}}\)_

_= 11.0 m_

_Hence, max height is 11.0 m_* Sketch from 0 to 3 seconds, (i) an acceleration-time graph, (ii) a velocity-time graph, and (iii)a displacement-time graph.

Indicate clearly on your graphs, the values of the _times_ at which (1) the ball leaves his hand, (2) it comes to its maximum height, (3) it reaches his hand again.

Topic 2: Kinematics 2-24

### _Motion under Gravity (Free Fall)_

In kinematics, we often deal with motion that is under the influence of gravity. If a ball is dropped from rest, the displacement, velocity and acceleration are in the same direction (downwards). Hence we can apply kinematics equations to derive information of the motion required.

#### 2.4.1 Air resistance is negligible

For this case, the only force acting on the ball is gravity. After time \(t\), the velocity of the ball released from rest would be given by:

\[\begin{array}{l}\nu=u+at\\ =gt\hskip 28.452756pt\mbox{(since $u=0$)}\end{array}\]

Thus the displacement and velocity changes with time as shown in the graphs below

#### 2.4.2 Motion due to Air resistance

In practice, if the air resistance is taken into consideration, the velocity of the falling object will not increase with time indefinitely. In general, the air resistance opposing motion tends to increase approximately with the square of the speed at high velocities and increase proportionately with speed at low velocities.

Hence, the larger the velocity, the greater the larger the retarding force (air resistance). The actual acceleration is the combined free-fall acceleration and the retardation due to air-resistance.

Taking downward as positive

\[\text{Net force}\,=ma=mg-F_{R}\] \[\therefore a=g-\frac{F_{R}}{m}\]

For bodies falling from great heights (aeroplane, clouds), the air resistance can be very large, so much that the retardation is equal to \(g\). As such, the net force is 0 N and we say that the body has reached terminal velocity, _vr_. Bodies falling in a fluid medium behave in the same way.

**Example 13**: Sketch the _v-t_ and _a-t_ graphs of a body falling from a great height when air resistance is not negligible.

**Solution**

Note:

In general \(g\) is not a constant. It decreases with height above the Earth's surface. However, for height \(<<\) Earth radius (e.g. few hundred metres), g varies negligibly with height and can be taken as a constant (= 9.81 m s\({}^{\text{-2}}\))

"Released" or "dropped" implies that initial velocity \(u\) equal to 0 m s\({}^{\text{-1}}\)

"Thrown or "fired" implies that initial velocity \(u\) is not equal to 0 m s\({}^{\text{-1}}\)Example 14: A ball is thrown vertically upwards with an initial velocity \(v_{o}\). Sketch its velocity-time graph showing the time until the ball reaches the thrower's hand, in the case when

1. air resistance is neglected, labelled A
2. air resistance is considered, labelled B

Explain qualitatively the shapes of both graphs.

The slope of the graph without any air resistance is a straight line with a constant negative slope because

_the acceleration due to gravity is constant and is directed downwards._

When the ball is on its upward journey, the slope of graph B is steeper than that for graph A because

_the retarding effect of air resistance acting in the same direction as the ball's weight is such that the net deceleration of the ball due to the weight of the ball and air resistance is greater than that due to gravity alone._

When the ball is on its downward journey, the slope of graph B is gentler than that for graph A because

_the retarding effect of air resistance is such that the net acceleration of the ball downwards due to the weight of the ball and the opposing effect of air resistance is less than that due to gravity alone._

When the ball is at the maximum height, the slope of graph B is equal to that for graph A because

_at the maximum height, the ball is instantaneously at rest, hence air resistance is zero, and the acceleration of the ball is due to gravity alone._

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:28]

### Non-linear Motion

_Learning Outcomes_

_(i)_: _Describe and explain motion due to a uniform velocity in one direction and a uniform acceleration in a perpendicular direction._

So far, we had only considered objects along straight-line paths. Now let us look at objects moving in a plane, that is, two-dimensional motion. Projectile motion deals with the motion of a particle or body when it undergoes motion in which there is a uniform velocity in one direction and a uniform acceleration in a perpendicular direction.

Examples in which projectile motion can occur include the following:

1. A body moving in a perpendicular to uniform gravitational field.
2. A charged particle moving perpendicular to uniform electric field.

When an object is projected into the air at an angle \(\theta\) with respect to the ground with speed \(v\), the body will move in a parabolic path. An example of projectile motion is an Olympic athlete throwing a javelin

Though the motion is two-dimensional, it can be analyzed by considering the straight line motion in the horizontal direction and vertical direction independently.

#### Horizontal motion

The body is moving with a constant velocity. There is no resultant force in the horizontal direction and therefore the horizontal acceleration is **zero**.

\begin{tabular}{l l l}
**Horizontal Acceleration** & \(\mathbf{a}_{\mathbf{x}}=\mathbf{0}\) & \\
**Horizontal Velocity** & \(\mathbf{v}_{\mathbf{x}}=\mathbf{u}_{\mathbf{x}}+\mathbf{a}_{\mathbf{x}} \mathbf{t}\) & \(=\mathbf{u}_{\mathbf{x}}\) \\
**Horizontal Displacement** & \(\mathbf{s}_{\mathbf{x}}=\mathbf{u}\mathbf{x}+\nicefrac{{1}}{{2}}\mathbf{a} \mathbf{x}^{2}\) & \(=\mathbf{u}\mathbf{x}\) \\ \end{tabular}

#### Horizontal motion

The body is moving with a constant velocity. There is no resultant force in the horizontal direction and therefore the horizontal acceleration is **zero**.

Note the **length of the vectors** representing the horizontal and vertical components of the velocity at each stage of the motion. The length of the horizontal component is constant.

**Vertical motion**

The body moves under the influence of gravity with a **constant** acceleration (g) hence the vertical velocity **changes** with time. Taking downwards (gravity) as positive, the kinematics equation for motion applies to this case

\begin{tabular}{l l}
**Vertical Acceleration** & \(\mathbf{a_{y}=g}\) \\
**Vertical Velocity** & \(\mathbf{v_{y}=u_{y}+gt}\) \\
**Vertical Displacement** & \(\mathbf{s_{y}=u_{y}t+\nicefrac{{1}}{{2}}gt^{2}}\) \\
**Time independent Eqn** & \(\mathbf{v_{y}^{2}=u_{y}^{2}+2gs_{y}}\) \\ \end{tabular}

**Note: A parabola is a shape found commonly in mathematics. In fact, if you plot quadratic equations (\(ax^{2}+bx+c\)) in a graph, you get a parabola.**

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:31]

#### Alternative derivation for Total Time of Flight, T

Considering the whole motion, when the projectile has reached the ground, \(y\,=\,0\)

Taking the upward direction as positive, \(a_{y}\,=\,-\,g\), \(u_{y}\,=\,u\,\sin\!\theta\)

Using \(s_{y}\,\,=\,u_{y}\,t\,+\,\nicefrac{{1}}{{2}}\,a_{y}\,t^{2}\)

\(0\,=\,\left(\,u\,\sin\!\theta\,\right)\,t\,+\,\nicefrac{{1}}{{2}}\,(-\,g)\,t^{2}\)

For \(y=0\), \(t\,\,\left(\,u\,\sin\!\theta-\nicefrac{{1}}{{2}}\,g\,t\,\right)\,=\,0\)

\(\Rightarrow\,\,\,t\,=\,0\,\,\,\,\,\mbox{or}\,\,\,\,\,t\,=\dfrac{2u\,\sin\! \theta}{g}\,=\,T\)

#### Range, R

The maximum horizontal distance covered by the projectile is known as the horizontal range, \(R\).

\(R\,=\,\,v_{x}\,T\,=\,\left(u\,\cos\!\theta\right)\,\dfrac{2u\,\sin\!\theta}{g}\)

\(R\,=\,\dfrac{u^{\,2}\sin\!20}{g}\)

For a given speed of projection, \(u\), the horizontal range is maximum when

\(\sin\,20=1\,\,\Rightarrow\,\,\,\theta\,=\,45^{\circ}\)

thus maximum range, \(R_{\max}\,=\,\dfrac{u^{\,2}}{g}\)

**IMPORTANT: EQUATIONS FOR RANGE, TIME OF FLIGHT, MAXIMUM HEIGHT ETC SECTION 2.5.1 to 2.5.5 CANNOT BE USED W/O PROOF FOR NUMERICAL PROBLEMS.**

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:34]

Example 19: A ball is thrown with an initial velocity of 15 m s-1 at an angle of 60\({}^{o}\) to the horizontal, as shown in the diagram below.

1. Explain why AB represents the velocity of the ball and not just its speed. _AB represents the velocity as the length of the arrow gives an indication of the magnitude of the velocity and the direction provides its initial direction of projection._
2. Calculate, for this ball, the initial values of 1. the vertical component of the velocity, \(u_{y}\) = 15 sin 60 = 13 m s1 (ii) the horizontal component of the velocity. \(u_{x}\) = 15 cos 60 = 7.5 m s-1 (c) Assuming that air resistance can be neglected, use your answers in (b) to determine 1. the maximum height to which the ball rises, _Taking upwards as +ve, \(u_{y}\) = +13 m s-1, at max. height: \(v_{y}\) = 0 m s-1, \(a_{y}\) = - 9.81 m s-2 Using \(v^{2}=u^{2}+2as\) 0 = 132+2(-9.81)(s\({}_{y}\)) \(s_{y}\)= 8.61 m_
2. the time of flight, that is, the time interval between the ball being thrown and returning to ground level, _Since the ball returns to ground level, \(s_{y}\) = 0 Using \(s_{y}\) = \(u_{y}\)t + 12 (-9.81)(t) 1(13 - 4.905) = 0 hence t = 0 or t = 2.65 s_* Use your answers to (b) to sketch the path of the ball, assuming air resistance is negligible. Label this path N.
* On your sketch in (d), draw the path of the ball, assuming that air resistance cannot be neglected. Label this path A.
* Suggest an explanation for any differences between the two paths N and A.

_In the horizontal direction, the ball experiences a net deceleration, therefore the horizontal speed decreases resulting in a shorter range._

_As the ball rises, it has to do work against air resistance, hence mechanical energy is lost and the maximum height is reduced (as per Conservation of Energy)_

_As the ball rises, it experiences a net deceleration greater than g because air resistance is acting in the same direction as the gravitational force. Hence, its vertical speed decreases to zero in a shorter time. As a result, it reaches a max height sooner, explaining why the max height is displaced to the left compared to path N._

_Path A is asymmetrical because horizontal speed is not uniform and in the vertical direction, the vertical acceleration experienced by the ball is not constant._

### Kinematics Summary

\begin{tabular}{l l} Scalar: & **Distance** is length of path taken by the object. \\  & **Speed** is defined as distance travelled per unit time. \\ Vector & **Displacement** of an object measures the change in position of the object along a straight line and is defined as the distance and direction of a position of a point as measured from a reference position. \\  & **Velocity** is the _rate of change of displacement with time_. It acts in the direction of change of displacement. It is a vector quantity. \\  & **Acceleration** is the _rate of change of velocity with time_. It acts in the direction of the change of velocity. \\  & \\ \end{tabular}

\begin{tabular}{l l}  & \(\nu=u+\text{at}\) \\ \(s=ut+\text{$\gamma_{2}$ at}^{2}\) \\ \(\nu^{2}=u^{2}+2\text{ }a\text{ s}\) \\ \(s=\text{$\gamma_{2}$ ($\mu+$)}t\) \\ \end{tabular}

\begin{tabular}{l l}  & Note: Need to know how to \\ \(\nu\) & \(u^{2}+2\text{ }a\text{ s}\) \\ \(s=\text{$\gamma_{2}$ ($\mu+$)}t\) \\ \end{tabular}

\begin{tabular}{l l}  & Note: Usually, the direction of the initial velocity \(u\) is taken as the positive direction. \\  & Vector (\(\nu\), \(s\) or \(a\)) which has an opposite direction is given a negative sign. \\ \end{tabular}

\begin{tabular}{l l}  & As the object falls, its velocity increases and \\  & the air resistance acting on the object also \\  & increases. This opposes the downward motion \\  & and causes the acceleration to decrease. At a \\  & point when the weight is offset by the air \\  & resistance, the net force and hence the \\  & acceleration is zero, the object moves with a \\  & constant terminal velocity. \\ \end{tabular}

\begin{tabular}{l l}  & \(t\) \\ \end{tabular}

\begin{tabular}{l l}  & \(\nu\) \\ \(\nu\) & Air resistance \\ \end{tabular}

\begin{tabular}{l l}  & \(\nu\) \\ \(\nu\) & Air resistance \\ \end{tabular}

\begin{tabular}{l l}  & As a body rises, both air resistance and weight act downward, causing a \\  & larger resultant force. Its initial upward deceleration is greater and it takes a \\  & shorter time to reach the greatest height. \\ \end{tabular}

As a body falls, it accelerates downwards, and air resistance opposes its weight, causing a smaller resultant force. The magnitude of the acceleration is smaller and it takes a longer time to reach the original position.

The gradient of the graph on the upward journey is steeper than that of the downwards journey. When its velocity is 0 m s-1, the gradient of the graph is 9.81 ms-2.

A mass is projected with speed \(u\) at an angle \(\theta\) in a space with \(no\) air resistance.

For a projectile motion, the horizontal and vertical components of the motion are **independent** of each other.

\begin{tabular}{l l l} horizontal: & \(F_{x}=0,\quad a_{x}=0,\quad\quad v_{x}\) **is constant**, \\  & \(u_{x}=u\cos\theta\) & \(v_{x}=u_{x},\quad\quad s_{x}=u_{x}t\). \\ vertical: & \(F_{y}=W,\quad a_{y}\) **is constant** & (9.81 m s-2 downwards) \\  & \(u_{y}=u\sin\theta\) & \\  & \(v_{y}=u_{y}+a_{y}t\) & \\  & \(S_{y}=u_{y}t+\frac{1}{2}\ a_{y}\ t^{2}\) & \\  & \(v_{y}^{2}=u_{y}^{2}+2\ a_{y}\ S_{y}\) & \\  & \(v_{y}=0\quad\) **(at highest point)** \\ \end{tabular}

**Note**: Time is the only quantity that is the same for both the horizontal and vertical motions.
