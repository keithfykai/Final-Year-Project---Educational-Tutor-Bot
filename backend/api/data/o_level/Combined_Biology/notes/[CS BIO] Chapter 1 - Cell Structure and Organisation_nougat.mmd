## Specialised Cells

RED Blood Cells

* **Function:** deliver oxygen to the body tissues via the blood.
* Cell structure **adaptations:**
* RBC contain **haemoglobin** which binds with oxygen and transports it from the lungs to all parts of the body
* RBCs have **no nucleus**, thus have more capacity for haemoglobin
* RBCs have a flattened **biconcave shape**. This increases the surface area to volume ratio for faster diffusion of oxygen. It also allows the cell to be more flexible when squeezing through blood capillaries.

## Specialised Cells

XYLEM VESSELS

* (1) **Conduct water and mineral salts*
* from the roots to the leaves of the plant. (2) **mechanical support*
* of plants
* Cell structure adaptations:*
* (1) **Absence of protoplasm and cross-walls*
* which could impede water flow through the lumen (2) **Deposition of lignin*
* on the cell walls which strengthens vessel walls, providing support

# Specialised Cells

ROOT HAIR CELLS

* **Function:** Extend into the soil to **absorb water and mineral salts.**
* **Cell structure adaptations:** root hair is **long and narrow**, this increases the surface area to volume ratio of the cell, so that water and mineral salts can be efficiently absorbed.
