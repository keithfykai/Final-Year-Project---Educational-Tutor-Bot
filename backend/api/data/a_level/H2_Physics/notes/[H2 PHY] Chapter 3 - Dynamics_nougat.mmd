Dynamics

In 1600s, Galileo Galilei proposed that a moving body does not need push to keep it moving. However, it needs a _force_ to change its motion, i.e., a change in velocity and direction.

DYNAMICS deals with these forces as it studies moving bodies in relation to forces that cause their motion.

* A force is any action that causes a change in the physical shape or the state of motion of an object.

**Note:**

* Force is a **vector** quantity. So, when taking the **net** (or **total**, or **resultant**) force, one must consider the directions.
* Example: \(F_{1}\) = negative ; \(F_{2}\) = positive 

\begin{tabular}{||c||c||c||} \hline Method & Symbol: \(W\) & \\ \hline \end{tabular}

is a measure of the gravitational force that the Earth exerts on the object.

\(m=\) mass of the object (in kg).

\(g=9.81\) acceleration of free fall near the surface of the Earth

Do not confuse mass \(m\) with weight \(W\).

Non-context (field) forces

Forces that are exerted by force fields and do not require physical contact between interacting bodies.

Examples

1. Weight (gravitational force)
2. Electrostatic force (force between charges)
3. Electromagnetic force (force between magnetic materials/ moving charges)

## Chapter 1 Contact Forces

Forces that are exerted by bodies in physical contact and act through the surface of contact.

Examples

1. Normal force \(N\)
2. Frictional force \(f\)
3. Tension \(T\) (force along the length of a cable)
4. Compressive Force (force exerted by external bodies on an elastic material)

Normal force acts in the direction perpendicular to the surface.

Frictional force acts in the direction opposite to the motion of a body.

* Tension will be discussed later.

Appendix A body continues in its state of rest or uniform motion in a straight line, unless a resultant external force acts on it

The first law implies that

1. the state of rest required no resultant force to maintain it.
2. the state of uniform velocity also requires no resultant force to maintain it.

The inertia of a body can be described as its _reluctance to start moving_, or to change its motion once it has started.

The mass \(m\) of a body is a measure of its inertia.

The larger the mass, the greater the inertia, hence greater reluctance to any change in motion.

The larger the mass, the larger the force needed to change the motion.

## Appendix

When the state of an object remains unchanged even though two or more forces are acting upon it, the object is said to be in **equilibrium Conditions**

An object is said to be in equilibrium if

1. the resultant force on the object is zero.
2. the resultant torque (\(\tau\)) on the object about any axis is zero.

A woman standing on the floor.

Since the woman is in equilibrium, the forces \(N\) exerted by the floor on her is equal to the magnitude of her weight \(W\). The resultant force is zero because \(W\) and \(N\) cancel out each other.

The vector sum of the forces is zero.

Note the following concerning action-reaction pair

1. The two forces must be of the **same type.**
2. The two forces act on **different** bodies and they therefore **do not cancel each other**.
* There are situations where forces are equal but opposite, but they are not action-reaction pairs.
* This often happens when an object is in **equilibrium*** When the swimmer exerts force \(F_{feet\ on\ wall}\) on the wall through her feet, the wall exerts an equal force \(F_{wall\ on\ feet}\) in the opposite direction.
* Thus, she accelerates to the left.
* This is also true when we are walking or running. The ground exerts force on our feet as we exert force on the ground.

* The forces \(W\) and \(N\) acting on the woman are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction.
* However, they are not the **same type of force** and they both act on the **same object**.
* Hence, they are **NOT** an action-reaction pair.
* The force _N_' exerted by the woman on the floor and normal force \(N\) are considered an action-reaction pair.

## 1.1. **Narrow's Second Law of Motion**

The rate of change of momentum of a body is proportional to the resultant force acting on it and occurs in the direction of the force.

This law implies that a body with _greater momentum_ compared to one with lesser will either require

1. a greater force to stop it in the same time, or
2. a longer time to stop it using the same force.

\begin{tabular}{l l} Formula & \(F_{net}=ma\) \\ \hline \(F_{net}=v\frac{dm}{dt}\) & \\ \end{tabular}

\begin{tabular}{c c}  & \(F_{net}=\frac{dp}{dt}=\frac{d(mv)}{dt}\) \\ Using chain rule, & \\ \(F_{net}=m\frac{dv}{dt}+v\frac{dm}{dt}\)* Is a force along the length of a rope.
* It is a pulling force that acts along a rope or a cable

Shown in the figure on the left is an example of an _Atwood machine_ wherein two objects, \(m_{1}\) and \(m_{2}\), are suspended over a pulley by a cable.

Assuming that the cable's mass is negligible, we can say that the cable has the **same magnitude of tension \(T\)** on both side of the pulley as shown in the free body diagrams of \(m_{1}\) and \(m_{2}\)

**Practice Example 2**

A hockey puck of mass 170 g is sliding to the right on a frictionless floor with a velocity of 2.0 m/s. Meanwhile a box weighing 1.0 kg is pushed on the same frictionless floor so that it moves to the left at a velocity of 0.20 m/s.

(a) Which of the two objects has the higher magnitude of momentum?

(b) Calculate the total momentum of the two objects.

**Practice Example 3**

A box of mass 2.5 kg is pulled from the ground using a cable. (a) What is the force \(T\) exerted by the cable on the box if the box is pulled such that it accelerates 0.30 m/s2? Draw the free body diagram of the box. (This part is a worked example (the solution is given), you can solve item (b)).

**Solution:**

Following the _solving tip_ discussed above, we take upward direction as the positive direction as this is the direction of acceleration.

\(F_{net}=ma\)

\(T-W=ma\to T=ma+mg\)

\(T=m(a+g)\)

\(T=(2.5)(0.3+9.81)\)

\(T=25.3\)\(N\) (upwards)* is defined as the product of a force \(F\) acting on an object and the time \(\Delta t\) for which the force acts.

\begin{tabular}{l l} \(p=\) momentum, \(F=\) force, \(\Delta t=\) time \\ \end{tabular}

\begin{tabular}{l l} \(t_{i}\) & \(t_{i}\) & \(t_{i}\) \\ \end{tabular}

## Appendix A Image-Momentum Theorem

The impulse of a force acting on an object is equal to the **change in momentum** of the object.

\(\int_{t_{i}}^{t_{f}}Fdt=\Delta p\)\(t_{i},t_{f}=\) initial and final time\(\Delta p=p_{f}-p_{i}=\) change in momentum.

\(F=\) force

**Derivation:**

By Newton's second law of motion

\[F=\frac{dp}{dt}\rightarrow\int_{t_{i}}^{t_{f}}Fdt=\int_{p_{i}}^{p_{f}}dp\]

\(\int_{t_{i}}^{t_{f}}Fdt=\Delta p\)

## Practice Example 6

You throw a piece of clay and a bouncy stress ball onto a wall. The clay stuck on the wall while the ball bounces off the wall. If both objects weigh the same, which of the two experiences greater impulse from the wall?

## Appendix A Proof of Observation of Linear Momentum

It states that the linear **momentum** of a system **remains unchanged**

**provided no net external force** acts on the system

\[\begin{array}{c}\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{Total initial momentum}\ =\ \text{Total final momentum}\\ m_{A}u_{A}+m_{B}u_{B}=m_{A}v_{A}+m_{B}v_{B}\end{array}\]

\(u_{A},u_{B}=\text{initial velocities of objects A and B}\)

\(v_{A},v_{B}=\text{final velocities of objects A and B}\)

\(m_{A},m_{B}=\text{masses of objects A and B}\)

**Meaning:**

* The total momentum before collision is equal to the total momentum after the collision, which implies that **momentum is conserved.*** Consider two masses, \(m_{A}\) and \(m_{B}\), colliding with one another.
* Before collision, they move with velocities \(u_{A}\) and \(u_{B}\) respectively.
* After collision, they move off with final velocities, \(v_{A}\) and \(v_{B}\).
* During the brief collision, (Newton's third law of motion)
* \(F_{A\,on\,B}=-F_{B\,on\,A}\)
* In the absence of other forces, \(F_{A\,on\,B}=\frac{dp_{B}}{dt}\) and \(F_{B\,on\,A}=\frac{dp_{A}}{dt}\)

where \(p_{A}\) and \(p_{B}\) are the momenta of objects A and B.
* Thus \[\begin{array}{c}\frac{dp_{B}}{dt}=-\frac{dp_{A}}{dt}\rightarrow\frac{\Delta p _{B}}{\Delta t}=-\frac{\Delta p_{A}}{\Delta t}\rightarrow\Delta p_{B}=-\Delta p _{A}\\ m_{B}v_{B}-m_{B}u_{B}=-(m_{A}v_{A}-m_{A}u_{A})\end{array}\]
* Rearranging \[m_{A}u_{A}+m_{B}u_{B}=m_{A}v_{A}+m_{b}v_{B}\]
## Appendix A Appendix

* Total kinetic energy is greater after collision. Example: explosion.
* Some form of potential energy, e.g., elastic, or chemical, is converted to kinetic energy.

**Practice Example 8**

Two particles A and B collide head on as they move towards each other. Particle A of mass 160 g travels at speed 2.0 m/s while particle B of mass 220 g move at speed 3.0 m/s. After the collision, sphere A rebounds with speed 2.4 m/s.

**A**: What is the final velocity of the particle B? (indicate both magnitude and direction)
**B**: Is the collision elastic?

**Practice Example 9**

A hard sphere of mass \(2m\) moving with a speed \(u\) collide with a stationary sphere with mass \(m\). After collision, they coalesce and move with a common velocity \(v\).

**a) Determine the common velocity of the spheres after collision.**

**b) Determine the ratio of the kinetic energy of the system after collision to that of before collision.**

**c) Explain what happened to the kinetic energy that is 'lost'.**

**Practice Example 2**

A hockey puck of mass 170 g is sliding to the right on a frictionless floor with a velocity of 2.0 m/s. Meanwhile a box weighing 1.0 kg is pushed on the same frictionless floor so that it moves to the left at a velocity of 0.20 m/s.

(a) Which of the two objects has the higher magnitude of momentum?

(b) Calculate the total momentum of the two objects.

**Solution:**

Momentum of hockey puck: \(p_{puck}=mv=(0.17)(2)=0.340\ kg\ m/s\) (to the right)

Momentum of box: \(p_{box}=mv=(1)(-0.2)=-0.2\ kg\frac{m}{s}=0.2\ kg\ m/s\) (to the left)

(a) The hockey puck has higher momentum.

(b)\(p_{\text{total}}=p_{\text{puck}}+p_{\text{box}}=0.34-0.20=0.14\) kg m/s

**Practice Example 3**

A box of mass 2.5 kg is pulled from the ground using a cable. (a) What is the force \(T\) exerted by the cable on the box if the box is pulled such that it accelerates 0.30 m/s2? Draw the free body diagram of the box. (This part is a worked example (the solution is given), you can solve item (b)).

**Solution:**

Let us take downward direction as the positive direction.

\(F_{net}=ma\)

\(W-T=ma\to a=\frac{W-T}{m}\)

\(a=\frac{mg-T}{m}\)

\(a=\frac{(2.5)(9.81)-24}{2.5}\)

\(a=0.21\ m/s^{2}\) (downwards)\(F_{net,x}=ma\)

\(W\sin\theta=ma\)

\(mg\sin\theta=ma\)

\(a=g\sin\theta=(9.81)\sin\ 15\)

\(a=2.54\,m/s^{2}\)

**Practice Example 5**

A real-life application of an Atwood's machine is an elevator of mass \(m_{E}=1200\ kg\) and its counterweight of mass \(m_{c}=900\ kg\). Assuming that the cable's mass is negligible, calculate the

a) acceleration of the elevator and

b) tension in the cable

**Solution:**

Free body diagram. Note that the tension is the same on both side of the pulley. Let us consider upward motion as the positive direction of motion. We denote the acceleration of elevator as \(a_{E}\) while \(a_{C}\) for the counterweight.

Elevator:

\[\begin{array}{c}F_{net}=m_{E}a_{E}\\ T-m_{E}g=m_{E}a_{E}\end{array} \tag{1}\]

Counterweight:

\[\begin{array}{c}F_{net}=ma_{C}\\ T-m_{C}g=ma_{C}\end{array} \tag{2}\]

**Practice Example 6**

You throw a piece of clay and a bouncy stress ball onto a wall. The clay stuck on the wall while the ball bounces off the wall. If both objects weigh the same, which of the two experiences greater impulse from the wall?

**Answer:**

We can answer this using the _impulse-momentum theorem_. The clay's final momentum is zero so the change in momentum of the clay is just the initial momentum. For the stress ball, the final momentum is opposite of the initial which means the absolute value of the change in momentum is the sum of the initial and final momentum. Since the change in momentum of the stress ball is higher than that of the clay, the ball has higher experienced impulse from the wall.

**Answer:**

Graphically, impulse is the area under the curve.

\[\text{Impulse}=\tfrac{1}{2}(5)(5)+\tfrac{1}{2}(7.5-5)(5)=18.75\text{ N s}\]

Using impulse-momentum theorem,

\[\Delta p=\text{Impulse}\]

\[p_{f}-p_{i}=18.75\]

\[mv_{f}-mv_{i}=18.75\]

\[v_{f}=\frac{18.75+mv_{i}}{m}=\frac{18.75+(4.5)(1)}{4.5}=5.17\overline{m}/ \text{s}\]

This is the velocity starting from 7.5 s.

**(Solution b)** Collision is elastic if the total kinetic energy is conserved.

\[\frac{1}{2}m_{A}u_{A}^{2}+\frac{1}{2}m_{B}u_{B}^{2}\overset{?}{=}\frac{1}{2}m_{A} v_{A}^{2}+\frac{1}{2}m_{B}v_{B}^{2}\]

\[\frac{1}{2}(0.16)(2)^{2}+\frac{1}{2}(0.22)(3)^{2}\overset{?}{=}\frac{1}{2}(0.1 6)(2.4)^{2}+\frac{1}{2}(0.22)(1.37)^{2}\]

\[1.31\neq 0.667\]

The total KE is not conserved so the collision is not elastic.
