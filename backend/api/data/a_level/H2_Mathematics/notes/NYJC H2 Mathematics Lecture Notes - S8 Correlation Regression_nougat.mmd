## Chapter 8 Correlation & Regression

At the end of this chapter, students should be able to

* use a scatter diagram to determine if there is a plausible linear relationship between two variables
* calculate and interpret the product moment correlation coefficient as a measure of the fit of a linear model to the scatter diagram
* find the equation of the least-squares regression line
* use the appropriate regression line to make prediction or estimate a value in practical situations (interpolation and extrapolation), and explain how well the situation is modelled by the linear regression model
* use a square, reciprocal or logarithmic transformation to achieve linearity

### 8.1 Terminology

#### 8.1.1 Dependent and Independent Variables

In statistics, **bivariate data** is data that has two variables. The following table shows 4 sets of bivariate data \(x\) and \(y\). Is there any relationship between each pair of variables?

\begin{tabular}{|l|c|} \hline \(x\) & \(y\) \\ \hline Student's Mathematics mark & Student's Physics mark \\ \hline Age of a tree & Trunk circumference \\ \hline Length of leg of a student & Distance jumped by a student \\ \hline Monthly advertising expenditure & Monthly sales \\ \hline \end{tabular} In a bivariate pair, an **independent variable** is a variable whose variation does not depend on that of another. In an experiment, the independent variable would be the one which you have "control" over, thus allowing you to vary its value to determine the value of the corresponding **dependent variable**.

It may be possible to identify _from context_ the independent variable and the dependent variable. For example, if we are investigating how the length of a pendulum will affect its period of swing, then the length of the pendulum will be the **independent** variable and its period will be the **dependent** variable.

The following table shows another set of bivariate data.

\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|} \hline \(x\) & 10 & 20 & 30 & 40 & 50 & 60 & 70 & 80 \\ \hline \(y\) & 20 & 21 & 23 & 24 & 23 & 25 & 28 & 29 \\ \hline \end{tabular} The values of \(x\) varies at a _fixed increment_. This is another indication that \(x\) is likely to be the **independent** variable (controlled) and \(y\) the **dependent** variable. If context is provided, the fact that \(x\) increases at fixed intervals would give further evidence that it is the independent variable.

**Example 1**:
* A botanist wishes to investigate the effects of artificial light on the growth of a certain type of plant. A random sample of 7 seeds of the plant species is planted in 7 different pots and the amount of artificial light per day given to each pot is varied. The following results are recorded after a period of 14 days: 
 State the independent variable and the dependent variable (if any), justifying your choice.

#### 8.1.2 Scatter Diagram

A **scatter diagram**, in which pairs of data \(\left(x_{t},y_{t}\right)\) are plotted, can be used to represent bivariate data graphically. A scatter diagram shows the general pattern and relationship between two variables.

**Remarks:**

* A scatter diagram gives a pictorial representation of how two variables \(x\) and \(y\) may be related.
* The independent variable if applicable is plotted on the horizontal axis.
* A scatter diagram is often used to determine if there is a **linear** relationship between two variables.

**(iv)** When \(y=80\), \(x=1.2356\left(80\right)+3.4317=102.2797\)

\(\equiv 102\) (nearest whole number)

Thus, the estimated time taken for a delegate to travel 80 km for the journey is 102 minutes correct to one decimal place.

**Remark:**

In **Examples 6** and **8**, the same data set were used and the regression line of \(y\) on \(x\) and the regression line of \(x\) on \(y\) are drawn on the same \(x\)-\(y\) plane below with \(x\) on the horizontal axis and \(y\) on the vertical axis. Observe that the two lines are different and they **intersect**\(at\)\(\left(\overline{x},\overline{y}\right)\).

### Transformation of Data Points from Non-Linear to Linear

Two variables may be governed by a relation that is non-linear. For example, the equation \(y=a+bx^{2}\) indicates that \(y\) and \(x\) are related by a quadratic relationship. However, we can view this equation as \(y\) with respect to \(x^{2}\). If we let \(u=x^{2}\), then \(y=a+bu\) and \(y\) and \(u\) are linearly related. We see that in making a transformation, \(u=x^{2}\), we have changed two variables that are non-linearly related to two variables that are linearly related.

The table below illustrates some suitable examples of transformation on the variables to obtain a linear relationship.

\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|} \hline
**Equation** & **Independent Variable** & **Dependent Variable** \\ \hline \(y=a+\frac{b}{x}\) & \(\frac{1}{x}\) & \(y\) \\ \hline \(y=a+bx^{2}\) & \(x^{2}\) & \(y\) \\ \hline \(y^{2}=a+bx\) & \(x\) & \(y^{2}\) \\ \hline \(y=a+b\ln x\) & \(\ln x\) & \(y\) \\ \hline \(\ln y=a+bx\) & \(x\) & \(\ln y\) \\ \hline \(y=ae^{bx}\) & \(x\) & \(\ln y\) \\ \(\Rightarrow\)\(\ln y=\ln a+bx\) & & \\ \hline \end{tabular}
**Note:**

1. The above list is not exhaustive. The transformation will usually be given in the question.
2. You may be given a scatter diagram and asked to compare two or more proposed models and determine which model is a better fit. Simply state which equation fits the shape of the scatter plot. If there is more than one possibility, compute the product moment correlation coefficient for each model and break the tie by choosing the model with \(\left|\begin{array}{c}\\ \end{array}\right|\) closest to 1,

**Example 11**:

A research worker gave each of eight children a list of words of varying difficulty and asked them to define the meaning of each word. The following table shows the age in years and the number of correctly defined words for each child.

\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|} \hline Child & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 & 7 & 8 \\ \hline Age, \(x\) (years) & 2.5 & 3.1 & 4.3 & 5.0 & 5.9 & 7.1 & 8.1 & 9.49 \\ \hline Number of correct words, \(y\) & 9 & 13 & 18 & 25 & 35 & 53 & 81 & 132 \\ \hline \end{tabular}
**(i)**: Using a scatter diagram, comment on the suitability of finding the linear regression line of \(y\) on \(x\).
**(ii)**: Find the product moment correlation coefficient between \(\ln y\) and \(\ln x\) and sketch the scatter diagram of \(\ln y\) against \(\ln x\). Comment on the suitability of the model \(\ln y=a+b\ln x\).
**(iii)**: Find the least-squares regression line of \(\ln y\) on \(\ln x\) and sketch this line on the scatter diagram in **(ii)**.
**Solution:**

**Example 13**:

A student wishes to determine the relationship between the length of a pendulum, \(l\), and the corresponding period, \(T\). After conducting the experiment, he obtained the following set of data:

\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|} \hline \(l\) (cm) & 150 & 135 & 120 & 105 & 90 & 75 & 60 & 45 & 30 & 15 \\ \hline \(T\) (s) & 2.45 & 2.31 & 2.22 & 2.07 & 1.91 & 1.74 & 1.56 & 1.35 & 1.10 & 0.779 \\ \hline \end{tabular}

(i)  Obtain a scatter diagram of this set of data.

(ii)  The student proposes the following two models:

\[\begin{array}{l}\Lambda:\ T=a+b\ln(l)\\ B:\ T^{2}=a+bl.\end{array}\]

(a)  Calculate the product moment correlation coefficient for both models, giving your answers to 4 decimal places.

(b)  Determine which model is appropriate for this set of data.

(iii)  Using the model determined in (ii) part (b), estimate the value of \(l\) when \(T=3\)  to 1 decimal place. Comment on the suitability of this method.

(iv)  Find a value of \(l\) and its corresponding value of \(T\)  such that the equation of the regression line for the chosen model will remain the same after the addition of this pair of values.

**Solution**:

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|} \hline (i) & The scatter diagram of the data set is as shown. \\ \hline \end{tabular}

**Chapter S8 Correlation and Regression**

\begin{tabular}{|c|} \hline (ii)(a) By GC, the product moment correlation coefficient for model \(A\) is \(r=0.9871\) and the product moment correlation coefficient for model \(B\) is \(r=0.9996\). \\ (b) Since \(0.9996>0.9871\), model \(B\) indicates a stronger positive linear correlation between \(l\) and \(T^{2}\) than the linear correlation between \(\ln\left(l\right)\) and \(T\) of model \(A\). Hence, model \(B\) is an appropriate model. \\ \end{tabular} Note that both equations can apply to this scatter diagram. Thus we compare the value of \(r\) as instructed in the question to determine the better model. \\ (iii) (Using model \(B\)) The regression line of \(T^{2}\) on \(l\) is \(T^{2}=0.025136+0.040060l\). Substituting \(T=3\) into the above equation, we have \(3^{2}=0.025136+0.040060l\). Thus, \(l=224.0\). Using the regression line may not be appropriate as \(T=3\) is not within the data range even though \(r\) is close 1. \\ (iv) Note that \(\left(\overline{l},\overline{T^{2}}\right)\) is the _only_ point that we can safely add to the set of data points and not change the regression line. \\  By GC, we find that \(\overline{l}=82.5\) and \(\overline{T^{2}}=3.3300541\) & See ANNEX for the GC keystrokes to find the values of \(\overline{l}\) and \(\overline{T^{2}}\). \\ \end{tabular}

**Note:** For any set of data, adding the point \(\left(\overline{x},\overline{y}\right)\) will not alter the equation of the regression line of \(y\) on \(x\) and the equation of the regression line of \(x\) on \(y\).

**Chapter S8 Correlation and Regression**

**SUMMARY: For Regression,**

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|} \hline a. & We first determine using a scatter diagram that a linear relationship between the variables \\  & \(x\) and \(y\) exist. \\ \hline b. & For a regression line \(y\) on \(x,x\) is taken as the independent variable and \(y\) as the dependent variable. \\  & For a regression line \(x\) on \(y,y\) is taken as the independent variable and \(x\) as the dependent variable. \\ \hline c. & When it is not obvious which is the independent or dependent variable, then, \\  & If you are given \(x\) and asked to _estimate_\(y\), use the regression line \(y\) on \(x\). \\  & If you are given \(y\) and asked to _estimate_\(x\), use the regression line \(x\) on \(y\) \\ \hline d. & If it is clear from the question that \(x\) is the independent variable (e.g. controlled variable), \\  & while \(y\) is the dependent variable, then **there is only one regression line \(y\) on \(x\)**. \\  & (Note: you should not find regression line \(x\) on \(y\) in this case) \\ \hline e. & Uses of the regression line of \(y\) on \(x\): \\  & Should only be used to estimate values of \(y\) within the range of values of \(x\) used in calculating the regression line. \\  & [_Extrapolation_ is making a prediction outside the range of values in the sample used to generate the model] \\  & [_Interpolation_ is making a prediction within the range of values in the sample] \\  & Extrapolation should not be used as we have no way of knowing the relationship between \(x\) and \(y\) that are not in the data range. \\ \hline f. & Both regression lines of \(y\) on \(x\) and \(x\) on \(y\) will pass through the point \(\left(\overline{x},\ \overline{y}\right)\). \\ \hline g. & If the scatter diagram reveals a non-linear relationship between two variables \(x\) and \(y\), say of \\  & the form, \(y=a+b\!f\left(x\right)\), then it is possible to introduce a new variable \(u=f\left(x\right)\) so that the \\  & equation becomes \(y=a+bu\) which is linear in \(u\) and \(y\). \\ \hline h. & Given a few non-linear models, we first use the scatter diagram to determine which is the \\  & appropriate model.

**ANNEX**

**GC Keystrokes for Example 11**

_To use the GC to transform the data and obtain the regression line of my on lnx._

**Press [STAT]** and highlight '1:Edit...' and press [ENTER]. Key in the values of \(x\) and \(y\) into \(L_{1}\) and \(L_{2}\) respectively,

In cell \(L_{3}\), key in "\(\ln\bigl{(}L_{1}\bigr{)}\) and press [ENTER].

The command " is to ensure that the GC stores the formula. " can be found on the '+' button.

Notice that there is a black icon in the header of \(L_{3}\) to indicate that a formula is stored. When the cursor is moved to \(L_{3}\), the formula "\(\ln\bigl{(}L_{1}\bigr{)}\)" will appear below the screen to indicate that \(L_{3}=\ln\bigl{(}L_{1}\bigr{)}\). If" is omitted when keying in "\(\ln\bigl{(}L_{1}\bigr{)}\)" in \(L_{3}\), the formula will not stored.

In cell \(L_{4}\), key in "\(\ln\bigl{(}L_{2}\bigr{)}\) and press [ENTER].

**Press [STAT]**, highlight '**CALC**' and select '4:LinReg(ax+b)' and press [ENTER].

To obtain the product moment correlation coefficient between \(\ln y\) and \(\ln x\), we key in '\(L_{3}\)' in '**Xlist:**' and '\(L_{4}\)' in '**Ylist**'. We then scroll down to '**Calculate**' and press [ENTER].

By GC, \(r=0.982\).

\(\ln y=1.948\ln x+0.247\)

Since \(r=0.982\) is very close to 1 and also based on the scatter diagram, we can say that the model \(\ln y=a+b\ln x\) is suitable.

**Note:**

You will need to plot \(L_{4}\) against \(L_{3}\) in your GC to see that lnx and lny are linearly related.

(v) Find the equation of the regression line of \(x\) on \(y\) and use it to find the value of \(y\) when \(x=6.5\). (vi) Compare the two values of \(y\) found in (iv) and (v). What do you notice? Why is it so? (vii) Plot both the regression lines of \(y\) on \(x\) and \(x\) on \(y\) on your scatter plot in part (i). \[[(\text{ii})\ 0.9913\ (\text{iii})\ y=0.1296x+1.6579\ (\text{iv})\ 2.50\ (\text{v})\ x=7.5805y-12.4899,\ y=2.51]\]
