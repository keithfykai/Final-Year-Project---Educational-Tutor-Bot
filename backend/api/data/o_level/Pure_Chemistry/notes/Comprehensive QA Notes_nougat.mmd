## General QA Skills

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|} \hline Observation Type & Things to Note \\ \hline General Guidelines & 1) Keep your bench and apparatus clean to prevent contamination. \\  2) Make sure droppers, reactant bottles, litmus paper, universal indicator paper, etc. do not touch the side of the test tubes to prevent contamination. \\  3) When not in use, keep any droppers inside the reagent they are used to add. \\  4) Regardless of whether you are adding a solid, adding a reagent, heating, etc., always do it slowly first to prevent missing subtle observations. \\  & a) For reagents, add dropwise before adding in excess. \\  & b) For solids, add one small spatula before adding in excess. \\  & c) For heating, heat gently (on and off the flame) before heating strongly. \\  5) Record any observations immediately because the degrees of change may be required. \\  6) Write in the margins the ions that you expect to be in the test tube based on your observations. \\  7) Note down the condition for the observation (e.g. heating, adding what reagent) in the answer booklet. \\  8) If you know an observation must happen by theory or if the question tells you that it will happen, record the observation even if you don't see it. \\ \hline Initial Colour & Whenever a new reagent or solid is introduced, note down the colour in the answer booklet. \\  & Refer to the solid or reagent as "(colour) solid" or "(colour) solution" throughout the series of tests. It is insufficient to just identify its colour once. \\ \end{tabular}

Additionally, for solids, if it is a distinctive feature, identify if the solid is shiny, a powder or a crystal.

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|} \hline Precipitation & Use a small amount of the unknown reagent to prevent dissolution of ppt. \\  & Whenever you see the solution becoming opaque, cloudy or have specks, you should note down precipitation. \\  & For the complex ion test, you must add only a few drops of acid. Even then, you will only see small specks. \\  & For the CO\({}_{2}\) test, you must add a very small volume of Ca(OH)\({}_{2}\). The ppt. is not very obvious. \\ \end{tabular}

Frequently, a colour change will be observed. Do not discard the test tube if you don't see any change yet. Instead, set it aside.

* Whenever a solid is added to a liquid or solution, note down the solubility of the solid in the answer booklet.
* You have to identify the liquid or solution added, and the colour of the resultant solution.
* "Soluble in excess NaOH (aq) giving a colourless solution"
* "Soluble in excess"

Whenever testing for solubility, make sure to tap the test tube against the palm of your hand for a sufficiently long time to dissolve solids which may not be very soluble.
* If there is a lot of precipitate in the test tube, or the solute is not very soluble, decant the solution into the sink so that there is less ppt. in the test tube, and continue shaking.

When you expect to test for solubility in excess reagent, add less of the reagent that produces a ppt. so that it is the limiting reagent and you will be able to see the solid dissolve.

* Before you carry out any test, always consider what gas might be produced and prepare the relevant gas tests. Normally, gases are produced when these tests are carried out: adding acids, metal strips, powders or heating.
* You will never be testing for SO2 or NO2 because these are toxic. If you did not get the expected observation, you did the test wrong.

If you expect a gas to be observed, you should add more of the reagent or solid that gives you the gas so that you can see observations more clearly. Some gases may not be produced in a high concentration. Hence, the observations may be very faint. Here are two common examples:

* CO2: Use limited Ca(OH)2 because if not the ppt. is too faint to see.
* Cl2: heat the mixture of KMnO4 and Cl-.

* Whenever you are heating a solid directly:
* Add a small amount so you don't have to wait forever if the solid decomposes completely. E.g. (NH4)2CO3
* Hold the tube in an almost horizontal position to speed up heating.
* Note down in the answer booklet if water droplets appear at the mouth of the test tube. This typically happens for crystalline solids.

When you are heating a liquid or solution directly:

* Heat gently first before heating strongly to prevent the test tube from cracking.
* Take the test tube off the flame when you start to see bubbles to prevent spurring.
* The test-tube should not be held in a fixed position all the time. Remove it from the flame every now and then and shake gently.

Whenever you start to see that there is a colour change, note it down immediately.

Even if it is small or gradual, note down every step that you can. Do not only note down the initial and final colour. It is always safer to record more than less.

Always leave a sample of an unknown substance aside to allow for change in colour to be seen if it happens after a while.

The colour change can be seen more clearly if you look from the top of the test tube when placed against a white tile.

Filtration

Tear off a small piece of the filter paper to allow for better filtration.

If the residue is required, wash it with deionised water. When the water has drained, wash the precipitate again with deionised water while it is in the filter funnel. Do not collect the washings of the residue together with the filtrate.

Record the colour of the filtrate and the residue.

## Colours of QA

Factors to Consider for whether you should realistically study this

1. What grade you want to get matters. Only study this if you want an A or A1 grade. This is the most important factor. If you don't want an A or A1 grade, please focus on something more efficient like practice papers. This is useless for you.
2. Cambridge sets a QA question every year (almost every year for 'O' Levels). So you can and will secure the QA marks if you do study this.
3. Cambridge can and have tested ions which are not provided in their data booklet. If you do not know what colour it is and assume it is an ion provided in the data booklet and write the corresponding colour, you will not get the mark for that question. * Theoretically you can answer all questions if you've'mastered the QA skills', but if your 'QA skills' are shit, then at least you can use this.
4. This is **extremely** excessive. More than half of the chemicals provided here are not required knowledge for the 'A' Levels, and those in red font are chemicals which will not be tested due to their negative health impacts.
5. The time period in which you study this matters. If you study this before your school covers QA in practical lessons, then during the actual practical lessons, it will help you focus on learning the 'QA skills', rather than trying to cross check the data booklet for what colour it is. Do not study this when your school covers QA in practical lessons, because it will only confuse you. You may study this nearing the 'O' levels or 'A' levels to make sure you're prepared for anything Cambridge throws at you, but only after you've studied everything else.

\({}^{2+}\)

\({}^{1}\) It appears green because it is [CrCl\({}_{2}\)(H\({}_{2}\)O)\({}_{d}\)]\({}^{*}\). But you can pretend the green solution is [Cr(H\({}_{2}\)O)\({}_{d}\)]\({}^{3*}\) in our syllabus.
