## 1 Basic Concept in Kinetics

### Collision Theory

(Understanding reaction at particulate level)

For a reaction between two particles to occur _two_ conditions must be met:

1) The particles must collide in the **correct orientation.**

2) The particles must collide with **sufficient minimum energy (known as the activation energy)** to bring about the necessary re-organisation of the bonds in the colliding particles.

\begin{tabular}{l l} _Note_: & Assuming product to be & A \\ The greater the number of particles & & \\ involved in a single & & \\ step, the more & & \\ difficult it is to have & \\ all of them to collide & & \\ at the correct & & \\ orientation to affect a & & \\ reaction. Hence & & \\ usually, only a & & \\ maximum of two & & \\ particles will collide & & \\ in a particular step of & & \\ a reaction. & & \\ \end{tabular}

When particles **collide at the correct orientation and sufficient energy**, this collision is known as **effective collision** which will bring about a chemical reaction.

\begin{tabular}{l l} _(A B)_ & & Correct Orientation \\ _Sufficient energy to react_ & \\ _A B_ & & Reaction Occurs \\ \end{tabular}

The greater the frequency of effective collisions, the greater the rate of reaction.

Hence, we can easily deduce that the experimental conditions required for increasing the number of effective collisions to increase reaction rate are:

**(i)**: Increase in temperature of the reacting particles
**(ii)**: Increase concentration of particles/ increasing surface area of solid particles
**(iii)**: Use of catalyst

### FACTORS Affecting Rate of Reaction

Learning Objectives:

* explain qualitatively, in terms of frequency of collisions, the effect of concentration changes on the rate of a reaction

#### Concentration of Aqueous or Gaseous Reactants

Rate of reaction **increases** as the concentration of reactants is increased.

Increasing the concentration or pressure (for gases) is equivalent to increasing the amount of reactants particles per unit volume. This will increase the frequency of effective collisions between molecules and this increases the rate of reaction.

The rate of a typical reaction is fastest at the beginning, where concentration of reactants is at their highest and gradually decreases as the reactants are used up and their concentration decreases.

#### Surface Area of Solid Reactant

In a solid substance, only the particles on the surface can come into contact with a surrounding reactant. If the solid is in powdered form, then the surface area of contact increases dramatically, frequency of collision increases, number of effective collision increases. Hence, rate increases correspondingly.

## Boltzmann Distribution Curve

Figure 1: Schematic view of the Boltzmann distribution curve.

#### Temperature

* **Learning objective:**
* explain qualitatively, in terms both of the Boltzmann distribution and of collision frequency, the effect of temperature change on a rate constant (and hence, on the rate) of a reaction

Increasing temperature of the reaction causes an increase in the rate of reaction. Rate approximately doubles for every 10 \({}^{\circ}\)C increase in temperature.

* **Worked example 1** CgHgCH2C_I_ undergoes a substitution reaction to form CgHgCH2CN as shown in the reaction below.

* **With the aid of Boltzmann distribution curve, predict and explain the effect on the rate of this reaction when the reaction temperature is decreased.**

* **When temperature of the reaction decreases, average kinetic energy of the reacting molecules decreases. The fraction of molecules with K.E.**\(\geq\)**E\({}_{a}\) decreases as shown in the Boltzmann distribution. The frequency of effective collisions decreases hence rate of reaction decreases.**

#### Catalyst

* **Learning objective:**
* explain that, in the presence of a catalyst, a reaction has a different mechanism, i.e. one of lower activation energy, giving a larger rate constant
* interpret this catalytic effect on a rate constant in terms of the Boltzmann distribution

A catalyst speeds up the rate of a chemical reaction by **providing an alternative pathway with lower activation energy**. It does not undergo any permanent chemical change (not used up at the end of reaction). It exerts **no effect on the enthalpy change** of the reaction.

_Worked example 2_

Azomethane, CH\({}_{3}\)N=N-CH\({}_{3}\), is a common compound used in cancer research. It decomposes according to the following equation:

\[\text{CH}_{3}\text{-N}\text{-N}\text{-CH}_{3}\left(\text{g}\right)\text{- CH}_{3}\text{CH}_{3}\left(\text{g}\right)\text{+ N}_{2}\left(\text{g}\right)\]

With the aid of the Boltzmann distribution, explain why the addition of a catalyst increases the rate of a reaction.

A catalyst provides an alternative reaction pathway with lower activation energy (E\({}_{\text{a2}}\)). The fraction of molecules with K.E. \(\geq\) E\({}_{\text{a}}\) increases as shown in the Boltzmann distribution. The frequency of effective collisions increases hence rate of reaction increases.

Energy Profile Diagram

In Energetics, we have learnt to draw **energy level diagram** which shows the stability of product relative to reactant. The energy level diagram (on the left) shows that in an endothermic reaction, product is less stable than reactant. The reaction is thus not energetically favorable.

To address both energetic feasibility and kinetic feasibility (rate) of a reaction, an **energy profile diagram** should be drawn. It shows energy changes of particles _throughout a reaction._

From the energy profile diagram, the following can be inferred:

(i) relative stability of reactants/products

(ii) magnitude of activation energy in the reaction.

From the magnitude of the activation energy (E\({}_{a}\)), the rate of reaction can be inferred. A higher E\({}_{a}\) indicates a slower reaction.

### 3.3. Types of Catalyst

Learning objective:

* outline the mode of action of heterogeneous catalysis as exemplified by the catalytic removal of oxides of nitrogen in the exhaust gases from car engines
* describe enzymes as biological catalysts which may have specific activity

#### 3.3.1 Biological catalyst (Enzymes)

Enzymes are complex globular proteins that catalyze biochemical reactions.

They contain an active site into which the reactant molecules of a particular shape and size will fit making them highly specific in their action.

The attractive forces between the reactant (substrate) molecule and the enzyme weakens the bonds within the substrate molecule, thereby lowering the activation energy and increasing the rate of reaction.

#### Heterogeneous Catalyst

Catalyst and the Reactants are in different phases.

\begin{tabular}{|c c|} \hline WATCH & How does catalytic hydrogenation reaction work? \\ _Lean_ & Watch [https://go.gov.sg/nic-kinetics-2](https://go.gov.sg/nic-kinetics-2) to find out. \\ \hline \end{tabular}

Usually involves a solid catalyst that catalyzes the reaction between gaseous reactants.

It catalyzes the reaction by bringing ALL reactant particles closer to each other and weakens the existing bonds in ALL reactant particles thereby providing an alternative pathway of lower activation energy for reaction to take place at a faster rate.

The energy profile diagram of the reaction with and without catalyst is as shown:

\begin{tabular}{|c c|} \hline Energy & Transition State & E\({}_{1}\) = E\({}_{a}\) of uncatalyzed reaction \\ \(\Delta\)H & E\({}_{2}\) = E\({}_{a}\) of catalysed reaction \\ \hline \end{tabular}

Reactants & E\({}_{3}\) \\ \hline \end{tabular}

\begin{tabular}{c c}  & **Mode of action in heterogeneous catalysis:** \\ \end{tabular}

\begin{tabular}{c c}  & **Step 1:** & **Adsorption** of reactant particles onto the surface of the catalyst. Weak interactions form between the reactant and catalyst. \\ \end{tabular}

\begin{tabular}{c c}  & **Step 2:** & **Reaction** at the surface occurs at a faster rate as reactant molecules are brought closer together and existing interactions in the reactant molecules are weakened. (lower E\({}_{a}\)) \\ \end{tabular}

\begin{tabular}{c c}  & **Step 3:** & **Description** of products from the catalyst surface. Catalyst is regenerated. \\ \end{tabular}

Catalysis at the solid metal surface involves the adsorption of reactant molecules on the surface catalyst atoms This has the effect of increasing the concentration of the reactants at the catalyst surface and also weakening of the bonds in the reactant molecules, i.e. activation energy is lowered.

## 2 Quantitative Kinetics

In the following sections, we will study the ways to quantify kinetic observation to draw predictions on reaction pathways and mechanisms.

### Difference between Instantaneous Rate and Initial Rate

Consider: 2HC/ (aq) + CaCO\({}_{3}\) (s) \(\longrightarrow\) CaCl\({}_{2}\) (aq) + CO\({}_{2}\) (g) + H\({}_{2}\)O (l)

_Note:_

The RATE of appearance of PRODUCT is **not necessarily equal to the RATE of disappearance of REACTANT. However, these rates can be related via **molar quantities** in a balanced chemical equation.

\[-\frac{\text{d}[\text{BrO}_{3}]}{\text{dt}}=-\frac{1}{5}\frac{\text{d}[\text {Br}^{-}]}{\text{dt}},\qquad\text{similarly,}-\frac{\text{d}[\text{BrO}_{3}]}{ \text{dt}}=\frac{1}{3}\frac{\text{d}[\text{Br}_{2}]}{\text{dt}}\]

\[\text{Rate of Reaction }=-\frac{\text{d}[\text{BrO}_{3}]}{\text{dt}}=-\frac{1}{5} \frac{\text{d}[\text{Br}^{-}]}{\text{dt}}=\frac{1}{3}\frac{\text{d}[\text{Br}_{ 2}]}{\text{dt}}\]

Based on the mole ratio of the reaction, on average

The rate of consumption of Br\({}^{-}\) would be 5 \(\times\) consumption rate of BrO\({}_{3}\).

The rate of production of Br\({}_{2}\) would be 3 \(\times\) consumption rate of BrO\({}_{3}\).

* **Instantaneous rate** of reaction is the rate at a particular point of time, it can be determined by finding the gradient of the tangent at any one point of the concentration-time graph. This is what we are keen to know in order to understand the mechanism of a reaction.
* **Initial rate** of reaction is the reaction rate at the start of the reaction, when an extremely small amount of reactants is used up. It corresponds to the slope of the tangent when t = 0. At initial rate, the rate of reaction is the highest due to the greatest amount of reactant consumed.

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:11]

In H1 Chemistry, we will need to know zero, first and second order of reaction.

Order of reaction is always with respect to a reagent. It will describe the effect of the concentration change of that reagent on the rate of reaction.

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|} \hline
**Order** & **Effect on Rate of Reaction** & **Rate vs conc graph** \\ \hline Zero & Rate of reaction is not affected by this reagent. (e.g. rate of reaction remains the same despite concentration doubled) & \\ \hline First & Rate of reaction is directly proportionate to the concentration of the reagent (linear relationship). (e.g. rate of reaction doubles when concentration is doubled) & \\ \hline Second & Rate of reaction is directly proportionate to square of concentration of reagent. (e.g. rate of reaction quadruples when concentration is doubled) & \\ \hline \end{tabular}

#### 2.2.2 Rate constant, \(k\)

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|} \hline WATCH & What are the factors affecting rate constant k? & \\ \(\textit{Lean}\) & How do these factors affect the rate constant? & \\ \hline Watch [https://go.gov.sg/nic-kinetics-9](https://go.gov.sg/nic-kinetics-9) to find out. & \\ \hline \end{tabular}

_Note:_

The effect of the changed conditions on rate of reaction can be explained by the collision theory with the aid of Boltzmann distribution curve.

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|} \hline
**Ordered** & **Effect on Rate of Reaction** & **Effect on value of rate constant, \(k\)** \\ \hline Zero & Rate of reaction is not affected by this reagent. (e.g. rate of reaction remains the same despite concentration doubled) & \\ \hline First & Rate of reaction is directly proportionate to the concentration of the reagent (linear relationship). (e.g. rate of reaction doubles when concentration is doubled) & \\ \hline Second & Rate of reaction is directly proportionate to square of concentration of reagent. (e.g. rate of reaction quadruples when concentration is doubled) & \\ \hline \end{tabular}

**Second** & **Effect on Rate of Reaction** & **Effect on value of rate constant, \(k\)** \\ \hline Order & **Effect on Rate of Reaction** & **Effect on value of rate constant, \(k\)** \\ \hline \end{tabular}

### Deducing the RATE EQUATION

Recall that rate = \(\frac{\text{d}[\ ]}{\text{dt}}\), hence rate of reaction can be tracked using the **changes in the concentration** of the reactant (or product as its production rate depends on the reactant consumption rate) and the **time taken**.

The **order of reaction** can then be deduced from two different methods (continuous and initial rate) and used to construct the rate equation. The two methods can also be combined to deduced the rate equation.

\begin{tabular}{|p{113.8pt}|p{113.8pt}|p{113.8pt}|} \cline{2-3} \multicolumn{1}{c|}{} & **CONTINUOUS METHOD** & **INITIAL RATE METHOD** \\ \hline
**No. of Experiments involved** & **A single experiment.** & **Multiple experiments.** \\ \hline
**Compare the change in reaction rate (measured by tracked over an over a period of time in** & **Comparate the change in reaction rate (measured by time taken) when concentration of a reactant is systematically changed between the experiments.** \\ \hline
**Data to collect from experiment** & **Concentration remaining in the reaction needs to be obtained through experiment.** & **Time taken in each experiment needs to be taken to determine the reaction rate for comparison.** \\ \hline
**Data Processing method** & **A concentration-time graph is plotted for analysis.** & **Order of reaction can be deduced by:** \\ \hline \end{tabular}

\begin{tabular}{|p{113.8pt}|p{113.8pt}|p{113.8pt}|} \cline{2-3} \multicolumn{1}{c|}{} & **Hair-life of graph can be used to deduce if reaction is first order.** & **(a) Rate-Concentration Graph** (b) Comparing how the degree of rate change due to change in concentration** \\ \hline \end{tabular}

#### 2.3.1 Data Processing Methods to Deduce Rate Equation

With the data obtained from the experiment, the data can be processed in one or more of these methods to deduce the rate equation

(i) **Inspection/Mathematical Method** - For Initial Rate Only (ii) **Graphical Methods** - For both Continuous and Initial Rate

In each of these methods, we will allow only 1 concentration to change and the other concentrations to stay constant. The concentrations which were kept constant may have impact on the rate of reaction but cannot be observed due to it being kept constant in that comparison / experiment.

Comparing the change in the rate of reaction with the changing concentration of reactant (or product), we can deduce the **order of reaction**. This can be used to construct the rate equation.

#### 2.3.1.1 Inspection/Mathematical Method

**Learning Objectives**:

 construct and use rate equations of the form rate = _KA_[B]" (limited to simple cases of single-step reactions, for which \(m\) and \(n\) are 0, 1 or 2), including:

To determine if t\({}_{1/2}\) is constant, any concentration on the y-axis can be the "initial concentration", not only concentration at t = 0.

1st and 2nd t\({}_{1/2}\) also _need not necessarily be taken in a consecutive manner_ as long as the "initial concentration" of 2nd t\({}_{1/2}\) is different from 1st t\({}_{1/2}\).

For example,

\(\bullet\) 2nd t\({}_{1/2}\) is obtained by taking the "initial concentration" to be 0.6 mol dm\({}^{-3}\), "final concentration" to be 0.3 mol dm\({}^{-3}\).
