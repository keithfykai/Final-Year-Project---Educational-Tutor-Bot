## Chapter 6 Circular Motion

The Singapore Flyer is currently one of the tallest Ferris wheel in the world. Described by its operators as an observation wheel, it reaches 42 stories high. At a total height of 165 m (541 feet) and a diameter of 150 m (492.1 feet), it was the tallest Ferris wheel at its inception, 5 m (16 feet) taller than the previous record holder, the Star of Nanchang. The Flyer was itself surpassed in 2014 by the High Roller in Las Vegas, which stands at 167.6 m (550 feet) with a diameter of 158.5 m (520 feet). The Ain Dubai in Dubai which was launched in 2021 stood at a height of 250 m (820 feet).

### Introduction

Circular motion is a type of motion we often encounter in our everyday lives, - the motion of a car and its passengers when navigating a bend, the motion of the capsules of a Ferris wheel when in rotation, children on a spinning merry-go-round, and clothes being spun in a spin dryer.

On a larger scale, in astronomy, we know that the moon circles the Earth, which circles the Sun, which circles the centre of the Milky Way.

On the atomic scale, for early models of the hydrogen atom, we picture an electron orbiting around the nucleus at the centre of the atom (a single proton in hydrogen's case).

Have you ever wondered?

Why must an airplane tilt when executing a turn?

Why the reading of your weight would be different at the bottom of a Ferris wheel as compared to the top?

Why do people in a roller coaster not fall out at the top of the loop? (No, it is not because of the belts!)

The exploration of the fascinating world of circular motion begins here.

**A Short Revision on basic ideas of Newton's Laws of Motion**

_Newton's 1st Law:_

Describes the motion of any object not subjected to a net external force, specifically that

an object at rest remains at rest, or

an object continues with constant speed in a straight line.

In the presence of a net external force, a constant mass experiences an acceleration governed by _Newton's 2nd Law._

\[\ddot{a}=\frac{\dot{F}_{net}}{m}\]

Note:

Forces which are parallel to the motion of an object result in its motion either speeding up or slowing down, with the direction of motion remaining along the original axis.

Forces which are perpendicular to the motion of the object cannot affect its speed, but instead will change its direction of motion.

Forces which are neither wholly parallel nor perpendicular to the direction of motion will affect both the speed and direction of the object upon which the force acts. (Consider projectile motion.)

**In this chapter you will learn that objects may move in circular paths when they experience a force or forces acting perpendicularly to their motion.**

### Kinematics of Circular Motion

When an extended object such as the wheel of a bicycle is rotating, different parts of the wheel will travel different distances in the same time. The outer parts of the wheel will travel larger distances and hence will have higher speeds than the inner parts of the wheel. However, all parts of the wheel will pass through the same angle in a given time. Hence the speed of rotation of a wheel is better expressed as an angular speed, as this is the same for all parts of the wheel.

#### 6.2.1 How angle is measured

The S.I. unit for angles is not the degree but the radian. An angle measured in radians is actually the ratio of two lengths: arc length and radius. The _arc length_\(s\) is the distance travelled along the circular path, and the angle \(\theta\) is said to _subtend_ the arc length at the circle centre (Figure 1).

Hence, note that \(\theta\) is actually a dimensionless quantity since it is a ratio of 2 lengths.

\(\theta\) (in rad) = \(\frac{\text{arc length}}{\text{radius}}=\frac{s}{r}\)

\(s\) = \(r\)\(\theta\)

Figure 1

One radian is the angle subtended at the centre of the circle by an arc equal in length to the radius of the circle.

If the circumference of a circle \(s\) = \(2\pi r\), \(\theta\) = \(s/r\) = \(2\pi\) rad.

Since for a complete circle, the angle subtended is \(360^{\circ}\),

\(360^{\circ}\) = \(2\pi\) rad

We can deduce that 1 radian = \(\left(\frac{360}{2\pi}\right)^{\circ}\) = \(57.3^{\circ}\)

Conversion between degrees and radians:

\(180^{\circ}\) = \(\pi\) rad

\(Z\) (degrees) = \(Z\) x \(\frac{\pi}{180}\) (radians)

#### 6.2.2 Angular Displacement (\(\theta\))

The angular displacement \(\theta\) is the angle an object has turned about a fixed point. In circular motion, the fixed point is taken to be the centre of the circle (Figure 2).

\(\Delta\theta\) = \(\theta-\theta_{0}\)

If \(\theta_{0}\) = 0, then \(\Delta\theta=\theta\).

S.I. unit of \(\theta\): radian (rad)

Figure 2

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:6]

#### 6.2.5 Period (7) and Frequency (f)

_Period_ (7) is the time it takes for an object in circular motion to make one complete revolution, or cycle.

_Frequency_ (f) is the number of revolutions, or cycles, made per unit time. The unit of frequency is s-1, which is called the _hertz_ (Hz) in the SI.

frequency, \(f=\dfrac{1}{T}\)

_Note:_

When asked to _define_ frequency, students often give it as the number of revolutions _per second_. This is incorrect, as a frequency can also be given as e.g. per minute or per year (frequency of the Earth).

Since an angular displacement of 2\(\pi\) rad is travelled in 1 period,

_angular speed, \(\omega=\dfrac{2\pi}{T}=2\pi f\)_

Example 1

A Blu-ray player is spinning a standard Blu-ray Disc (120 mm diameter) at 900 revolutions per minute (RPM). Determine

i) the frequency of the rotation (in revolutions per second)

ii) the period of the rotation

iii) the angular speed

**Example 2**

Dishes are placed on a Lazy Susan at a reunion dinner during Chinese New Year. When the Lazy Susan is spun around to serve the guests, what can be said about the dishes in the inner circle compared to those in the outer circle in terms of their speed and angular velocity?

### Uniform Circular Motion

_Uniform circular motion_ is the motion of an object travelling at a **constant** (uniform) speed in a circular path.

An object moving in a uniform circular motion (Figure 4) has a _constant angular velocity_ (\(\omega\)). The _magnitude_ of the velocity vector (or the linear speed, \(\nu\)) is _constant_ but the _direction_ of the velocity vector is _changing_. Thus, the _linear velocity vector is continuously changing_ (\(\nu_{t}\), \(\nu_{2}\) & \(\nu_{3}\)) as the object moves around the circle. Since there is a change in the velocity with respect to time, the object can be considered to be undergoing acceleration. So the object is travelling at constant speed but is still accelerating!

In the next section we derive an expression for the magnitude of this acceleration in terms of the speed and radius of the motion. We also find out the direction of this acceleration which is quite a surprising result!

_Centripetal acceleration of a body moving with constant speed in circular motion:_

[https://xmphysics.com/2022/12/22/6-1-3/](https://xmphysics.com/2022/12/22/6-1-3/)

#### 6.3.1 Derivation of the equation of centripetal acceleration

In this derivation we only consider the kinematics of uniform circular motion to arrive at a general expression for the acceleration an object is experiencing when it moves in a circle at constant speed.

Consider a particle moving in a circle of radius \(r\) with uniform angular speed (Figure 4(a)). At one instant the particle is at A, and its instantaneous velocity is \(v_{A}\) in the direction AA'.

A short time \(\Delta t\) later, the particle has moved to B, a distance \(t\Delta\theta\) along the arc, where \(\Delta\theta\) is a small angle, and the particle's velocity has changed to \(v_{B}\) in the direction BB'.

With reference to the vector triangle in Figure 4(b), which is rotated \(90^{\circ}\) with respect to Figure 4(a), the arc length can be approximated to a chord. For small angle \(\Delta\theta\),

\[\begin{array}{l}\Delta\nu\approx\nu\Delta\theta\qquad\text{(note, magnitude of $\nu_{A}=v_{B}=\nu$)}\\ \Delta\nu/\Delta t\approx\nu\Delta\theta\Delta t\\ \frac{\partial\nu}{dt}=\nu\frac{\partial\theta}{dt}\\ \alpha=\nu\omega\end{array}\]

Similarly,

\[\begin{array}{l}\alpha=(r\omega)\omega=r\omega^{2}\\ \alpha=\nu(\frac{\nu}{r})=\frac{\nu^{2}}{r}\end{array}\]

As \(\Delta t\) (or \(\Delta\theta\)) (Figure 4(b)) becomes smaller, the angle between \(\Delta\nu\) and either \(\nu_{A}\) or \(\nu_{B}\) will tend to \(90^{\circ}\). Since \(\nu_{A}\) and \(\nu_{B}\) are _tangent_ to the circular path, this means \(\Delta\nu\) will point _towards the centre_ of the circular path. From the derivation above, we see that the acceleration \(\alpha\) points in the same direction as \(\Delta\nu\), so the acceleration also points towards the centre of the circular path. This type of acceleration in uniform circular motion is called _centripetal acceleration_ (centripetal means centre-seeking).

The centripetal acceleration is directed radially inward towards the centre of the circular path. The direction of the centripetal acceleration is thus continuously changing.

For an object in _uniform circular motion_, there is **no** acceleration component in the tangential direction (i.e. angular acceleration), or else the magnitude of the velocity vector (tangential or linear speed) would change.

The centripetal acceleration is indicated by the subscript \(c\). Hence,

Centripetal acceleration, \(a_{c}=\frac{\nu^{2}}{r}=r\omega^{2}=\nu\omega\)

_Deriving the formula for centripetal acceleration \(a=\frac{\nu^{2}}{r}\)_ :

Derivation of Formula for Centripetal Acceleration \(\nu^{2}/r\) - YouTube

**Conceptual Questions:**

1. _Is an object travelling at non-uniform speed accelerating?_

Yes, there is a change in velocity.
2. _Can an object travelling at constant speed be accelerating?_

Yes, an example is an object moving in circular motion.

#### 6.3.2 Centripetal Force (\(F_{c}\))

In the last section we discovered both the magnitude and direction of the acceleration associated with circular motion. We now move into the dynamics of circular motion, quantifying and identifying forces that can constrain objects to follow such circular paths.

To provide acceleration, there must be a net force. Thus, **to produce a centripetal (inward) acceleration, there must be a resultant force towards the centre of the circular motion**. As the resultant force is centre-seeking, we call it the centripetal force, also indicated by the subscript \(c\).

From Newton's second law (\(\sum F=ma\)),

\(F_{c}=ma_{c}=\frac{m\nu^{2}}{r}=m\nu^{2}=m\nu\), and it is **always directed toward the centre** of the circle.

_Note:_ In general, when a force is continuously applied **at an angle of 90deg to the direction of motion** (which in this case centripetal force is), _only the direction_ of the velocity changes.

**Conceptual Question:** Is there work done by a centripetal force?

No, the centripetal force is always perpendicular to motion. (\(W=F\)s cos\(\theta\), where \(\theta=90\)deg)

_Note:_ For uniform circular motion,

* Centripetal force is not a new type of force, it is provided by the **net force** pointing toward the centre of the circular path, and this net force is the **vector sum of all the force components that point along the radial direction**.
* Forces labelled as "centripetal" or labelled as \(\frac{m\nu^{2}}{r}\) should **never** appear in a free-body diagram!

_Some forces that provide the centripetal force necessary for a body to undergo a circular motion:_

[https://xmphvsics.com/2023/01/02/6-2-1-centripetal-force/](https://xmphvsics.com/2023/01/02/6-2-1-centripetal-force/)

**Example 3 - Conical pendulum**

In a conical pendulum system, a small pendulum bob of mass 0.50 kg is rotating in a fixed horizontal plane. The string is 30 cm long and makes an angle of 15\({}^{\circ}\) to the vertical.

Calculate the (a) tension in the string;

(b) linear speed of the bob;

(c) period of rotation of the bob.

_A conical problem explained:_

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CDwVWMvOgC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CDwVWMvOgC)

**Example 4**

Explain, with the aid of a diagram, why the mass at the end of a light inelastic string cannot be whirled in uniform circular motion in such a way that the string is horizontal.

### Vertical Circular Motion

When an object is set to travel in a vertical circular path, (without the use of a motor*) its speed will not be constant as some kinetic energy will be lost to account for potential energy the object gains as it climbs the circle. This results in **non-uniform circular motion**. For non-uniform motion, _the net force is no longer equal to the centripetal force_. We can still resolve the net force into its tangential and radial components. The tangential component changes only the speed of the motion, while the radial component changes only the direction of the motion. Calculations-wise, the equation for centripetal acceleration is still \(\frac{V^{2}}{r}\), just that centripetal acceleration must now vary as the speed changes.

Typical examples of vertical non-uniform motion, are a roller coaster going through a loop-de-loop and an object whirled in a vertical circle at the end of a string. Both will be further explored in Examples 5 and 6 below. **We will assume in both cases, that the object's total energy is conserved**. At the top of the circular motion, the object's gravitational potential energy is larger than at the bottom of the circular motion. By the principle of conservation of energy, the object will be moving faster at the bottom than at the top as it will possess more kinetic energy to compensate for having less potential energy.

Depending on the context, there are two approaches to attack problems involving vertical, non-uniform motion.

In the **FORCES APPROACH**, we follow our **general strategy for solving dynamics problems**: drawing a free-body diagram, carefully identifying the individual forces experienced by the object undergoing circular motion, and determining the net force acting on the object. Subsequently, we resolve the net force into its _tangential_ and _centripetal_ components.

The **ENERGY APPROACH**, involving vertical, non-uniform circular motion invokes the **principle of conservation of energy**. We know how the gravitational potential energy changes as an object goes from a higher point to a lower point. Hence, if we know the difference in height between two points, we also know the difference in kinetic energy and, thus, the difference in speed.

*Take the Singapore Flyer as an example, the carriages are moving in a uniform circular motion although it is a vertical circular path.

**Example 5 - Roller coaster**

Some roller coasters have several loops along the track. The picture on the right illustrates such a coaster executing a loop-the-loop.

In the question below, assume that the total mass of one car plus its passengers is 170 kg and that friction can be ignored.

(a) A passenger car for a roller coaster enters a loop of radius 19 m at position 1, as indicated in the diagram, with a speed of 33 m s\({}^{\text{-1}}\). Determine the normal contact force the track exerts on the car at i) the bottom (position 1) and ii) the top (position 2) of the loop.

(b) Find the minimum speed at which the passenger car must travel while it is at the top of the loop, in order to clear the loop safely.

A stone of mass 800 g is tied to one end of a string and is whirled in a vertical circle. The string is inextensible and of length 1.2 m. The stone has a certain speed \(V_{A}\) at the lowest point, as shown below.

1. Determine the minimum speed the stone must have at the top of the circular motion if the string is to be taut at that instant.
2. Hence, show that the stone can complete a vertical circular motion if \(V_{A}=8.0\) m s\({}^{-1}\).

Analysing vertical circular motion:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0ByVmuOfIU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0ByVmuOfIU)

In some other instances of vertical circular motion, the speeds of the objects are kept constant (e.g. Ferris wheel). In these cases, the objects are undergoing uniform circular motion. You will encounter some of these applications in the tutorial.

### _Problem solving for Circular Motion_

1. Identify the object undergoing circular motion (and the relevant known quantities such as \(m\), \(v\), \(r\), \(\omega\)...).
2. Draw a **free-body diagram** of the object, carefully identifying the individual forces _experienced by_ the object, to determine the net force acting on the object.
3. **Resolve the net force** into relevant perpendicular "directions", i.e., the tangential and centripetal components.
4. The **tangential component** is usually zero. If it is not, applying Newton's 2nd Law to the tangential component only will tell you how fast the object is slowing down or speeding up.
5. The **centripetal component** will be equal to \(\frac{m\nu^{2}}{r}\). You can use this to determine any further unknowns in the question.

Note that you have not learnt a new way of solving physics problems. The main strategy is still to draw a free-body diagram and to resolve the net force into perpendicular components. In the previous topics, it was convenient to take the horizontal and the vertical component, or the component along some slope and the component perpendicular to it. Now it is convenient to choose components parallel and perpendicular to the motion.

**Example 7 - Car going around a bend**:

1. A bend in the road has a 50 m radius of curvature. A car of mass 600 kg takes the bend at 45 km h-1. 1. What is the centripetal acceleration of the car? 2. What is the centripetal force experienced by the car and what provides it? 3. What will happen to the car if driver decides to take the bend at 60 km h-1 instead? (Given that the maximum friction between the tyres and road surface is 3000 N.) [label=()]
2. When the car negotiates a corner on horizontal ground, the frictional force between the tyres and the ground is the only force providing the centripetal force. As there is a limit to this frictional force for a particular road surface, there is a maximum speed which the car can make the turn safely, beyond which skidding will occur.

Hence, some corners (especially at race-tracks) have raised embankments to increase the maximum speed at which a vehicle can turn the corner than if on a level road. It does so by making the **normal contact force** contribute a component to the centripetal force.

For an embankment inclined at 20\({}^{\circ}\) to the horizontal, find the speed at which the normal contact force is able to **completely provide the centripetal force** (i.e. no frictional force is required).

The radius of curvature of the rack at point A is \(R\).

(a) Find the maximum value of \(v_{o}\) so that the roller coaster stays on the track at **A** solely because of gravity.

(b) Using the value of \(v_{o}\) calculated in (a), determine the value of \(h\)' that is necessary if the roller coaster just makes it to point B.

(c) Consider solution in (b), why do we not use the equations of motion that we learnt in the earlier chapter in kinematics to solve this question?

**D10** _(MJC Prelims 10/12)_ A particle of mass \(m\) performs vertical circular motion as shown in the diagram.

The following two graphs show the vertical and horizontal components of the velocity of the particle along path **ABC**.

**D11**: Sasha's favourite ride at the fair is the Ferris wheel that has a radius of 7.0 m.

1. If the ride takes 20.0 s to make one full revolution, what is the linear speed of the wheel?
2. What is the magnitude of the centripetal force acting on Sasha's 50.0 kg body?
3. In order for Sasha to feel weightless at the top of the ride, at what linear speed must the Ferris wheel turn?
4. At this speed, how much will she appear to weigh at the bottom of the Ferris wheel?

**D12**: The Singapore Flyer (as shown in the figure below) is a giant observation wheel that is Asia's most visible iconic visitor attraction, providing breath-taking, panoramic views of Singapore and beyond. Completed in Mar 2008, it is one of the world's largest man-made moving land objects. It has a height of 178 m, a diameter of 150 m and sits on a 28 m high three-storey terminal building.

During the testing phase, the Singapore Flyer went through a series of continuous revolutions without stopping. Assume that it revolves at constant angular speed \(\omega\) and each complete revolution takes 37 minutes.

(a) Calculate the angular speed of the Singapore Flyer. [2] (b) Hence or otherwise, determine the speed of a passenger capsule which is located at the circumference. [2] (c) Given that there are 32 equally spaced capsules on the Flyer, find the time taken for a capsule to go from position X to position Y. [2] (d) The Singapore Flyer now revolves at a much faster rate such that the centripetal force on the passenger becomes about half his weight. Draw and label the forces acting on a passenger standing inside a capsule at the three positions in the figure below. [4]
