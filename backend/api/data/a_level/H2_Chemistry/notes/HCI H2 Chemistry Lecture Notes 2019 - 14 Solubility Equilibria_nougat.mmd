## 1 Introduction

### Looking back

In Topic 7 Chemical Equilibrium, we learnt the concept of dynamic equilibrium and the Le Chatelier's principle. In this topic, we will apply this knowledge to the dynamic equilibrium that exists between an undissolved solute and its dissolved ions in solution, when the rate of precipitation and dissolution is equal, and use the Le Chatelier's principle to explain the factors that affect the solubility of a salt.

Equilibria involving ions in aqueous solution are important in industrial, analytical and biological processes. The dissolving and precipitating of ionic compounds in aqueous solution are phenomena that occur both within us and around us. For example, the dissolving of enamel on teeth in acidic solutions causes tooth decay; the precipitation of certain salts in our kidneys produces kidney stones; the precipitation of calcium carbonate from underground water forms statactites and stalagmites inside caves. The principles and characteristics of these heterogeneous equilibria in aqueous solutions are very similar to those in other systems in chemical equilibria.

In this extension topic, we will explore the solubility equilibria of sparingly soluble ionic compounds.

## 2 Solubility and saturated solutions

### Definition

Solubility of a salt is the number of moles (or mass) of solute (salt) that can be dissolved in **1 dm\({}^{3}\)** of a given solvent (e.g; water) to form a saturated solution at a given temperature.

For example, the solubility of Na\(C\) in water at 25 \({}^{\circ}\)C is 357 g dm\({}^{-3}\) or 6.102 mol dm\({}^{-3}\).

This is the maximum amount of Na\(C\) that can be dissolved in water to give a saturated solution at that temperature.

### Units of solubility: mol dm\({}^{-3}\) (molar solubility) or g dm\({}^{-3}\)

Ionic compounds with low solubility are said to be **sparingly soluble**. The table below summarises some ionic compounds with very high solubility ('soluble'), and very low solubility ('insoluble').

### Calculation of \(K_{\rm sp}\) from solubility

The solubility of silver chloride is \(1.46\times 10^{-3}\) g dm\({}^{-3}\)at 18 "C. What is the solubility product of silver chloride at this temperature? (\(M_{\rm r}\) of AgCl \(i\) is 143.5)

Figure 4.1: Calculate the \(K_{\rm sp}\) of Ag:SO\({}_{4}\) given that its solubility is \(4.47\) g dm\({}^{-3}\). (M\(\cdot\) of Ag:SO\({}_{4}\) is 312.1)

### Calculation of solubility from \(K_{\text{g}}\)

A suspension of solid Mg(OH)\({}_{2}\) in water is sold as "milk of magnesia" to alleviate minor stomach disorders by neutralising stomach acid. The [OH] is too low to harm the mouth and throat, but the suspension dissolves in the acidic stomach juices.

Find the solubility of Mg(OH)\({}_{2}\) in mol dm\({}^{3}\) and in g dm\({}^{-3}\), given the numerical value of \(K_{\text{g}}\) of Mg(OH)\({}_{2}\) is \(6.30\times 10^{-10}\) (M, of Mg(OH)\({}_{2}\) is 58.3)

_Scenario:_

To plan an experiment to determine a value of the solubility product \(K_{\text{sp}}\) of a sparingly soluble salt, and to investigate how the solubility will be affected by the presence of a common ion (see section 6.1).

_Approach:_

This experiment is in two parts: part 1, preparing the saturated solution(s), and part 2, determining the amount of dissolved, solid (usually by titration).

Part 1: To prepare a saturated solution of the sparingly soluble compound, take into consideration the following characteristics of heterogeneous equilibria:

\[\text{MX (s)}\xrightleftharpoons[]{}\text{M}^{\ast}\text{(aq)}+\text{X}^{\ast} \text{(aq)}.\]

To establish an equilibrium, the saturated solution must also contain excess (undissolved) solid. If you are not required to determine the mass of the dissolved solid gravimetrically, there is no need to weigh the amount of solid added accurately, so long as there is undissolved solid in the saturated solution. At this stage, this is called a suspension because it contains undissolved solid.

Like all reversible reactions, it takes time to reach equilibrium. Therefore the suspension is shaken in stoppered bottles / conical flasks, or stirred in beakers with a glass rod, and then allowed to stand for a while (about \(5-10\) min), at the end of which, the excess solid settles to the bottom.

Solubility and \(K_{\text{sp}}\) values are dependent on temperature, so the temperature of the suspension must be maintained (usually by a water bath or thermostat), and be recorded.

To investigate the effect of a common ion (see section 6.1), you may be required to set up several (usually five) different saturated solutions with different starting concentrations of the common ion.

Part 2: To determine the amount of dissolved solid, a titration procedure is often carried out. For example, standard hydrochloric acid will be used to titrate the saturated solution if X's OH', However, before this titration is carried out, the suspension must be filtered to remove the undissolved solid. To prevent the introduction of water which will dilute the saturated solution, it is critical that the filtration is carried out using dry filter funnel, dry filter paper, and the filtrate is collected in a dry conical flask.

_Generic procedure for determining solubility_

1. Measure (volume) of (solvent) into a conical flask, using a measuring cylinder.
2. Add (solid) to the conical flask and swirl. Continue adding (solid) until no more can dissolve.
3. Stopper the flask and shake.
4. Leave the flask to stand in a water bath, maintained at 25 \({}^{\circ}\)C for (a suitable time).
5. Filter the suspension, into a dry conical flask, using dry filter funnel and dry filter paper.
6. Pipette 25 cm\({}^{3}\) of the filtrate (saturated solution) into another conical flask.
7. (titration procedure);

### Using \(K_{\text{sp}}\) and IP to predict the occurrence of precipitation

* The value of IP indicates the direction in which the solubility reaction will occur. The idea of IP and \(K_{\text{sp}}\) is analogous to that of \(Q_{\text{c}}\) and \(K_{\text{c}}\).
* When IP \(<K_{\text{sp}}\), the forward reaction (dissolution of the salt) occurs. When IP \(>K_{\text{sp}}\), the backward reaction (precipitation of the salt) occurs, Relate this to what you learnt in Topic 7 Chemical equilibria about \(Q_{\text{c}}\) and \(K_{\text{c}}\).
* Hence, the value of IP allows us to predict if precipitation would occur when two solutions are mixed.
* When two solutions are mixed, precipitation may or may not occur depending on: (a) concentration of ions after mixing (b) \(K_{\text{sp}}\) of the salt present

Consider the sparingly soluble salt BaSO\({}_{4}\), BaSO\({}_{4}\)(s) \(\rightleftharpoons\) Ba\({}^{2}\)(aq) + SO\({}_{4}\)\({}^{-}\)(aq)

The solution is not saturated.

The first trace of precipitate just appears. (or is just about to appear)

## 6 FACTORS Affecting Solubility

### Common lon Effect

Consider a mixture of solid calcium fluoride and its aqueous ions in a saturated solution:

If a water-soluble solute containing the common ion Ca2* or F* is added, e.g. adding CaCl\({}_{2}\)(aq) or NaF(aq), by Le Chatelier's Principle, the position of equilibrium will shift to the left to decrease [Ca2*] or [F*]. Less CaF\({}_{2}\) will dissolve, reducing the solubility of CaF\({}_{2}\).

The numerical value of \(K_{\rm sp}\) of AgCl is \(2.00\times 10^{-10}\) at 25 *C.

### Formation of complex ion:

Some metal ions can accept electron pairs from neutral molecules or anions to form complex ions.

**Example 1:**

When NaOH(aq) is added to a solution containing A\({}^{B+}\), a white precipitate of A(OH)\({}_{3}\) is formed. This precipitate dissolves in excess NaOH to form the complex ion [A/(OH)\({}_{4}\)]. Such complex ions are soluble in water.

**Explanation:**

Initially, when NaOH(aq) is added to a solution containing A\({}^{B+}\), since \(K_{\rm sp}\) of A/(OH)\({}_{3}\) is very low, IP easily exceeds \(K_{\rm sp}\).

Precipitate starts forming when IP \(\equiv\)\(K_{\rm sp}\) and equilibrium exists between some A/(OH)\({}_{3}\)(s) and its ions.

In excess NaOH, the complex ions [A/(OH)\({}_{4}\)] are formed.

* Formation of the complex ions removes A\({}^{B+}\) from the solution, hence [A\({}^{B+}\)] decreases.
* This shifts the position of equilibrium in (1) to the right to produce more A\({}^{B+}\), and the white precipitate of A/(OH)\({}_{3}\) dissolves.
* Complex ion formation **increases** the solubility of a sparingly soluble salt.

## 7 APPLICATION AND RELEVANCE TO REAL-LIFE CONTEXTS

The following examples illustrate the relevance of the \(K_{\text{sp}}\) concept to a range of phenomena and contexts.

* Daily life In regions with hard water (that contains calcium and magnesium ions); mineral deposits can sometimes be seen on cooking dishes or in bathtubts. These deposits are caused by the precipitates of calcium/magnesium ions in the hard water. These deposits can make hard water unsuitable for many uses. Thus, variety of ways can be used to reduce the hardness of water, for example, by the addition of sodium carbonate.
* Health Kidney stones are a biological example of how the concept of solubility is experienced in our lives. A kidney stone is usually made up of a salt of calcium, commonly ethanedioate or phosphate. Thus people who are prone to kidney stones have to limit or avoid eating foods with high ethanolioate content (e.g. spinach, peanuts and sweet potatoes). A possible approach to treating kidney stones is to drink a large amount of water so as to flush out the kidney stones from the urinary tract.

**Looking ahead:**

The concepts learnt about the dynamic equilibrium of a saturated solution will be useful when we explore the chemistry of inorganic compounds in further topics (such as in inorganic Qualitative Analysis experiments and Topic 22 Chemistry of the Transition Elements). For example, the Le Chatelier's principle, common ion effect and the formation of metal complex ions will be applied to explain the precipitation and dissolution of metal salts in inorganic reactions.
