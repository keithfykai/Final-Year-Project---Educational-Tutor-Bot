## Biology

(Syllabus 6093)

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:2]

## Introduction

The O-Level Biology syllabus is designed to have less emphasis on factual materials, but a much greater emphasis on the understanding and application of scientific concepts and principles. This approach has been adopted in recognition of the need for students to develop skills that will be of long-term value in an increasingly complex and globalised world, rather than focusing on large quantities of factual material, which may have only short-term relevance.

It is envisaged that teaching and learning programmes based on this syllabus will feature a wide variety of learning experiences designed to promote acquisition of scientific expertise and understanding, and to develop values and attitudes relevant to science. Teachers are encouraged to use a combination of appropriate strategies in teaching topics in this syllabus. The assessment will be specifically intended to test skills, comprehension and insight in familiar and unfamiliar contexts.

## Aims

The aims of a course based on this syllabus should be to:

1. provide a worthwhile educational experience for all students, whether or not they go on to study science beyond this level
2. develop in students the understanding, and skills relevant to the practices of science, and enable them to 2.1 appreciate practical applications of Biology in the real world 2.2 deepen their interest in Biology for future learning and work 2.3 become scientifically literate citizens who can innovate and seize opportunities in the 21st century 2.4 understand how living organisms work to sustain life and use the disciplinary ideas in Biology to approach, analyse and solve problems in biological systems.
3. develop in students the values, ethics and attitudes relevant to science such as 3.1 curiosity - desiring to explore the environment and question what is found 3.2 creativity - seeking innovative and relevant ways to solve problems 3.3 integrity - handling and communicating data and information with complete honesty 3.4 objectivity - seeking data and information to validate observations and explanations without bias 3.5 open-mindedness - accepting all knowledge as tentative and suspending judgement, tolerance for ambiguity, willingness to change views if the evidence is convincing 3.6 resilience - not giving up on the pursuit of answers/solutions, willingness to take risks and embrace failure as part of the learning process 3.7 responsibility - showing care and concern for living things and awareness of our responsibility for the quality of the environment 3.8 healthy scepticism - questioning the observations, methods, processes and data, as well as trying to review one's own ideas.

## 1 Practices of Science

The _Practices of Science_ represent the set of established procedures and practices associated with scientific inquiry, what scientific knowledge is and how it is generated and established, and how Science is applied in society respectively. It consists of three components:

### 1 Demonstrating Ways of Thinking and Doing in Science (WoTD)

#### 1.1.1 Posing questions and defining problems

#### 1.2 Designing investigations

#### 1.3 Conducting experiments and testing solutions

#### 1.4 Analysing and interpreting data

#### 1.5 Communicating, evaluating and defending ideas with evidence

#### 1.6 Making informed decisions and taking responsible actions

#### 1.7 Using and developing models

#### 1.8 Constructing explanations and designing solutions

#### 2.1.2 Understanding the Nature of Scientific Knowledge (NOS)

1.3 Science is an evidence-based, model-building enterprise concerned with understanding the natural world

2.4 Science assumes there are natural causes for physical phenomena and an order and consistency in natural systems

3.1 Scientific knowledge is generated using a set of established procedures and practices, and through a process of critical debate within the scientific community

#### 2.4.1 Scientific knowledge is reliable and durable, yet open to change in the light of new evidence

#### 3.1.4 Relating Science, Technology, Society and Environment (STSE)

1.5 There are risks and benefits associated with the applications of science in society. Science and its applications have the potential to bring about both benefits and harm to society

#### 3.2.6 Applications of science often have ethical, social, economic and environmental implications

3.7 Applications of new scientific discoveries often inspire technological advancements while advances in technology motivate scientists to ask new questions and/or empower scientists in their inquiry (e.g. collecting more precise data or carrying out more complex data analysis)

The _Practices of Science_ serve to highlight that the discipline of Science is more than the acquisition of a _body of knowledge_ (e.g. scientific facts, concepts, laws, and theories); it is also a way of _thinking and doing_. In particular, it is important to appreciate that the cognitive, epistemic and social aspects of the _Practices of Science_ are intricately related. For example, observation of events can lead to the generation of scientific knowledge which is, simultaneously, shaped by the beliefs of scientific knowledge. In addition, scientists develop models to construct theories, based on the assumption that there is order and consistency in natural systems. The practice of theory-making, in turn, reinforces the explanatory power of scientific knowledge. The scientific endeavour is embedded in the wider ethical, social, economic and environmental contexts.

## Assessment Objectives

## Disciplinary ideas of Biology

The disciplinary ideas of Biology described below represent the overarching ideas which can be applied to explain, analyse and solve a variety of problems that seek to address the broader question of how living organisms work to sustain life. The purpose of equipping students with an understanding of these ideas is to develop in them a coherent view and conceptual framework of scientific knowledge to facilitate the application and transfer of learning. These ideas can be revisited throughout the syllabus, deepened at higher levels of learning and beyond the schooling years.

1. **The Cell** - Diverse life forms are similar in that their basic unit are cells.
2. **Structure and Function** - Structure and function of organisms from the molecular to the organ system levels are related to each other.
3. **Systems** - Biological systems interact among themselves and with the environment resulting in the flow of energy and nutrients.
4. **Energy** - To ensure survival, living organisms obtain, transform and utilise energy from the external world.
5. **Homeostasis, Co-ordination and Response** - Living organisms detect changes both from the surrounding environment and within themselves so that they are able to respond to these changes to maintain a constant internal environment needed for sustaining life.
6. **Heredity** - Genetic information is passed down from parents to offspring during reproduction to ensure the continuity of life.
7. **Evolution** - The diversity of living organisms is achieved through a process of evolution, driven by mechanisms such as natural selection.

## Subject Content

### Section I: Cells and the Chemistry of Life

#### Overview

Living things are different from non-living things in their ability to grow, reproduce, move, and respond to change. Understanding what makes these characteristics of life possible requires an appreciation of the hierarchical organisation of life (from cells \(\rightarrow\) tissues \(\rightarrow\) organs \(\rightarrow\) systems \(\rightarrow\) organism) and the processes needed to sustain life at each level.

In this section, we begin by exploring life at the smallest level. Amidst the great diversity of living organisms on earth, all living organisms are fundamentally similar at the smallest level; they are all made of cells and a common set of carbon-based molecules. Physiological processes in living organisms can be explained through activities happening at the cellular level. For instance, the transport of oxygen around the body is made possible by red blood cells that bind oxygen to haemoglobin.

At the molecular level, living organisms are made of four elements carbon, hydrogen, oxygen and nitrogen. These elements make life possible as they combine to form macromolecules such as carbohydrates, proteins and fats, which are needed to sustain life by providing energy, building cellular structures, and for growth and repair.

The overarching ideas of this section are cells as the basic unit of life, correlation between structure and function and how living organisms obtain, transform and utilise energy from the external world at the cellular level to sustain life. Knowing how life works at the cellular and molecular level will provide students with a foundation to understand processes needed to sustain life at the tissue, organ and system levels, which are covered in subsequent sections of this syllabus.

## Section II: The Human Body - Maintaining Life

### Overview

Life is sustained through the integrated organisation of the whole organism. In humans, the maintenance and regulation of life processes include nutrition, transport, respiration, excretion, homeostasis and co-ordination and response.

Living systems utilise energy and macromolecules to maintain life processes such as growth, reproduction and homeostasis. Interactions also exist between living systems within organisms, which are often accompanied by the transfer of energy between matter and transfer or exchange of matter. Each system has their component parts, characterised by the division of labour. This division of labour enables an organism to function efficiently and allows for the various systems to work together as a co-ordinated whole. The co-ordinated response across systems to maintain optimal internal environments stimulated by external and internal changes forms the basis of homeostasis.

The threat of diseases disrupts the maintenance of important life processes and the functioning of human body systems. In ancient times, the concept of 'catching' a disease was unheard of, and diseases were even thought to be caused by the imbalance of 'humours' (internal fluids) within the body. However, with the invention of the microscope, we have found out that infectious diseases are often caused by pathogens, e.g. viruses and bacteria.

The overarching ideas in the study of this section are the co-ordination of the human body system as a whole and the correlation between structure and function.

## Section III: Living together - plants, animals and ecosystems

### Overview

The sun is the principal source of energy for almost all living organisms on earth, without which, life will not exist as it is today. Green plants are able to capture and convert light energy to useful chemical forms through the unique process of photosynthesis. Other organisms depend on this energy captured by plants through direct or indirect feeding relationships to sustain life.

The study of ecology will further explain how all organisms are interdependent on the transfer of energy and matter in this intricate web of life. Humans are by far the singular most influential species in ensuring the conservation of the fragile ecosystem and thus, there are important lessons to be learnt from this highly interdependent relationship among organisms. In the face of global warming as one of the major challenges confronting the world now, examining how human actions can reduce the effects of global warming takes on a pressing urgency to ensure the sustainability of the environment and life on Earth.

The overarching idea of this section is the interaction between organisms in the ecosystem for the sustainability of life through the transfer of energy and matter.

## Section IV: Continuity of Life

### Overview

The many aspects of structure and function that we have examined in this syllabus can be viewed in the widest context as various adaptations aimed at ensuring reproductive success. Reproduction is vital for the survival of species across generations.

In this section, we examine the processes that contribute to the continuity of life. These processes include how genes interact to produce hereditary characteristics in the offspring and how genetic information is passed from one generation to the next.

Some important scientists who contributed to findings in this section include Gregor Mendel - who published his observations from breeding experiments on pea plants and James Watson and Francis Crick - who developed the model for deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), a molecule that was deduced as the hereditary material that is passed down through generations. Models aid in the visualisation of science and led to the breakthrough of the discovery of the double-helix molecule - DNA.

The overarching ideas of this section are the storage of genetic information in the DNA and the passing down of genetic information through generations to ensure the continuity of life.

## Practical Assessment

Scientific subjects are, by their nature, experimental. It is therefore important that an assessment of a candidate's knowledge and understanding of Science should include a component relating to practical work and experimental skills.

This assessment is provided in Paper 3 as a formal practical test and is outlined in the Scheme of Assessment.

**Paper 3**

This paper is designed to assess a candidate's competence in those practical skills which can realistically be assessed within the context of a formal test of limited duration.

Candidates will be assessed in the following skill areas:

(a) Planning (P)

Candidates should be able to:

* identify key variables for a given question/problem
* outline an experimental procedure to investigate the question/problem
* describe how the data should be used in order to reach a conclusion
* identify the risks of the experiment and state precautions that should be taken to keep risks to a minimum

(b) Manipulation, measurement and observation (MMO)

Candidates should be able to:

* set up apparatus correctly by following written instructions or diagrams
* use common laboratory apparatus and techniques to collect data and make observations
* describe and explain how apparatus and techniques are used correctly
* make and record accurate observations with good details and measurements to an appropriate degree of precision
* make appropriate decisions about measurements or observations* Presentation of data and observations (PDO) Candidates should be able to:
* present all information in an appropriate form
* manipulate measurements effectively for analysis
* present all quantitative data to an appropriate number of decimal places/significant figures
* Analysis, conclusions and evaluation (ACE) Candidates should be able to:
* analyse and interpret data or observations appropriately in relation to the task
* draw conclusion(s) from the interpretation of experimental data or observations and underlying principles
* make predictions based on their data and conclusions
* identify significant sources of errors and explain how they affect the results
* state and explain how significant errors may be overcome or reduced, as appropriate, including how experimental procedures may be improved.

One, or more, of the questions may incorporate some assessment of skill area P, set in the context of the syllabus content, requiring candidates to apply and integrate knowledge and understanding from different sections of the syllabus. It may also require the treatment of given experimental data in drawing relevant conclusion and analysis of proposed plan.

The assessment of skill areas MMO, PDO and ACE will be set mainly in the context of the syllabus content. The assessment of PDO and ACE may also include questions on data-analysis which do not require practical equipment and apparatus.

The material used in experiments will be closely related to the subject matter of the syllabus but will not necessarily be limited to the particular types mentioned in the curriculum content.

Candidates may be asked to carry out exercises comprising:

1. simple physiological experiments, involving tests for food substances, enzyme reactions, hydrogecarbonate indicator solution, cobalt(II) chloride paper and so on
2. simple physiological experiments, involving the use of sharp instruments such as mounted needles, scalpels, knives, forceps and scissors on plant or animal materials (accurate observations of these specimens will need a hand lens of not less than \(\times 6\) magnification for each candidate)
3. manipulative skills in assembling apparatus, in using chemical reagents and in using such instruments as mounted needles, scalpels and razor blades, forceps and scissors
4. measurements using appropriate instruments (e.g. thermometer, syringe, measuring cylinder, ruler and so on) and simple arithmetical calculations
5. familiar and unfamiliar techniques to record observations and make deductions from them
6. recognition and observation of features of familiar and unfamiliar biological specimens, recording observations and making deductions about functions of whole specimens or their parts
7. clear line drawings of the specimens provided, indicating magnification and labelling familiar structures

This is not intended to be an exhaustive list. Candidates are expected to be familiar with the use of data-loggers. Assessment of Skill P may include the appropriate use of data-loggers.

When planning practical work, teachers should make sure that they do not contravene any school, education authority or government regulations which restrict the sampling, in educational establishments, of urine, saliva, blood or other bodily secretions and tissues. Candidates should also be aware of the need to take simple precautions for safety and/or accuracy.

Within the Scheme of Assessment, the practical paper constitutes 20% of the O-Level Biology examination. It is therefore recommended that the schemes of work include learning opportunities that apportion a commensurate amount of time for the development and acquisition of practical skills.

### Glossary of TERMS USED IN BIOLOGY PAPERS

It is hoped that the glossary will prove helpful to candidates as a guide, i.e. it is neither exhaustive nor definitive. The glossary has been deliberately kept brief not only with respect to the number of terms included but also to the descriptions of their meanings. Candidates should appreciate that the meaning of a term must depend in part on its context.

1. _Calculate_ is used when a numerical answer is required. In general, working should be shown, especially where two or more steps are involved.
2. _Comment_ is intended as an open-ended instruction, inviting candidates to recall or infer points of interest relevant to the context of the question, taking account of the number of marks available.
3. _Compare_ requires candidates to provide both similarities and differences between things or concepts.
4. _Define_ (_the term(s)_...) is intended literally, only a formal statement or equivalent paraphrase being required.
5. _Describe_ requires candidates to state in words (using diagrams where appropriate) the main points of the topic. It is often used with reference either to particular phenomena or to particular experiments. In the former instance, the term usually implies that the answer should include reference to (visual) observations associated with the phenomena.
6. _Determine_ often implies that the quantity concerned cannot be measured directly but is obtained by calculation, substituting measured or known values of other quantities into a standard formula.
7. _Discuss_ requires candidates to give a critical account of the points involved in the topic.
8. _Estimate_ implies a reasoned order of magnitude statement or calculation of the quantity concerned, making such simplifying assumptions as may be necessary about the points of principle and about the values of quantities not otherwise included in the question.
9. _Explain_ may imply reasoning or some reference to theory, depending on the context.
10. _Find_ is a general term that may be variously interpreted as calculate, measure, determine, etc.

* 11. _List_ requires a number of points, generally each of one word, with no elaboration. Where a given number of points is specified, this should not be exceeded.
* 12. _Measure_ implies that the quantity concerned can be directly obtained from a suitable measuring instrument, e.g. length, using a rule, or mass, using a balance.
* _Outline_ implies brevity, i.e. restricting the answer to giving essentials.
* 14. _Predict_ or _deduce_ implies that the candidate is not expected to produce the required answer by recall but by making a logical connection between other pieces of information. Such information may be wholly given in the question or may depend on answers extracted from an earlier part of the question.
* 15. _Sketch_, when applied to graph work, implies that the shape and/or position of the curve need only be qualitatively correct, but candidates should be aware that, depending on the context, some quantitative aspects may be looked for, e.g. passing through the origin, having an intercept, asymptote or discontinuity at a particular value.
* _Sketch_, when applied to diagrams, implies that a simple, freehand drawing is acceptable; nevertheless, care should be taken over proportions and the clear exposition of important details.
* 16. _State_ implies a concise answer with little or no supporting argument, e.g. a numerical answer that can be obtained 'by inspection'.
* 17. _Suggest_ is used in two main contexts, i.e. either to imply that there is no unique answer, or to imply that candidates are expected to apply their general knowledge to a 'novel' situation, one that may be formally 'not in the syllabus'.
* 18. _What is meant by (the term(s)...)_ normally implies that a definition should be given, together with some relevant comment on the significance or context of the term(s) concerned, especially where two or more terms are included in the question. The amount of supplementary comment intended should be interpreted in light of the indicated mark value.

## Special Note

### Units, significant figures

Candidates should be aware that misuse of units and/or significant figures, i.e. failure to quote units where necessary, the inclusion of units in quantities defined as ratios or quoting answers to an inappropriate number of significant figures, is liable to be penalised.

### Calculators

An approved calculator may be used in all papers.
