LEARNING CURRENITS

Candidates should be able to:

1. show an understanding of and use the terms period, frequency, peak value and root-mean-square (r.m.s.) value as applied to an alternating current or voltage.
2. deduce that the mean power in a resistive load is half the maximum power for a sinusoidal alternating current.
3. represent an alternating current or an alternating voltage by an equation of the form \(x=x_{0}\sin\alpha t\).
4. distinguish between r.m.s. and peak values and recall and solve problems using the relationship \(I_{\text{rms}}=\dfrac{I_{0}}{\sqrt{2}}\) for the sinusoidal case.
5. show an understanding of the principle of operation of a simple iron-core transformer and recall and solve problems using \(\dfrac{N_{\text{s}}}{N_{\text{p}}}=\dfrac{V_{\text{s}}}{V_{\text{p}}}=\dfrac{I _{\text{p}}}{I_{\text{s}}}\) for an ideal transformer.
6. explain the use of a single diode for the half-wave rectification of an alternating current.

A resistor heats up when an alternating current is passed through it, much the same way as when a direct current is used. As free electrons move through the resistor when a potential difference is applied across it, they collide against fixed ions in the resistor and transfer some of their energies to these ions, resulting in an increase in the internal energy and correspondingly, the temperature of the resistor. Although the increase in temperature depends on the magnitude of the current, it is independent of the direction of current.

This indicates that some power is dissipated in the resistor. Thus the effective value of the sinusoidal alternating current cannot be zero. More often, root-mean-square or r.m.s values, rather than the average values.

Most of the time, it is more meaningful for us to know the average or mean power rather than the variation of power in an a.c. circuit.

Consider the two circuits below. The diagram on the left shows a resistor \(R\) connected to an a.c. source, while the diagram on the right shows the same resistor connected to a d.c. source.

Suppose the resistor in both circuits dissipates heat at the same rate, we can then equate the average power dissipated as:

This shows that we can find the average power of an a.c. source by treating it as a d.c. source with \(I_{\text{dc}}=I_{\text{rms}}\). Hence, the average power dissipated in the resistor,

The root-mean-square value of the alternating current or voltage is that value of the direct current or voltage that would produce thermal energy at the same rate in a resistor.
