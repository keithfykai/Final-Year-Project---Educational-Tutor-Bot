**Key Concept**

**structure of eyes accommodation**

**pupilreflex**structure of eyes

external

[FIGUREstructure of eyes

internal

Chrovid

Middle layer of the eyeball, between the sclera and retina.

Contains blood vessels that supply oxygen and nutrients, and remove metabolic waste products.

Pignetted black to prevent an internal reflection of light.

Retina

Inermost layer of the eyeball which contains photoreceptors, which are connected to the optic nerve.

Lens

Transparent biconvex structure that refracts light onto the retina.

The lens can change its curvature to focus light onto retina

Fovea

Also called yellow spot, a small depression in the retina where images are usually focused

The fovea contains the greatest concentration of cones, but no rods.

Contains **ciliary muscles** which control the curvature of the lens. It is also responsible for producing aqueous humour.

Suspensory

Connects the ciliary body to the lens

Igament

Aqueous

The space **between the lens and the cornea.**

Transparent aqueous humour keeps the front of the eyeball firm and helps to reflect light into the pupil.

Vitreous

The space **behind lens**

Transparent vitreous humour keeps the eyeball firm and helps to refract light onto the retina.

Optic nerve

**Transmits signal from the retina to the brain.**

There are no photoreceptors in the area of the retina where the optic nerve leaves. This area is called the **blind spot.**

How we see

1. When light falls on an object, light rays are reflected from the object
2. Light rays are **refracted through the cornea** and the **aqueous humour** onto the lens
3. The lens causes **further refraction** and the rays are brought to a **focus on the retina**.
4. The image on the retina **stimulates the photoreceptors**, either the rods or the cones, depending on the intensity of the light.
5. Nerve impulses are produced and **sent to the brain via optic nerve**. The brain interprets the impulses and the person sees the object.

* **Accommodation:** it is a **reflex action** where the **lens is adjusted** so that clear images of objects at different distances are formed on the retina.
* **Light rays reflected from the object and refracted into the eyes depend on the distance of object accommodation

Focusing on a distant object

1.Light rays reflected off distant objects are nearly parallel and enter the eyes

2.Ciliary muscles relax, causing suspensiony ligaments to tighten

3.Suspensory ligaments become taut, pulling on the edge of the lens.

4.Lens becomes thinner and less convex, increasing its focal

length, causing less refraction of the rays of light

5.Light rays from the distant object are sharply focused on the retina.

Focusing on a close object

1.Light rays reflected off close objects are diverging and enter the eyes

2.Ciliary muscles contract, causing suspensiony ligaments to become relax

3.Suspensory ligaments slacken, relaxing their pull on the lens.

4.The lens becomes thicker and more convex, decreasing its focal length, causing more refraction of the rays of light,

5.Light rays from the near object are sharply focused on the retina.
