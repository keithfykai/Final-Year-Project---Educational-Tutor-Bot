CORE IDEA

(2) Genetics and Inheritance

MITOSSIS & MEIOSSIS

_Content_

* Replication and division of nuclei and cells
* Understanding of chromosome number and variation
* Effect of meiosis on chromosome number and variation

_Learning Outcomes_

2(I) Explain what is meant by the terms _gene mutation_ and _chromosome aberration_.

For gene mutation, knowledge of how substitution, addition and deletion could change the amino acid sequence (e.g. frameshift) is required.

- to be covered in DNA & Genomics.

For chromosomal aberration, knowledge of numerical, e.g. aneuploidy, as in the case of trisomy 21, i.e. Down syndrome) and structural (e.g. translocation, duplication, inversion, deletion) aberration is required.

(n) Describe the events that occur during the mitotic cell cycle and the main stages of mitosis (including the behaviour of chromosomes, nuclear envelope, cell membrane and centrioles).

(o) Explain the significance of the mitotic cell cycle (including growth, repair and asexual reproduction) and the need to regulate it tightly. (Knowledge that dysregulation of checkpoints of cell division can result in uncontrolled cell division and cancer is required, but detail of the mechanism is not required.)

(s) Describe the events that occur during the meiotic cell cycle and the main stages of meiosis (including the behaviour of chromosomes, nuclear envelope, cell membrane and centrioles), (Names of the main stages are expected, but not the sub-divisions of probleme.)

(i) Explain the significance of the meiotic cell cycle (including how meiosis and random fertilisation can lead to variation).
