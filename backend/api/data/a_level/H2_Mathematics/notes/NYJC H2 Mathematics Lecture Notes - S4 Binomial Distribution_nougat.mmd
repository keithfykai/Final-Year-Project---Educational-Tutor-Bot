### 4.1 The Binomial Distribution

Consider an experiment with a fixed number, \(n\), of independent repeated trials, with two possible outcomes, of which one is defined as'success' and the other '**failure**'. Suppose the probability of success is a constant, \(p\), and the probability of failure is \(1-p\) (or \(q\)).

Let \(X\) be the random variable denoting the number of successes occurring in the \(n\) independent trials such that the probability of success for each trial is \(p\). Then \(X\) can take the values \(0\), \(1\), \(2\),..., \(n\), so that \(X\) is a discrete random variable.

If \(X\) is distributed in this way, we write \(X\sim\mathrm{B}\big{(}n,p\big{)}\) to denote that the random variable \(X\) has a binomial (probability) distribution with **parameters**\(n\) and \(p\), where \(n\) is the number of independent trials and \(p\) is the probability of success. The probability density function (p.d.f.) of \(X\) is given by

\[\mathrm{P}\big{(}X=x\big{)}=\binom{n}{x}p^{x}\big{(}1-p\big{)}^{n-x},\,\text{ where }\,x=0\,,\,1,\,2\,,\,...,\,n\,.\quad\text{\bf(In MF 26)}\]

For example, if \(X\) is the random variable denoting the number of successes occurring in the 40 independent trials such that the probability of success for each trial is 0.3, we write \(X\sim\mathrm{B}\big{(}40,0.3\big{)}\). We can also use a diagram to illustrate the respective probabilities of the distribution.

As you progress through the chapters, you will learn about other distributions. Thus, it is necessary to correctly identify the random variable and its distribution to ensure that we model a particular situation using the correct probability model. You are also required to justify the appropriateness of the model and the assumptions made **in the context of the question**.

Necessary conditions for a binomial distribution to be an appropriate model:

The experiment has a fixed number, \(n\), of repeated trials, where \(n\in\mathbb{Z}^{*}\).

There are 2 mutually exclusive outcomes, namely success and failure.

The outcome of each trial is independent of the outcomes of other trials.

The probability of success, \(p\), is constant for each trial, where \(0\leq p\leq 1\).

**Note:**

1. **All** conditions must be fulfilled before a random variable can be well-modelled by a binomial distribution.
2. When a question asks for assumptions needed for a random variable to be well-modelled by a binomial distribution, **write down the conditions that you cannot find in the question as assumptions**.
3. All assumptions must be written **in the context of the question**.

**Example 1**: For each of the random variable described below, state whether the binomial distribution is a suitable model. If it is, justify your answer and give the appropriate values for the parameters. If it is not, give one reason.

The number of heads when a fair coin is tossed five times.

The number of draws, out of 8, (without replacement) a red ball is drawn from a bag containing 10 red and 15 white balls.

The number of draws, out of 8, (with replacement) a red ball is drawn from a bag containing 10 red and 15 white balls.

The number of tosses of a coin to get a head.

**Solution**

**(i) Yes:**

- There are n-S repeated (nice)

- There are 2 mutually exclusive outcomes, namely

- There are 2 mutually exclusive outcomes, namely success and failure.

- The event of getting ahead in each trial do not

not affect the event of getting head in the

- Are the outcomes of each trial

- _independent?_

- Is the probability of success a constant?

In **(ii)**, what if the total number of balls

in the bag was large?

**(iii)** Yes:

* There are \(n=8\) repeated draws
* There are 2 mutually exclusive outcomes, namely

drawing a red ball or white ball.
* The event of getting a red ball in each draw does not affect the event of getting red balls in other draws hence

the outcomes are independent.

**Example 9** (**Question involving binomial distribution within a binomial distribution**): In a large population, the proportion of people having blood group A is 35%. Specimens of blood from the first five people attending a clinic are to be tested. It can be assumed that these five people are a random sample from the population. The random variable \(X\) denotes the number of people in the sample who are found to have blood group A.
**(i)**: State the distribution of \(X\), **justifying your answer**. Find the probability that there are two or fewer people with blood group A.
**(ii)**: Three such samples of five people are taken. Find the probability that each of these three samples has more than two people with blood group A.
**(iii)**: Twenty such samples of five people are taken. Find the probability that at least fifteen out of these twenty samples will contain at most two with blood group A.

**Solution**: **Think Zone**: (i) \(X\) is a binomial distribution since \(X\) is a **fixed number** of number of people to be tested, \(n=5\), \(X\) each person either has blood group A or does not, \(X\) the blood group of each person is **independent** of others, \(X\) the probability of a person having blood group A, \(p=0.35\), can be considered to be a **constant** since the population is large.

\(X\sim\mathrm{B}\big{(}5,0.35\big{)}\): Using G.C., \(\mathrm{P}\big{(}X\leq 2\big{)}\approx 0.76483\): \(\mathrm{=0.765\ (3\ s.f)}\): We usually leave answers to 5 s.f. for accuracy in case we need the value in computing subsequent parts of the questions. However, you still need to leave the **final** answer in 3 **s.f.**

**(ii)**: _Let be the RV density the number of people in a sample of 5 with blood group A. Instead we are interested to know how many samples out of the 3 groups of 5 that satisfy the condition of "having more than 2 with blood group A". Hence we need to

**Example 11 (Independent Reading)**

In a binomial probability distribution, there are \(n\) trials and the probability of success for each trial is \(p\). If the mean is 8 and the variance is 4.8, find the values of \(n\) and \(p\).

**Solution**

Let \(X\) be the random variable representing the number of success out of \(n\) trials. Then, \(X-\mathrm{B}\big{(}n,p\big{)}\)

\(\mathrm{E}\big{(}X\big{)}=np=8\)

\(\mathrm{Var}\big{(}X\big{)}=np\big{(}1-p\big{)}=4.8\)

\(\mathrm{Subst.}\) (1) into (2):

\(8\big{(}1-p\big{)}=4.8\)

\(1-p=0.6\)

\(p=0.4\)

\(\therefore n=\dfrac{8}{0.4}=20\)

**Example 12 (Airline Overbooking)**

**Air Canada has apologised to a Canadian family and offered "very generous compensation" after the airline bumped a 10-year-old boy from a flight. Agencies, S. A. (2017, April 17). Air Canada apologises for bumping boy, 10, from family holiday flight. [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/apr/18/air-canada-apologises-bumping-boy-family-holiday-flight](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/apr/18/air-canada-apologises-bumping-boy-family-holiday-flight)**

**United passenger dragged off plane**

**likely to sue airline, attorney says**

David Dao, a 69-year-old Vietnamese American doctor, was hospitalized after Chicago aviation police dragged him from the plane as the airline sought to make space on a flight from the city's O'Hare international airport to Louisville, Kentucky. Agencies, S. A. (2017, April 13). [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/apr/13//united-airlines-passenger-lawsuit-david-dao](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/apr/13//united-airlines-passenger-lawsuit-david-dao)**

\begin{tabular}{|l|} \hline
**(iv)** Revenue \(\simeq\) (0000(_l0)\(\subset\)l0\(\subset\)l0\(\subset\)l0\(\subset\)l0\(\subset\)l0\(\subset\)l0\(\subset\)l0\(\subset\)l0 Since the expected revenue of selling all 12 tickets (with compensation for overbooking) is more than selling all 10 tickets, the airline should continue with the first method. \\ \hline \end{tabular}

The above example is a simplified version of calculations used by airlines when they overbook flights. As the airline issues more tickets, there is a higher chance of having to bump passengers from the flight, but there is also a higher chance of filling most seats. In reality, the airline has to make a trade-off between these two, by taking, its various costs and revenues and how sensitive the various no-show probabilities are to the number of tickets it issues, into account to determine the optimal number of tickets to issue.

**Effects of varying \(n\) and \(p\) on the shape of the binomial distribution**

Applet to explore how the binomial distribution change as \(n\) and \(p\) changes:

[https://www.geogebra.org/m/GKb9XrA5](https://www.geogebra.org/m/GKb9XrA5)What observations can you make and what conclusion can you come to?

1. For small \(p\) and small \(n\), e.g. \(X-\mathrm{B}\big{(}12,0.2\big{)}\), the binomial distribution is skewed right (i.e. the bulk of the probability falls in the smaller numbers 0, 1, 2,..., and the distribution tails off to the right). In the context of the airline overbooking in Example 15; it corresponds to the case where the no-show rate is \(\mathbf{\hat{8}0\%}\) and there is allowance to more than 12 tickets such that the bulk of the probability still falls in the numbers smaller than 10 (number of seats).
2. For small \(n\) and large \(p\), the binomial distribution is skewed left.
3. For \(p=0.5\) and large and small \(n\), the binomial distribution is symmetric.
4. For large \(n\), the binomial distribution approaches a bell shape.

### Mode of \(X\) or most likely value of \(X\)

The **mode** is the value of \(X\) that is most likely to occur, i.e., **the most probable value** of \(X\). To find the mode of a binomial distribution, we will calculate all the binomial probabilities and find the value of \(X\) with the highest probability.

**Important:** The **mode** (most probable number) is usually close to the **expected number** but both refer to different concepts and **must not** be used interchangeably.

The expected number refers to the average that is expected to be obtained if a sufficiently large number of the same experiment were repeated under the same set of conditions. The most probable number is the value most likely to occur in any given experiment.

**(ii)**: Four such samples of 20 people are taken. Find the probability that two of these samples have exactly one person with disability, and the other two samples have more than two people with disability. [3]
**(iii)**: Find the least number of such samples of 20 people that must be taken so that the probability of having at least two samples with more than two people with disability is not less than 0.95. [3]

The chocolate brand 'Kid Cats' are sold in packets of 20 individual pieces. Each packet is made up of randomly chosen flavours of Kid Cats pieces produced. On average 15% of the Kid Cats pieces are hazelnut flavoured.

**(i)**: Let the random variable \(X\) denote the number of hazelnut flavoured Kid Cats pieces in a randomly chosen packet. State, in context, one assumption needed for \(X\) to be well modelled by a binomial distribution. [1]
**(ii)**: Find the probability that a randomly chosen packet of Kid Cats contains no more than 4 hazelnut flavoured pieces. [2]
**(iii)**: The Interact Club buys 100 randomly chosen packets of Kid Cats for their event. Find the probability that at least 75 of these packets contain no more than 4 hazelnut flavoured pieces. [3]

On average the proportion of Kid Cats pieces that are almond flavoured is \(q\). It is known that the most common number of almond flavoured pieces in a packet is 6.
**(iv)**: Use this information to find exactly the range of values that \(q\) can take. [4]

11 cards marked with the letters from the word MATHEMATICS are placed in a bag. Mary draws 3 cards at random and without replacement. She scores 1 point for every vowel drawn and 2 points for every consonant drawn.

Let \(X\) denote Mary's score. Show that

\[\mathbb{P}\big{(}X\geq 4\big{)}=\frac{161}{165}\]

and find E(\(X\)) and Var(\(X\)).

The cards are now replaced in the bag.

John draws 3 cards at random and without replacement. Like Mary, John scores 1 point for every vowel drawn and 2 points for every consonant drawn. After noting his score, he replaced the 3 cards in the bag. John carries out the same experiment a total of 165 times.

Find the probability that he gets a score of at least 4 for at least 161 times. [2]2005/RJC/II/26

Alex undergoes 4 training sessions each week, on separate days. In each of his training session, Alex has to run 10 laps of 400m. The probability of him meeting his target time for each lap on a sunny day is 0.95. On a rainy day, the probability of achieving his target time is 0.9. Each day is either sunny or rainy, and the probability of a sunny day is 0.8.

**(I)**: Calculate the probability of Alex achieving his target time for at least 8 of the laps on a rainy day. [2]
**(II)**: Given that there was a week of rainy days, determine the conditional probability of Alex being able to achieve his target time for 8 or more laps, in each of the sessions, on 3 separate days.

There was sunny weather for 2 consecutive weeks. Find the probability of Alex not meeting his target time for more than 4 laps during the 2 weeks. [2]
