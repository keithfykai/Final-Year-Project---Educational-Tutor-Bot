## Introduction

_How has the understanding of atomic structure developed and evolved?_

_The atomic model has changed over time when new evidence surfaced through the various discoveries relating to the structure of an atom._

_From John Dalton's atomic theory, the development of atomic theory had come a long way and our understanding of the nature of matter and the structure of atoms were deepened with the works of scientists such as J. J. Thompson, Ernest Rutherford, James Chadwick, Niels Bohr, Louis de Broglie, Erwin Schrodinger and Werner Heisenberg, just to name a few._

### Three Fundamental Sub-atomic Particles

* Electrons are attracted to the protons in the nucleus by electrostatic forces of attraction.
* The protons and neutrons in the nucleus are drawn very close together by nuclear forces.
* These forces are only effective over a very short range because they do not pull the outer electrons into the nucleus.

\(i\) An atomic mass unit (amu) is defined as 1/12 the mass of one atom of carbon-12. It has the value of 1.6606 x 10\({}^{-24}\) g.

### Representation of a Nucleide

* '**Nuclide**' refers to any species with a specified number of protons and neutrons.
* The nuclide of an element, X, is represented by: where

* is atomic number / proton number
* number of **protons** in the nucleus of an atom
* unique for each element (thus, helping us to identify the element)
* isotopes of an element have the same proton number

* is the mass number / nucleon number
* sum of **protons** and **neutrons** in the nucleus of an atom
* isotopes of an element have different **mass numbers** due to different number of neutrons

### Example 1

Determine the number of protons, neutrons and electrons of the following:

\begin{tabular}{l l l l l l}  & \({}^{35}\)C/ & \({}^{40}\)Ar & \({}^{40}\)K & \({}^{63}\)Cu\({}^{*}\) & \({}^{32}\)g\({}^{2-}\) \\
**proton** & **17** & **18** & **19** & **29** & **16** \\
**neutron** & 35-17 = **18** & **40-18 = **22** & 40-19 = **21** & 63-29 = **34** & 32-16 = **16** \\
**electron** & **17** & **18** & **19** & 29-1 = **28** & 16+2 = **18** \\ \end{tabular}

### Isotopes

* Isotopes are atoms of an element that have the same number of protons but different number of neutrons and hence different nucleon numbers (or mass number).
* The different mass numbers are known as isotopic masses (e.g. chlorine has two isotopes, chlorine-35 and chlorine-37.)
* They have the same number of electrons and thus, they show similar chemical properties. This is because in a chemical reaction, it is the electrons that are transferred between atoms. The nucleus remains intact.
* They have different number of neutrons and thus, different masses. Hence they show different physical properties (e.g. density).
* Not all isotopes are stable. Unstable isotopes undergo radioactive decay, sometimes producing a different isotope.
* An example of an unstable isotope that undergoes radioactive (alpha) decay is uranium-238. In this process, the uranium atom (\({}^{238}_{92}\) U) transmuted into an atom of thorium (\({}^{234}_{90}\) Th) and, at the same time, gives off an alpha particle (\({}^{4}_{2}\) He). \[{}^{238}_{92}\text{U}\ \ \rightarrow\ ^{234}_{90}\text{Th}\ \ +\ ^{4}_{2}\text{He}\ \ +\ \text{ energy}\]

* **A** & 16 & 18 & 16 & 17 & 17 & 18 & 17 & 0 & 17 & 20 & 17 &

### Behaviour of Sub-atomic Particles in an Electric Field

When a beam comprising of protons, electrons and neutrons is passed through an electric field, the expected deflections are as shown below.

\begin{tabular}{c|c|c} \hline Particle & Charge of particle & Direction of deflection in electric field \\ \hline Neutrons & Electrically neutral & Not deflected \\ \hline Electrons & Negatively charged & Attracted towards the positively charged plate \\ \hline Protons & Positively charged & Attracted towards the negatively charged plate \\ \hline \end{tabular}

* Angle of deflection, \(\theta\), is proportional to the **charge** of the particle, but inversely proportional to its **mass** \\ \(\frac{q}{m}\) for a proton, \(\dagger\) H + = \(\frac{1}{1}\) = \(\frac{1}{1}\) & \(\frac{q}{m}\) for an electron = \(\frac{1}{1840}\) = \(\frac{1}{1840}\) \\ Thus, the angle of deflection for electrons is 1840 times more than protons (\(\theta\) > \(\theta\) ).
* Particles with **smaller mass** and/or **higher charge** will be **deflected more**.

For your information

* _The_ **greater the charge of the particle**_, the greater is the attractive force exerted on it from the oppositely charged plate, and the_ **greater is the deviation from its original direction of motion**
* _If two particles are moving at the same speed but one is more massive than the other, the heavier particle has a greater kinetic energy. Thus, more energy must be exerted on the heavier particle to cause it to deflect. Since the applied electric field is exerting the same amount of force on these two different particles with different masses, the_ **heavier particle is deflected to a lesser extent**

**(b)**: Using answers in **(a)**, sketch the paths of particles **1**, **2** and **3** in an electric field on the same diagram, showing clearly the angle of deflection of each of the particles.

## Part 2: The arrangement of electrons

* The arrangement of electrons in an atom (or ion) is referred to its **electronic structure or electronic configuration**.
* It normally applies to atoms or ions in the **ground state** (i.e. **lowest possible energy level** available to it).
* The electronic configuration provides us with the following information:
* the **number*
* of electrons in the atom or ion
* the **distribution*
* of electrons in the atom or ion
* the **relative energies*
* of the electrons
* An electron in an atom is described by its **principal quantum number**, the **subshell**, and **orbital**.

### Principal Quantum Number

* The electrons in an atom are arranged in **electronic shells**
* Each electronic shell is denoted by a **principal quantum number**, represented by the symbol **n**, where **n** = 1, 2, 3,... (numbered outwards from the nucleus)
* The **larger*
* the principal quantum number,
* the **further*
* is the shell from the nucleus (i.e. \(n\) = 1 is the innermost shell).
* the **less strongly*
* the electron is **attracted*
* to the nucleus
* the **higher*
* the **energy level*
* of the electron

### Subshell

* Each electronic shell comprises one or more **subshells**.
* Subshells are represented by the letters: **s**, **p**, **d** and **f**.
* The number of subshells in each electronic shell is equal to the **n** value.

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|} \hline
**Principal quantum number, n** & **No of subshells** & **Type of subshells** \\ \hline
1 & 1 & **s** \\ \hline
2 & 2 & **s**, **p** \\ \hline
3 & 3 & **s**, **p**, **d** \\ \hline
4 & 4 & **s**, **p**, **d**, **f** \\ \hline \end{tabular}
* Within the same electronic shell, the relative energies of the subshells are in the order: **s** < **p** < **d** < **f**.

### Orbitals

* Electrons are not "fixed" in place; rather they are spread out around the nucleus as an **electron cloud** known as **orbital**.
* An orbital represents a three-dimensional volume of space around the nucleus in which there is a **high probability (> 95%) of finding an electron**.

_Example: If we were to take instantaneous snapshots of the position of electrons over a period of time, a result similar to that shown below would be obtained for an s electron._

* Each subshell consists of **group of orbitals** with the **same energy level** (**degenerate**) but different orientation in space.
* The number of orbitals is determined by the type of subshell
* Number of orbitals
* Each orbital can contain a maximum of two electrons which must be of **opposite spin**.

_Summary_

* **Note:** From this table, it can be observed that in the \(\mathbf{n^{\text{th}}}\) principal quantum number, there are \(\mathbf{n}\) number of subshells consisting of \(\mathbf{m^{2}}\) number of orbitals with a maximum number of \(\mathbf{2n^{2}}\) electrons.

#### 2.3.1 Shapes of Orbitals

**(a)**: **s orbitals**

* The s orbital is **spherically symmetrical** about the nucleus.
* The probability of finding an electron at a distance r from the nucleus is the same in all directions.
* An s orbital is represented by drawing a circle.
* s orbitals from different principal electronic shells **differ in size**.

**Why?**

As the principal quantum number, \(n\), increases, the orbitals get **larger** and **more diffused**.

**More detailed explanation**

With a 2s orbital larger than a 1s orbital, the probability of finding an electron in a 2s orbital is spread across a greater region, and thus this electron is less strongly attracted by the nucleus as compared to one in the 1s orbital. As we view the electron as a negatively charged cloud, this means a lower electron density and hence a more diffused orbital.

**(b)**: **p orbitals: **p\({}_{\text{x}}\)**, **p\({}_{\text{y}}\)**, and **p\({}_{\text{z}}\)**

* A p subshell is made up of _three_**dumb-bell shaped** p orbitals mutually at **right angles** to each other.
* Each p orbital consists of two lobes with the atomic nucleus lying between them.
* p orbitals are **directional**, e.g. the p\({}_{\text{x}}\) orbital will have 2 lobes of high electron density that lie along the x axis.
* All the three p orbitals are **degenerate**, i.e. they have the **same energy**.
* \(p\) orbitals from different electronic shell shells **differ in size**. Like s orbitals, the p orbitals get larger and more diffused as the principal quantum number, \(n\), increases. i.e. 3p > 2p

#### 2.3.2 Relative energies of the orbitals

* Each orbital is associated with a specific **energy level**, which is in turn associated with a specific distance of the electron from the nucleus.
* The "energy of an orbital" is the energy of the electron occupying that orbital.
* An electron that resides in an electron shell closer to the nucleus is more strongly attracted to it. It will have a lower potential energy and is thus more stable.
* A schematic representation of the energy levels is shown below, indicating the relative energies of the various orbitals.

#### 2.4.2 Electronic Configurations involving More Than 18 Electrons

* When filling electrons into the orbitals, the **4s orbital** is filled first before the **3d orbitals**. (Refer to page 18 on using periodic Table to decide on the relative subshell energies) \[{}_{19}\text{K} :\] & 1s 2s 2 2p 6 3s 2 3p 6 4s 1 20Ca : 1s 2 2s 2 2p 6 3s 2 3p 6 4s 2 21Sc : 1s 2 2s 2 2p 6 3s 2 3p 6 **3d 1 4s 2** Note: The electronic configuration is always written in the order of **increasing** principal quantum number e.g. for \({}_{26}\)Fe it should be 1s2s22p63s23p63d4s2 but _not_ 1s2s2s2p63s23p64s3d6.

#### 2.4.3 Anomalous Electronic Configurations

The electronic configurations for chromium (\({}_{24}\)Cr) and copper (\({}_{29}\)Cu) are anomalous.

(a) Chromium: [Ar] **3d5** 4s1** _not_ [Ar] 3d4 4s2 (b) Copper: [Ar] **3d10** 4s1** _not_ [Ar] **3d9** 4s2** Electronic configurations with **half-filled** or **fully filled 3d subshells** are unusually **stable** due to the **symmetrical distribution of charge around the nucleus.

_If similar charges are distributed symmetrically, this means that all charges are spread out evenly and as far apart as possible. This results in similar amount of electrostatic repulsion at each point in space. Such a state has lower energy (thus more stable) as compared to a state of asymmetrical distribution._

### Electronic Configurations involving ions

#### 2.5.1 Cations/ positively charged ions

* Electrons are first removed from orbitals with the highest energy.

**Note:**

* For atoms / ions with **more than 20** electrons, the 4s electrons are removed first before the 3d electrons even though the 4s orbital is filled before the 3d orbitals.
* This is because the 3d subshell is closer to the nucleus. Once the 3d subshell is occupied by electrons, the inner 3d electrons repel the 4s electrons further from the nucleus and cause the latter to be at a higher energy level.

**Example 6**:

Determine the electronic configuration of the following ions:

(a) Na+ ion (b) Ca2+ ion (Na : 1s2 2s2 2p6 3s1) (Ca: 1s22s22p63s23p64s2) **Na+**: Ca2+**:

(c) Iron(II) ion (d) Iron(III) ion (Fe : 1s22s22p63s23p64s2) **Fe2+**: (Fe : 1s22s22p63s23p63d64s2)

#### 2.5.2 Anions/ Negatively charged ions

Anions are formed when atoms **gain electrons**.

Electrons are added to the **next available lowest energy orbital** in the atom.

**Example 7**:

Determine the electronic configuration of the following ions:

(a) Oxide ion (b) Chloride ion (O : 1s2 2s22p6) (C1 : 1s22s22p63s23p5) **O2+**:

**2.6 Electronic Configurations involving isoelectronic species**

When 2 different species (atoms or ions) have the **same** number of electrons (or electronic configuration), they are said to be **isoelectronic** with one another.

For example, the following species are isoelectronic:

**1s2s22p6**10Ne 1s22s22p6**11Na+ 1s22s22p6**Checkpoint 3**

1 Gallium has the electronic configuration [Ar] 3d10 4s2 4p1, where [Ar] represents the configuration of argon.

**A** & _AI_ & **B** & Ti\({}^{3+}\) \\
**C** & Zn\({}^{2+}\) & **D** & Cr\({}^{3+}\) \\ \end{tabular}

### The Periodic Table

In the Periodic Table,

* elements are arranged in order of increasing **atomic (proton)** number
* elements in the same **Period** (row) have electrons occupying the same outermost shell (or have the same number of electron shells).
* elements in the same **Group** (column) have the same number of valence (outermost) electrons and thus, same electronic configuration in the valence (outermost) shell in their atoms.

#### How can we easily decide the relative energy levels of the subshells?

The Periodic Table is divided into blocks of 2, 6, 10 and 14 columns which reflects the _number of electrons that occupy s_, \(p\) _d_ _and f_ _subshells_.

As we proceed through the elements in the periodic table in order of increasing atomic number, we will be able to determine the _relative energies_ of the subshells and hence deduce the _order of filling_ up the subshells.

### Definition of first ionisation energy (1st I.E.):

The first ionisation energy of an element is the energy needed to remove one mole of electrons from one mole of the gaseous atoms to form one mole of singly charged gaseous cations.

* The magnitude of ionisation energy is a measure of the **strength of attraction** between the **positively charged nucleus** (due to the protons present) and the **valence electron** that is to be removed.
* Ionisation energies have positive values (**endothermic**) because energy is **absorbed** during ionisation to overcome this attractive force.
* When we carry out ionisation, the species must be **gaseous** atoms. In the gaseous state, atoms have very minimal interactions with one another. Thus, the energy absorbed would solely be responsible for removing the electrons and not for overcoming other type of interactions.

### Example 8

Which equation is used to define the first ionisation of bromine?

- B Br +(g) + e
- C?Br(g) Br +(g) + e
- D?Br +(g) + e
- Modified N96/IV/1; N99/III/2

### Factors Affecting Ionisation Energy (I.E.)

#### Nuclear Charge

* As the number of protons increases, the nuclear charge increases.
* The attraction of the positively charged nucleus for the negatively charged valence electrons becomes stronger.
* More energy is required to remove the valence electrons.
* Hence, the ionisation energy increases.

#### Shielding effect by other electrons

* Electrons in the inner electronic shells repel those in the outer shell away from the nucleus.
* The inner (core) electrons partially cancel the attraction between the valence electrons and the nucleus, i.e. the inner electrons shield or screen the valence electrons from the attraction of the nucleus. Hence, the actual attraction of the nucleus experienced by the valence electrons is lessened.

* Shielding/screening effect increases with an increase in the number of inner electronic shells.
* Thus the electrostatic attraction between the valence electron and the nucleus becomes weaker.
* Less energy is required to remove the valence electron
* Hence the ionisation energy decreases.

#### 3.2.3 No. of electronic shells (distance)

* As the number of electron shells increases, the valence electrons are further away and more shielded from the nucleus.
* The attraction of the positively charged nucleus for the negatively charged electrons becomes weaker.
* Less energy is required to remove the valence electrons.
* Hence, the ionisation energy decreases.

### Trends in First Ionisation Energy

The figure below shows how the **first ionisation energy** of elements vary with atomic number.

Observations from the graph above,

**(a)** **First ionisation energies generally increase across a period**

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|} \hline Examples & From Li to Ne (Period 2 elements) \\  & From Na to Ar (Period 3 elements) \\ \hline Reason & Across a period, number of protons increases and hence **nuclear charge increases.** \\  & Across a period, number of electrons also increases but these \\  & electrons are added to the same outermost electron shell and hence \\  & **number of electron shells remains the same** and **shielding effect** \\  & **remains approximately constant.** \\  & Electrostatic **attraction** between the valence electrons and the \\  & nucleus **becomes stronger.** \\  & Hence **more energy** is required to remove a valence electron from \\  & an atom across a period. \\  & First ionisation energies **generally increase** across a period.

### (c) First ionisation energy decreases down the Group

### (d) Additional points to take note

1. The first ionisation energy of the noble gas is the **highest** within each period. * Within each period, the noble gas has the largest number of protons compared to any one of the preceding elements and hence it has the **largest nuclear charge**. * Within each period, the noble gas has the same number of shell. It also has the largest number of electrons but these additional electrons are added to the **same outermost shell and they provide relatively poor shielding** for one another. Hence the valence electrons in the noble gas atom experience **approximately the same shielding effect** as those of any of the preceding elements. * Thus the electrostatic **attraction** between the valence electron and the nucleus is the **strongest** for the noble gas atom. * Hence the **largest amount of energy** is required to remove an electron from the noble gas atom than from any other element within each period, leading the noble gas having the highest first ionisation energy. 
2. There is a **sharp drop** in first ionisation energy from **He to Li**, from **Ne to Na** and from **Ar to K**. * The first ionisation energy of K is **lower** than that of Ar. * Ar 1s2 2s2 2p6 3s2 3p6 K 1s2 2s2 2p6 3s2 3p6 4s1 Though the **nuclear charge of K is **larger** than that of Ar, the 4s electron to be removed from K is **further away from the nucleus** than the 3p electron in Ar. This 4s electron experiences significantly **more shielding** due to more inner electrons. * The 4s electron in K is **less strongly attracted** by the nucleus and requires **less energy** to be removed compared to the 3p electron in Ar. * Hence the first ionisation energy of K is lower than that of Ar.

**Example 9**:

Why is the first ionisation energy of Ne higher than that of F?

**A**: Fluorine is more electronegative than neon.
**B**: Neon has a complete octet, but fluorine does not.
**C**: The atomic radius of fluorine is less than that of neon.
**D**: The nuclear charge in neon is greater than that in fluorine.

**Example 10**:

Why is the first ionisation energy of sulfur lower than that of phosphorus?
**A**: Sulfur is more electronegative than phosphorus.
**B**: Sulfur forms anions more readily.
**C**: The electron to be lost is paired with another electron.
**D**: The sulfur atom is larger than the phosphorus atom.

### Trend in Successive Ionisation Energies of an Element

Definition of second ionisation energy (2nd I.E.):

The **second ionisation energy** of an element is the energy needed to remove **one mole** of electrons from **one mole** of singly charged **gaseous** cations to form **one mole** of **doubly charged **gaseous** cations.

Successive ionisation energies refer to the energies required to remove electrons one after another from a gaseous ion.

During ionisation, electrons are always removed from the **valence** (outermost) shell.

The successive ionisation energies of an element **increase** with the removal of each electron.

For example:

I.E. (kJ mol\({}^{-1}\)) = 736 1450 7740 10500

Reason:

* as electrons are successively removed from the atom
* number of protons **remains the same**\(\Rightarrow\) **nuclear charge remains the same**
* number of electrons decreases \(\Rightarrow\) **shielding effect decreases (_But note: The change in shielding effect is not significant if the number of inner shell electrons remains the same.)
* **remaining electrons experience stronger attraction** by the nucleus
* **more energy** is required to remove the electron leading to an **increase** in I.E.

Why is the 3rd IE significantly larger than the 2nd IE (1450 vs 7740)?

Reason:

Mg\({}^{+}\) : 1s\({}^{2}\) 2s\({}^{2}\) 2p\({}^{6}\)3s\({}^{1}\)Mg\({}^{2+}\) : 1s\({}^{2}\) 2s\({}^{2}\) 2p\({}^{6}\)

* **The 3rd electron is removed from the next inner electron shell** which is **nearer to** and **less shielded** from the nucleus
* Thus **the electron experiences even stronger attraction by the nucleus
* **even more energy** is required to remove the electron leading to a **larger increase** in I.E.

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:30]

* Example: large difference between the 9th and 10th ionisation energies
* more energy is required to remove the 10th electron
* the 10th electron is removed from an inner electron shell that is closer to the nucleus and hence less shielded from the nucleus
* the 10th electron is more strongly attracted by the nucleus
* There is a large difference between the 1st and 2nd ionisation energies
* more energy is required to remove the 2nd electron
* the 2nd electron is removed from an inner electron shell, one that is closer to the nucleus and less shielded from the nucleus
* the 2nd electron is more strongly attracted by the nucleus
* The small jump between 7th and 8th ionisation energies is due to the removal of electrons from different subshells.
* The energy gap between subshells is not as big as that between principal quantum shells.
* **Sometime, this observation is not discernible**. For example a small jump is expected between the 15th and 16th ionisation energies (due to the removal of electrons from different subshells) but this is not observed in the graph.
