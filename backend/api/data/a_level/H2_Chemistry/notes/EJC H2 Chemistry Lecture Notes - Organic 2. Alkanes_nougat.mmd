## 1 Introduction

### Hydrocarbons

Hydrocarbons are compounds containing only hydrogen and carbon (e.g. alkanes, alkenes, arenes, alkynes) and are obtained from crude oil, a fossil fuel.

**(Recap from 'O' Levels) Fractional distillation** separates the components of crude oil (which is mainly made up of alkanes) based on their different boiling points.

**Major fractions of crude oil and their uses:**

\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|c|c|} \hline
**fraction** & **boiling point** & **length of** & & \\  & **range / \({}^{\circ}\)C** & **carbon chain** & & \\ \hline refinery gas & \(<20\) & C\({}_{1}\) to C\({}_{4}\) & fuels and feedstock (starting reactants) & \\  & & & for petrochemicals. & \\ \hline gasoline/ & \(20\)-\(120\) & C\({}_{5}\) to C\({}_{12}\) & petrol for transport and as a feedstock for & \\  & & & petrochemicals & \\ \hline kerosene & \(120\)-\(220\) & C\({}_{10}\) to C\({}_{16}\) & jet fuel, paraffin & \\ \hline diesel & \(220\)-\(350\) & C\({}_{15}\) to C\({}_{25}\) & fuel for transport, power plants and heating & \\ \hline residue & \(>350\) & \(>\) C\({}_{25}\) & oil-ifred power stations, polishing waxes, lubricating oils and bitumen on roads \\ \hline \end{tabular}

* **LO (e)** Recognise that petroleum, a chemical feedstock, is a finite resource and the importance of recycling
* **Petroleum** is used to produce things such as plastics. Since petroleum is a finite resource thus recycling is important to reduce the amount of waste sent to landfills and incinerators, as well as the conservation of natural resources. It also helps sustain the environment for future generations.

### Alkanes

* Alkanes are saturated hydrocarbons (only have single bonds, _e.g._**C-C, C-H**).
* Each C atom is **sp\({}^{3}\)** hybridised, tetrahedrally surrounded by H and other C atoms with bond angle of **109.5\({}^{\circ}\)**.
* Alkanes can exist as straight chains, branched chains, and rings (these are known as cycloalkanes).
* General formula: \(\Box\) for all straight chain and branched chain alkanes: C\({}_{n}\)H\({}_{2n+2}\), \(\Box\) for cycloalkanes: C\({}_{n}\)H\({}_{2n}\), where \(n\) equals the number of carbon atoms (the difference of 2 H atoms is equivalent to a ring structure).

## 2 Nomenclature (using the IUPAC system)

The IUPAC system is the most common method used for naming most organic compounds. In the IUPAC nomenclature, every name consists:

[MISSING_PAGE_POST]

## 3 Physical Properties

All alkane molecules are **non-polar molecules** (as C-C bond is non-polar and C-H bonds are effectively non-polar due to the very small difference in electronegativity between C and H atoms).

### Bolling Point / Volatility

Alkanes have relatively low boiling points (or high volatility or high vapour pressure) as they have weaker instantaneous dipole-induced dipole interactions.

Recall from Chemical Bonding that the strength of such electrostatic forces of attraction is affected by:

**(1) Number of electrons in the molecule**

If we look at the melting and boiling points of the alkanes on page 3, they generally increase from one member of the homologous series to the next member. This is due to the additional -CH\({}_{2}\)-group which leads to a **greater number of electrons** in the molecule, thus **greater polarisation of electron cloud** in the molecule, and **stronger instantaneous dipole - induced dipole interactions**. Hence, more energy is needed to overcome these electrostatic forces of attraction, leading to higher melting/boiling point and lower volatility or higher enthalpy change of vapourisation.

**(2) Shape of the molecule**

\(\text{CH}_{3}\text{CH}_{2}\text{CH}_{2}\text{CH}_{2}\text{CH}_{3}\)\(\text{CH}_{3}\text{-C}\text{-CH}_{3}\)\(\text{CH}_{3}\)\(\text{CH}_{3}\)\(\text{CH}_{3}\)\(\text{CH}_{3}\)\(\text{pentane}\) (36 \({}^{\circ}\)C) 2,2-dimethylpropane (10 \({}^{\circ}\)C) Straight chain alkanes (_e.g._ pentane) have higher boiling point (or lower volatility) than their corresponding branched chain alkanes (_e.g._ 2,2-dimethylpropane). This is because **straight chain molecules have larger surface area of contact between them** and thus have more extensive instantaneous dipole-induced dipole interactions which need more energy to overcome.

**Example A**

Arrange the following alkanes in order of increasing boiling points. Explain your answer.

* 2,3-dimethylbutane
* hexane
* propane

Among the 3 alkanes, **propane has least number of electrons**. Hence, **strength of instantaneous dipole-induced dipole interactions is weakest for propane**. Comparing hexane and 2,3-dimethylbutane, hexane is a chain alkane and 2,3-dimethylbutane is a chain alkane. Therefore, hexane has greater surface area of contact than 2,3-dimethylbutane**. Hexane has more extensive instantaneous dipole-induced dipole interaction compared to 2,3-dimethylbutane.

Thus in order of increasing boiling point:

### Solubility

Alkanes are soluble in non-polar solvents such as benzene but are insoluble in water and other (highly) polar solvents.

**Reason:**

**Between alkane and non-polar solvent:**

The energy released in forming the **instantaneous dipole-induced dipole (i.d.-i.d.)** interactions between the alkane molecules and non-polar solvent molecules is sufficient to overcome the i.d.-i.d. interactions between the alkane molecules and the i.d.-i.d. interactions between the non-polar solvent molecules.

**Between alkane and water/polar solvent:**

The energy released in forming the **permanent dipole-induced dipole (p.d.-i.d.)** interactions between the alkane molecules and water molecules / polar solvent molecules is insufficient to overcome the i.d.-i.d. interactions between the alkane molecules and the **hydrogen bonds / permanent dipole-permanent dipole (p.d.-p.d.) interactions between the water molecules / polar solvent molecules**.

### Density

Generally, **alkanes are less dense than water**. The **density of alkanes increases with size of the molecule**\(\left(\text{density}=\frac{\text{mass}}{\text{volume}}\right)\) due to the **higher relative molecular mass and stronger instantaneous dipole-induced dipole interactions** that make the molecules come closer to each other.

#### 5.2.1 Free Radical Substitution Mechanism

(using methane as an example)

[frame=lines,width=1.5cm]

LO (c) Describe the mechanism of free-radical substitution with particular reference to the initiation, propagation and termination reactions.

In Reaction Kinetics, we discussed about mechanisms and how they show us details such as how many steps does the reaction involve, which bonds are broken/formed and the order in which they do so, as well as the relative rates of the different steps within the reaction. Here, we will look into the first mechanism - free radical substitution.

The mechanism involves three stages - initiation, propagation and termination.

Using the reaction between methane and chlorine as an example, the overall equation for the reaction is:

\[\begin{array}{c}\mbox{CH}_{4}+\mbox{C}_{L}\mbox{ }\frac{\mbox{uv light}}{\mbox{CH}_{3}Cl+\mbox{HC}l}\end{array}\]

**Stage 1: Initiation**

Under ultraviolet light or heat, the **homolytic fission of C_I_-_C_I_ bond takes place and **chlorine free radicals**, _*C_I_, are formed.

[frame=lines,width=1.5cm]

Note: The uv light used (_e.g._ sunlight consisting of UV-A of wavelength 315-400 nm, corresponding to energy of 380-299 kJ mol-1) only provides enough energy to break the weaker C_I_-_C_I_ bond (244 kJ mol-1) and not the stronger C-H bond (410 kJ mol-1).

**Stage 2: Propagation**

The **highly reactive chlorine free radical**, on colliding with alkanes such as methane, abstracts a hydrogen atom to produce HC_I_ and a **methyl radical**, _*CH_3.

The methyl radical **reacts further** with another chlorine molecule to form the product (chloromethane, CH_3_C_I_) and a **chlorine free radical** is **regenerated**.

This step leads to a chain reaction [**(a)**, **(b)**, **(a)**, **(b)**,...] since the chlorine free radical formed can react in the same way as shown in the first propagation step.

Note: The **reaction only requires a flash of ultraviolet light rather than prolonged radiation**. Since the ***C_I_**radical is **regenerated** in the propagation stage, the **generation of *C_I_**radical by using ultraviolet light** is only required in the initiation stage to start the chain reaction.

Summary of mechanism for the chlorination of methane

Free Radical Substitution98

The mechanism above only shows the formation of CH\({}_{3}\)_CI_ only. For the formation of CH\({}_{2}\)_CI_, it will be a different free-radical substitution mechanism with a different propagation and termination stages involving -CH\({}_{2}\)_CI_ instead of -CH\({}_{3}\).

Note:

In drawing the mechanism of the free radical substitution reaction, please note the following:

* the type of reaction, free radical substitution, and names of the 3 stages must be given
* half arrows are _only required_ for _Initiation Stage_
* for Termination Stage, it is sufficient to show any **two** steps
* description of each step is **not** required

Checking for Section 5.4.1 and 5.4.2.

* To understand and describe the chemistry of alkanes in the following reactions:

1. Combustion

2. Free radical substitution by chlorine and bromine

* To be able to describe the mechanism of free-radical substitution using the initiation, propagation and termination reactions.

* To recognise that free radical substitution is not a good method to prepare halogenalkanes as a mixture with different halogen-substituted alkanes is produced.

#### 5.2.3 Reactivity of Halogens with Alkanes

Generally, down the group from fluorine to iodine, there is a decrease in reactivity between halogens and alkanes.

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|} \hline
**halogen** & **reaction with alkanes** \\ \hline F\({}_{2}\)(g) & reacts **explosively** with alkanes \\ \hline C\(l_{2}\)(g) & react with alkanes in the presence of **UV light or heat**. \\ Br\({}_{2}\)(_l_) & Br\({}_{2}\) reacts less readily than chlorine. \\ (_both reagents can be dissolved in inert solvents like CCLu)_ & both have **no reaction** with alkanes in dark conditions or at room temperature. \\ \hline I\({}_{2}\) & **no reaction** with alkanes \\ \hline \end{tabular}

Reactivity trend: **F\({}_{2}\) > C\(l_{2}\) > Br\({}_{2}\) > I\({}_{2}\)**

In particular, the lack of reactivity involving iodine means that iodoalkanes are **not** prepared using free radical substitution reaction. The reason behind the lack of reactivity involves energetics - during the **first step of the propagation stage, the reaction is highly endothermic**.

In the first propagation stage of the reaction between a halogen and an alkane, the **C-H bond is broken and the H-X bond is formed**.

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|} \hline X\({}^{+}\) & H\(-\)R & X\(-\)H & + \(\cdot\)R & \(\Delta H_{t}^{\phi}\) \\ \hline \end{tabular}

The enthalpy change of reaction for the first propagation stage, \(\Delta H_{t}^{\phi}\), for the different halogens can be calculated by considering bond energy values:

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|} \hline \(\Delta H_{t}^{\phi}\) & = & B.E.(bonds broken) & \(-\) \(\sum\)B.E.(bonds formed) \\  & = & B.E.(C\(-\)H) - B.E.(H\(-\)X) \\ \hline \end{tabular}

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|} \hline X & B.E.(C\(-\)H)/kJ mol\({}^{-1}\) & B.E.(H\(-\)X)/kJ mol\({}^{-1}\) & \(\Delta H_{t}^{\phi}\)/kJ mol\({}^{-1}\) \\ \hline F & 410 & 562 & \(-\)152 \\ \hline C\(l\) & 410 & 431 & \(-\)21 \\ \hline Br & 410 & 366 & +44 \\ \hline I & 410 & 299 & +111 \\ \hline \end{tabular}

The \(\Delta H_{t}^{\phi}\) of the first propagation step is highly endothermic (**+111 kJ mol\({}^{-1}\)**) in the case of I.

#### Reasons:

As the **size of the halogen atom increases** down the group, orbital becomes more **diffuse** and **overlap between the H and X atom is less effective**. Hence, \(\Delta H_{t}^{\phi}\)**becomes more endothermic down the group.

Example 9A

Propane and chlorine react when irradiated with ultraviolet light to form 2-chloropropane as one of the products.

Write two equations for the propagation stage for this reaction.

A compound with molecular formula C6H14 was formed in this reaction. Suggest the structural formula of this alkane.

#### 5.2.4 Predicting ratio of monosubstituted products of free radical substitution

As seen in section 5.2.1, when methane undergoes free radical substitution with chlorine, chloromethane can be formed.

However, when propane undergoes free radical substitution with chlorine, 1-chloropropane and 2-chloropropane can be formed.

What would be the expected ratio of the two products formed? This requires us to consider two aspects:

1. the **number and type of H atoms** that can undergo free radical substitution, and
2. the **stability of the alkyl radicals** formed.

#### 5.2.4.1 Number and types of H atoms that can undergo free radical substitution

In propane, there are two types of H atoms, H\({}^{a}\) and H\({}^{b}\). H\({}^{a}\) is a primary hydrogen as it a hydrogen atom residing on a carbon which is directly attached to ONE other carbon atom. H\({}^{b}\) is a secondary hydrogen atom as it is a hydrogen atom residing on a carbon which is directly attached to TWO other carbon atoms.

From the above structural formula, we can deduce that the ratio of types of H atoms, H\({}^{a}\) : H\({}^{b}\), is 6 : 2 = 3 : 1.

Assuming **equal stability** of the alkyl radical formed, ratio of **1-chloropropane : 2-chloropropane** formed **should** also be 3 : 1.

However, from the above data, it can be seen that the actual percentage of 1-chloropropane (45%) formed is lower than that of 2-chloropropane (55%). Therefore, in the chlorination of propane, we also have to consider the rate of abstraction of different types of hydrogen atoms on different carbon atoms.

#### 5.2.4.2 Stability of the alkyl radicals formed

In the chlorination of propane, the rate of abstraction of different types of hydrogen atoms on different carbon atoms is different. We observe selectivity in that primary hydrogen are abstracted much slower than secondary hydrogen.

This is attributed to the stability of the resultant radical formed:

\[\begin{array}{ccc}\text{CH}_{3}\text{--CH--CH}_{3}&>&\text{CH}_{3}\text{-- CH}_{2}\text{--CH}_{2}\\ \text{2}^{\circ}\text{2-propyl radical}&&\text{1}^{\circ}\text{ 1-propyl radical}\end{array}\]

The more stable the resultant radical, the faster the hydrogen can be abstracted.

## 7 Measures to Reduce Pollution

### Catalytic Converters

(Refer to Kinetics lecture notes)

Vehicles are fitted with catalytic converters to convert harmful emissions to harmless products. Exhaust gases are passed through heated solid platinum, rhodium or palladium catalyst.

The three harmful compounds that can be converted are:

* **Hydrocarbons** (in the form of unburned gasoline)
* **Carbon monoxide** (formed by the incomplete combustion of gasoline)
* **Oxides of nitrogen or NOx** (created when high temperatures in the engine promote reaction between the nitrogen and oxygen present in the air)

These pollutants are converted into CO\({}_{2}\), N\({}_{2}\) and water vapour.

* **Unburnt hydrocarbons are oxidised to CO\({}_{2}\) and H\({}_{2}\)O.**
* **CO is oxidised to CO\({}_{2}\)**
* **NO\({}_{x}\) is converted to N\({}_{2}\)**

Examples of equations for these conversions (not exhaustive) are given below:

\(\text{C}_{x}\text{H}_{y}(\text{g})+\frac{X+Y}{4}\,\text{O}_{2}(\text{g})\to X \text{CO}_{2}(\text{g})+\frac{Y}{2}\,\text{H}_{2}\text{O}(\text{I})\) (Pt/ Pd catalyst)

\(\text{2CO}(\text{g})+\text{O}_{2}(\text{g})\to 2\text{CO}_{2}(\text{g})\) (Pt/ Pd catalyst)

\(\text{2CO}(\text{g})+\text{NO}(\text{g})\to 2\text{CO}_{2}(\text{g})+\text{N}_{2}( \text{g})\) (Rh catalyst)

Checking for Section 6 and 7

* To recognise the environmental consequences of: 1. carbon monoxide, oxides of nitrogen and unburnt hydrocarbons arising from the internal combustion engine and their catalytic removal. 2. gases that contribute to enhanced greenhouse effect.
* To describe how catalytic converters can convert harmful C\({}_{x}\text{H}_{y}\), CO and NOx into harmless products with the aid of equations.
