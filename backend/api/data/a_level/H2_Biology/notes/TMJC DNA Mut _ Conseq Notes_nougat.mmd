## Topic synopsis

An understanding of _Genetics and Inheritance_ that would help make sense of the transition from molecular to organismal level. _Genetics and Inheritance_ provides the molecular basis to the understanding of how variations in populations arise and this is important in the study of biological evolution. At the cellular level, expression of genes involves cellular structures such as the nucleus, endoplasmic reticulum and ribosome. Many essential products of gene expression are enzymes involved in biochemical pathways which control physiological functions. As such, mutation of genes may give rise to dysfunctional proteins which in turn could result in diseases. Sickle cell anemia and cancer are raised as examples of a monogenic and a multi-genic disease respectively.

The following questions should help you frame your learning:

* How does the genetic make-up of an organism influence its appearance, behavior and survival?
* How can we ensure continuity of human as a species?

_Mutation arises from imperfect replication of genetic information. Together with other biological processes, such mutations increase genetic variation._

Based on the central dogma, a change in the sequence of DNA nucleotide, i.e. gene mutation, may affect the amino acid sequence in the polypeptide and hence the phenotype of the organism. Many mutations are detrimental to the individual since they affect the normal functioning of the gene product, e.g. genetic diseases such as sickle cell anemia and cancer. Others are neutral, often because they have no effect on the phenotype, e.g. a change in a DNA triplet which still codes for the same amino acid. Occasionally, mutations may be beneficial. For example, individuals who are heterozygous for a mutated hemoglobin gene that causes sickle cell anemia have selective advantage in areas where malaria is common. Besides mutation of genes, chromosomal mutation and change in chromosome number may also occur. Down's syndrome arises due to the presence of an additional copy of chromosome 21.

The development of cancer is a multi-step process that comprises gene mutations caused by environmental factors, biological agents or hereditary predispositions. These mutations might cause cells to bypass cell cycle checkpoints. Normally, two groups of genes are involves in regulating cell division: tumor-suppressor genes and proto-oncogenes. Mutations in either or both of these groups of genes may lead to the development of cancer. Cancer has a much higher incidence in Singapore compared to other diseases and accounts for as much as 30% of the death in this country. The recorded incidence of cancer is on the rise and this could be due to the accumulation of mutations from one generation to the next, although other reasons have also been proposed: increased exposure to carcinogens and increased detection rates as a result of effective cancer screening programmes. As such, an understanding of how cancer develops is important as this would set the platform for discussion of developing anti-cancer drugs.

**4.7**: Factors that Increase the Chances of Cancerous Growth*** Mutations
* Mutation is the **change in the amount, arrangement or structure of the DNA** in an organism.
* Mutations occur mostly during **flawed DNA replication** or **nuclear division**.
* Mutations occurring in **germ cells** that produce gametes (sperms/eggs) can be inherited by the offspring during fertilization. This is known as **germline mutation**.
* Mutations occurring in **somatic cells** (e.g. skin cells, breast cells) will not be passed down to the offspring. This is known as **somatic mutation**.
* Mutations resulting from **a change in nucleotide sequence of the DNA at a single locus** are known as **gene mutation**.
* Large scale mutations resulting from a **change in the number or structure of chromosomes** is known as **chromosomal mutation** or **chromosomal aberration**.

Figure 1.1: A summary of genetic mutations.

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:5]

#### Base Pair Substitution

* Base pair substitution is the **replacement** of one nucleotide pair with another pair of nucleotides.
* Possible outcomes of a single base pair substitution in exons :

* Substitution may result in a **silent mutation** (Fig. 2.2).
* As the **genetic code** is **degenerate**, mutations in DNA triplets lead to changes in mRNA **codon** with a different 3rd base**, the altered codon may still code for the **same amino acid**.
* Hence, primary structure of protein remains unchanged (still the same protein).

* Substitution may result in a **silent mutation** (Fig. 2.3).
* The different amino acid may have **different properties** from the original amino acid.
* **Tertiary structure** of a protein is **altered** leading to altered activity.
* The protein may become **more active** or **less active** or **non-functional**.
* In the case of an enzyme, the active site might be altered and unable to bind substrate effectively.

* Substitution may result in a **premature STOP codon** (UGA, UAG, UAA).
* Translation terminates prematurely and the polypeptide will be shorter than normal (a **truncated protein** results).

### Non-cancerous Genetic Disorders caused by Gene Mutations

#### Sickle Cell Anemia

* The mutated version of the allele is produced by a **single-base substitution** mutation in the \(\beta\)**-globin gene** (located on chromosome 11) which codes for the beta chain of haemoglobin. The 17th nucleotide of the gene is changed from '**A' to 'T'** on the **non-template DNA strand** resulting in a change from a 5' GAG 3' to a 5' GTG 3'. **NOTE**: 1) State the direction that transcription proceeds in: **5' to 3'** 2) The **DNA template strand** is read from > 3' to 5' direction** (so that a 5' to 3' complementary mRNA can be synthesised). 3) Therefore, a change from 5' GAG 3' to 5' GTG 3' on the non-template DNA strand means > **change from 3' CTC 5' to 3' CAC 5' on the DNA template strand** (Fig 8).
* This changes the **mRNA codon*
* from 5' GAG 3' to 5'GUG 3', resulting in the 6th amino acid of the chain being changed from **glutamic acid*
* (charged, hence hydrophilic) **to valine*
* (hydrophobic) (Fig 8). The mutant haemoglobin produced is known as **Haemoglobin S*
* This substitution of one single base in the beta globin gene alters the tertiary and quaternary structure of haemoglobin, which has a profound influence on the physiology and wellbeing of the individual.

Figure 8: A single base substitution results in a mutant allele for sickle-cell \(\beta\)-globin.

Normal red blood cells are bi-concave in shape (Fig. 2.10A). They move easily through the blood vessels.

#### Abnormal Sickle cells

* The hydrophobic R group of valine inserts into the hydrophobic pocket of another \(\beta\)-globin, causing the HbS to **crystalline** to form **long fibres** at low oxygen concentration (Fig. 2.9).
* The fibrous HbS protein cause the RBC to assume a sickle or crescent shape (Fig. 2.10B).
* Sickle-shaped cells do not move easily through the blood vessels. They are stiff and sticky and tend to **form clumps** and get stuck in the blood vessels (Fig. 2.10B).
* The clumps of sickle cells **obstruct blood flow** in the blood vessels that lead to the limbs and organs. Blocked blood vessels can cause pain, serious infections, and organ damage.
* In addition, the sickle cells rupture easily, resulting in severe anemia. Victims usually suffer an early death.
* Note that the sickle-cell \(\beta\)-globin allele is usually passed down from parent to offspring.

Figure 2.10: Red blood cells in both (A) healthy and (B) sickle cell anemic patients.

Figure 2.9: The different in protein folding between normal haemoglobin and HbS.

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:11]

* This disease results from a number of different mutations in the CFTR gene. Some of the more common mutations include: (1) **Deletion of a DNA triplet** resulting in the **deletion of the amino acid phenylalanine at position 508**. (2) A **substitution mutation at position 551** resulting in an **aspartic acid being substituted for a glutamic acid**. (3) A **mutation at position 542** resulting in a **stop codon instead of one that codes for glycine and hence a truncated protein. (4) Other mutations at the splice sites of introns (non-coding regions of a gene).
* Cystic fibrosis exerts its effects in several ways: (1) **Lungs** \(\circ\) The thick mucus **blocks the airways**. \(\circ\) The build-up of mucus makes it **easy for bacteria to grow**. This leads to repeated, serious lung **infections**. Over time, these infections can severely damage the lungs. (2) **Pancreas and the digestive system** \(\circ\) The thick, sticky mucus also **block tubes, or ducts,** in the **pancreas**. \(\circ\) The **digestive enzymes that the pancreas makes cannot reach the intestine** \(\circ\) These enzymes help break down the food. Without them, digestion of **fats and proteins is ineffective**. This can **cause vitamin deficiency and malnutrition** because nutrients leave the body unused. \(\circ\) It also can cause bulky stools, intestinal gas, a swollen belly from severe constipation, and pain or discomfort
3. **Water balance** \(\circ\) Sweat becomes very salty. As a result, the body **loses large amounts of salt** during perspiration. This can upset the balance of minerals in the blood and cause a number of health problems. \(\circ\) Examples include **dehydration** increased heart rate, tiredness, weakness, decreased blood pressure and heat stroke.
4. **Infertility** \(\circ\) Infertility in men. \(\circ\) Blocked fallopian tubes in women.

### 2.3 BNA repair

* Damages or changes to DNA may occur as a result of exposure to physical and chemical agents, e.g. reactive chemicals, carcinogenic substances, radioactive emissions, X-rays or UV light.
* DNA polymerase proofreads and repairs DNA by excising damaged DNA (Fig. 2.13).
* **Excision repair** includes cutting out the damaged segment, fill in resulting gap with properly paired nucleotides using the intact strand as a template.
* Xeroderma pigmentosum, a rare hereditary defect of an enzyme that repairs UV-induced DNA damage, results in extreme sensitivity to sunlight and a tendency to develop skin cancer.
* A failure to correct mutations may lead to the creation of new alleles that can be passed onto offspring if the mutations occur in the germ-line cells.

Figure 2.13: Mechanism of DNA repair

## 3 Chromosomal Aberrations

There are two main categories of chromosomal aberrations (mutations): **changes in chromosome numbers** and **changes in chromosome structure**.

### Chromosome Aberrations (Numerical)

Chromosomal aberrations can result in **aneuploid** or **polyloid** organisms.

Changes in the number of chromosomes usually occur as the result of errors **during meiosis** but they can also occur **during mitosis** after fertilisation.

#### 3.1.1 Aneuploidy

As a result of **nondisjunction** (failure of chromosome to separate) (_Fig. 3.1_) during meiosis, the gametes produced could have either an extra chromosome (n + 1) or a missing chromosome (n - 1).

During fertilization, fusion of an aberrant gamete with a normal haploid gamete produces a zygote with an odd number of chromosomes.

The resultant offspring is an aneuploid. The offspring could be **trisomic** [having 3 copies of chromosome (2n+1)] or **monosomic** [having only a single copy of chromosome (2n-1)].

Figure 3.1: Nondisjunction can occur in **(a)** meiosis I or **(b)** meiosis II.

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:19]

#### 3.2.2 Duplication

* Duplication occurs when additional set(s) of genes **replicate** (Fig. 3.9).
* The additional region of genes may be incorporated within the chromosome or at one end of the chromosome, or become attached to another chromosome.
* Duplication may affect phenotype by altering gene dosage. For example, the amount of proteins synthesised is often proportional to the number of gene copies present, hence extra genes can lead to excess proteins. As most embryonic developmental processes are heavily dependent on carefully balanced levels of proteins, duplications resulting in extra gene copies can lead to developmental defects.

#### Case study: _Drosophila_ Bar eye mutation (FYI only)

* The Bar phenotype in _Drosophila melanogaster_ results from an X-linked duplication (Fig. 3.10).
* In (a) Wild-type fruit flies have normal-size eyes. In (b) Flies heterozygous and (c) homozygous for the Bar mutation have smaller, bar-shaped eyes.
* In (d) Flies with three copies of the duplication have much smaller bar-shaped eyes.

Figure 3.10: The Bar phenotype in _Drosophila melanogaster_ is the result of X-linked duplication.

Figure 3.9: Chromosomal duplication can occur a few times, resulting in multiple copies of the gene(s).

#### Inversion

* Occurs when a region of the chromosome **breaks off** and **rotates through 180\({}^{\circ}\)** before **rejoining** back the chromosome (Fig. 3.11).
* Does not involve a loss of genetic information, but simply rearranges the linear gene sequence.
* If the expression of the gene is altered as a result of its relocation, a change in phenotype may result.

#### Case Study: Eye colour in _Drosophila_ (FYI only)

* Wild-type flies with a normal _white_ gene have red eyes. If the _white_ gene is inactivated by a mutation, the eyes become white (hence the name of the gene).
* In flies with a chromosomal inversion that moves the _white_ gene near a heterochromatic (transcriptionally inactive) region (Fig. 3.12), the eyes are mottled, with red and white patches. The white patches represent cells where the _white_ gene is silenced and red patches represent cells that express the _white_ gene.
* The difference is thought to arise from variations in how far along the chromosome the heterochromatin signals early in eye development. Once established, the state of _white_ expression is heritable, producing patches of many cells that express _white_ as well as patches of cells where _white_ is silenced.

Figure 3.11: Chromosomal inversion changes the sequence of genes.

Figure 3.12: Example of chromosomal mutation in _Drosophila_.

#### Translocation

* **Non-reciprocal translocation** occurs when a segment of chromosome **breaks** and **rejoins** either to the other end of the **same chromosome** (Fig. 3.13a) or **another non-homologous chromosome** (Fig. 3.13b).
* **Reciprocal translocation** occurs when **two non-homologous chromosomes break** and **exchange fragments** (Fig. 3.13c).
* This is similar to inversion in that it does not involve a loss of genetic information, but there is a rearrangement of existing genes.
* If the expression of the gene is altered as a result of its relocation, a change in phenotype may result.

Case study: Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia (FYI only)
* In CML, there is an exchange of gene segments between chromosome 9 and 22 (Fig. 3.14). CML patients are characterised by unregulated growth of white blood cells, leading to unusually high number of such cells in the bone marrow and blood.

Figure 3.14: Example of chromosomal translocation (CML).

Figure 3.13: (a) Non-reciprocal translocation within the same chromosome. (b) Non-reciprocal translocation to another chromosome. (c) Reciprocal translocation.

#### Summary of Chromosomal Aberrations (Structure)

Deletion and translocation are especially likely to occur together during meiosis, resulting in one chromosome with a deleted segment and the other gaining the segment.

Possible consequences of the above four types of chromosomal aberrations include:

**(1)** A diploid embryo that has a large deletion in its chromosome structure would have lost a number of essential genes; this condition is normally lethal.

**(2)** In animals/humans, inversion, duplication and translocation tend to have harmful effects, which may lead to tumour growth (_refer to section 4_).

Previously distant genes (i.e. Gene A and Gene B located at different locus on the same chromosome or located at different chromosomes) may now fuse with each other to produce a new gene (Fusion Gene A-B), which will alter the phenotype by either producing a new protein or a change in gene expression.

## 4 The Development of Cancer as a Result of Mutations

### 4.1 Introduction to Cancer

* Cancer is a set of diseases in which **cells escape** from normal regulation of cell division, resulting in **uncontrolled cell division**.
* Characteristics of Cancer Cells
* They exhibit excessive, **uncontrolled cell division*
* They do not undergo **apoptosis*
* (programmed cell death when damages occur to its DNA)
* They **remain undifferentiated*
* They stimulate growth of blood vessels towards themselves (**angiogenesis**)
* They **do not exhibit contact inhibition*
* They spread to other parts of the body via circulatory system to form secondary tumours (**metastasis**)
* **Normal Cell*
* & **Cancer cell*
* **Require external growth factors*
* to divide. **Divide independently*
* of growth factors. Does not behave as part of a tissue
* **Show contact inhibition**, stop dividing **when*
* in contact with other cells (e.g. gap of wound is filled) & **Lost this ability**, hence form large mass of cells called tumour
* **Ages and die**. Replaced by new cells in an **Immortal**. **Cancerous cells may divide indefinitely as telomerase is activated No apoptosis*
* \\ \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 1: Differences between a normal cell and cancer cell.

### Control of Eukaryotic Cell Cycle

* In **normal** eukaryotic cell cycle, cells divide when required for growth and for replacement in a **controlled way**.
* The cell cycle is regulated by a molecular control system involving a set of **signalling molecules** in cell that **coordinates the cell cycle**.
* These molecules (e.g. proteins) regulate the cell cycle at various **checkpoints** to ensure normal cell cycle (Fig. 4.1).
* To minimise mistakes in cell cycle events, the cell cycle progress is monitored at 3 key checkpoints:
* G\({}_{1}\) checkpoint
* G\({}_{2}\) checkpoint
* M phase checkpoint
* Control mechanisms that operate at these checkpoints ensure that damaged DNA is repaired before proceeding to next stage and that each stage of the cell cycle is completed before the following stage is initiated.
* There are two types of genes are involved in the **normal regulation of cell division** at the various checkpoints: (1) **Proto-oncogenes** are **normal genes** that code for **proteins** that **stimulate normal cell growth** and **division** (likened to the accelerator of a car). (2) **Tumour suppressor genes** play a critical role in regulating when cells are allowed to divide and increase in number. They are **normal genes** that code for **proteins** that **prevent uncontrolled cell division** (likened to be the brakes of a car). E.g. the p53 protein, a tumour suppressor protein, halts the cell cycle by arresting cells with damaged DNA at the G\({}_{1}\) phase.

Figure 4.1: Checkpoints in the regulation of cell cycle

### 4.3 The Role of Mutations in the Development of Cancer

* Cancer cells can arise from:
* in **proto-oncogenes*
* and **tumour-suppressor genes**;
* of the **telomerase gene*
* (_details in Topic 8_). This removes a natural limit on the number of times the cell can divide.
* Mutations in proto-oncogenes and tumour-suppressor genes can cause cell to bypass cell cycle checkpoints. This will cause **dysregulation of cell cycle checkpoints**, resulting in cells dividing uncontrollably. Further **accumulation of mutations in this cell** results in formation of cancer cell.
* A cell is **most susceptible to mutations** when it is **replicating its DNA** during the **S phase** of the cell cycle. High rate of mitosis increases the number of times cells replicate, hence increasing the likelihood of mutation.

### 4.4 Gain-of-Function Mutations in Proto-oncogenes

* **Gain-of-function mutations*
* lead to the production of
* **Excessive amount*
* of proteins due to **increased transcription*
* that eventually leads to increase in translation (protein synthesis).
* proteins due to changes to the 3D conformation of the protein that confer abnormally high activity.
* When a proto-oncogene undergoes a genetic change that leads to an **increase** either in the **amount** of the proto-oncogene's protein product or in the **activity** of each protein molecule, there is **over-stimulation of the cell cycle** / **uncontrolled cell division** that leads to **cancer**.
* The **proto-oncogene** is said to have **mutated to become an oncogene.**
* This type of mutation is known as **gain-of-function mutation** as the mutated allele is more active than the normal allele. (Fig. 4.2).

* Most oncogenes are **dominant alleles.**
* Mutation in just **one of the two** proto-oncogene alleles would be sufficient in producing excess proteins or hyperactive protein to induce cancer.

Figure 4.2: Gain-of-function mutation in proto-oncogene produces oncogene which stimulates the cell to undergo excessive cell division.

The genetic changes that convert a proto-oncogene to an oncogene falls into three main categories:

* **Point mutations in the proto-oncogene itself OR a control element*
* (Fig. 4.3).
* A point mutation in the proto-oncogene results in a **hyperactive protein*
* than the normal protein (Fig. 4.3a) due to changes in its 3D conformation. Example: point mutation of _R_as gene in colorectal cancer.
* A point mutation occurs in the **promoter*
* or **enhancer*
* (details in Topic 8) that controls a proto-oncogene. This makes the altered promoter or enhancer **binds to transcription factors more strongly**, leading to an increase in expression of the proto-oncogene (Fig. 4.3b).
* **Fig. 4.3a: A point mutation in a proto-oncogene results in the production of a hyperactive protein.**

## 2 Amplification of a proto-oncogene

* **Increase the number of copies of the proto-oncogene in the cell through repeated gene duplication** leads to excessive amount of the encoded protein in the cell (Fig. 4.4).

## 3 Chromosomal translocation within the genome

* Translocation involves a region of a chromosome breaking off and re-joining either to the same chromosome or another non-homologous chromosome (Fig. 4.5).
* A proto-oncogene may be **translocated** downstream of an **active promoter** or other **control elements**, resulting in **increased rate of transcription and translation of the protein that stimulates cell division**.

* Note that for amplification of proto-oncogene and chromosomal translocation of proto-oncogene downstream of an active promoter, the resulted oncogene protein structure is identical to the normal proto-oncogene protein (i.e. the protein is not hyperactive). The oncogenic effect is due to the **excessive amount of protein produced**.

Figure 4.4: Amplification of a proto-oncogene results in the production of more proteins.

Figure 4.5: Chromosomal translocation of an active promoter results in an increased rate of protein synthesis.

### Example of proto-oncogene: _Ras_ gene

* The **Ras protein** is a component of a signal-transduction pathway (_details in Topic 12: Communication and Equilibrium in Multicellular Organisms_) which eventually activates a protein that stimulates cell cycle to promote growth in the organism. **Signal Transduction Pathway**: A series of chemical reactions in the cell that convey signals from the external environment of the cell to the DNA in the nucleus.
* Ras protein is a G-protein that relays a growth signal from a growth factor receptor to a cascade of protein kinases.
* At the end of the pathway is the synthesis of a protein that stimulates the cell cycle (Fig. 4.7).

Figure 4.7: Cell cycle-stimulating pathway – The signal transduction pathway relays the signal from the growth factor from outside the cell to the DNA in the nucleus to start transcription.

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:31]

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:32]

* Loss-of-function mutations in tumour suppressor genes can occur in various ways: 1. Mutations in **promoters or control elements*
* lead to down-regulation (decreased expression) of tumour suppressor gene expression. 2. Mutations within tumour suppressor gene may have one of the three following consequences:
* **No protein produced**.
* Production of protein that binds to its substrate with **decreased affinity**.
* Production of a **non-functional protein*
* due to loss of protein structure. 3. **Chromatin modifications _(details in Topic 8)_ can inactivate tumour suppressor genes
* Many tumour cells expressed high level of histone deacetylase (HDAC) that **deacetylates histones*
* and increases the positive charge on the histone protein. This results in **DNA coiling tightly around histones**, such that the **tumour suppressor genes*
* are silenced.
* Excessive **histone methylation*
* or packaging of genes as **heterochromatin*
* will also effectively shut down gene expression of tumour suppressor genes.

### Example of tumour suppressor gene: _p53_ gene

* The _p53_ gene codes for the **p53 protein**. The normal p53 protein functions at crucial **cell-cycle checkpoints** (mainly **checkpoint G1**), to stop the cell cycle when damage to DNA is detected.
* The normal p53 protein is an **activator** which initiates transcription of the following 3 types of genes: 1. _p21_ gene, whose protein product, **p21 protein** (a cyclin-kinase inhibitor), binds to cyclin-dependent kinases protein, and hence, **halts the cell cycle**. This allows time for the cell to repair the DNA (Fig. 4.11). 2. **DNA repair genes**: e.g. _p53R2_ gene, whose protein repairs damaged DNA. 3. **"Suicide genes"** whose protein products cause cell death by **apoptosis** (programmed cell death) when DNA damage is irreparable.

Figure 4.11: Cell cycle inhibiting pathway: The signal transduction pathway that activates p53 protein to initiates transcription of a protein that inhibits the cell cycle

* The p53 protein itself **is also directly involved in DNA repair** by interacting with DNA polymerase in base excision repair.
* **Cell cycle inhibiting pathway** (Fig. 4.11): 1. **DNA damage** acts as a signal that is passed via 2. **protein kinases**. 3. This leads to **activation of p53 protein**. Activated _p53_ promotes **transcription of the gene** which codes for a **protein** eg p21 protein that **inhibits the cell cycle.** The resulting suppression of cell division ensures that the **damaged DNA is not replicated**. If the DNA damage is irreparable, the p53 signal leads to programmed cell death (apoptosis).

### Case study: Retinoblastoma (FY1 only)

* Retinoblastoma is a cancerous tumour of the retina that developed in early childhood.
* Caused by the **loss-of-function mutation** of the _Rb_ gene (a **tumour suppressor gene**).
* Condition is marked by a deletion of a segment of DNA sequence on chromosome 13.
* A mutation on both alleles of the gene results in a cell that produces non-functional _Rb_ protein.
* _Rb_ protein prevents mitosis by blocking cells from entering S phase of the cell cycle.
* There are two forms of retinoblastoma (Fig. 4.12): 1. Hereditary Retinoblastoma
* Occurs when fetus inherits one of the parents' chromosome 13 that has its _Rb_ locus deleted.
* Hence, all cells in the body lack one of the two functional copies of the _Rb_ tumour suppressor gene.
* Loss or inactivation of the remaining copy by a somatic mutation in any retinal cell removes the inhibition provided by the Rb protein and the affected cell grows into a tumour.
2. Non-hereditary Retinoblastoma * Both inherited _Rb_ genes are normal * A single retinal cell must have both copies of the gene lost or inactivated by a somatic mutation (often deletion) in order to develop into a tumour. * Occurrence of such tumour is rare. (1 in 30,000).

Figure 4.12: Genetic mechanisms underlying retinoblastoma.

### The Development of Cancer as a Multi-step Process

* The eventual development of cancer in an individual does not result from a single mutation in a cell. A **single cell** needs to **accumulate mutations** (Fig. 4.13) in both tumour suppressor genes and proto-oncogenes to become a cancer cell.

* As mutation can occur throughout one's lifetime, the **chances of cancer development increases with increasing age** (Fig. 4.14).

* An individual that **inherits** an oncogene or a mutant allele of a tumour-suppressor gene from their parents will be one step closer to accumulating the necessary mutations for cancer development. He is said to be **predisposed to cancer**.

Figure 4.13: Accumulation of mutationsCase Study: Colorectal Cancer (FY1 only)
* Colorectal cancer illustrates a multi-step process of cancer development (Fig. 4.15, 4.16 and 4.17).
* The first sign is often **formation of polyps**, small benign growths in the colon lining with fast dividing cells.
* Through gradual **accumulation of mutations** that **activates oncogenes** (e.g. **mutant _Ras_ gene) and **knock-out tumour-suppressor genes** (e.g. _p53_ gene), the **polyp can develop into a malignant tumour**.
* These usually include the **appearance of at least one active oncogene** and the **mutation or loss of several tumour-suppressor genes**.
* Since mutant **tumour-suppressor alleles** are usually **recessive**, **mutations must occur in _both_ alleles**.
* As tumour suppressor genes (e.g. _p53_ gene) usually code for proteins that control the cell cycle and DNA repair, mutations in the tumour suppressor alleles would result in the cell being unable to repair damaged DNA. This will lead to **accumulation** of mutations over time.
* Most oncogenes behave as **dominant alleles**, hence the **mutation of one of two copies** of the gene would **contribute** to the development of cancer.
* As oncogenes generally result in the production of **hyperactive proteins**, such mutations would cause an increase in the rate of cell division.
* In the early phases of multi-step tumour progression, cancer cells multiply and form a **primary tumour** mass.

### Factors that Increase the Chances of Cancer

* Causative factors that could increase the **chances of mutations** leading to cancer include: 1. Exposure to chemical **carcinogens** (chemicals that cause cancer) e.g. ethidium bromide, benzo(a)pyrene in cigarette smoke, sodium nitrite in preserved food, etc.
2. Exposure to excessive **ionizing radiation and UV radiation.** * Ionizing radiation includes cosmic radiation (from outer space), radioactive fallout, radon gas, x-rays, gamma-rays, etc. * UV radiation from the sun.
3. Agents that cause **inflammation,** which generates **DNA-damaging oxidizing agents** in the cell.
4. Infection by certain **viruses and bacteria** * Hepatitis B and C are closely associated with liver cancer, * Human papillomavirus is associated with cervical cancer, * Human Immunodeficiency virus (HIV), the virus that causes AIDS. People who have HIV infection are at greater risk of cancer such as lymphoma and a rare cancer called Kaposi sarcoma. * Epstein barr virus is associated with Burkitt's lymphoma and nasopharyngeal carcinoma. * Helicobacter _pyloris_, a bacterium that causes stomach ulcers. It also can cause stomach cancer and lymphoma in the stomach lining * Viruses promote cancer development by * integrating viral DNA or viral oncogene into the DNA of infected cells, * insertion of viral DNA may disrupt a tumour-suppressor gene or convert a proto-oncogene to an oncogene.
* Other factors contributing to cancer include
5. **Age** * **A cell** usually **needs to accumulate mutations** in both tumour suppressor genes and proto-oncogenes **to become a cancer cell**. More than one somatic mutation is generally required to produce all the changes characteristic of a full-fledged cancer cell. As cancer results from an accumulation of mutations, and if mutations occur throughout one's life, then the longer we live, the more likely we are to develop cancer.
6. **Inherited predisposition** * If an oncogene or a mutated tumour suppressor gene is already present in the sperm of the father or egg of the mother, this genetic damage can be passed on to their children. * An individual inheriting an oncogene or a mutant allele of a tumour suppressor gene is one step closer to accumulating the necessary mutations for cancer to develop than is an individual without any such mutations.
7. **Loss of immunity** * As immunity decreases, the likelihood of cancerous growths and metastasis increases. An experiment discovered that mice with T cell deficiency died sooner than control mice that were not immunocompromised after tumours were introduced.
