Annex 1

Annex 2The Periodic Table

Dmitri Mendeleev's Periodic Table, first published in 1869, which arranged elements according to **atomic mass**, was widely accepted. It was able to predict the properties of five undiscovered elements and their compounds, which provided proof of his periodic table.

The elements had been listed and carefully arranged before Mendeleev did his. They had even been organized by similar properties before.

So why is Mendeleev's periodic table the one that has endured? This was because Mendeleev correctly predicted "eka-aluminum", an element yet to be discovered in his time, until years later. All these simply from where he suspected/expected this new element was to be located on his version of the Periodic Table.

Today, there are 118 elements in the Periodic Table. Elements 113, 115, 117 and 118 newly added completing the Periodic Table. These elements were given the names ninonium (Nh), moscovium (Mc), tennessine (Ts) and oganesson (Og) respectively, officially in November 2016 by IUPAC.

A quick glance at the table shows a trend of elements in their respective groups such as electrical conductivity and reactivity. These trends, or **periodicity**, is the focus of this whole topic.

**Definition**

Periodicity refers to the **repeating pattern of chemical and physical properties that is seen at regular intervals**

Elements are arranged in order of **increasing atomic (proton) number**.

The properties of the elements are a periodic (i.e. **repeating after a regular interval**) function of their atomic numbers.

The Periodic Table can be segregated into **4 main blocks (s, p, d, f)**, named according to the valence orbital of the elements at ground state level (i.e. when the electrons are not excited).

**Classification of Elements in the Periodic Table:**

_(Refer to the Periodic Table on page 6.)_

_Main group elements_

* Elements in Groups 1 and 2: **s-block elements**
* Elements in Groups 13 to 18: **p-block elements**

_Transition elements_
* Elements in Groups 3 to 12: **d-block elements**
* 71 & 90
- 103: **f-block elements**.

_Groups_ refer to the vertical columns of elements in the Periodic Table.

* For Main Group elements, Group number = number of valence electrons (e.g. Group 13 = 3 valence electrons)
* For Transition elements, Group number = number of valence electrons in the outermost s and d subshells (e.g. Group 3 = 3 valence electrons in the 3d and 4s subshells)
* Elements in the same group have the **same outermost electronic configurations** in their atoms.
* Hence, they have **similar chemical properties**.

_Periods_ refer to the horizontal rows of elements in the Periodic Table.

* Period number = principal quantum number (n) of the valence electrons
* Elements within the same period have the **same number of quantum shells**.

**Comparison of Atomic Radius and Ionic Radius**

From the Data Booklet,

Cationic radius is smaller _than_ atomic radius.

\(\bullet\) **Nuclear charge** remains the **same**.

\(\bullet\) **The cation has **one principal quantum shell lesser** than the atom.

\(\bullet\) **The valence electrons in the cation are closer to the nucleus and less shielded** from the nucleus.

\(\bullet\) **There are stronger (electrostatic) forces of attraction** between the nucleus and the valence electrons in cation.

\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|c|} \hline

Anionic radius is larger than atomic radius.

\(\bullet\) **Nuclear charge** remains the **same**.

\(\bullet\) **The anion has more electrons than the atom.

\(\bullet\) **Inter- electronic repulsion increases**. resulting in the valence electrons in being further away from the nucleus.

\(\bullet\) **There are weaker (electrostatic) forces of attraction** between the nucleus and the valence electrons in anion.

## Good to know:

### Let's find out why is the radius of Ar left out in the comparison for atomic radius?

There are three different measurements for atomic radius.

1. Metallic radius

2. Covalent radius

3. Van der Waals' radius

These measurements can be found in _Table 5 of the Data Booklet._ Radii of atoms can be different using different measurements. Covalent radius of the atom is smaller than its Van der Waals' radius for the same atom.

For noble gases, we tend to refer their radius as the van der Waals' radius. Noble gases exist in monoatomic form and we refer to their radius as the distance between the nuclei of 2 atoms. The proximity of the atoms is **not as great as in metals** as there is a large space in between the atoms, due to the presence of weak Van der Waals forces that attracts the atoms together.

(Note: Van der Waals forces are similar to instantaneous dipole-induced dipole attractions. However, do not use the term 'Van der Waals forces' in examination.)

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:11]

**(3) Anomalies across the period**

The first I.E of S (1000 kJ mol\({}^{-1}\)) is **lower** than that of P (1060 kJ mol\({}^{-1}\)).

P : 1s\({}^{2}\) 2s\({}^{2}\) 2p\({}^{6}\) 3s\({}^{2}\) **3p\({}^{3}\)**

S : 1s\({}^{2}\) 2s\({}^{2}\) 2p\({}^{6}\) 3s\({}^{2}\) **3p\({}^{4}\)**

* The **3p electron** to be removed from S is a **paired electron** while that to be removed from P is an ** unpaired electron**.
* Due to **inter-electronic repulsion** between paired electrons in the same orbital, **less energy** is required to remove the 3p electron from S.
* Hence the first ionisation energy of S is **lower** than that of P.

**(4) Down the group**

* **Nuclear charge increases**
* The number of filled principal quantum shells **increases**.
* The valence electrons are **further** from the nucleus and **more shielded**.
* **Less energy** is required to overcome the **weaker** (electrostatic) **forces of attraction** between the nucleus and the valence electron to be removed.
* First ionisation energies **decrease** down the group.

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:13]

**Diagonal Relationship (IMPORTANT)**

* The **head element (Li, Be, B)** of each group may **resemble** the elements positioned **diagonally** to it, **both physically and chemically.**
* Due to _increase in electronegativity across the period but decrease down the group_, the elements diagonal to each other can have **similar electronegativity** giving rise to similar properties.

### Electrical Conductivity of Period 3 Elements (SDL)

Electrical Conductivity

Electrical conductivity increases across the period among the metals

Giant metallic structure

Presence of sea of delocalised electrons as mobile charge carriers to conduct electricity under the influence of an electric current/ field.

Explanation Electrical conductivity increases across the period among the metals

Number of valence electrons contributed per atom for metallic bonding increases across the period among the metals for delocalisation.

More mobile electrons can act as charge carriers.

Electrical conductivity

Si is a semiconductor which can only give rise to delocalised electrons at high temperatures

Giant molecular structure

Strong covalent bonds exist between atoms in a giant molecular structure

At higher temperatures, more electrons gain enough energy to overcome the nuclear attraction and electrical conductivity increases

Electrical conductivity

Non-conductors of electricity

Simple molecular structure

Absence of delocalised electrons or free mobile ions as mobile charge carriers

in their molecular structures.

## 3 Chemical properties of period 3 elements and their compounds

* The presence of 3d subshell in the valence shell of Period 3 elements enables Group 15 to 17 elements (P, S and C/I) to expand their octet structures by excitation of valence electrons into **energetically accessible and available 3d orbitals.** Example: **PCI\({}_{3}\)** P: **PCI\({}_{3}\)** P: **PCI\({}_{1}\)** 3s** 3p** 3d** 3s** 3s** 3p** 3d** 3s** 3p** 3d** 3s** 3p** 3d**
* The **maximum oxidation number** that the elements in Period 3 can attain has the **same numerical value** as their unit digit of the **group number**, which also corresponds to the number of valence electrons in the outermost principal quantum shell.
* Due to the _increasing electronegativity_ across the Period, the structure of oxides and chlorides formed across the period changes from **giant ionic lattice structure to simple molecules**. The different structures of these compounds affect the type of bonding which in turn affect their physical and chemical properties. This will be covered in subsequent sections.

**IMPORTANT:**

Students must be able to write balanced chemical equations for all the reactions covered.

**Ability to write the chemical equations for all reactions discussed in this topic is critical.** However, many students find it challenging to memorise the many chemical equations. Students can use the following concepts to help them memorise or balance these equations.

(1) Identify the reaction types e.g. neutralisation, combustion, oxidation.

(2) Identify the products formed in the reaction based on the type of reaction.

(3) For some aqueous systems, **AOHE** can be used to balance the equations.

Example:

How to write the chemical equation for reaction of **P_o_1e in NaOH?

Identify the type of reaction

Neutralisation

Identify the product.

Since this is neutralisation, salt and water are formed. Since this is not a redox reaction, there is no change in the oxidation number of P, i.e. +5 in both reactant and product as well.

Write the reactant and product in

We can identify PO_4_3_- as the product instead of PO_3_-.

Note: Chlorides of sulfur is not in the syllabus.

* The **maximum oxidation number** that the elements in Period 3 can attain has the **same numerical value** as their unit digit of the **group number**, which also corresponds to the number of valence electrons in the outermost principal quantum shell.

**Oxidation States**

Elements in Groups 15 to 16 can also exhibit multiple oxidation states because they can expand their octet structures by excitation of valence electrons into _energetically accessible and available 3d orbitals._

**Why are the oxidation states of Period 3 elements in their chlorides always positive? Solution**: Chorine is more electronegative than all the period 3 elements.

When chlorides interact with water, _hydration_ and _hydrolysis_ may take place.

**Metallic chlorides in water**

## 4 The Group 2 Elements

### Introduction

* Group 2 elements (alkaline earth metals) are one of the two groups of \(s\)-block elements. Their outer electrons are in \(s\) orbitals, with a valence shell configuration, **ns2**.
* Group 2 elements are reactive metals. They occur naturally in combination with other elements in mineral deposits and seawater as salts, and are extracted through electrolysis.
* In their pure form, the elements exist as **silvery grey metals** which tarnish readily in air.
* Group 2 elements are all **good reducing agents** and only show **one oxidation state of +2** in their compounds
* Group 2 metals have generally low first and second ionisation energies.
- A small amount of energy is required to remove the two outer \(s\) electrons as they experience weak electrostatic forces of attraction due to shielding effect.
- Subsequent electrons involve the loss of inner shell electrons, which require more energy, hence higher oxidation states are not favourable.
* Most Group 2 compounds are **ionic** (Be is an exception), containing **M2*** ions.
* All Group 2 oxides formed are **white** and have **extremely high melting points**.

### Physical properties of Group 2 elements

* Several physical properties of Group 2 elements and their trends are summarised in Table 1.1

Table 1.1: Physical Properties of Group 2 Metals

### Chemical properties of Group 2 elements

#### 4.3.1 Reducing Power

Group 2 elements are strong reducing agents.

* The reducing power of the metals can be measured by their _standard electrode potential_.

Down the group,

* the standard electrode potential \(E^{0}\) values become less positive,
* the reducing power of the metals increases.
* the metals have higher tendency to be oxidised. (i.e.: The metal atoms lose their valence electrons **more readily**.

Down Group 2, metal atoms lose their valence electrons **more readily** because

* The number of filled principal quantum shells **increases**.
* Valence electrons are **further** and **more shielded** from the nucleus.
* There are **weaker** electrostatic forces of attraction between the nucleus and the valence electrons.

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|} \hline  & \(E^{0}\) / V \\ \hline Be\({}^{2+}\) + 2e \(\rightleftharpoons\) Be & \(-\)1.85 \\ \hline Mg\({}^{2+}\) + 2e \(\rightleftharpoons\) Mg & \(-\)2.38 \\ \hline Ca\({}^{2+}\) + 2e \(\rightleftharpoons\) Ca & \(-\)2.87 \\ \hline Sr\({}^{2+}\) + 2e \(\rightleftharpoons\) Sr & \(-\)2.89 \\ \hline Ba\({}^{2+}\) + 2e \(\rightleftharpoons\) Ba & \(-\)2.90 \\ \hline \end{tabular}

Standard Electrode Potential, \(E^{0}\)

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|} \hline M\({}^{2+}\) + 2e \(\rightleftharpoons\) M & \(E^{0}\) / N \\ \hline In the Data Booklet, half-equations are represented with reversible arrows. \\ - & The **forward** reaction is the **reduction** of M\({}^{2+}\). \\ - & The **backward** reaction is the **oxidation** of M. \\ \end{tabular}

A **positive**\(E^{0}\) value indicates that the **reduction** reaction is predominant. The **more positive** the \(E^{0}\) value,

- & the **greater the tendency** for **reduction of M\({}^{2+}\)** to occur

- & the **stronger** the **oxidising power of M\({}^{2+}\)** \\ \end{tabular}

A **less positive**\(E^{0}\) value indicates that the **oxidation** reaction is predominant. The **less positive** the \(E^{0}\) value,

- & the **greater the tendency** for **oxidation of M** to occur

- & the **stronger** the **reducing power of M** \\ \end{tabular}

_Note: The concept of 'Standard Electrode Potential' was covered in greater details in the topic 'Electrochemistry'._

#### 4.3.2 Thermal Decomposition of Group 2 Carbonates

Group 2 carbonates can be broken down by heating into their oxides and carbon dioxide.

The following table shows the decomposition temperature of the Group 2 carbonates.

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|} \hline
**M** & **Temperature of decomposition / \({}^{\circ}\)C** & **Thermal Stability** \\ \hline Be & 250 & \\ Mg & 540 & \\ Ca & 900 & \\ Sr & 1289 & \\ Ba & 1360 & \\ \hline \end{tabular} From the above table, down **Group 2**:

The **ease** of thermal decomposition of carbonates **decreases**.

Thermal stability of carbonates **increases**.

Explanation:

Down the group,

**ionic radius** of M\({}^{2+}\)**increases** so the **charge density** of the M\({}^{2+}\)**decreases**.

M\({}^{2+}\) becomes less polarising.

The electron cloud of CO\({}_{3}\)\({}^{2-}\) anion is less distorted so the **C-O covalent bond** within the CO\({}_{3}\)\({}^{2-}\) anion is **less weakened** down the group.

**Ease of decomposition decreases** down the group OR

**Thermal stability of carbonates increases** down the group.

2025/ASRJC/Chemistry The Periodic Table (9729)What about the decomposition of Group 2 nitrates?_

2M(NO3)2(s) \(\rightarrow\) 2MO (s) + 4NO2(g) + O2(g)

The argument is exactly the same here. The small positive ions at the top of the Group polarise the nitrate ions (NO3) more than the larger positive ions at the bottom.

Recall

General Terms:

* **Polarisation** is the distortion of electron cloud of an anion by a cation
* **Polarising power** of a cation is its ability to distort the electron cloud of an anion.
* **Polarisability** of an anion is the ease with which its electron cloud gets distorted

For a cation, polarising power \(\propto\) charge density ( = \(\frac{\text{ionic charge}}{\text{ionic radius }}\))

- A small and highly charged cation has a high charge density, hence high polarising power, e.g., Mg2+ ion is more polarising than Ba2+ ion.

For an anion, polarisability depends on its charge and size.

- A large and highly charged anion has a high polarisability as the electron cloud is more diffused (or loosely held).

e.g., CO3- ion is more polarisable than O2- ion.

* **Magnesium oxide** (MgO) is used as a **refractory lining** in **high temperature furnaces** because of its high melting point and low reactivity.
* **Calcium carbonate** (CaCO\({}_{3}\)), also known as **limestone**, is used in **construction materials**.
* The pH of soil affects the ability of crops to absorb nutrients.
- The optimum pH for most crops lies in the range of 6 to 7.
- **Liming** (i.e. the process of adding basic calcium oxide to acidic soil) is employed to **reduce acidity** of soil in order to maximise crop yields.
* **Barium sulfate** (BaSO\({}_{4}\)) is used in **'barium meal' test** in x-ray diagnostic work.

* Down the group, melting / boiling point of the hydrogen halides generally **increases**.

**Explanation:**

* Hydrogen halides have **simple molecular structures**.

* Down the group, the **number of electrons** in the hydrogen halide molecules **increases**.

* **Strength** of **instantaneous dipole-induced dipole attractions** between the hydrogen halide molecules **increases**
* **Larger amount of energy** is required to overcome the **stronger** instantaneous dipole-induced dipole attractions between the hydrogen halide molecules.

Note:

* HF has abnormally high melting and boiling points due to more energy required to overcome the **stronger hydrogen bonding** between HF molecules.

* Down the group, **thermal stability** of the hydrogen halides **decreases**.

**Explanation:**

* Down the group from F to I,

* **Valence orbital** of halogen used in bonding with hydrogen is **bigger** and **more** diffused
* **Overlap of orbitals between the H atom and halogen atom is **less** effective

**Solutions to Checkpoint 4**

**Q1: B**

For group 2 metals

Reducing power **increases** down the group

Ionic radii **increases** down group

Electronegativity **decreases** down the group

Reactivity with water **increases** down the group

**Q2: A**

Similar to Group 2 carbonates, the **ease of thermal decomposition of Group 2 iodates, M(IO\({}_{3}\))\({}_{2}\) decreases** down the group.

**Q3: B**

The thermal stability of Group 17 hydrogen halides is due related to bond energy.

Explanation:

* Down the group of HC\(I\), HBr and HI
* **Valence orbital** used in bonding is **bigger** and **more** diffused
* **Overlap of orbitals** between the H atom and the halogen atom is **less** effective
* **Bond energy**: HC\(I\) > HBr > HI
* **Thermal stability**: HC\(I\) > HBr > > HI

**Q4: B**

Halides are strong reducing agents. The stronger the reducing agent, the more likely it will undergo oxidation.

X\({}^{-}\) is the strongest reducing agent as it is oxidised when it reacted with X\({}_{2}\) and Y\({}_{2}\).

Y\({}^{-}\) is the weakest reducing agent since it has 'no reaction' with all halogens which suggest that it does not undergo oxidation readily.

**Q5: D**

Down Group 17,

1: H-X bond strength decreases (can refer to _Data Booklet_)

2: electronegativity decreases

3: Order of oxidising power of the halogens decreases

\(\text{F}_{2}>\text{C}l_{2}>\text{B}\text{f}_{2}>\text{I}_{2}>\text{A}\text{f} _{2}\)

Hence, At\({}_{2}\) is unable to displace/ oxidised C\(I^{-}\) ion.
