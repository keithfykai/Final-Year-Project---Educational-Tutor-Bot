## 1 Introduction

Reaction kinetics is the study of the rate of chemical reactions. Some aspects that we study include the factors which affect rate of reactions (_e.g._ concentration, temperature, _etc._) and how the reactions occur (_e.g._ if the reaction involves only one step or multiple steps, what bonds are broken or formed during the reaction, the molecularity of each of the steps (i.e. whether the reaction is unimolecular or bimolecular), the activation energy barrier _etc._).

LO **(a)** explain and use the terms: _rate of reaction_

### _Rate of Reaction_

_The **rate of reaction** is defined as the **change in concentration of a reactant or product per unit time**.

\(\frac{\text{change in concentration of a reactant or product}}{\text{time}}\)

units: mol dm\({}^{-3}\) s\({}^{-1}\) (or mol dm\({}^{-3}\) min\({}^{-1}\) or mol dm\({}^{-3}\) h\({}^{-1}\))

By convention, rate is a **positive quantity**.

Consider the reaction: a**A** + b**B** \(\rightarrow\)**cC** where \(a\), \(b\) and \(c\) are stoichiometric coefficients of the balance chemical equation. The rate of reaction is given by:

\[\text{rate}=-\frac{1}{a}\frac{\text{d}\left[\textbf{A}\right]}{\text{d}t}=- \frac{1}{b}\frac{\text{d}\left[\textbf{B}\right]}{\text{d}t}=\frac{1}{c}\frac{ \text{d}\left[\textbf{C}\right]}{\text{d}t}\]

_i.e._\(\frac{\textbf{1}}{\textbf{a}}\times\text{rate of consumption of }\textbf{A}=\frac{\textbf{1}}{\textbf{b}}\times\text{rate of consumption of }\textbf{B}=\frac{\textbf{1}}{\textbf{c}}\times\text{rate of formation of }\textbf{C}\).

It is necessary to divide the rate of reaction with respect to the reactants or products by the respective coefficient _i.e._\(a\), \(b\) and \(c\) in the balanced equation to ensure that **the numerical value of reaction rate is the same** regardless of the choice of species used as reference.

The negative sign is included before the reactant concentrations to convert the negative change in reactant concentration to a positive value for the rate (since the change in reactant concentration is always negative as the reaction proceeds).

### Expressing Rate of Reaction

Based on the definition, we should be able to determine the rate of reaction from a graph of concentration-versus-time.

Reaction Kinetics

Introduction

The **average rate** of a reaction during a specified time interval is the change in concentration of a reactant or a product over that time interval.

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|} \hline \hline \multicolumn{1}{|c|}{average rate between \(t_{\text{i}}\) and \(t_{\text{2}}\)} & \multicolumn{1}{|c|}{average rate between \(t_{\text{i}}\) and \(t_{\text{2}}\)} & \multicolumn{1}{|c|}{average rate between \(t_{\text{i}}\) and \(t_{\text{2}}\)} \\ \(=-\frac{\Delta[\text{reactant}]}{\Delta t}\) & \(=\frac{\Delta[\text{product}]}{\Delta t}\) & \(\Delta[\text{product}]\) \\ \(=-\)gradient of straight line & \(=\) gradient of straight line & \\ joining points at \(t_{\text{i}}\) and \(t_{\text{2}}\) & joining points at \(t_{\text{i}}\) and \(t_{\text{2}}\) & \\ \(=\frac{y}{x}\) & \(=\frac{y}{x}\) & \\ \hline \end{tabular}

### Initial rate

The **initial rate** of a reaction is the instantaneous rate at time t = 0.

It is the instantaneous rate **at the start of the reaction**, when an infinitesimally small amount of the reactant has been used up.

Reaction Kinetics

In practice, the **initial rate can be approximated by the average rate** provided

1) the time interval is small enough, such that at most

 - 10% of the reactants had reacted, _or_

 - 10% of the eventual products had been formed.

2) the time interval starts from \(t=0\) (since this is initial rate).

Example:

* The initial rate is given by the gradient of the tangent to the curve at \(t=0\).
* The _average rate_ between 0 and \(t_{i}\), where the reaction is 10% completed, approximates the _initial rate_, _i.e._ \[\text{average rate between 0 and }t_{i}=\frac{\Delta[\text{product}]}{\Delta t}= \frac{0.1[\textbf{P}]_{\text{c}}}{t_{i}}\] \[\approx\frac{d[\text{product}]}{dt}(\text{at }t=0)=\text{initial rate}\]
* The average rate between 0 and \(t_{i}\), where the reaction is 20% completed, can be seen to already _deviate significantly_ from the initial rate.
* As the reaction proceeds, with increasing time intervals (_e.g._ 0 to \(t_{3}\), 0 to \(t_{4}\) and 0 to \(t_{5}\)), the larger the average rate deviates from the initial rate.

Reaction Kinetics

**Making Thinking Visible**

**Q:** When the question says "rate", is it normally referring to instantaneous rate or average rate?

**A:** In general, it is more meaningful to talk about instantaneous rate, because we are constructing the rate equation (or _rate law_) to show the mathematical relationship between the rate and the concentration of the reactants at a particular temperature. To do so, the exact value of the concentration of the reactants and the corresponding rate (at the same point of time) must be known. It is less meaningful to discuss average rate because the "instantaneous rates" are different for the range of reactant (or product) concentrations used, and it is inaccurate to construct a rate equation based on the average rate. Instantaneous rate can be approximated by average rate is when there is very small change to the reactant concentration (within a very small time interval).

To this end, it would be meaningful to carefully evaluate the "rate" we are measuring when we visit Sections 4 and 5.

**Q:** Why do we want to talk about average rate? Isn't instantaneous rate better?

**A:** It is always easier to measure the average rate, as you will see in the comparison of continuous and discontinuous methods used to measure rate in Section 5. When done correctly, the average rate in certain experimental setup can be approximated to the instantaneous rate (at t=0, i.e. the initial rate).

**Q:** What is meant by "time"? Is there a difference between the **(1)** "time" used in the horizontal axis of the graph, **(2)** "time" used in (calculating) the rate of reaction, and **(3)** "time" elapsed for a specific change to be observed (in Sections 4 and 5)?

**A:** We are easily confused when we understand a term literally and assume that the meaning is identical for all contexts (i.e. a word can only have one meaning, which is not true).

**(1)** refers to the time that has elapsed since the reaction has started, i.e. from a specific reference point in time. In this case, we are thinking about time as a "dimension" that allows for observations to be made.

**(2)** is slightly different from **(1)**, and refers to a generic time interval between two reference points since the reaction has started. If we are talking about instantaneous rate (d[product]/dt), then we would be talking about an "instant" which means an infinitesimally small amount of time has passed. This instantaneous rate can be approximated by the average rate, when given the correct conditions.

**(3)** typically refers to the time that has elapsed between the start of the experiment and the change that is to be observed, and is hence _dependent_ on the observation to be made.

In a way the "time" in **(1)**, **(2)** and **(3)** all refer to an interval (or a very small interval), but the specific reference points are different.

## 2 The Rate Equation

LO **(a)** explain and use the terms: rate equation; order of reaction; rate constant

### Relationship between Rate and Reactant Concentrations

For a general reaction a**A** + _b_**B** \(\rightarrow\) products, the rate of reaction can be experimentally shown to be related to the concentrations of the reactants by a rate equation of the form:

\[\text{rate}=\textit{k}\langle\textbf{A}\rangle^{m}[\textbf{B}]^{n}\]

where **[A]** and **[B]** are concentrations of reactant **A** and **B** respectively,

\(m\) and \(n\) are order of reaction with respect to reactant **A** and **B** respectively,

\(k\) is the rate constant,

\(m+n=\) overall order of reaction.

(Note: when the order of reaction is 1, it is normally not written out.)

(Note: it is possible to have reactions that have more than 2 reactants in a single step. However, as you would learn from Section 8, it is difficult for 3 or more reactant particles to collide with the correct geometry and have sufficient energy to overcome the activation energy barrier. Hence, this set of lecture notes uses only 2 reactant particles to illustrate the concepts for the rate equation.)

### Definition of Terms Relating to the Rate Equation

\begin{tabular}{|p{14.2pt}|p{142.3pt}|} \hline  & The rate equation (or rate law) is an **experimentally determined mathematical equation between the reaction rate and the concentration of reactants at a particular temperature**. \\ rate equation & The rate of reaction is related to the concentration of each reactant raised to the appropriate power. It may not include all reactants in the chemical equation. \\  & The rate equation can only be experimentally determined and cannot be deduced from the stoichiometric equation (_i.e._\(m\) and \(n\) may or may not be equal to \(a\) and \(b\) respectively). \\ \hline  & The order of reaction with respect to a particular reactant is the **power to which the concentration of that reactant is raised in the experimentally determined rate equation**. \\  & _e.g._ rate = _k_**A**\({}^{2}[\textbf{B}]\)\(\Rightarrow\) order of reaction w.r.t. **A** is 2 \\ respect to a reactant) & The order of reaction can be an integer, fraction, positive or negative value. \\  & **Overall order of reaction** is the **sum of the individual orders of reaction**_i.e._ (2 + 1) = 3 in this case. \\ \hline  & Rate constant, \(k\), is a **proportionality constant for a given reaction at a specified temperature**. \\  & The units of \(k\) depends on the rate equation. \\ rate constant & For example, if rate = _k_**[A], units of \(k\) = \(\frac{\text{mol}\text{ dm}^{-3}\text{ s}^{-1}}{\text{mol}\text{ dm}^{-3}}=\text{s}^{-1}\) \\  & if rate = _k_**[A]\({}^{2}\), units of \(k\) = \(\frac{\text{mol}\text{ dm}^{-3}\text{ s}^{-1}}{(\text{mol}\text{ dm}^{-3})^{2}}=\text{mol}^{-1}\text{ dm}^{3}\text{ s}^{-1}\) \\  & Value of \(k\) can be affected by _temperature_ and _catalyst_. \\  & The larger the value of \(k\), the faster the rate of reaction. \\ \hline  & \multicolumn{1}{p{142.3pt}}{} \\ \end{tabular}

Bromine and methanoic acid react as follows:

\[\text{Br}_{2}\text{ (aq)}+\text{HCO}_{2}\text{H (aq)}\rightarrow\text{2Br}^{-}\text{ (aq)}+\text{2H}^{+}\text{ (aq)}+\text{CO}_{2}\text{ (g)}\]

The rate of reaction is found to be first order with respect both to bromine and to methanoic acid.

Which of the following deductions can be made from this information?

Doubling the concentration of methanoic acid doubles the rate of evolution of gas.

Halving the concentration of both reactants simultaneously will halve the reaction rate.

## 3 Zero-order, First-order and Second-order Reactions

LO **(b)** construct and use rate equations of the form rate = _KA_[**A**]"[**B**]" (limited to simple cases of single-step reactions and of multi-step processes with a rate-determining step, for which \(m\) and \(n\) are 0, 1 or 2)

(ii) justifying, for zero-order reactions, the order of reaction from concentration-time graphs

### Zero-order Reactions

Consider the zero-order reaction: \(\textbf{A}\rightarrow\textbf{B}+\textbf{C}\), the rate equation is:

\[\text{rate}=K\textbf{[A]}^{0}=K\]

The rate is **constant** (at a particular temperature), _i.e._ rate = \(k\) (since **[A]**\({}^{0}\)=1)

If the order of reaction with respect to any reactant is zero, then **changing the concentration of that reactant will not affect the rate of reaction**, _i.e._ rate of a zero order reaction is **independent** of the concentration of the reactant.

The graphs associated with zero order reactions are as shown:

The concentration of sucrose, [**S**], was measured at different times.

\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|c|c|c|c|} \hline

Reaction Kinetics Zero-, First- and Second-order Reactions

### Second-order Reactions

Consider the second-order reaction: **2A**\(\rightarrow\)**B** + **C**, the rate equation is:

\[\text{rate}=\textit{k}\textbf{A}\textbf{}]^{2}\]

If the order of reaction with respect to any reactant is two, then the **rate is directly proportional to the square of the concentration of that reactant**.

The graphs associated with second-order reactions are as shown:

### Pseudo First-order Reactions

Suppose the reaction **A** + **B**\(\rightarrow\)**C**, where the rate equation is

\[\text{rate}=\textit{k}\textbf{(A)}\textbf{[B]}.\]

If **B** is used in large excess** compared to **A**, say **[B]** is about 10 times more than **[A]**, then **[B]** is effectively constant** during the reaction and thus **[B]** is also constant.

The above rate equation can then be rewritten as:

\[\text{rate}=\textit{K}\textbf{[A]}\quad\text{where}\textit{K}=\textit{K}\textbf {[B]}\]

Now, it appears that the reaction follows **first-order kinetics** (i.e. the observed change in **[A]** follows first-order kinetics) and thus we say that the reaction follows **pseudo first-order kinetics**. The \(\textit{t}_{\textit{\chi}}\) of **A** is now equal to \(\frac{\text{ln}2}{\textit{k}}\).

\[\textit{t}_{\textit{\chi}}=\frac{\text{ln}2}{\textit{k}^{\prime}}=\frac{\text {ln}2}{\textit{k}\textbf{[B]}}\]

The table below shows how the \(\textit{t}_{\textit{\chi}}\) of **A** is affected when **[A]** and **[B]** are changed.

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|} \hline
**experiment** & **[A]** _/ mol dm-3_ & **[B]** _/ mol dm-3_ & \(\textit{t}_{\textit{\chi}}\)** _/ min_ \\ \hline
1 & 0.01 & 1 & 10 \\ \hline
2 & 0.02 & 1 & 10 \\ \hline
3 & 0.01 & 2 & 5 \\ \hline \end{tabular}

Reaction Kinetics Zero-, First- and Second-order Reactions

### Presence of a large excess of a reactant

Consider the reaction of peroxodisulfate ions and iodide ions:

\[\text{S}_{2}\text{O}_{8}{}^{2}+2\text{I}^{-}\longrightarrow 2\text{SO}_{2}{}^{2}+ \text{I}_{2}\]

The rate equation is found to be: **rate = \(\text{K}\text{(S}_{2}\text{O}_{8}{}^{2})\text{[H}^{-}]\)**

If **initial [S\({}_{2}\text{O}_{8}{}^{2}\)]** **initial [I\({}^{-}\)]**, then [S\({}_{2}\text{O}_{8}{}^{2}\)] will hardly change during a reaction relative to the change in [I\({}^{-}\)].

In this case, [S\({}_{2}\text{O}_{8}{}^{2}\)] may be regarded as effectively constant throughout the reaction _i.e._ at all times in the reaction mixture, [S\({}_{2}\text{O}_{8}{}^{2}\)] = initial [S\({}_{2}\text{O}_{8}{}^{2}\)] = constant.

Hence the rate equation can be modified as: **rate = \(\text{K}\text{[T}^{-}\)]** where \(\text{\emph{k}}\) = \(\text{K}\text{(S}_{2}\text{O}_{8}{}^{2}\)]**

In this case, the reaction is said to exhibit **pseudo-first-order kinetics** and \(\text{\emph{k}}\) is a pseudo-first-order rate constant.

### Solvent is a reactant

Consider the hydrolysis of ethyl ethanoate in water.

\[\text{CH}_{3}\text{CO}_{2}\text{CH}_{2}\text{CH}_{3}+\text{H}_{2}\text{O} \rightarrow\text{CH}_{3}\text{CO}_{2}\text{H}+\text{CH}_{3}\text{CH}_{2}\text{OH}\]

The rate equation is: **rate = \(\text{K}\text{(CH}_{3}\text{CO}_{2}\text{CH}_{2}\text{CH}_{3}\text{][H}_{2}\text{O}]\)**

As water is a reactant and also the **solvent** in this reaction (and hence present in a **large excess**), its concentration remains essentially constant throughout the reaction. The total amount of water reacted is negligible as compared to the total amount of water present.

Hence the rate equation can be modified as: **rate = \(\text{K}\text{[CH}_{3}\text{CO}_{2}\text{CH}_{2}\text{CH}_{3}\text{]}\)**

where \(\text{\emph{k}}\) = \(\text{K}\text{[H}_{2}\text{O}]\)**. We now have a **pseudo first-order** reaction for the hydrolysis of ethyl ethanoate.

### Presence of a catalyst

Consider the hydrolysis of sucrose in the presence of hydrochloric acid as the catalyst.

\[\text{C}_{12}\text{H}_{22}\text{O}_{1},\text{ }+\text{H}_{2}\text{O} \xrightarrow[\text{H}\text{C}\text{H}_{2}\text{O}_{6}\text{ }+\text{C}_{6}\text{H}_{2}\text{O}_{6}\]

Experimentally, the rate equation is found to be: **rate = \(\text{K}\text{[H}^{+}]\text{[sucrose]}\)**

In this case, H\({}^{+}\), which is contributed through the dissociation of hydrochloric acid, is a **cataly**. It increases the rate of the reaction but is not consumed by the reaction. It participates in the reaction but is **regenerated**. Thus the [H+] can be regarded as essentially constant during the reaction _i.e._ [H\({}^{+}\)] \(\approx\) constant.

Hence the rate equation can be modified to: **rate = \(\text{\emph{k}}\text{[sucrose]}\)**

where \(\text{\emph{k}}\) = \(\text{K}\text{[H}^{+}]\) = constant**. We now have a **pseudo first-order** reaction in this example.

Reaction Kinetics Zero, First- and Second-order Reactions

A reaction occurs between \(\Gamma\)- and S\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{8}\)\({}^{2-}\). The rate equation for this reaction is

\[\text{rate}=k\{\text{S}_{2}\text{O}_{8}\text{${}^{2-}$}\}[\Gamma].\]

An experiment is performed where initial concentrations of S\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{8}\)\({}^{2-}\) at 1 x 10\({}^{-4}\) mol dm\({}^{3}\) and \(\Gamma\)- at 9 x 10\({}^{-1}\) mol dm\({}^{-3}\) were used. A graph of [S\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{8}\)\({}^{2-}\)] against time was plotted and the half-life was determined to be 40 s. Determine the value and units of the rate constant, \(k\).

The units of \(k\) is not s\({}^{-1}\) as it should not be determined from pseudo rate law (i.e. \(k\neq k\)).

The unknowns for Section 1

Reaction Kinetics ```
EverimentalMethods
```

If the data given in the table is the volume of the reactants instead of their concentration, we can use the relationship that \(\underline{V}_{\text{reactant}}\)**cc [reactant]**, provided that the **total volume of solution is kept constant** (often achieved by adding various volumes of water).

If the data given in the table is the time taken for the reaction to be complete, we can use the relationship that **rate is inversely proportional to time taken for the reaction to be complete**.

Example **Everimental**

The reaction of potassium iodate, KIO\({}_{3}\), with potassium sulfite, K\({}_{2}\)SO\({}_{3}\), in the presence of sulfuric acid can be studied using sodium thiosulfate, Na\({}_{2}\)S\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{3}\). The equation of the reaction is shown.

\[\text{5SO}_{3}{}^{2}\text{(aq)}+\text{2H}^{+}\text{(aq)}+\text{2IO}_{3}\text{ (aq)}\to\text{5SO}_{4}{}^{2}\text{(aq)}+\text{I}_{2}\text{(aq)}+\text{H}_{2} \text{O(I)} \text{rxn }\mathbf{I}\]

\[\text{I}_{2}\text{(aq)}+\text{2S}_{2}\text{O}_{3}{}^{2}\text{(aq)}\to 2\ \Gamma\text{(aq)}+\text{2S}_{4}\text{O}_{6}{}^{2}\text{(aq)} \text{rxn }\mathbf{II}\]

When a small but constant amount of Na\({}_{2}\)S\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{3}\)is added to a reaction mixture, the iodine slowly produced by rxn \(\mathbf{I}\) will immediately react in rxn \(\mathbf{II}\) until all the Na\({}_{2}\)S\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{3}\) has been used up. At that point, free iodine will be present in the solution, which will cause a sudden appearance of a deep blue colour if starch is present.

The stated volumes of solutions were mixed in expt 1 and the time for the blue colour to appear recorded.

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|} \hline  & volume of & volume of & volume of & volume of & volume of & volume & time / \\ expt & KIO\({}_{3}\) / & K\({}_{2}\)SO\({}_{3}\) / & H\({}_{2}\)SO\({}_{4}\) / & Na\({}_{2}\)S\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{3}\) / & deionised & of starch & s \\  & cm\({}^{3}\) & cm\({}^{3}\) & cm\({}^{3}\) & cm\({}^{3}\) & water / cm\({}^{3}\) & / cm\({}^{3}\) & s \\ \hline
1 & 20 & 20 & 20 & 2 & 0 & 1 & 30 \\ \hline
2 & \(a\) & \(b\) & 10 & 2 & \(c\) & 1 & \\ \hline \end{tabular}

* If the purpose of experiment 2 is to determine the order of reaction with respect to sulfuric acid, suggest the volumes \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) to use in experiment 2.
* If the time taken for experiment 2 is 60 s, deduce the order of reaction with respect to H\({}_{2}\)SO\({}_{4}\). Explain clearly your deduction.

CH\({}_{3}\)COCH\({}_{3}\)(aq) + I\({}_{2}\)(aq) \(\rightarrow\) CH\({}_{2}\)ICOCH\({}_{3}\)(aq) + HI(aq)

can be investigated experimentally by varying the concentrations of the three substances involved and determining the time for the colour of the iodine to disappear. In this method the rate of the reaction is measured in terms of the rate at which the iodine concentration changes, _i.e._ rate of reaction \(\propto\)

Reaction Kinetics \(\mathbf{ExperimentalMethods}\)

Plot these data on suitable axes and use your graphs to determine the following:

Use the half-life method to deduce the order of reaction with respect to C\({}_{2}\)H\({}_{5}\)Br.

Use the initial rates method to deduce the order of reaction with respect to NaOH.

**Pointers for finding half-lives:**

At least 2 half-lives shown on graph (3 half-lives if graph is obtained from practical expts)

Values of half-life (time taken) clearly shown on graph

Half-lives shown on graph must have **minimal overlap** with one another, i.e. take

**consecutive** half-lives where possible. (To illustrate this point, note that a zero-order will have similar half-lives if you took the time lapsed for reactant concentration to drop from for e.g., 100 units to 50 units, and 96 units to 48 units.)

Since **half-life is constant at 116 min for experiment 1** (or 78 min for experiment 2), the reaction is **first order** with respect to C\({}_{2}\)H\({}_{5}\)Br.

initial rate for experiment 1\(=-\frac{0.0100-0.0000}{0-164}=6.098\times 10^{-5}\) mol dm\({}^{-3}\) min\({}^{-1}\)

initial rate for experiment 2\(=-\frac{0.0100-0.0000}{0-110}=9.091\times 10^{-5}\) mol dm\({}^{-3}\) min\({}^{-1}\)

When **[OH] increases 1.5 times**, the initial rate also increases \(\mathbf{9.091\times 10^{-5}}\)\(\mathbf{6.098\times 10^{-5}}\)\(\mathbf{\approx 1.5}\)

**times**, hence the reaction is **first order** with respect to NaOH.

**(b)**: Write the rate equation for the reaction and use it to calculate the rate constant.

\[\text{rate = }k[\text{C}_{2}\text{H}_{5}\text{Br}][\text{OH}^{-}]\]

Hydrogen peroxide decomposes according to the equation: 2H\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{2}\)(aq) \(\rightarrow\) 2H\({}_{2}\)O(_l_) + O\({}_{2}\)(g)

**Procedure**

The rate of decomposition of a 3.0 mol dm\({}^{-3}\) solution of H\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{2}\) may be measured by pipetting out 10.0 cm\({}^{3}\) portions of the reaction mixture at regular time intervals of 5 minutes into a 250 cm\({}^{3}\) conical flask. These portions can be quenched by adding 30 cm\({}^{3}\) of cold water. The concentration of the unreacted H\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{2}\) in the quenched samples can be found by titrating the sample with acidified 0.1 mol dm\({}^{-3}\) aqueous KMnO\({}_{4}\). The results are shown below.

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|} \hline time / min & 0.0 & 5.0 & 10.0 & 15.0 & 20.0 & 25.0 & 30.0 \\ \hline vol of KMnO\({}_{4}\)/ cm\({}^{3}\) & 30.0 & 23.40 & 18.30 & 14.20 & 11.10 & 8.70 & 6.80 \\ \hline \end{tabular}

A graph of volume (KMnO\({}_{4}\)) against time can be plotted.

Since the unreacted [H\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{2}\)] in the conical flask is proportional to the volume of KMnO\({}_{4}\) reacted, the graph of volume (KMnO\({}_{4}\)) against time is equivalent to [H\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{2}\)] against time.

The rate of reaction at various times can be determined by drawing tangents to the curve and determining the gradients of the tangents.

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|} \hline \(\text{{\bf{Vol of KMnO}}}_{4}\)/ cm\({}^{3}\) & \(\text{{\bf{c}}}\) & \(\text{{\bf{[H_{2}O_{2}]}}}\) & \(\text{{\bf{[H_{2}O_{2}]}}}\) & \(\text{{\bf{[H_{2}O_{2}]}}}\) & \(\text{{\bf{[H_{2}O_{2}]}}}\) \\ \hline \end{tabular}

Since **half-lives** are constant (\(t_{\chi}\) = 14.0 min), reaction is first order with respect to H\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{2}\). Thus, rate = \(\text{{\bf{[H_{2}O_{2}]}}}\)Reaction Kinetics

Experimental Methods

In the presence of an acid, propanone reacts with iodine according to the following equation:

\[\ce{CH_{3}COCH_{3}(aq)}+\text{I}_{2}(aq)\text{ }\xrightarrow{H^{+}}\text{ }\ce{CH_{3}COCH_{2}I(aq)}+\text{HI(aq)}\]

The reaction rate may be studied by determining the amount of unreacted iodine in the reaction mixture at different times so that the relationship between rate and [I\({}_{2}\)] can be found. To investigate the order of reaction w.r.t. I\({}_{2}\), the concentration of propanone and H\({}^{+}\) used should be at least 10 times that of I\({}_{2}\), so that the kinetics becomes a pseudo zero order w.r.t. to both propanone and H\({}^{+}\).

Progenome, iodine solution and dilute sulfuric acid of known concentrations are mixed together and a stopwatch is started. At regular time intervals, samples of known volumes are pipetted out. The withdrawn sample is quenched by adding a quenching agent, sodium hydrogen carbonate, which neutralises the acid catalyst:

HCO\({}_{3}\)- H\({}^{+}\)\(\rightarrow\) CO\({}_{2}\)+ H\({}_{2}\)O

The concentration of the unreacted iodine in the quenched sample is determined by titrating with against a standard solution of aqueous sodium thiosulfate, Na\({}_{2}\)S\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{3}\).

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|} \hline
**time / min** & 0 & 3 & 6 & 9 & 12 \\ \hline
**vol of S\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{3}\)\({}^{2-}\)/ cm\({}^{3}\)** & 25.00 & 20.00 & 15.00 & 10.00 & 5.00 \\ \hline \end{tabular}

A graph of volume of S\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{3}\)\({}^{2-}\) against time can be plotted.

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|} \hline
**time / min** & 0 & 3 & 6 & 9 & 12 \\ \hline
**vol of S\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{3}\)\({}^{2-}\)/ cm\({}^{3}\)** & 25.00 & 20.00 & 15.00 & 10.00 & 5.00 \\ \hline \end{tabular}

A straight line graph is obtained. This implies that the rate of reaction is constant.

At time \(t\) = 0, the reaction has not started, hence the volume of S\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{3}\)\({}^{2-}\) used indicates the number of moles of iodine present initially. As reaction progresses, the amount of unreacted iodine present decreases, hence the volume of S\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{3}\)\({}^{2-}\) used also decreases.

Since volume of S\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{3}\)\({}^{2-}\) used is directly proportional to the [I\({}_{2}\) remaining], a graph of [I\({}_{2}\)] against time would also give a straight line, indicating that the rate of reaction is independent of concentration of iodine, _i.e._ reaction is zero order with respect to I\({}_{2}\).

#### 5.1.2 Monitoring rate by measuring volume of gaseous product

In a reaction whereby a gas is produced from non-gaseous reactants, the progress of the reaction can be followed by measuring the volume of the gas evolved at suitable time intervals under the same temperature and pressure conditions.

The rate of the reaction is given by the change in the volume of the gas produced over a specified time interval.

Footnote †: margin: **Analysis of Results**

For all three examples described, the volume of gaseous product formed is monitored at regular time intervals. Using the volumes of gaseous product, and with some manipulation, different graphs of volume of gases against time can be plotted. From these graphs, orders of reaction with respect to the reactants can be obtained.

Using the results obtained from **Example 3**: Decomposition of hydrogen peroxide,

\[2\text{H}_{2}\text{O}_{2}(\text{aq})\to 2\text{H}_{2}\text{O}(\hat{t})+\text{O}_{2}( \text{g})\]

**(A) Graph of volume of O2 against time**

A graph of volume of O2(g) evolved against time can be plotted. The rate of reaction at any instant, \(t\), is the gradient of the tangent to the curve at that instant.

From the graph of volume of O2(g) against time, the order of reaction with respect to H2O2 can be found from the shape of the graph:

zero order: straight line through origin with positive gradient

first order: concave curve with constant half-life

second order (and above): concave curve with non-constant (increasing) half-lives

**Note:**

\(1^{\text{st}}\)\(t_{\text{s}}\) = time taken for volume of O2 to increase from 0 to \(\gamma\)V\({}_{\infty}\) = ft

\(2^{\text{nd}}\)\(t_{\text{s}}\) = time taken for volume of O2 to increase from \(\gamma\)V\({}_{\infty}\) to \(3\gamma\)V\({}_{\infty}\) = \(t_{\text{b}}-t_{\text{t}}\)

\(3^{\text{rd}}\)\(t_{\text{s}}\) = time taken for volume of O2 to increase from \(\gamma\)V\({}_{\infty}\) to \(7\)V\({}_{\infty}\) = \(t_{\text{b}}-t_{\text{b}}\)

**(B) Graph of (V\({}_{-}-V_{\text{t}}\)) against time**

Alternatively, the values of (\(V_{\infty}-V_{\text{t}}\)) can be determined and a graph of (\(V_{\infty}-V_{\text{t}}\)) against time can be plotted.

**Note:**

\(V_{t}\) = volume of O2(g) evolved at time \(t\)

\(V_{\infty}\) = volume of O2(g) evolved at the end of the reaction

\((V_{\infty}-V_{\text{t}})\) = volume of O2(g) **vet** to be evolved at time \(t\)

\((V_{\infty}-V_{\text{t}})\) \(\propto\) [H2O2] remaining at time \(t\)

A graph of (\(V_{\infty}-V_{\text{t}}\)) against time is equivalent to a

graph of [H2O2] against time.

From this graph, the half-life of the reaction can be determined.

The order of reaction with respect to H2O2 can be found from the shape of the graph:

zero order: straight line with negative gradient

first order: convex curve with constant half-life

second order (and above): convex curve with non-constant (increasing) half-lives

**Figure 1**: The order of reaction with respect to H2O2 can be found from the shape of the graph:

zero order: straight line with negative gradient

first order: convex curve with constant half-life

second order (and above): convex curve with non-constant (increasing) half-livesReaction Kinetics Experimental Methods

#### 5.1.3 Monitoring rate by measuring changes in pressure

* If a reaction involves a change in the number of moles of gas, the total pressure of the reaction mixture can be measured at regular time intervals. The partial pressure of the reactant or product under consideration can then be calculated. The rate of the reaction can be determined from the change in partial pressure (at constant volume and temperature) of the reactant or product over time.
* For the experiments described in section 5.1.2, we can also monitor the rate of the reaction by measuring changes in pressure since there is a **change in the number of moles of gas molecules present**.
* The reaction is usually carried out in a closed metal container of a fixed volume fitted with a pressure gauge and the total pressure is measured at regular time intervals.

\begin{tabular}{c c}  & Taps T\({}_{2}\) and T\({}_{3}\) allow the \\  & & reactants **A** and **B** to enter \\  & & the reaction vessel \\  & & the total pressure can be measured to \\  & & thermostatically \\  & & controlled furnace \\ \end{tabular}

Some examples of reactions which involved changes in the amount of gaseous molecules and hence a change in total pressures are:

1. 2NO(g) + O\({}_{2}\)(g) \(\to\) 2NO\({}_{2}\)(g)
2. 2N\({}_{2}\)O(g) \(\to\) 2N\({}_{2}\)(g) + O\({}_{2}\)(g)

For these reactions, a manometer can be attached to the reaction vessel of known volume for measurement of gas pressure at various time intervals. The reaction vessel is also immersed in a constant-temperature bath. A graph of pressure against time can be plotted and the rates at various times are obtained by drawing tangents to the curve and calculating the gradients.

#### 5.1.4 Monitoring rate by measuring changes in mass

In a reaction whereby a gas is produced and the gas allowed to escape, we can monitor the rate of the reaction by measuring changes in the loss in mass of the reacting system.

\begin{tabular}{c c}  & & Mg(s) + 2HC(aq) \(\to\) MgC_b_(aq) + H\({}_{2}\)(g) \\ \end{tabular}

**Example 1: Reaction between thiosulfate ions and hydrogen ions to produce sulfur**

Sodium thiosulfate reacts with hydrochloric acid according to the equation:

\[\text{Na}_{2}\text{S}_{2}\text{O}_{3}\text{(aq)}+2\text{HC}\textit{l}\textit{(aq)} \to 2\text{NaC}\textit{l}\textit{(aq)}+\text{H}_{2}\text{O}\textit{(l)}+\text{SO}_{2 }\text{(g)}+\text{S}\text{(s)}\]

The rate of reaction may be studied by measuring the time taken for a fixed amount of sulfur to form.

**Procedure**

Place 20 cm\({}^{3}\) of Na\({}_{2}\)S\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{3}\)(aq) in a conical flask. Place the card, marked with a cross ("\(\mathbf{\times}\)"), below the conical flask.

Measure 30 cm\({}^{3}\) of HC_l_(aq). Pour the acid into the conical flask containing Na\({}_{2}\)S\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{3}\)(aq) and start the stopwatch at the same time. Record the time taken for the cross ("\(\mathbf{\times}\)") on the card to be completely obscured by the sulfur produced.

Repeat the experiments by varying the concentrations of thiosulfate and acid used as shown in the table below. Keep the total volume of the reaction mixture constant by adding distilled water.

Calculate and record the reciprocal of time \(t\left(\textit{i.e.}\ \frac{1}{t}\right)\) for each of the experiment.

**Experimental Data**

**Note:** Since rate \(\propto\frac{1}{t}\), if at least 5 experiments were conducted with different [S\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{3}\)\({}^{2}\)] (or [H\({}^{+}\)] ), a graph of \(\frac{1}{t}\) against [S\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{3}\)\({}^{2}\)] (or [H\({}^{+}\)] ) can be plotted to find the order of reaction with respect to S\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{3}\)\({}^{2}\)- (or H\({}^{+}\)). Alternatively, we can find the order of reaction with respect to the reactants by making a direct comparison of experimental results, as shown in the Treatment of Results at the following page.

**Example 2: Reaction between hydrogen peroxide and iodide ions in acidic medium**

Hydrogen peroxide reacts with iodide ions in an acidic medium according to the equation:

\[\text{H}_{2}\text{O}_{2}(\text{aq})+2\text{I}^{-}(\text{aq})+2\text{H}^{+}(\text{ aq})\to\text{I}_{2}(\text{aq})+2\text{H}_{2}\text{O}(\text{I})\]

The initial rate of the reaction between H\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{2}\) and acidified KI solution can be studied by the "clock" method, using sodium thiosulfate.

* When a small but constant amount of sodium thiosulfate is added to a reaction mixture, the iodine being slowly produced by reaction **(1)** will immediately react in reaction **(2)**.

**reaction (1):**: \(\text{H}_{2}\text{O}_{2}(\text{aq})+2\text{I}^{-}(\text{aq})+2\text{H}^{+}( \text{aq})\to\text{I}_{2}(\text{aq})+2\text{H}_{2}\text{O}(\text{I})\)

**reaction (2):**: \(2\text{S}_{2}\text{O}_{3}{}^{2}(\text{aq})+\text{I}_{2}(\text{aq})\to\text{S}_{4} \text{O}_{6}{}^{2}(\text{aq})+2\text{I}^{-}(\text{aq})\)
* Since reaction **(2)** is relatively faster than reaction **(1)**, the concentration of iodine in the reaction mixture will remain effectively zero so long as there are still some S\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{3}{}^{2}\)- ions in the mixture.
* At that point when the small amount of Na\({}_{2}\)S\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{3}\) is completely used up, free iodine will be present in the solution, which will cause a sudden appearance of a blue-black colour characteristic of the starch-iodine complex if starch is present. (Note: since reaction **(1)** is slower, we are effectively observing the rate of reaction based on reaction **(1)** and not **(2)**, which is aligned to our aim).
* **Note:** By carrying out the reaction in the presence of a **small but fixed amount of Na\({}_{2}\)S\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{3}\)** and the starch indicator, a 'clock' is introduced into the system. The 'clock' tells us when a given concentration of I\({}_{2}\) has formed. (_Recap why we use small but fixed amount of Na:S\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{3}\) by reading Section 1.2(c)_)
* A series of experiments was carried out using different volumes of the five reagents, each solution being made up to the same total volume with appropriate volume of water added.
* The **volume and hence amount of Na\({}_{2}\)S\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{3}\) was kept constant** for each experiment to ensure that the amount of iodine produced (which reacted with the thiosulfate ions) was constant for all the experiments.

## 6 Reaction Mechanisms

* **NOT IN H1 Chemistry Syllabus:**

* **(a)** explain and use the terms: rate-determining step
* **(b)** **(iii)** verifying that a suggested reaction mechanism is consistent with the observed kinetics
* **(w)** predicting the order that would result from a given reaction mechanism

A **reaction mechanism** describes how a reaction occurs by showing the progression of events from reactants to products. For example, among other things, it shows us whether a reaction occurs in a single step or in a certain sequence of steps. These steps are individually called an **elementary reaction**, which describes a single molecular event that cannot be made up of simpler steps. Examples of elementary reactions are (i) one particle decomposing or (ii) two particles colliding and combining.

_The rate determining step is the slowest step in a sequence of elementary reactions._

The rate determining step has the highest activation energy amongst all the steps involved in the mechanism.

Consider the reaction:

\[2\textbf{A}+\textbf{B}\ \ \rightarrow\ \textbf{C}+\textbf{D}\]

Suppose the experimentally determined rate equation is given by: rate = _K_**[A][B]**

The following mechanism of the reaction is proposed:

\[\begin{array}{l}\text{step 1:}\ \ \ \ \textbf{A}+\textbf{B}\ \ \rightarrow\ \textbf{C}+\textbf{X}\ \ \ \ \text{(slow)}\\ \text{step 2:}\ \ \ \ \ \textbf{A}+\textbf{X}\ \ \rightarrow\ \textbf{D}\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \text{(fast)}\\ \text{overall equation: }2\textbf{A}+\textbf{B}\rightarrow\textbf{C}+\textbf{D}\end{array}\]

X is formed in step 1 but is used up in step 2. We call **X** an **intermediate**, a species which is formed in an elementary reaction and used up in another. Hence, **intermediates do not appear either in the stoichiometric equation or the rate equation**.

In any proposed mechanism, the **equations in all the steps must sum up to give the overall balanced chemical equation of the reaction**.

### Surface Area of Reactants

* For a given mass of solid reactant, as **particle size decreases, surface area per unit volume increases**.
* Hence, the **frequency of effective collisions increases** and the reaction **rate increases**. _E.g._ CaCO3 (marble chips) + 2HC_l_(aq) \(\rightarrow\) CaCO_l_(aq) + H_2O_(l) + CO_2(g) slower CaCO3 (powder) + 2HC_l_(aq) \(\rightarrow\) CaCO_l_(aq) + H_2O_(l) + CO_2(g) faster

### Concentration of Reactants

* As the **concentration** of a reactant **increases**, the **reactant particles** are **closer together** as the **number of molecules per unit volume increases**.
* Hence, the **frequency of effective collisions increases** and the reaction **rate increases**.

### Pressure of Gaseous Reactants

* Pressure changes in a **gaseous** system will affect the rate of reaction as the **partial pressure of a gas is directly proportional to its concentration** at a particular temperature.
* An **increase in the partial pressure of a gaseous reactant** leads to an **increase in the concentration** of the reactant.
* Hence, the **frequency of effective collisions increases** and the reaction **rate increases**.

### Temperature

A Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution curve shows how energy is distributed amongst the reactant particles in the system for a particular temperature.

Reaction Kinetics ```

From the curve, at a given temperature,

The **total area** under the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution curve is proportional to the **total number of reactant particles** present. The particles do not all have the same **kinetic energy or speed**.

Only a **small proportion** of reactant particles possesses **energy greater than or equal to the activation energy, \(E_{\text{s}}\)**.

Hence, only a small fraction of colliding reactant particles is able to lead to reaction.

As temperature increases, the **curve broadens and flattens** out as the distribution of energies become more spread out. Since the total area under the curve must remain constant (as the total no. of particles remains constant), the **peak shifts to the right and is lower than before**.

When temperature is increased, the

1. average speed and hence **average kinetic energy of the reacting particles increases, increasing the frequency of collisions**;
2. **number of reactant particles with energy greater than or equal to the activation energy, \(E_{\text{a}}\), increases** (as shown by the larger shaded region).

Hence, the **frequency of effective collisions increases** and the rate constant increases, hence the reaction **rate increases**.

The distribution of the number of molecules with energy \(E\) is given in the sketch for two temperatures, \(T_{1}\) and a higher temperature \(T_{2}\). The letters **P**, **Q**, **R** refer to the separate and differently shaded areas. The activation energy is marked on the energy axis.

Which expression gives the fraction of the molecules present which have at least the activation energy at the higher temperature \(T_{2}\)?

\begin{tabular}{l l l}

**C** & **Q**+**R** & **D** & **Q**+**R** \\ \end{tabular}

Reaction Kinetics

#### 8.4.1 Rate constant and the Arrhenius equation

The Arrhenius equation relates the rate constant, \(k\), to the activation energy, \(E_{a}\), and the absolute temperature, \(T\) (in Kelvin).

\[k=A\omega^{\frac{E_{a}}{RT}}\]

where \(A\) is the Arrhenius constant and \(R\) is the molar gas constant.

* When **temperature increases**, the **rate constant and hence the rate of reaction increases** (generally, rate is roughly **doubled** for every 10 K rise in temperature).
* When a **catalyst is used**, the reaction takes place via an **alternative reaction pathway of lower activation energy**. The **rate constant and hence the rate of reaction increases**.

### Catalyst

* explain and use the terms: catalysis
* explain that, in the presence of a catalyst, a reaction has a different mechanism, _i.e._ one of lower activation energy, giving a larger rate constant
* interpret this catalytic effect on a rate constant in terms of the Boltzmann distribution

* _A catalyst is a substance which increases the rate of a chemical reaction by providing an alternative reaction pathway with lower activation energy_ and remains chemically unchanged at the end of the reaction.

A catalyst does not affect the yield of the reaction and is regenerated at the end of the reaction.

* When a **catalyst is used**, the **reaction is able to proceed via a pathway of lower activation energy, \(E_{a}\)**. The **fraction of reacting particles having energy greater than or equal to the activation energy increases**.
* The **frequency of effective collisions increases** and the rate constant increases, and hence the reaction rate increases.

#### 8.5.1.1 Haber Process

The reaction between nitrogen and hydrogen to form ammonia is a reversible reaction.

\[\text{N}_{2}(\text{g})+3\text{H}_{2}(\text{g})\rightleftharpoons 2\text{NH}_{3}(\text{g})\]

In order to speed up the reaction and favour the formation of ammonia, the Haber process is carried out industrially at 450 \({}^{\circ}\)C and at a pressure of 250 atm.

Finely divided **iron**, together with a promoter _e.g._A\(\underline{\text{O}}_{3}\), is used as a **heterogeneous catalyst** to further increase the rate of reaction by **weakening the triple bond in \(\text{N}_{2}\).

#### 8.5.1.2 Catalytic removal of oxides of nitrogen in exhaust gases from car engines

To reduce air pollution, cars are fitted with **catalytic converters** to **remove three main pollutants (carbon monoxide, oxides of nitrogen and unburnt hydrocarbons) from exhaust fumes**.

A typical catalytic converter consists of a ceramic honeycomb structure coated with the precious metals **platinum (Pt)**, **palladium (Pd) and rhodium (Rh)**, which acts as catalysts. A honeycomb structure helps to maximise the surface area on which heterogeneously catalysed reactions take place.

The three catalysts are selective in the reactions they promote. As the gases enter, the **oxides of nitrogen (NO\({}_{x}\)) are reduced to \(\text{N}_{2}\) by the excess CO present**, with **rhodium** acting as the catalyst.

#### 2NO(g) + 2CO(g) \(\rightarrow\) N\({}_{2}\)(g) + 2CO\({}_{2}\)(g)

The **unburnt hydrocarbons and CO are oxidised to CO\({}_{2}\) and H\({}_{2}\)O** with **platinum and palladium as the catalysts**. Catalytic converters are de-activated (or poisoned) by lead; _i.e._ the lead is preferentially adsorbed on the catalyst surface thereby occupying their actives sites. Hence, cars fitted with catalytic converters must be run on unleaded petrol.

\[\begin{split} 2\text{CO}(\text{g})+\text{O}_{2}(\text{g})\to 2 \text{CO}_{2}(\text{g})\\ \text{C}_{x}\text{H}_{y}\left(\text{g}\right)+\left(x+\frac{Y}{4} \right)\text{O}_{2}\left(\text{g}\right)\to x\text{CO}_{2}\left(\text{g} \right)+\frac{Y}{2}\text{H}_{2}\text{O}\left(\text{g}\right)\end{split}\] (Pt/Pd as catalyst)Reaction Kinetics

#### 8.5.1.3 Catalytic Hydrogenation of Alkenes

Consider the reaction

Step 1: Diffusion

Reactant molecules diffuse towards the solid catalyst surface.

Step 2: Adsorption

These molecules physically adsorb onto the active sites of the solid catalyst surface by intermolecular forces of attraction. This increases the local concentration of reactants.

Step 3: Chemical Reaction

Adjacent reactant molecules react to form products. This reaction has lower E\({}_{a}\) than the uncatalysed reaction.

Step 4: Desorption

This is the reverse of adsorption. After the reaction, the adsorbed product molecules breaks free from the catalyst surface and leave the nickel surface.

Step 5: Diffusion

The product molecules diffuse away from the surface. The vacant active sites are now available for adsorbing other reactant molecules.

Note:

The use of a heterogeneous catalyst increases the rate of reaction. However, there is a limited number of active sites on the surface of the catalyst. Hence, the rate will not increase any further when all the active sites are occupied.

#### 8.5.2 Homogeneous catalysis

The catalyst and reactants are in the **same physical phase**, either liquid or gaseous

A **homogeneous** catalyst provides an alternative pathway with **lower activation energy** by forming an **intermediate** which is later consumed in the reaction. The product is formed with the regeneration of the catalyst.

The catalytic activity of a homogeneous catalyst depends on its ability to exist in **variable oxidation states**.

The table below shows some examples of homogeneous catalysts.

\begin{tabular}{|l|c|} \hline
**reactions** & **homogeneous catalyst** \\ \hline \(2\text{SO}_{2}(\text{g})+\text{O}_{2}(\text{g})\to 2\text{SO}_{3}(\text{g})\) & NO(g) or NO\({}_{2}(\text{g})\) \\ \hline \(\text{S}_{2}\text{O}_{8}\text{{}^{2}}\text{-}(\text{aq})+2\Gamma\text{-}( \text{aq})\to 2\text{SO}_{4}\text{{}^{2}}\text{-}(\text{aq})+\text{I}_{2}(\text{aq})\) & Fe\({}^{2*}\)(aq) or Fe\({}^{3*}\)(aq) \\ \hline \(\text{CH}_{3}\text{COCH}_{3}(\text{aq})+\text{I}_{2}(\text{aq})\to\text{CH}_{2 }\text{COCH}_{3}(\text{aq})+\text{HI}(\text{aq})\) & H\({}^{+}\)(aq) \\ \hline \end{tabular}

#### 8.5.2.1 Reaction of iodide and peroxodisulfate ions

\[\text{S}_{2}\text{O}_{8}\text{{}^{2}}\text{-}(\text{aq})+2\Gamma\text{-}( \text{aq})\ \ \to\ 2\text{SO}_{4}\text{{}^{2}}\text{-}(\text{aq})+\text{I}_{2}(\text{aq})\]

Due to **repulsion** between the negatively charged \(\text{S}_{2}\text{O}_{8}\text{{}^{2}}\) and \(\Gamma\) ions, the reaction has **high activation energy**, hence this reaction is slow. Ions such as Fe\({}^{2*}\)(aq) act as **homogeneous catalysts** by providing an alternative reaction pathway of lower activation energy.

Mechanism

Step 1: 2Fe\({}^{2*}\)(aq) + \(\text{S}_{2}\text{O}_{8}\text{{}^{2}}\text{-}(\text{aq})\to 2\text{Fe}^{3+}(\text{aq})+2 \text{SO}_{4}\text{{}^{2}}\text{-}(\text{aq})\)

Step 2: 2Fe\({}^{3*}\)(aq) + 2\(\Gamma\text{-}(\text{aq})\to 2\text{Fe}^{2*}(\text{aq})+\text{I}_{2}(\text{aq})\)

Since both steps involve the reaction between oppositely charged ions, the absence of electrostatic repulsion here (unlike in the uncatalysed reaction) results in a **lower** activation energy and increases the frequency of effective collisions and hence, increases the rate of reaction.

_Note:_

_Only a small amount of Fe\({}^{2*}\)(aq) is required since it is regenerated by the reaction. Fe\({}^{3*}\)(aq), an intermediate in the reaction, may also catalyse the reaction (i.e. step 2 will take place before step 1)._

#### 8.5.2.2 Oxidation of atmospheric sulfur dioxide by atmospheric oxides of nitrogen

Atmospheric sulfur dioxide (from volcanic eruptions and burning of fossil fuels) can be oxidised to sulfur trioxide, but the reaction is slow in the absence of a catalyst.

\[2\text{SO}_{2}(\text{g})+\text{O}_{2}(\text{g})\to 2\text{SO}_{3}(\text{g})\]

Due to the high temperature involved in the combustion of fossil fuels and during lightning discharges, the _endothermic_ oxidation of nitrogen in the air occurs.

\[\text{N}_{2}(\text{g})+\text{O}_{2}(\text{g})\to 2\text{NO}(\text{g})\]

_Note:_ Most combustion reactions are exothermic, with the rare exception of nitrogen, due to its exceptionally strong N=N triple bond.

In the atmosphere, further oxidation readily occurs.

\[2\text{NO}(\text{g})+\text{O}_{2}(\text{g})\to 2\text{NO}_{2}(\text{g})\]

Nitrogen dioxide formed can catalyse the oxidation of sulfur dioxide.

Mechanism

Step 1: \(\text{SO}_{2}(\text{g})+\text{NO}_{2}(\text{g})\to\text{SO}_{3}(\text{g})+ \text{NO}(\text{g})\)

Step 2: \(\text{NO}(\text{g})+\text{\char 37}_{2}\text{O}_{2}(\text{g})\to\text{NO}_{2}(\text{g})\)

Sulfur trioxide is a secondary pollutant which dissolves in water vapour (in the air) to form sulfuric acid.

\[\text{SO}_{3}(\text{g})+\text{H}_{2}\text{O}(\text{\char 37}\to\text{H}_{2} \text{SO}_{4}\,(\text{\char 37})\]

This results in acid rain and amplifies the pollution problem caused by atmospheric sulfur dioxide. To reduce the emission of sulfur dioxide, many industrial countries enforce flue gas desultrisation, _i.e._ removing sulfur dioxide from waste gases by reacting it with limestone, CaCO\({}_{3}\).

#### 8.5.3.1 Reaction of manganate(VII) and ethanedioate ions in acidic medium

The reaction between MnO\({}_{4}\)- and C\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{4}\)\({}^{2\text{-}}\) in acid solution is catalysed by the Mn\({}^{2\star}\) formed during the reaction.

\[2\text{MnO}_{4}\text{(aq)}+5\text{C}_{2}\text{O}_{4}\text{${}^{2}$-(aq)}+16 \text{H}\text{${}^{+}$(aq)}\to 2\text{Mn}^{2\text{+}$(aq)}+10\text{CO}_{2}\text{(g)}+8 \text{H}_{2}\text{O}(\text{$\text{$\text{$\text{$\text{$\text{$\text{$\text{$ \text{$\text{$\text{$\text{$\text{$\text{$\text{$\text{$\text{$\text{$\text{$\text{$ $}}}}}}}}}}}}}$})\]

Initially, the reaction is slow. As the reaction proceeds, the purple MnO\({}_{4}\) rapidly decolourises due to the formation of Mn\({}^{2\star}\) which act as the catalyst. Rate of reaction starts to increase when greater amount of the catalyst starts to form. The rate of reaction will eventually decrease despite the increasing concentration of the Mn\({}^{2\star}\) catalyst because the concentration of reactants decrease to very low levels.

[] LO (**k**) describe enzymes as biological catalysts which may have specific activity

(**f**) explain the relationship between substrate concentration and the rate of an enzyme-catalysed reaction in biochemical systems

[] Making Thinking Visible

**Q:** Does the original reaction stop once the catalysis begins in an autocatalytic reaction? What determines the rate of reaction at any one point of time?

**A:** The original reaction does not stop, although it remains to be a slow reaction (and goes even slower as the concentration of reactants decrease to lower levels. The observed rate of decrease in reactant concentration is a consequence of two reactions, i.e. the original uncatalysed reaction and the catalysed reaction, albeit the catalysed reaction tends to be much faster.

**Q:** More Mn\({}^{2\star}\) is produced as the reaction proceeds, and there is an increasing rate of reaction at the start due to that. Does it mean that [Mn\({}^{2\star}\)] affects the reaction and is in the rate equation even though Mn\({}^{2\star}\) is only a catalyst?

**A:** Catalysts can be part of the rate equation (see page 17)! In catalysed reactions, the concentration of the catalyst does not change over time, and hence the reaction tends to slow down with time. In auto-catalytic reactions, the concentration of the catalyst increases with time as it is the product of the reaction, and as such, there is an increasing rate of reaction at the start. The rate of the auto-catalysed reaction is a function of both the concentration of the catalyst (which is increasing) and the concentration of the reactants (which is decreasing), which explains the shape of the graph.

### Reaction Kinetics

#### 8.5.4 Enzymes

Enzymes are proteins which act as **biological catalysts** as they catalyse chemical reactions in living organisms. They are **bichly specific** in that they catalyse particular reactions and react with specific reactants (referred to as substrates). A theory which accounts for this specificity is the **lock and key model**.

According to it, the substrate and the enzyme molecules have complementary shapes so that they fit together like a lock and its key. Each enzyme has an **active site** (specific region of the enzyme) into which **only one type of substrate** (reactant) can fit.

The substrate molecule moves into the active site on the enzyme and is bound by attractive forces. An enzyme-substrate complex is formed and this weakens the intramolecular bonding within the substrate, thus providing an alternative reaction pathway of lower activation energy.

The enzyme-substrate complex then breaks apart to release the products as the products formed are no longer of the right shape to remain in the active site. Now the enzyme is free to bind to another substrate molecule.

For a fixed amount of enzymes, there is a limited number of **active sites**. When substrate is in excess, the rate of reaction is **directly proportional** to [enzyme], _i.e._ reaction is **first order** with respect to the enzyme.

**At low [substrate]**

There are **available active sites for the substrate molecules to bind to**.

**Rate of reaction is directly proportional to [substrate] _i.e._ reaction is **first order** with respect to the substrate.

As [substrate] increases, there are **fewer active sites available** for catalysis. Thus, the **increase in rate of reaction becomes smaller** and reaction is **no longer first order with respect to the substrate.

Reaction Kinetics

**At high [substrate]**

**Substrate molecules occupy all the active sites and the enzyme is saturated**.

**Rate of reaction will be independent of [substrate]** _i.e._ reaction is **zero order** with respect to the substrate. The rate remains the same even though the substrate concentration increases.

**Electrodynamics for Section 8**

**I know how to:**

Understand factors affecting rate of reaction in terms of collision theory and activation energy.

Interpret, draw and explain, using Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution curve, the effect of temperature and catalyst on the rate of reaction, with reference to activation energy, collision frequency.

Understand how temperature affects rate constant (in Arrhenius equation) and hence rate of reaction.

Understand how catalyst (including enzymes) affects rate of reaction.

Appreciate and understand some examples of homogeneous, heterogeneous and autocatalysis.

23Rate = {M}[H+][CH2][H+]
3Rate = {M}[H+][CH2][H+]
4The rate of reaction depends on the [HBr] and [HBrO3]. In turn, the rate of formation of HBr depends on the concentrations of [H+] and [Br-] while the rate of formation of HBrO3 depends on the concentrations of [H+] and [BrO3]. Therefore, rate = {M}[BrO3][H+][H+]
