## 1 Introduction

Carbonyl compounds are commonly found in biologically important molecules such as carbohydrates and hormones, as well as other natural and synthetic dyes, fragrances and pharmaceuticals.

Hedione (methyl hydrojasmonate) was discovered in the early 1960s and is one ingredient found in almost all fine fragrances. During a quest to identify the characteristic smell of Bulgarian rose oil, the rose ketones, damascenones, were discovered and synthesized. In general, aldehydes contribute to the floral concept in feminine perfumery and aliphatic aldehydes with 8-13 carbon atoms have a very pleasant odour, and can be detected in very low concentrations.

Benzaldehyde, the simplest aromatic aldehyde, has a pleasant almond-like odour, while cinnamaldehyde gives cinnamon note.Vanillin (4-hydroxy-3-methylbenzaldehyde) is used as vanilla note, an ubiquitous note in almost all fragrances.

A carbonyl group is composed of a carbon atom which is double bonded to an oxygen atom.

### Boiling Points

Aldehydes and ketones have higher boiling points than corresponding non-polar hydrocarbons of similar number of electrons in the molecule, but have lower boiling points than their corresponding alcohols and carboxylic acids.

\begin{tabular}{|p{56.9pt}|p{56.9pt}|p{56.9pt}|p{56.9pt}|p{56.9pt}|} \hline
**Compound** & **Structural formula** & **No. of electrons in the molecule** & **b.p. / \({}^{\circ}\)C** & **Predominant intermolecular forces** \\ \hline Butane & CH3CH2CH2CH3 & 34 & -0.5 & Dispersion forces \\ \hline Propanan & CH3CH2CHO & 32 & 49 & Permanent-dipole - Permanent-dipole \\ \hline Propanone & CH3COCH3 & 32 & 56 & Permanent-dipole - Permanent-dipole \\ \hline Propanol & CH3CH2CH2OH & 34 & 97 & Hydrogen-bonding \\ \hline Ethanoic acid & CH3CO2H & 32 & 118 & Hydrogen-bonding \\ \hline \end{tabular}

* The **carbonyl** group is **polar**, thus **permanent dipole-permanent dipole** interactions exist between molecules in aldehydes and ketones (in addition to dispersion forces) which require more energy to overcome compared to only dispersion forces present in non-polar alkanes. Hence, carbonyl compounds have **higher boiling point than the corresponding alkanes.
* **Alcohols** and **carboxylic acids** can form **hydrogen bonds** between molecules, which are **stronger** and require more energy to overcome than **permanent dipole-permanent dipole** interactions in the corresponding aldehydes and ketones. Hence, carbonyl compounds have **lower boiling point** than the corresponding alcohols and acids.

### Solubility in water

Aldehydes and ketones have both polar and non-polar regions. They can act as solvents to both polar and non-polar solutes, which gives them a wide range of uses as solvents.

The lower aliphatic aldehydes and ketones are soluble in water due largely to their ability to form hydrogen bonds with water molecules.

\begin{tabular}{|p{56.9pt}|p{56.9pt}|p{56.9pt}|p{56.9pt}|} \hline
**Alcohols** & **Alcohols** & **Alcohols** & **Alcohols** & **Alcohols** \\ \hline \end{tabular}

* Higher members of carbonyl compounds containing more than 5 carbons or aromatic rings, are virtually insoluble in water. As the number of carbon atoms in the alkyl chain increases, the strength of the dispersion forces between molecules of the carbonyl compound increases. Energy released from hydrogen bonding formed between the carbonyl group and water is less able to overcome the increasingly stronger dispersion forces, as well as the existing hydrogen bonding in water. In addition, the hydrogen bonding with water is disrupted by the larger non-polar alkyl chain.

## 4 REACTIONS OF ALDEHYES AND KETONES

### 4.1 Nucleophilic Addition Reaction

The overall reaction for nucleophilic addition of carbonyl compounds can be represented as:

Examples of nucleophiles that can react with aldehydes, and ketones in a nucleophilic addition include CN, H\(\alpha\)O and RO\(\beta\). HCN(\(\beta\), \(\gamma\)).

Figure 11: The carbonyl carbonyl compounds are therefore planar about the carbonyl carbonyl and the bond angles are approximately 120Â° with respect to the carbonyl carbon.

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:9]

#### 4.1.3 Nucleophilic addition with hydrogen cyanide, HCN

_LO 11.6(b): describe the mechanism of the nucleophilic addition reactions of hydrogen cyanide with aldehydes and ketones_

Aldehydes and ketones undergo nucleophilic addition reaction with hydrogen cyanide, HCN, under appropriate conditions to form cyanohydrins.

_Note:_

HCN is a toxic gas and has a boiling point of 25.6\({}^{\circ}\)C. It is usually generated _in situ_ by the reaction between KCN(s) and cold dilute H\({}_{2}\)SO\({}_{4}\).

The reaction,mixture is kept cold (at 10-20\({}^{\circ}\)C) to ensure that HCN remains as a,liquid under reaction conditions.

### Condensation Reaction (Application Example)

Nucleophiles having two H atoms on a nitrogen atom readily add on to carbonyl compounds. But usually, the initially formed addition product is not isolated because it easily loses water via elimination to give stable compounds containing a C=N bond.

The overall reaction can be represented as:

#### 4.2.1 General Mechanism

The reaction can be viewed as an addition, followed by an elimination, hence it may be referred to as an _addition-elimination_ reaction,

Step 1: Addition of nucleophile to carbonyl compound

Step 2: Elimination of a water molecule

Figure 2: Elimination of a water molecule

#### 4.2.2 Condensation reaction with 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine (2,4-DNPH)

_10 11.6(a): describe the use of 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine (2,4-DNPH) to detect the presence of carbonyl compounds_

2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine, also known as Brady's reagent, is a yellow solution. It reacts with aldehydes and ketones to form 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazone, which is an orange precipitate. A water molecule is eliminated in the reaction.

This is a characteristic test for the presence of aldehydes and ketones.

#### 4.2.3 Reduction

Aldehydes and ketones undergo reduction to form primary and secondary alcohols respectively.

Figure 11: When the aldehyde or ketone react with LiA/H\({}_{\alpha}\), the alkoxide ion is form. H\({}_{2}\)O needs to be added to protonate the alkoxide to form the alcohols.

#### 4.3.1 Comparing reducing agents LiA/H\({}_{4}\) and NaBH\({}_{4}\)

10 11.6(c)part: explain the differences in reactivity between carbonyl compounds and alkenes towards nucleophilic reagents, such as lithium aluminium hydride

LiA/H\({}_{4}\) is a gravisi powder that is soluble in ether. It reacts violently with water to form H\({}_{2}\) gas and decomposes explosively when heated above 120 oC. NaBH\({}_{4}\) is a white, crystalline solid that can be handled in the open atmosphere and used in either water or alcohol solution.

Due to the hazardous nature of LiA/H\({}_{4}\) and ether (which forms highly explosive mixtures in air), the use of NaBH\({}_{4}\) is usually preferred.

Both LiA/H\({}_{4}\) and NaBH\({}_{4}\) can be considered as sources of the nucleophilic hydride anion, H\({}_{2}\). They both have hydrogen atoms covalently bonded to aluminium and boron respectively and because hydrogen is more electronegative than aluminium and boron, the hydrogen atoms will bear the negative charge, making it a good nucleophilic. As such, LiA/H\({}_{4}\) and NaBH\({}_{4}\) are able to react with aldehydes and ketones bearing the polar C=O group with an electron-deficient carbon.

Aluminium is less electronegative than boron, thus more of the negative charge in the A/H\({}_{4}\) ion is borne by the hydrogen atoms. Therefore, LiA/H\({}_{4}\) is a much stronger reducing agent, and is much less selective than NaBH\({}_{4}\).

Both LiA/H\({}_{4}\) and NaBH\({}_{4}\) do not reduce the non-polar electron-rich alkene group. The alkene functional group is reduced using H\({}_{2}\)(g) over a nickel catalyst. Refer to Topic 6 Reaction Kinetics for the mechanism of this heterogeneous catalysis reaction.

The aldehyde functional group undergoes oxidation reactions with acidified potassium dichromate (VI), Tollens' reagent and Fehling's solution, while the ketone does not. As such, these three tests are good distinguishing tests between aldehydes and ketones.

#### Oxidation with acidified potassium dichromate(VI) or acidified potassium manganate(VII)

Aldehyde has a hydrogen atom attached directly to the carbonyl carbon. This enables it to be oxidised to carboxylic acids.

#### 4.4.2 With Tollens' reagent [Silver Mirror Test]

Tollens' reagent [amimonical silver nitrate] contains diamminesiliver(l) ions; [Ag(NH\({}_{3}\))\({}_{2}\)]\({}^{\dagger}\). The Lidehydes reduce silver(l) in Tollens' reagent to silver metal. Under carefully controlled conditions, silver metal will deposit on the walls of the reaction vessel as a mirror.
