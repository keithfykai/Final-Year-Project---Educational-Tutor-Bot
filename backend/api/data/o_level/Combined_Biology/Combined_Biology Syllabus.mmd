## Practices of Science

The _Practices of Science_ represents the set of established procedures and practices associated with scientific inquiry, what scientific knowledge is and how it is generated and established, and how science is applied in society respectively. It consists of three components:

1. **Demonstrating Ways of Thinking and Doing in Science (WoTD)** * 1.1 Posing questions and defining problems * 1.2 Designing investigations * 1.3 Conducting experiments and testing solutions * 1.4 Analysing and interpreting data * 1.5 Communicating, evaluating and defending ideas with evidence * 1.6 Making informed decisions and taking responsible actions * 1.7 Using and developing models * 1.8 Constructing explanations and designing solutions* 2. **Understanding the Nature of Scientific Knowledge (NOS)*
	* 2.1 Science is an evidence-based, model-building enterprise concerned with understanding the natural world
	* 2.2 Science assumes there are natural causes for physical phenomena and an order and consistency in natural systems
	* 2.3 Scientific knowledge is generated using a set of established procedures and practices, and through a process of critical debate within the scientific community
	* 2.4 Scientific knowledge is reliable and durable, yet open to change in the light of new evidence
* 3. **Relating Science, Technology, Society and Environment (STSE)*
	* 3.1 There are risks and benefits associated with the applications of science in society. Science and its applications have the potential to bring about both benefits and harm to society
	* 3.2 Applications of science often have ethical, social, economic and environmental implications
	* 3.3 Applications of new scientific discoveries often inspire technological advancements while advances in technology motivate scientists to ask new questions and/or empower scientists in their inquiry (e.g. collecting more precise data or carrying out more complex data analysis)

The _Practices of Science_ serve to highlight that the discipline of Science is more than the acquisition of a _body of knowledge_ (e.g. scientific facts, concepts, laws, and theories); it is also a way of _thinking and doing_. In particular, it is important to appreciate that the cognitive, epistemic and social aspects of the _Practices of Science_ are intricately related. For example, observation of events can lead to the generation of scientific knowledge which is, simultaneously, shaped by the beliefs of scientific knowledge. In addition, scientists develop models to construct theories, based on the assumption that there is order and consistency in natural systems. The practice of theory-making, in turn, reinforces the explanatory power of scientific knowledge. The scientific endeavour is embedded in the wider ethical, social, economic and environmental contexts.

## 5 Physics section

### Introduction

The Ordinary Level Science (Physics) Syllabus provides students with a coherent understanding of energy, matter, and their interrelationships. It focuses on investigating natural phenomena and then applying patterns, models (including mathematical ones), principles, theories and laws to explain the physical behaviour of the universe. The theories and concepts presented in this syllabus belong to a branch of physics commonly referred to as classical physics. Modern physics, developed to explain the quantum properties at the atomic and sub-atomic level, is built on knowledge of these classical theories and concepts.

Students should think of physics in terms of scales. Whereas the classical theories such as Newton's laws of motion apply to common physical systems that are larger than the size of atoms, a more comprehensive theory, quantum theory, is needed to describe systems that are very small, at the atomic and sub-atomic scales. It is at this atomic and sub-atomic scale that physicists are currently making new discoveries and inventing new applications.

It is envisaged that teaching and learning programmes based on this syllabus would feature a wide variety of learning experiences designed to promote acquisition of scientific expertise and understanding, and to develop values and attitudes relevant to science. Teachers are encouraged to use a combination of appropriate strategies to effectively engage and challenge their students. It is expected that students will apply investigative and problem-solving skills, effectively communicate the theoretical concepts covered in this course and appreciate the contribution physics makes to our understanding of the physical world.

### Disciplinary ideas of physics

The disciplinary ideas of Physics represent the overarching ideas essential for the understanding of Physics. An understanding of these ideas helps students see the interconnectedness of ideas within and across the sub-disciplines of Physics. Equipping students with a coherent view and conceptual framework facilitates the application and transfer of learning. These disciplinary ideas can be revisited and deepened at higher levels of learning and beyond the schooling years.

Disciplinary ideas are introduced at the upper secondary levels when students begin to specialise in the sub-disciplines of science.

1. Matter and energy make up the Universe
2. Matter interacts through forces and fields
3. Forces help us understand motion
4. Waves can transfer energy without transferring matter
5. Conservation laws constrain the changes in systems
6. Microscopic models can explain macroscopic phenomena

## Subject Content

### 1.1 **Measurement**

#### Overview

Physics is an experimental science and precise measurements enable the collection of useful experimental data which can be tested against hypothesis for the development of physical theories. With the development of better measurement tools and techniques, the data available is improved and scientific knowledge continue to evolve in light of new information.

There is a variety of instruments available and our choice of instrument should take into consideration the precision, and feasibility of the choice of instrument when making measurements. We need to be cognisant of the limitations associated with the measurement process which can arise from the precision of the instrument chosen, the mechanics of the measuring instrument and the design of the experiment.

Apart from the need of accurate measurements, interactions between objects in systems should also be described with precisely defined quantities and units and as these interactions could range from celestial objects to sub-atomic particles, prefixes in order-of-ten are necessary to depict such diversity in range of magnitude.

6. state what is meant by _scalar_ and _vector_ quantities and give common examples of each

## Section II: Newtonian Mechanics

### Overview

Mechanics is the branch of physics that deals with the study of motion and its causes. Through a careful process of observation and experimentation, Galileo Galilei used experiments to overturn Aristotle's ideas of the motion of objects, for example the flawed idea that heavy objects fall faster than lighter ones, which dominated physics for about 2,000 years.

The greatest contribution to the development of mechanics is by one of the greatest physicists of all time, Isaac Newton. By extending Galileo's methods and understanding of motion and gravitation, Newton developed the three laws of motion and his law of universal gravitation, and successfully applied them to both terrestrial and celestial systems to predict and explain phenomena. He showed that nature is governed by a few special rules or laws that can be expressed in mathematical formulae. Newton's combination of logical experimentation and mathematical analysis shaped the way science has been done ever since.

## Section III: Thermal Physics

### Overview

When asked what was the most valuable scientific information in a single sentence, Richard Feynman response was, 'All things are made of atoms - little particles that move around in perpetual motion, attracting each other when they are a little distance apart, but repelling upon being squeezed into one another. In that one sentence... there is an enormous amount of information about the world.' (Six Easy Pieces, p.4)

Understanding thermal physics requires us to approach the concepts from both the macroscopic and microscopic lenses. The _Kinetic Particle Model of Matter_ is a cornerstone theory that is used extensively to explain how different types of matter exhibit certain physical properties by relating them to behaviour of atoms and molecules.

By nature, energy exchange takes place between bodies of different temperatures until thermal equilibrium is reached. Energy may be transferred between bodies by heating through processes like conduction, convection and radiation. These processes could cause changes in the molecular structure of matter and result in macroscopic observations, e.g. monsoon winds and ocean currents observed are convectional currents produced in the process of regulating differences in temperature.

## Section IV: Waves Overview

All waves have properties in common and a wave model can be used to explain many phenomena, both natural (like water waves and sound) and artificial (like many forms of electromagnetic waves). The ability of waves to transfer energy at great speed provides valuable propositions.

Much of our current understanding of wave motion has come from the study of acoustics, which is the science of sound. Many of the ancient Greek philosophers were interested in music. They had hypothesized that there was a connection between waves and sound, and that vibrations must be responsible for sounds. Pythagoras observed in 550 BC that vibrating strings produced sound, and worked to determine the mathematical relationships between the lengths of strings that made harmonious tones.

Scientific theories of wave propagation became more prominent in the 17th Century, when Galileo Galilei published a clear statement that connected vibrating bodies to the sounds they produce. In 1640 Robert Boyle's classic experiment on the sound produced by a ticking watch in a partially evacuated glass vessel provided evidence that air is necessary, either for the production or transmission of sound.

The mathematical theory of sound propagation began with Isaac Newton, whose _Principia_ (1686) included a mechanical interpretation of sound as being 'pressure' pulses transmitted through neighbouring fluid particles. In the 18th Century, French mathematician and scientist Jean Le Rond d'Alembert derived the wave equation, a thorough and general mathematical description of waves, which laid the foundation for generations of scientists to study and describe wave phenomena.

## SECTION V: Electricity and Magnetism

### Overview

Electricity and magnetism were seen as separate and independent phenomena in the past. It only was when Danish physicist Hans Christian Orsted discovered, accidentally, in 1820 that a magnetic needle is deflected when the current in a nearby wire varies - a phenomenon establishing a relationship between electricity and magnetism.

Inspired by Orsted's discovery, Andre-Marie Ampere conducted a series of experiments in the same year to designed to elucidate the exact nature of the relationship between electric current-flow and magnetism.

Further works by Michael Faraday reinforced the magnetic effect of a current and introduced the idea of a 'field' of action to explain why electricity and magnetism had and 'area of activity'.

However, it was the work of James Clerk Maxwell, a mathematical physicist, who provided mathematical tools and equations to describe Faraday's ideas of the field. His works went on to prove that electromagnetic fields have wave-like properties which was a very important discovery in physics.

## SECTION VI: Radioactivity

### Overview

Radioactivity was first discovered through the handling of radioactive uranium by physicists Pierre and Marie Curie during which they suffered radioactive burns due to inadequate handling of the substance.

_Radioactivity_ is the study of the nature of the radiation emitted by radioactive materials. It was later understood that there are three types of emissions: the alpha particles (helium atoms with no electrons), beta particles (fast moving electrons) and the gamma rays (electromagnetic radiation similar to X-rays). These emissions are the result of the decay or disintegration of an unstable atomic nucleus.

Radioactivity have important medical uses, which include the killing of cancer cells. However excessive exposure to radioactivity can cause cancer if the dose is too high. Many early scientists working with radioactive materials died early from the harmful effects of high radiation before proper safety guidelines were drawn. 'Radiometric dating' makes use of a radioactive element's half-life to help determine the age of rocks or carbon.

Large amounts of energy are also involved in radioactive emissions and physicists quickly recognized the power of this. Many scientists working on this from 1930 to 1940 in Europe were forced to leave their home countries, fleeing to the United States due to the development of the war. This led to a 'brain drain' which benefited the United States and allowed them to develop the two atomic bombs which ended the war. This highlights the impact on science on society and human interactions. Since the development of the atomic bomb, much has been learnt about how to control the release of energy and nuclear power can generate electricity with only a fraction of the greenhouse gases released by burning coal and other fossil fuels.

Because radiation cannot be easily seen, it is commonly feared and shunned. Coupled with news about the dangers of nuclear radiation and the potential detriments to health, the general public is apprehensive about the use and application of any form of radiation. This topic aims to provide an objective evaluation of the risks and benefits of the use of radiation through the development of a good understanding of the many practical uses of radioactive materials.

## Chapter 5 Chemistry section

### 5.1 INTRODUCTION

The Ordinary Level Science (Chemistry) Syllabus is designed to place less emphasis on factual materials while having a greater emphasis on the understanding and application of scientific concepts and principles. This approach has been adopted in recognition of the need for students to develop skills that will be of long-term value in an increasingly complex and globalised world, rather than focusing on large quantities of factual materials, which may have only short-term relevance.

It is envisaged that teaching and learning programmes based on this syllabus will feature a wide variety of learning experiences designed to promote acquisition of scientific expertise and understanding, and to develop values and attitudes relevant to science. Teachers are encouraged to use a combination of appropriate strategies including developing practical work for their students to facilitate a greater understanding of the subject. It is expected that students will apply investigative and problem-solving skills and effectively communicate the theoretical concepts covered in this course.

### 5.2 Disciplinary ideas of Chemistry

The disciplinary ideas of Chemistry described below represent the overarching ideas which can be applied to explain, analyse and solve a variety of problems that seek to address the broader questions of what matter is and how particles interact with one another. Equipping students with a coherent view and conceptual framework facilitates the application and transfer of learning. These disciplinary ideas can be revisited and deepened at higher levels of learning and beyond the schooling years.

1. Matter is made up of a variety of chemical elements, each with characteristic properties, and the smallest particle that characterises a chemical element is an atom.
2. The structure of matter and its chemical and physical properties are determined by the arrangement of particles and electrostatic interactions between them.
3. Energy changes across and within systems usually occur during physical and chemical changes, when there is rearrangement of particles.
4. Energy plays a key role in influencing the rate and extent of physical and chemical changes.
5. Matter and energy are conserved in all physical and chemical changes.

The study of reactions also reveals patterns in the chemical properties of substances, leading to the organisation of elements in the Periodic Table.

## Chapter 5 Object Content

### 5.1 Section I: Cells and the Chemistry of Life

#### Overview

Living things are different from non-living things in their ability to grow, reproduce, move, and respond to change. Understanding what makes these characteristics of life possible requires an appreciation of the hierarchical organisation of life (from cells \(\rightarrow\) tissues \(\rightarrow\) organs \(\rightarrow\) systems \(\rightarrow\) organism) and the processes needed to sustain life at each level.

In this section, we begin by exploring life at the smallest level. Amidst the great diversity of living organisms on earth, all living organisms are fundamentally similar at the smallest level; they are all made of cells and a common set of carbon-based molecules. Physiological processes in living organisms can be explained through activities happening at the cellular level. For instance, the transport of oxygen around the body is made possible by red blood cells that bind oxygen to haemoglobin.

In order to sustain life, all living things require three macromolecules - carbohydrates, proteins and fats. They make life possible by providing energy, building cellular structures, and for growth and repair.

The overarching ideas of this section are cells as the basic unit of life, correlation between structure and function and how living organisms obtain, transform and utilise energy from the external world at the cellular level to sustain life. Knowing how life works at the cellular and molecular level will provide students with a foundation to understand processes needed to sustain life at the tissue, organ and system levels, which are covered in subsequent sections of this syllabus.

## Section II: The Human Body - Maintaining Life

### Overview

Life is sustained through the integrated organisation of the whole organism. In humans, the maintenance and regulation of life processes include nutrition, transport and respiration.

Living systems utilise energy and macromolecules to maintain life processes such as growth, reproduction and homeostasis. Interactions also exist between living systems within organisms, which are often accompanied by the transfer of energy between matter and transfer or exchange of matter. Each system has their component parts, characterised by the division of labour. This division of labour enables an organism to function efficiently and allows for the various systems to work together as a co-ordinated whole.

The threat of diseases disrupts the maintenance of important life processes and the functioning of human body systems. In ancient times, the concept of 'catching' a disease was unheard of, and diseases were even thought to be caused by the imbalance of 'humours' (internal fluids) within the body. However, with the invention of the microscope, we have found out that infectious diseases are often caused by pathogens, e.g. viruses and bacteria.

The overarching ideas in the study of this section are the co-ordination of the human body system as a whole and the correlation between structure and function.

## SECTION III: Living Together - Plants, Animals and Ecosystems

### Overview

The sun is the principal source of energy for almost all living organisms on earth, without which, life will not exist as it is today. Green plants are able to capture and convert light energy to useful chemical forms through the unique process of photosynthesis. Other organisms depend on this energy captured by plants through direct or indirect feeding relationships to sustain life.

The study of ecology will further explain how all organisms are interdependent on the transfer of energy and matter in this intricate web of life. Humans are by far the singular most influential species in ensuring the conservation of the fragile ecosystem and thus, there are important lessons to be learnt from this highly interdependent relationship among organisms. In the face of global warming as one of the major challenges confronting the world now, examining how human actions can reduce the effects of global warming takes on a pressing urgency to ensure the sustainability of the environment and life on Earth.

The overarching idea of this section is the interaction between organisms in the ecosystem for the sustainability of life through the transfer of energy and matter.

## Section IV: Continuity of Life

### Overview

The many aspects of structure and function that we have examined in this syllabus can be viewed in the widest context as various adaptations aimed at ensuring reproductive success. Reproduction is vital for the survival of species across generations.

In this section, we examine the processes that contribute to the continuity of life. These processes include how genes interact to produce hereditary characteristics in the offspring and how genetic information is passed from one generation to the next.

Some important scientists who contributed to findings in this section include Gregor Mendel - who published his observations from breeding experiments on pea plants and James Watson and Francis Crick - who developed the model for deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), a molecule that was deduced as the hereditary material that is passed down through generations. Models aid in the visualisation of science and led to the breakthrough of the discovery of the double-helix molecule - DNA.

The overarching ideas of this section are the storage of genetic information in the DNA and the passing down of genetic information through generations to ensure the continuity of life.

## Practical Assessment

Scientific subjects are, by nature, experimental. It is therefore important that an assessment of a candidate's knowledge and understanding of Science should include a component relating to practical work and experimental skills. This assessment is provided in Paper 5, as a formal practical test, and is outlined in the **Scheme of Assessment**.

**Paper 5 Practical Test**

**Physics Practical Test**

1. measurements of 1. length by using tapes, rules, digital calipers and digital micrometers 2. time interval (including period of a simple pendulum) by using digital stopwatches 3. volume of solids/liquids by using measuring cylinders 4. mass and weight by using electronic balances and spring balances 5. temperature by using laboratory thermometers 6. current and voltage by using ammeters and voltmeters 7. determination of the density of a liquid, or a regularly or irregularly shaped solid, that sinks in water 8. determination of the value of acceleration of free fall 9. investigation of the effects of balanced and unbalanced forces 10. the principle of moments 11. determination of the position of the centre of gravity of a plane lamina 12. investigation of the factors affecting transfer of energy by thermal processes 13. the law of reflection 14. determination of the position and characteristics of an optical image formed by a plane mirror or a thin converging lens * (i) the refraction of light through glass blocks
* (k) determination of the resistance of a circuit component

This is not intended to be an exhaustive list. Reference may be made to the techniques used in these experiments in the theory papers, but no detailed description of the experimental procedures will be required.

### Apparatus List

This list below gives guidance to Centres concerning the apparatus and items that are expected to be generally available for examination purposes. The list is not intended to be exhaustive.

The apparatus and materials requirement for Paper 5 will vary from year to year. Centres will be notified in advance of the details of the apparatus and materials required for each practical examination.

Spare sets of apparatus must be available to allow for breakages and malfunctions.

#### Chemistry Practical Test

Candidates may be asked to carry out exercises based on:

1. quantitative experiments involving the use of a pipette, burette and an indicator such as methyl orange or screened methyl orange; if titrations other than acid / alkali are set, full instructions and other necessary information will be given
2. speeds of reaction that may involve measuring of quantities, e.g. volume, length, mass or time measurement
3. measurements of temperature based on thermometers with 1\({}^{\circ}\)C graduations
4. problems of an investigatory nature, possibly including suitable organic compounds
5. paper chromatography
6. filtration
7. qualitative inorganic analysis involving an element, a compound or a mixture, including precipitation reactions, and tests for oxidising and reducing agents (as specified in the syllabus)

Candidates should be familiar with the identification of ions and gases as specified in the syllabus. Candidates would **not** be required to carry out tests involving sulfur dioxide gas or describe methods to prepare salts. Reactions involving ions not specified in the syllabus may be tested: in such cases, candidates will **not** be expected to identify the ions but only to draw conclusions of a general nature.

This is not intended to be an exhaustive list.

Responsibility for safety matters rests with Centres. Candidates should also be aware of the need for safe handling of chemicals and apparatus.

Candidates are not allowed to refer to notebooks, textbooks or any other information in the practical examination. _Notes for Qualitative Analysis_ will be included in the question paper for the use of candidates in the examination.

Candidates may also be required to perform simple calculations.

#### Practical Techniques

The following notes are intended to give schools and candidates an indication of the accuracy that is expected in titration and general instructions for qualitative analysis.

1. Candidates should normally record burette readings to the nearest 0.05 cm\({}^{3}\) and they should ensure that they have carried out a sufficient number of titrations, e.g. in an experiment with a good end-point, two titres within 0.20 cm\({}^{3}\).
2. In qualitative analysis, candidates should use approximately 1 cm depth of a solution (1-2 cm\({}^{3}\)) for each test and add reagents slowly, ensuring good mixing, until no further change is seen. Candidates should indicate at what stage a change occurs. Answers should include details of colour changes and precipitates formed, and the name and test for any gases evolved.

## Glossary of Terms Used in Science Papers

It is hoped that the glossary (which is relevant only to science papers) will prove helpful to candidates as a guide, i.e. it is neither exhaustive nor definitive. The glossary has been deliberately kept brief not only with respect to the number of terms included but also to the descriptions of their meanings. Candidates should appreciate that the meaning of a term must depend in part on its context.

1. _Calculate_ is used when a numerical answer is required. In general, working should be shown, especially where two or more steps are involved.
2. _Classify_ requires candidates to group things based on common characteristics.
3. _Comment_ is intended as an open-ended instruction, inviting candidates to recall or infer points of interest relevant to the context of the question, taking account of the number of marks available.
4. _Compare_ requires candidates to provide both similarities and differences between things or concepts.
5. _Construct_ is often used in relation to chemical equations where a candidate is expected to write a balanced equation, not by factual recall but by analogy or by using information in the question.
6. _Define (the term(s)...)_ is intended literally, only a formal statement or equivalent paraphrase being required.
7. _Describe_ requires candidates to state in words (using diagrams where appropriate) the main points of the topic. It is often used with reference either to particular phenomena or to particular experiments. In the former instance, the term usually implies that the answer should include reference to (visual) observations associated with the phenomena. In the latter instance the answer may often follow a standard pattern, e.g. Apparatus, Method, Measurement, Results and Precautions. In other contexts, _describe and give an account of_ should be interpreted more generally, i.e. the candidate has greater discretion about the nature and the organisation of the material to be included in the answer. _Describe and explain_ may be coupled in a similar way to _state and explain_.
8. _Determine_ often implies that the quantity concerned cannot be measured directly but is obtained by calculation, substituting measured or known values of other quantities into a standard formula.
9. _Discuss_ requires candidates to give a critical account of the points involved in the topic.
10. _Estimate_ implies a reasoned order of magnitude statement or calculation of the quantity concerned, making such simplifying assumptions as may be necessary about the points of principle and about values of quantities not otherwise included in the question.
11. _Explain_ may imply reasoning or some reference to theory, depending on the context.
12. _Find_ is a general term that may be variously interpreted as calculate, measure, determine, etc.
13. _List_ requires a number of points, generally each of one word, with no elaboration. Where a given number of points is specified, this should not be exceeded.
14. _Measure_ implies that the quantity concerned can be directly obtained from a suitable measuring instrument, e.g. length, using a rule, or angle, using a protractor.
15. _Outline_ implies brevity, i.e. restricting the answer to giving essentials.
16. _Predict_ or _deduce_ implies that the candidate is not expected to produce the required answer by recall but by making a logical connection between other pieces of information. Such information may be wholly given in the question or may depend on answers extracted from an earlier part of the question. _Predict_ also implies a concise answer with no supporting statement required.

* 17. _Sketch_, when applied to graph work, implies that the shape and / or position of the curve need only be qualitatively correct, but candidates should be aware that, depending on the context, some quantitative aspects may be looked for, e.g. passing through the origin, having the intercept, asymptote or discontinuity at a particular value. In diagrams, _sketch_ implies that a simple, freehand drawing is acceptable; nevertheless, care should be taken over proportions and the clear exposition of important details.
* 18. _State_ implies a concise answer with little or no supporting argument, e.g. a numerical answer that can be obtained 'by inspection'.
* 19. _Suggest_ is used in two main contexts, i.e. either to imply that there is no unique answer, or to imply that candidates are expected to apply their general knowledge to a 'novel' situation, one that may be formally 'not in the syllabus'.
* 20. _What do you understand by/What is meant by (the term(s)...)_ normally implies that a definition should be given, together with some relevant comment on the significance or context of the term(s) concerned, especially where two or more terms are included in the question. The amount of supplementary comment intended should be interpreted in light of the indicated mark value.

## Special Note

### Nomenclature

Students will be expected to be familiar with the nomenclature used in the syllabus. The proposals in '_Signs, Symbols and Systematics_' (The Association for Science Education Companion to 16-19 Science, 2000) and the recommendations on terms, units and symbols in 'Biological Nomenclature 4th Edition (2009)' published by the Institute of Biology, in conjunction with the ASE, will generally be adopted although the traditional names sulfate, sulfite, nitrate, nitrite, sulfutrous and nitrous acids will be used in question papers. Sulfur (and all compounds of sulfur) will be spelt with (not with ph) in question papers, however students can use either spelling in their answers. It is intended that, in order to avoid difficulties arising out of the use of / as the symbol for litre, use of dm\({}^{3}\) in place of / or litre will be made. In chemistry, full _structural formulae_ (_displayed formulae_) in answers should show in detail both the relative placing of atoms and the number of bonds between atoms. Hence, -CONH\({}_{2}\) and -CO\({}_{2}\)H are not satisfactory as full structural formulae, although either of the usual symbols for the benzene ring is acceptable.

### Units and significant figures

Candidates should be aware that misuse of units and / or significant figures, i.e. failure to quote units where necessary, the inclusion of units in quantities defined as ratios or quoting answers to an inappropriate number of significant figures, is liable to be penalised.

### Calculators

An approved calculator may be used in all papers.

### Geometrical Instruments

Candidates should have geometrical instruments with them for Paper 1 and Paper 2 for syllabus 5086 and 5087.
