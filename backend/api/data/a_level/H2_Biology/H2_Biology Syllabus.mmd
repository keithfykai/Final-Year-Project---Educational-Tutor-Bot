## Preamble

This preamble sets out the approach, objectives, directions and philosophy of the H2 Biology syllabus.

In Singapore, Biology education from Primary to A-Level has been organised as a continuum in the following manner:

* from Primary 3 to Primary 6, students learn about how life works at the systems level
* from Lower Secondary Science to O-Level Biology, students learn about how life works at the physiological level
* at A-Level, students learn about how life works at the cellular and molecular levels while understanding the implications of these at the macro level.

The Biology syllabus is developed as a seamless continuum from O-Level to A-Level, without the need for topics to be revisited at A-Level. The O-Level syllabus is foundational and thus should provide the necessary background for study at A-Level. Students who intend to offer H2 Biology will therefore be assumed to have knowledge and understanding of O-Level Biology, either as a single subject or as part of a balanced science course.

Many new and important fields of biology have emerged through recent advancements in life sciences. Vast amounts of knowledge have been generated, as evident from the sprouting of scientific journals catering to niche areas of research. As such, this syllabus refines and updates the content knowledge of the previous syllabus (9648) so that students can keep up to date with knowledge that is relevant for their participation in a technology-driven economy.

## Introduction

Candidates will be assumed to have knowledge and understanding of O-Level Biology, as a single subject or as part of a balanced science course.

The syllabus has been arranged in the form of Core and Extension content to be studied by all candidates. The syllabus places emphasis on the applications of biology and the impact of recent developments on the needs of contemporary society.

Experimental work is an important component and should underpin the teaching and learning of biology.

The value of learning H2 Biology ultimately hinges on the development of a scientific mind and disposition while addressing the broader questions of what life is and how life is sustained. The Science Curriculum Framework developed by the Ministry of Education elaborates on the development of the scientific mind and disposition. Through the study of the H2 Biology course, students will be prepared for life science-related courses at university and, consequently, careers that are related to this field.

## Aims

The syllabus aims to:

1. provide students with an experience that develops their interest in biology and builds the knowledge, skills and attitudes necessary for further studies in related fields
2. enable students to become scientifically literate citizens who are well prepared for the challenges of the 21st century
3. develop in students the understanding, skills, ethics and attitudes relevant to the _Practices of Science_, including the following: 1. understanding the nature of scientific knowledge 2. demonstrating science inquiry skills 3. relating science and society
4. address the broader questions of what life is and how life is sustained, including: 1. understanding life at the cellular and molecular levels, and making connections to how these micro-systems interact at the physiological and organismal levels 4.2 recognising the evolving nature of biological knowledge 4.3 stimulating interest in and demonstrating care for the local and global environment.

## Practices of Science

Science as a discipline is more than the acquisition of a _body of knowledge_ (e.g. scientific facts, concepts, laws and theories); it is a way of knowing and doing. It includes an understanding of the nature of scientific knowledge and how this knowledge is generated, established and communicated. Scientists rely on a set of established procedures and practices associated with scientific inquiry to gather evidence and test their ideas on how the natural world works. However, there is no single method and the real process of science is often complex and iterative, following many different paths. While science is powerful, generating knowledge that forms the basis for many technological feats and innovations, it has limitations.

The _Practices of Science_ are explicitly articulated in the syllabus to allow teachers to embed them as learning objectives in their lessons. Students' understanding of the nature and limitations of science and scientific inquiry are developed effectively when the practices are taught in the context of relevant science content. Attitudes relevant to science such as _inquistiveness_, _concern for accuracy_ and _precision_, _objectivity_, _integrity_ and _perseverance_ should be emphasised in the teaching of these practices where appropriate. For example, students learning science should be introduced to the use of technology as an aid in practical work or as a tool for the interpretation of experimental and theoretical results.

### _Practices of Science_ comprise three components:

#### 1.1.1 Understanding the Nature of Scientific Knowledge

1.2 Understand that science is an evidence-based, model-building enterprise concerned with the natural world

1.3 Understand that the use of both logic and creativity is required in the generation of scientific knowledge

1.4 Recognise that scientific knowledge is generated from consensus within the community of scientists through a process of critical debate and peer review

1.5 Understand that scientific knowledge is reliable and durable, yet subject to revision in the light of new evidence

#### 1.1.6 Demonstrating Science Inquiry Skills

#### 1.1.7 Identify scientific problems, observe phenomena and pose scientific questions/hypotheses

1.8 Plan and conduct investigations by selecting the appropriate experimental procedures, apparatus and materials, with due regard for accuracy, precision and safety

#### 1.1.9 Obtain, organise and represent data in an appropriate manner

#### 1.1.1 Analyse and interpret data

1.10 Construct explanations based on evidence and justify these explanations through sound reasoning and logical argument

#### 1.1.11 Use appropriate models1 to explain concepts, solve problems and make predictions

Footnote 1: A model is a representation of an idea, an object, a process or a system that is used to describe and explain phenomena that cannot be experienced directly. Models exist in different forms, from the concrete, such as physical scale models, to the abstract, such as diagrams or mathematical expressions. The use of models involves the understanding that all models contain approximations and assumptions limiting their validity and predictive power.

## 3 Relating Science and Society

1 Recognise that the application of scientific knowledge to problem solving could be influenced by other considerations such as economic, social, environmental and ethical factors

2 Demonstrate an understanding of the benefits and risks associated with the application of science to society

3 Use scientific principles and reasoning to understand, analyse and evaluate real-world systems, as well as to generate solutions for problem solving.

## 4 Curriculum Framework

The rapid progress in the field of life sciences poses a challenge for Biology education, especially in terms of designing a framework that integrates fundamental knowledge, skills and attitudes. With this in mind, this syllabus has adopted a framework that will chart a new direction for Biology education. An overview of this framework is depicted in Fig. 1: H2 Biology Curriculum Framework.

The _Practices of Science_ are common to the natural sciences of Physics, Chemistry and Biology. These practices highlight the ways of thinking and doing that are inherent in the scientific approach, with the aim of equipping students with the understanding, skills, and attitudes shared by the scientific disciplines, including an appropriate approach to ethical issues.

The content in this H2 Biology syllabus is organised around four _Core Ideas_ of Biology and two _Extension Topics_. The _Learning Experiences2_ refer to a range of learning opportunities selected by teachers to link the biology content of the _Core Ideas_ and _Extension Topics_ with the _Practices of Science_, to enhance students' learning of the concepts. Rather then being mandatory, teachers are encouraged to incorporate _Learning Experiences_ that match the interests and abilities of their students and provide opportunities to illustrate and exemplify the _Practices of Science_, where appropriate. Real-world contexts can help illustrate the biology concepts and their applications. Experimental activities and ICT tools can also be used to build students' understanding.

Footnote 2: _Learning Experiences_ can be found in the Teaching and Learning Syllabus.

The two _Extension Topics_ are based on important emerging biological issues impacting both the local and global contexts. They require students to demonstrate assimilation of the _Core Ideas_ and extend their knowledge and understanding to real-world challenges. Furthermore, _Extension Topics_ will equip students with the necessary knowledge and process skills to make informed decisions about scientific issues. In line with this, the two _Extension Topics_ chosen are (A) Infectious Diseases and (B) Impact of Climate Change on Animals and Plants. Both _Extension Topics_ take up about 10% of the total H2 Biology curriculum.

Students are expected to study all four _Core Ideas_ and both _Extension Topics_.

Figure 1: H2 Biology Curriculum Framework

## Assessment Objectives

The _Assessment Objectives_ listed below reflect those parts of the _Aims_ and _Practices of Science_ that will be assessed.

### Knowledge with understanding

Candidates should be able to demonstrate knowledge with understanding in relation to:

1. scientific phenomena, facts, laws, definitions, concepts and theories
2. scientific vocabulary, terminology and conventions (including symbols, quantities and units)
3. scientific instruments and apparatus, including techniques of operation and aspects of safety
4. scientific quantities and their determination
5. scientific and technological applications with their social, economic and environmental implications.

The syllabus content defines the factual materials that candidates need to recall and explain. Questions testing the objectives above will often begin with one of the following words: _define_, _state_, _name_, _describe_, _explain or outline_ (see the _Glossary of Terms_).

### Handling, applying and evaluating information

Candidates should be able (in words or by using symbolic, graphical and numerical forms of presentation) to:

1. locate, select, organise, interpret and present information from a variety of sources
2. handle information, distinguishing the relevant from the extraneous
3. manipulate numerical and other data and translate information from one form to another
4. present reasoned explanations for phenomena, patterns, trends and relationships

9. use skills, knowledge and understanding from different areas of Biology to solve problems
10. organise and present information, ideas and arguments clearly and coherently, using appropriate language.

These _Assessment Objectives_ above cannot be precisely specified in the syllabus content because questions testing such skills are often based on information which is unfamiliar to the candidate. In answering such questions, candidates are required to use principles and concepts that are within the syllabus and apply them in a logical, reasoned or deductive manner to a novel situation. Questions testing these objectives may begin with one of the following words: _discuss_, _predict_, _suggest_, _calculate_ or _determine_ (see the _Glossary of Terms_).

## Appendix C Experimental skills and investigations

Candidates should be able to:

1. follow a detailed sequence of instructions or apply standard techniques

_Paper 2_ (2 h, 100 marks)

This paper will consist of a variable number of structured questions, all compulsory, including data-based or comprehension-type questions. These include questions which require candidates to integrate knowledge and understanding from different areas of the syllabus.

_Paper 3_ (2 h, 75 marks)

This paper will consist of a variable number of long structured questions, all compulsory, including data-based or comprehension-type questions and one free-response question of 25 marks. These include questions that assess the higher-order skills of analysing, making conclusions and evaluating information and require candidates to integrate knowledge and understanding from different areas of the syllabus.

_Section A_ (50 marks) will comprise two or more compulsory long structured questions. There will be one or more stimulus materials that may be taken or adapted from a source such as a scientific journal or book. This material may not necessarily relate directly to the content of the syllabus. Questions may require candidates to explain terms used in the passage, analyse data, justify decisions, perform calculations and draw conclusions based on information in the stimulus material.

_Section B_ (25 marks) will comprise two free-response questions, from which candidates will choose **one**. The quality of scientific argumentation and written communication will be given a percentage of the marks available.

_Paper 4_ (2 h 30 min, 55 marks)

This paper will assess appropriate aspects of Assessment Objectives C1 to C6 in the following skill areas:

* Planning (P)
* Manipulation, measurement and observation (MMO)
* Presentation of data and observations (PDO)
* Analysis, conclusions and evaluation (ACE).

The assessment of skill area P will have a weighting of 5%, and the skill areas MMO, PDO and ACE will have a weighting of 15%. Candidates will require access to apparatus, as stated in the Confidential Instructions. For some questions, candidates may be allocated a specific time for access to the apparatus. Paper 4 may also include data handling/interpretation questions that do not require apparatus, in order to test the skill areas of PDO and ACE.

Candidates are **NOT** allowed to refer to notebooks, textbooks or any other information in the Practical Examination.

## Additional Information

Modern biological sciences draw extensively on concepts from the physical sciences. It is desirable therefore that, by the end of the course, students should have knowledge of the following topics, sufficient to aid understanding of biological systems. No questions will be set directly on them except where relevant to the assessment of a Learning Outcome.

* The electromagnetic spectrum
* Energy changes (potential energy, activation energy, chemical bond energy)
* Molecules, atoms, ions, electrons
* Acids, bases, pH, buffers
* Isotopes, including radioactive isotopes
* Oxidation and reduction
* Hydrolysis, condensation

### Nomenclature

Candidates will be expected to be familiar with the nomenclature used in the syllabus. The proposals in "_Signs, Symbols and Systematics_" (The Association for Science Education Companion to 16-19 Science, 2000) and the recommendations on terms, units and symbols in "_Biological Nomenclature_" (2009) published by the Institute of Biology, in conjunction with the ASE, will generally be adopted although the traditional names sulfate, sulfite, nitrate, nitrite, sulfutrous acid and nitrous acid will be used in question papers. Sulfur (and all compounds of sulfur) will be spelt with f (not with ph) in question papers. However, candidates can use either spelling in their answers.

### Disallowed Subject Combinations

Candidates may not simultaneously offer Biology at H1 and H2 Levels.

### Units and Significant Figures

Candidates should be aware that misuse of units and/or significant figures, e.g. failure to quote units where necessary, the inclusion of units in quantities defined as ratios or quoting answers to an inappropriate number of significant figures, is liable to be penalised.

## Practical Assessment

Scientific subjects are, by their nature, experimental. It is therefore important that, wherever possible, the candidates carry out appropriate practical work to support the learning of this subject and to develop the expected practical skills.

### Paper 4 Practical

This paper is designed to assess candidates' competence in those practical skills which can realistically be assessed within the context of a formal practical assessment.

Candidates will be assessed in the following skill areas:

1. Planning (P) Candidates should be able to: * define the question/problem using appropriate knowledge and understanding * give a clear, logical account of the experimental procedure to be followed * describe how the data should be used in order to reach a conclusion * assess the risks of the experiment and describe precautions that should be taken to keep risks to a minimum.
2. Manipulation, measurement and observation (MMO) Candidates should be able to: * demonstrate a high level of manipulative skills in all aspects of practical activity * make and record accurate observations with good details and measurements to an appropriate degree of precision * make appropriate decisions about measurements or observations * recognise anomalous observations and/or measurements (where appropriate) with reasons indicated.
3. Presentation of data and observations (PDO) Candidates should be able to: * present all information in an appropriate form * manipulate measurements effectively in order to identify trends/patterns * present all quantitative data to an appropriate number of decimal places/significant figures.
4. Analysis, conclusions and evaluation (ACE) Candidates should be able to: * analyse and interpret data or observations appropriately in relation to the task * draw conclusion(s) from the interpretation of experimental data or observations and underlying principles * make predictions based on their data and conclusions * identify significant sources of errors, limitations of measurements and/or experimental procedures used, and explain how they affect the final result(s) * state and explain how significant errors/limitations may be overcome/reduced, as appropriate, including how experimental procedures may be improved.

One or more of the questions may incorporate some assessment of skill P, set in the context of the syllabus content, requiring candidates to apply and integrate knowledge and understanding from different sections of the syllabus. These questions may also require the treatment of given experimental data to draw a relevant conclusion and analyse the proposed plan.

The assessment of skills MMO, PDO and ACE will also be set mainly in the context of the syllabus content and will require access to apparatus, as stated in the Confidential Instructions. For some questions, candidates may be allocated a specific time for access to the apparatus. The assessment of PDO and ACE may also include questions on data analysis which do not require practical equipment and apparatus.

Within the Scheme of Assessment, Paper 4 is weighted to 20% of the Higher 2 assessment. It is therefore recommended that the schemes of work include learning opportunities that apportion a commensurate amount of time for the development and acquisition of practical skills. The guidance for practical work, which is published separately, will provide examples of practical activities.

Candidates are **NOT** allowed to refer to notebooks, textbooks or any other information in the Practical examination.

### Apparatus List

This list given below has been drawn up in order to give guidance to Centres concerning the apparatus that is expected to be generally available for examination purposes. The list is not intended to be exhaustive and practical examinations may require additional apparatus and materials that will be specified in the Confidential instructions, e.g. enzymes, indicators, plastic straws, etc. Furthermore, general laboratory glassware and items that are commonly regarded as standard equipment in a Biology laboratory (e.g. Bunsen burners, tripods and gauze, thermostatically controlled water-baths, safety goggles, disposable gloves, paper towels, etc.) are not included in this list.

## Mathematical Requirements

Questions set in the examination may involve the basic processes of mathematics for the calculation and use of decimals, means, ratios and percentages.

Candidates may be required to (i) construct graphs or present data in other suitable graphical forms, and (ii) calculate rates of processes.

Candidates should be aware of the problems of drawing conclusions from limited data and should appreciate levels of significance, standard deviation and probability, and the use of \(t\)- and chi-squared tests.

### Notes on the Use of Statistics in Biology

Candidates should know how to apply a \(t\)-test and a chi-squared test. \(t\)-tests are of value in much of Biology, while the chi-squared test allows the evaluation of the results of breeding experiments and ecological sampling. Each of these tests is dealt with fully in many books on statistics for Biology.

Candidates are not expected to remember the following equations or what the symbols stand for. They are expected to be able to use the equations to calculate standard deviations, to test for significant differences between the means of two small unpaired samples and to perform a chi-squared test on suitable data from genetics or ecology. Candidates will be given access to the equations, the meaning of the symbols, a \(t\)-table and a chi-squared table.

\[\begin{array}{ll}\text{standard deviation}&s=\sqrt{\frac{\sum\left(x- \overline{x}\right)^{2}}{n-1}}\\ t\text{-test}&t=\frac{\left|\vec{r}_{1}-\vec{x}_{2}\right|}{\sqrt{\left( \frac{s_{1}^{2}}{n_{1}}+\frac{s_{2}^{2}}{n_{2}}\right)}}&\nu=n_{1}+n_{2}-2\\ \chi^{2}\text{ test}&\chi^{2}=\sum\frac{\left(\text{O}-\text{E}\right)^{2}}{ \text{E}}&\nu=\text{c}-1\end{array}\]

### Key to symbols

\[\begin{array}{ll}s\text{*}=\text{standard deviation}&\sum\text{= `sum of}&\overline{x}=\text{ mean}\\ n=\text{sample size (number of observations)}&x=\text{observation}\\ v=\text{degrees of freedom}&\text{O}=\text{observed `value'}\\ \text{E}=\text{expected `value'}&\text{c}=\text{number of classes}\end{array}\]

\({}^{\star}\)Candidates should note that on some calculators the symbol \(\sigma\) may appear instead of the symbol \(s\).

Candidates are not expected to be familiar with the term _standard error_, nor to appreciate the difference between \(s_{n}(\sigma_{n})\) and \(s_{n-1}(\sigma_{n-1})\). \(\chi^{2}\) tests will only be expected on one row of data. Candidates should have a brief understanding of what is meant by the term _normal distribution_ and appreciate levels of significance. (Tables will be provided.) Questions involving the use of a \(t\)-test or \(\chi^{2}\) test may be set on Papers 1, 2 and 3. Questions involving an understanding of the use of the tests may be set on Paper 4 but detailed computation will not be required.

### Calculators

Any calculator used must be on the Singapore Examinations and Assessment Board list of approved calculators.

## Glossary of Terms

It is hoped that the glossary (which is relevant only to science subjects) will prove helpful to candidates as a guide; it is neither exhaustive nor definitive. The glossary has been deliberately kept brief not only with respect to the number of terms included but also to the descriptions of their meanings. Candidates should appreciate that the meaning of a term must depend in part on its context.

1. _Analyse_ is a context-specific term involving the identification of the constituent parts of a complex situation or result, an assessment of their individual implications and a consideration of how these relate to one another and to scientific knowledge and understanding. Analysis may require further processing of mathematical data to reveal underlying trends and patterns.
2. _Calculate_ is used when a numerical answer is required. In general, working should be shown, especially where two or more steps are involved.
3. _Classify_ requires candidates to group things based on common characteristics.
4. _Comment_ is intended as an open-ended instruction, inviting candidates to recall or infer points of interest relevant to the context of the question, taking account of the number of marks available.
5. _Compare_ requires candidates to provide both the similarities and differences between things or concepts.
6. _Deduce_ is used in a similar way as predict except that some supporting statement is required, e.g. reference to a law/principle, or the necessary reasoning is to be included in the answer.
7. _Define_ (the term(s)...) is intended literally. Only a formal statement or equivalent paraphrase is required.
8. _Describe_ requires candidates to state in words (using diagrams where appropriate) the main points of the topic. It is often used with reference either to particular phenomena or to particular experiments. In the former instance, the term usually implies that the answer should include reference to (visual) observations associated with the phenomena. In other contexts, describe and give an account of should be interpreted more generally, i.e. the candidate has greater discretion about the nature and the organisation of the material to be included in the answer. Describe and explain may be coupled in a similar way to state and explain.
9. _Determine_ often implies that the quantity concerned cannot be measured directly but is obtained by calculation, substituting measured or known values of other quantities into a standard formula, e.g. relative molecular mass.
10. _Discuss_ requires candidates to give a critical account of the points involved in the topic.
11. _Draw_ is often used in the context of drawing biological specimens. This is an instruction to make a freehand diagram to show the structures observed, as accurately as possible with respect to shape and proportion. Lines delimiting distinct regions should be continuous. In other contexts, this will require an accurate representation of the required subject according to the applicable conventions and criteria, e.g. draw the structure of a molecule of glucose.
12. _Estimate_ implies a reasoned order of magnitude statement or calculation of the quantity concerned, making such simplifying assumptions as may be necessary about points of principle and about the values of quantities not otherwise included in the question.
13. _Evaluate_ is a context-specific term requiring a critical use of information to make a judgement or determination of a particular value or quality (e.g. accuracy). Evaluation of the validity of an experimental procedure, a set of results or a conclusion involves an assessment of the extent to which the procedures, results or conclusions are likely to obtain or represent a 'true' outcome. This will require consideration of the advantages and disadvantages, strengths and weaknesses, and limitations of the underlying approach, as well as other relevant criteria as applicable, and their relative importance.
14. _Explain_ may imply reasoning or some reference to theory, depending on the context.

15. _Find_ is a general term that may variously be interpreted as calculate, measure, determine, etc.
16. _Justify_ requires candidates to give reasoning in support of an answer (for example, a decision, conclusion, explanation or claim), based on a consideration of available evidence, including experimental data, together with relevant scientific knowledge and understanding.
17. _Label_ requires candidates to use an appropriate label (and labelling line, where necessary) to accurately show the position of a structure, region or point within a diagram or graph, according to the requirements of the assessment.
18. _List_ requires a number of points, generally each of one word, with no elaboration. Where a given number of points is specified, this should not be exceeded.
19. _Measure_ implies that the quantity concerned can be directly obtained from a suitable measuring instrument, e.g. length, using a rule, or angle, using a protractor.
20. _Outline_ implies brevity, i.e. restricting the answer to giving essentials.
21. _Predict_ implies that the candidate is not expected to produce the required answer by recall but by making a logical connection between other pieces of information. Such information may be wholly given in the question or may depend on answers extracted in an early part of the question.
22. _Recognise_ is often used to identify facts, characteristics or concepts that are critical (relevant/ appropriate) to the understanding of a situation, event, process or phenomenon.
23. _Sketch_, when applied to graph work, implies that the shape and/or position of the curve need only be qualitatively correct, but candidates should be aware that, depending on the context, some quantitative aspects may be looked for, e.g. passing through the origin, having an intercept, asymptote or discontinuity at a particular value. In diagrams, sketch implies that a simple, freehand drawing is acceptable; nevertheless, care should be taken over proportions and the clear exposition of important details.
24. _State_ implies a concise answer with little or no supporting argument, e.g. a numerical answer that can be obtained 'by inspection'.
25. _Suggest_ is used in two main contexts, i.e. either to imply that there is no unique answer (e.g. in chemistry, two or more substances may satisfy the given conditions describing an 'unknown'), or to imply that candidates are expected to apply their general knowledge to a 'novel' situation, one that may be formally 'not in the syllusus'.
26. _What is meant by (the term(s)...)_ normally implies that a definition should be given, together with some relevant comment on the significance or context of the term(s) concerned, especially where two or more terms are included in the question. The amount of supplementary comment intended should be interpreted in the light of the indicated mark value.
