QUADRATIC EQUATIONS AND ITS ROOTS

A quadratic equation is usually expressed in the form of \(ax^{2}+bx+c=0\).

Methods to solve quadratic equations and obtain its roots (solutions):

1. Factorisation

Solving the equation gives \(x=\alpha\) or \(x=\beta\)
2. Quadratic formula

\[x=\frac{-b\pm\sqrt{b^{2}-4ac}}{2a}\quad\text{where},a\neq 0\]

This is the reason why the discriminant matters! Can you guess why?

## 6 Solving Quadratic Inequalities

Step 1: Beyond the equation and make one-side equals to zero.

Step 2: Retrofe the quadratic equation into this form

\(\alpha(x-x_{0})(x-x_{0})=(0)\)

Step 3: Sketch the quadratic graph

(Make use of the coefficient of \(\alpha^{2}\) to define the shape of graph)

See 4-label theorems of the graph

Step 5-Shade the region between the curve and the 2-axis and you will obtain your answer.

If you need a question example for better understanding, check out this video on Overmugged's TikTok channel: [https://w.tiktok.com/Z5fi43eEf/](https://w.tiktok.com/Z5fi43eEf/)CONDITIONS FOR QUADRATIC EQUATION TO BE ALWAYS POSITIVE OR ALWAYS NEGATIVE

ALWAYS POSITIVE

1. Coefficient of \(x^{2},\)_also known as \(a\ >0\)_
2. Discriminant \(b^{2}-4ac\ <0\)

ALWAYS NEGATIVE

1. Coefficient of \(x^{2},\)_also known as \(a\ <0\)_
2. Discriminant \(b^{2}-4ac\ <0\)

Discriminant must always be negative as there should not be any intersections between the curve and the \(x\)-axis for it to always be above or below the \(x\)-axis.
