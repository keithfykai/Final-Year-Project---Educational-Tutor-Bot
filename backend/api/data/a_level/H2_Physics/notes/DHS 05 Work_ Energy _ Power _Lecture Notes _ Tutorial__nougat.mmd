1. _define and use work done by a force as the product of the force and displacement in the direction of the force_ Work is a concept that provides a link between force and energy. Do not be misled by the many different meanings of the work in ordinary conversation - doing homework, going to work or having too much work to do. Not everything we call work in conversation is work in the physics sense of the word. We will now define work - in the physics sense.

**Work done (by a constant force)** Work done by a constant force on an object is defined as the product of the force and its displacement in the direction of the force.

1. _W = (F cos_ \(\theta\)_s_ W = \(F\) (s cos_ \(\theta\)_)_s_ W = \(F\) (s cos_ \(\theta\)_)_s_ S _S

**Example 1**

A man of mass 60 kg carrying a pair of 20 kg walks on a level road for 10 m. What is the work done by the man in carrying the load?

**Example 2**

A physics book is pushed 1.20 m along a horizontal tabletop by a horizontal force of 2.00 N. The opposing force of friction is 0.400 N.

(a) How much work is done on the book by the 2.00 N force?

(b) What is the work done on the book by the friction force?

(c) What is the total work done on the book?

**Example 3**

A 5.00 kg block slides from rest down a 2.50 m long rough incline of 30\({}^{\circ}\). A friction force of 18.5 N acts on the block throughout the motion.

**Determine**

(a) the work done by the force of gravity.

(b) the work done by friction force between the block and the incline.

(c) the work done by the normal force.

(d) the total work done on the block.

**Note:**

1 When several forces act on an object, the total (or net) work done is the sum of the work done by each force separately, that is, \(W_{\text{total}}=W_{1}+W_{2}+W_{3}+\ldots=\Sigma W_{i}\)

2 Another way to calculate the total work done is to find the work done by the net force as if there were a single force acting and then using the definition of work, that is,

\(W_{\text{total}}=(F_{\text{net}}\cos\ \theta)s\)

where \(\theta\) is the angle between \(F_{\text{net}}\) and the displacement \(s\).

* _calculate the work done in a number of situations including the work done by a gas which is expanding against a constant external pressure: W = P.\(\Delta\)V_
* _deduce the elastic potential energy in a deformed material is related to the area under the force-extension graph_ Graphical interpretation of work done
* 1. If a constant force acts on an object over a displacement \(s\), then the force-displacement graph would look like the one on the right. Work done \(W=Fs\) = area under the force-displacement graph
* 2. For a variable force, the work done on an object that undergoes a displacement is still equal to the area under the force-displacement graph, that is, \(W=\int Fdx\)
* 2. The force on an object, acting along the \(x\) axis, varies as shown in the figure. Determine the work done by this force to move the object (a) from \(x=0\) to \(x=10\) m, and (b) from \(x=0\) to \(x=15\) m

**Work done to stretch a spring**

If the spring obeys Hooke's law, \(F=k\epsilon\), that is, the displacement \(e\) of the spring is proportional to the force \(F\) applied on it.

The work done \(W\) by the force in stretching the spring is given by the area under the force-extension graph. This work done is stored as elastic potential energy \(U\) in the spring.

\(U=\frac{1}{2}F\epsilon=\frac{1}{2}\,k\epsilon^{2}\)

**Work done by a gas during expansion**

Consider a quantity of gas, at pressure \(p\), in a syringe which has a frictionless piston as shown in the diagram. If the piston has cross-sectional area \(A\), the force exerted by the gas on the piston is \(F=pA\)

If the gas expands slowly (so that we may consider the pressure of the gas to be constant) against a constant external pressure moving outwards a displacement \(s\), then the force \(F\) is constant.

The work done by the gas in expanding from \(V_{1}\) to \(V_{2}\)

\(W=F.s=(pA)s=p(As)\)\(=p\triangle V\)\(=p(V_{2}-V_{1})\)

Note:

When the gas expands (\(V_{2}>V_{1}\)), work done by the gas \(W\) is positive.

When the gas is compressed (\(V_{2}<V_{1}\)), work done by the gas \(W\) is negative.

Graphically, work done \(W=\int p\partial V\), i.e., the area under the pressure-volume graph.

* _Swinging pendulum: gravitational potential energy of body converted to kinetic energy and vice versa._
* _Diver on springboard: Chemical energy stored in body of diver allows him to compress diving board causing the bent springboard to store elastic potential energy which is then reconverted into kinetic energy for the diver by giving him an upward push._
* _Burning of fuels: Stored chemical energy in the fuels is converted into heat and radiant energy._
* _Connecting a battery to a filament lamp: Stored chemical energy in the cells is converted into electrical energy, which in turn is converted in the filament into heat and radiant energy._* _derive, from the equations for uniformly accelerated motion in a straight line, the equation_ \(E_{k}=\frac{1}{2}mv^{2}\)__
* _recall and use the equation_ \(E_{k}=\frac{1}{2}mv^{2}\)__

The energy that a body possesses solely due **to its motion** is called kinetic energy.

If a body of mass \(m\) is moving with speed \(\nu\), then its

\[\boxed{kinetic\;energy\,E_{k}=\frac{1}{2}mv^{2}}\]

Kinetic energy is a scalar quantity and its SI unit is the joule (J).

**To derive \(E_{k}=\gamma mv^{2}\) from the equations of motion**

Consider a stationary body of mass \(m\) which moves a horizontal displacement \(s\) under the action of a constant net force \(F\).

Since the force is constant, the body moves with a constant acceleration \(a\) given by Newton's second law of motion:

\[F=ma\]

When the body undergoes a displacement \(s\), its final velocity \(\nu\) can be found from the following equation of motion:

\[\nu^{2}=u^{2}+2as\] or \[s=\frac{\nu^{2}}{2a}\hskip 28.452756pt\text{since $u=0$}\]

The work done on the body \(W=F.s\)

\[=m\omega\left(\frac{\nu^{2}}{2a}\right)\] \[=\frac{1}{2}mv^{2}\]

The work done by force \(F\) increases the kinetic energy of the body. Hence the kinetic energy of the body at speed \(\nu\) is \(E_{k}=\frac{1}{2}mv^{2}\).

In general, when work is done by a force \(F\) acting over a distance \(s\) on a body, and the speed of a body, with mass \(m\), increases from \(u\) to \(v\) then

\[F\!s =\frac{1}{2}mv^{2}-\frac{1}{2}mu^{2}\] \[W =\left(E_{k}\right)_{final}-\left(E_{k}\right)_{initial}\] \[W =\Delta E_{k}\]

the work done by a resultant external force on a body = change in kinetic energy of the body. When the work done is positive, the speed of the body increases, increasing the kinetic energy. When the work done is negative, the speed of the body decreases, decreasing the kinetic energy.

**Example 5**

A car of mass 800 kg and moving at 30 m s-1 along a horizontal road is brought to rest by a constant retarding force of 5000 N. Calculate the distance the car moves while coming to rest.

_derive, from the definition of work done by a force, the equation \(E_{p}=mgh\) for potential energy changes near the Earth's surface_

_recall and use the equation \(E_{p}=mgh\) for gravitational potential energy changes near the Earth's surface_

The energy that a body possesses due to its position relative to other objects, stresses within itself, its electric charge or state is called potential energy. Potential energy (p.e.) is a scalar quantity and its SI unit is the joule (J). Examples of potential energies are gravitational p.e., elastic p.e., and electric p.e.

Consider an object at a certain height \(h_{1}\) from the ground raised by a constant force \(F\) equal and opposite to the weight of the object. The object moves at constant speed to a height \(h_{2}\) (to ensure that no work is used to increase its kinetic energy)

_Weight mg = \(F\)_

Work done by the force \(F\) is

\(W\) = force x displacement in the direction of the force

 = \(F\)\(\Delta h\)

 = \(F\)\((h_{2}-h_{1})\)

 = \(mg\)\((h_{2}-h_{1})\)

 = \(mgh_{2}-mgh_{1}\)

 = final GPE - initial GPE

Work done by a force in raising an object through a vertical height \(h\) at a constant speed results in a change in gravitational potential energy of the object.

Hence gravitational potential energy is defined as \(E_{p}\) = \(mgh\)

In solving problems involving gravitational potential energy, it is important to choose a reference level where the \(E_{p}\) = 0 J. The choice of zero level is arbitrary because the important quantity is the difference in potential energy and this difference is independent of the choice of zero level.

Note:

1) \(E_{p}\) = \(mgh\) is the potential energy of a body mass \(m\) at a height \(h\) above the Earth's surface. This value of \(E_{p}\) for the body is not absolute but depends on the reference level chosen. In this case, \(E_{p}\) is taken to be zero on the Earth's surface (ground).

2) \(E_{p}\) = \(mgh\) is valid for small distances \(h\) near the Earth's surface where \(g\) can be taken to be constant.

**Example 6**

A vehicle of mass 1000 kg moves from point A to point B then to point C. What is the gain in gravitational potential energy (a) at B? (b) at C?

_(i)_ _show an understanding of and use the relationship between force and potential energy in a uniform field to solve problems_

Two categories of forces exist in nature - conservative and non-conservative forces.

A force is conservative if the work the force does on an object moving between two points is independent of the path the object takes between the points.

In other words, the work done on an object by a conservative force depends only on the initial and final positions of the object. Examples of conservative forces: gravitational force, electric force between charges, elastic force in springs.

A force is non-conservative if the work the force does on an object depends on the path taken by the object between its starting and final points. Examples of non-conservative forces: friction, drag force. These are also called dissipative forces.

In the derivation of the formula for potential energy,

Work done by \(F=F\Delta h=final\)\(GPE-Initial\)\(GPE\)\(F\Delta h=\Delta E_{p}\)\(F=\Delta E_{p}/\Delta h\)\(\Delta h\)\(F_{g}=-F_{g}\) (weight of the object),

\[F_{g}=-\frac{\Delta E_{p}}{\Delta h}\]

Taking the limit that \(\Delta h\to 0\),

\[F_{g}=-\frac{dE_{p}}{dh}\]

This result can be generalized to all conservative forces such that the conservative force \(F\) is related to the potential energy \(U\) such that

\[F=-\frac{dU}{dx}\]

The gradient of the potential energy - displacement graph gives the magnitude of the conservative force. In addition, the force points in the direction of decreasing potential energy.

**Example 7**: The gravitational potential energy of a mass \(m\) with respect to a reference level is \(U=mgx\).

Sketch the graphs of the (a) gravitational potential energy \(U\) against \(x\). (b) gravitational force \(F\) against \(x\).

This is an example of a uniform field in which the force on the mass is independent of the position of the mass in the field.

**Example 8**

The elastic potential energy in a spring \(U=\frac{1}{2}\,kx^{2}\) Sketch

the graph of the elastic force \(F\) against \(x\).

The elastic force \(F=-\frac{dU}{dx}=-\frac{d}{dx}\bigg{(}\frac{1}{2}\,kx^{2}\,\bigg{)}=-kx\)

**Note**:

The elastic force is negative because the force acts in opposite direction to displacement \(x\).

_(c)_ _give examples of energy in different forms, its conversion and conservation, and apply the principle of energy conservation_

The sum of kinetic energy and potential energy is called mechanical energy.

The principle of conservation of mechanical energy states that in the absence of any net external force, the total mechanical energy of the system is conserved.

In equation form, this means that the final value of the mechanical energy is the same as its initial value:

\[(E_{K}+E_{P})_{i}=(E_{K}+E_{P})_{i}\]

This principle offers keen insight into the way in which the physical universe operates. While the sum of the kinetic and potential energies at any point is conserved, the two forms may be inter-converted or transformed into one another.

**Example 9**

A motorcyclist is trying to leap across the canyon by diving horizontally off the cliff at a speed of 38 m s\({}^{-1}\). Ignoring air resistance, determine the speed with which the cyclist strikes the ground on the other side.

Hint:

Once the cyclist leave the ground, only the weight acts on the cycle since air resistance is ignored. So work done by non-conservative forces is zero. Applying conservation of mechanical energy, total mechanical energy is the same at the initial and final position of cyclist.

\({}^{\star}\)Additional: Try solving this question using kinematics equations you learnt in Topic 2.

Most moving objects experience dissipative forces e.g. friction, drag and the work done by these forces is not zero. In these situations, the total mechanical energy is not conserved. The work done by dissipative forces equal the loss in the mechanical energy, that is,

Initial mechanical energy + work done by dissipative forces = final mechanical energy

\((E_{K}+E_{P})+W_{G}=(E_{K}+E_{P})_{t}\)

Note:

The work done by the dissipative forces \(W_{G}\) is negative (as the forces always act in opposite direction to the displacement).

**Example 10**

Consider a ball of mass 200 g falling from rest through air. If its speed is 15 m s-1 after falling through a distance of 20 m. (a) How much energy is lost as work done against drag? (b) What is the average drag experienced by the ball?

**Example 11**

A 0.400 kg bead slides on a curved wire, starting from rest at point A. (a) If the wire is frictionless, determine the speed of the bead at B and C. (b) If there is a constant friction force of 2.0 N, determine the speed of the bead at B and C. The length of wire AB is 6.0 m and BC is 3.0 m.

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:16]

**Example 13**

Find the power developed by the engine of 1600 kg car moving at 90 km h-1 on a level road if the total resistive force is 700 N. What is the power required if the car is to move with the same speed, up a slope that is inclined at 10\({}^{\circ}\) to the horizontal?

**Example 14**

A 1000 kg lift carries a maximum load of 800 kg. A constant frictional force of 4000 N retards its motion upward. What minimum power must the motor deliver to lift the fully loaded lift at a constant speed of 3.00 m s-1?_(a) show an appreciation for the implications of energy losses in practical devices and use the concept of efficiency to solve problems_

In machines, due to inevitable work done by frictional forces, the energy conversion can never be 100%; the (useful) energy output is always less than the energy input.

**Energy Input = Useful Energy Output + Energy Loss**

The efficiency of a machine in its conversion of energy from one form to another is defined as:

efficiency \(\eta=\frac{\textit{useful energy output}}{\textit{total energy input}}\)\(x100\%\)

Alternatively, \(\eta=\frac{\textit{useful power output}}{\textit{total power input}}\)\(x100\%\)

**Example 15**

Water flows over a section of Niagara Falls at a rate of 5.0 x 10\({}^{6}\) kg each second and falls 50 m.

(a) How much power is generated by the falling water?

(b) Assuming a efficiency of 95% in converting mechanical energy to electrical energy, how many 100 W bulbs could this light?

**Example 16**

A car has a mass of 800 kg and its efficiency is rated at 18% (i.e. 18% of the available fuel energy is delivered to the wheels). Determine the amount of petrol used to accelerate the car from rest to 30 m s-1. Use the fact that 1 kg of petrol supplies 5.0 x 10\({}^{7}\) J of energy.

(300 W)20 Data based Question In the USA, cars account for about half the oil consumed, half the urban pollution and a quarter of emission of greenhouse gases. Vehicle usage is set to continue its growth globally. With improved technology over the past decade, electric vehicle is touted to be a greener alternative to conventional cars powered by fossil fuels. The following tables gives the specifications of variants of the same model of car, Ford Focus, one oil-powered (named 'Classic') and one electric-powered (named 'Electric'). Specifications for two variants of Ford Focus:

(113 g) Comment on whether the Electric variant of Ford Focus is more environmentally friendly than the Classic variant in the context of Singapore.

* One of the key challenges facing electric car manufacturers is how to reduce the long charging time for the vehicle battery pack. A particular electric car has a charging power rating of 20 kW. However, the charging power will decay as the battery gets charged up. It takes about 5 hours for the battery pack to charge fully from empty state. The figure below shows how the charging power varies with time.
* Estimate the amount of energy that the battery can store at full capacity.
* Another manufacturer has invented a better charging technology that allows the decay in charging power to be delayed. Assuming that the maximum charging power of this charger is still 20 kW and that the capacity of the battery remains the same, sketch, in the graph above, its corresponding charging curve for the same battery. Label this graph A.
