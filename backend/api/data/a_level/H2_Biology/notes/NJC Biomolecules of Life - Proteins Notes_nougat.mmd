## 1 Introduction

Proteins are highly diverse. The diversity in protein structures allow them to carry out many different functions (Figure 1).

Figure 1: Overview of protein functions (Campbell, et al., 2018).

## 2 Amino acids

Amino acids are the building blocks or monomers of proteins. There are 20 common amino acids that are used in the biosynthesis of proteins by cells. These amino acids can be divided into essential and non-essential amino acids.

* Essential amino acids must be obtained from the diet because organisms lack the long and complex reaction pathways required for their synthesis. This is to ensure proper nitrogen balance and adequate growth.
* Non-essential amino acids are synthesized from readily available metabolites.

## 3 Basic structure of an amino acid

Figure 2 shows the general structure of an amino acid which consists of a central carbon atom, known as the \(\alpha\)-carbon, bonded to 4 different groups:

* a hydrogen atom
* an amino group (-NH\({}_{2}\))
* a carboxyl group (-COOH)
* a variable R group / side chain which is unique to each amino acid.

The R group may be a hydrogen atom or hydrocarbon chain or cyclic structure containing varying functional groups, The different R groups of amino acids determines their physical and chemical properties.

Figure 2: General structure of an amino acid

## 0.2 Properties of Amino acids

* Amino acids are amphoteric because they contain a basic group (amino group which can accept H+) and an acidic group (carboxyl group which can donate H+) (Figure 3).
* Amino acids are soluble in water and ionise to form zwitterions, ions with both positive and negative charges (Figure 3).
* The amino group receives an H+ and becomes positively-charged.
* The carboxyl group dissociates, releasing H+ and becomes negatively-charged.
* Due to their amphoteric property, amino acids can resist slight pH changes, thus serving as pH buffers (Figure 3). A buffer minimises changes in pH when a small amount of acid or alkali is added to it. Such property is essential in biological system where any sudden change in pH could adversely affect the performance of proteins like enzymes.

Amino acids are classified according to the properties of their R group (Figure 4 and Figure 5).

Figure 4: Classification of R groups of amino acids

Figure 3: Amino acids can act as acid and as base (Garrett & Grisham, 2010)Within your syllabus, you will need to be familiar with the following amino acids:

* The simplest amino acid is glycine (Gly or G) as it only has a hydrogen atom as the R-group.
* Lysine (Lys or K) has a basic R group (positively-charged), which is important for the packing of negatively-charged DNA (cross reference to topic: Eukaryotic Genomes).
* Cysteine (Cys or C) is the only amino acid with a sulfhydryl (-SH) group and hence the only amino acid that can form disulfide bond.
* Methionine (Met or M) is an important amino acid for protein synthesis is it is coded by the start codon AUG.
* Glutamate (Glu or G) has a carboxyl group in its side chain which makes it hydrophilic. In sickle cell anaemia, mutation in haemoglobin causes glutamate to be substituted with valine (Val or V), an amino acid with a non-polar R-group, and so it is hydrophobic (cross reference to topic: Mutations).

## 4 Four Levels of Protein Structure

[frame=lines,width=1cm] LO: (m) Explain primary structure, secondary structure, tertiary structure and quaternary structure of proteins, and describe the types of bonds that hold the molecule in shape (hydrogen, ionic and disulfide bonds, and hydrophobic interactions)

There are four levels of structural organisation in proteins: **primary**, **secondary**, ** tertiary** and **quaternary**. Note that not all proteins possess all four levels.

### Primary structure

* The primary structure of a protein refers to the specific number and sequence of amino acids joined by peptide bonds in a polypeptide chain.
* The total possible number of different combinations of polypeptide chains can be denoted as nr, where n = number of different amino acids and r = number of residues in polypeptide chain.
* The sequence of amino acids determines the type and location of chemical interactions, and hence the pattern of folding which confers the specific three-dimensional conformation of a particular protein.
* The sequence of amino acids is determined by the sequence of DNA in the cell (cross reference topic: Nucleic Acids and Central Dogma).

### Secondary structure

* The secondary structure of proteins consists of repeated coiling or folding of a polypeptide chain in a specific pattern.
* These coils and folds are maintained by hydrogen bonds between oxygen of -C=O in a peptide bond and hydrogen of -N-H in a peptide bond.
* The side chains or R-groups are not involved in the secondary structure.
* There are two common types of secondary structure: a-helix and b-pleated sheet.
* Regions of polypeptide chains without a regular secondary structure are described to have a random coil or loop conformation.

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:10]

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:11]

## Appendix C Tertiary structure

* The tertiary structure of proteins refers to the unique three-dimensional conformation formed by further coiling and folding of a single polypeptide.
* As a result of the coiling and folding, amino acids that are far apart in the primary structure and in different types of secondary structure may interact within the completely folded protein.
* It is stabilised by four types of interactions: hydrogen bonds, ionic bonds, hydrophobic interactions, and disulfide bonds between R groups of amino acids (Figure 11).

## Appendix D

Figure 11: Interactions stabilising higher levels of protein structure (Freeman, et al., 2014)

## d Quaternary structure

* Quaternary structure refers to the association of two or more polypeptide chains to form one functional protein.
* Each polypeptide forms a subunit, and the subunits are held together by hydrogen bonds, ionic bonds, hydrophobic interactions, and disulfide bonds between R groups of amino acids to form a multimeric protein.
* Note: Not all proteins have a quaternary structure. Some proteins, such as myoglobin, only have one polypeptide and hence are organised up to tertiary level only.

## 5 Types of Proteins

* LO: (o) describe the molecular structure of the following proteins and explain how the structure of each protein relates to the function it plays: (i) haemoglobin (transport), (ii) collagen (structural), (iii) G-protein linked receptor (signalling).

Proteins can be broadly grouped into three major classes according to their shape and solubility: globular, fibrous, or membrane.

* **Globular proteins** have **hydrophobic R-groups in the interior of the protein while the hydrophilic R-groups are on the exterior**, making them **soluble**, such as haemoglobin.
* **Fibrous proteins** have **regular repeating structure** which gives **high tensile strength**. So, they often perform structural role, such as collagen, the major component of connective tissue.
* **Membrane proteins often serve as receptors such as G-protein linked receptor, or protein channels.

* **Haemoglobin**
* Haemoglobin is the red pigment in red blood cells responsible for transporting oxygen in blood.
* Haemoglobin is a **quaternary globular protein*
* with **4 subunits*
* (_Figure 13_):
* 2 \(\alpha\) globin chains of 141 amino acids each
* 2 \(\beta\) globin chains of 146 amino acids each
* Each subunit consist of a globin chain associated with a prosthetic group called haem group.

* **Structure**
* **Function**
* **Each globin chain coils into \(\alpha\)-helices** (no \(\beta\)-pleated sheets) and folded into a 3D tertiary structure. Four subunits associate and packed tightly in a **tetrahedral conformation**.
* **Each subunit is associated with a haem group**, which resides in a **hydrophobic pocket**. The haem group is a **prosthetic group**, consisting of a **porphyrin ring with an iron (II) ion (Fe2*)** in the centre (Figure 14).

* **Each haemoglobin molecule has **four haem** groups and can carry four oxygen molecules.

* **The quaternary structure of haemoglobin is maintained by **weak intermolecular forces** such as **hydrogen bonds, ionic bonds, and hydrophobic interactions**. No disulfide bonds.
* **Haemoglobin has a globular structure, with the hydrophobic R-groups are in the interior of the structure while hydrophilic R-groups are on the exterior surface in contact with the aqueous medium.

**b. Collagen**

* Collagen is a structural protein found in connective tissue such as tendons, cartilages, and skin.
* Collagen is a fibrous protein, consisting of a basic triple helix structure, called tropocollagen.
* Each collagen polypeptide chain contains about 1000 amino acids, usually with a **repeating triplet sequence** of Gly-X-Y, where **X is often proline**, and **Y is often hydroxyproline**.
* Each chain is coiled into a left-handed helix (not \(\alpha\)-helix), which wound around one another to form a triple helix structure, called tropocollagen (Figure 16).
* The 3 helical chains are held together by **hydrogen bonds between -NH and -C=O of peptide bonds in adjacent polypeptide chains** (Figure 17).
* Tropocollagen molecules lie **parallel** to each other in a **staggered arrangement** to form fibrils, with **strong covalent cross-links** occur between **adjacent tropocollagen molecules**.
* The cross-links occur between **two lysine or hydroxylysine residues at the C-terminus of one collagen chain with two similar residues at the N-terminus of an adjacent chain.
* Many fibrils unite to form fibres.

**Structure**

**Every 3rd amino acid residue is a glycine**. Glycine being the **smallest amino acid** is able to fit into the centre of the tropocollagen**.

**Presence of large number of proline and hydroxyproline** which have ** bulky and inflexible R group**, contributing to the **rigidity** of the polypeptide chains.

Hydroxproline, derived from proline through post-translational hydroxylation, further **enhances stability** of the triple helix by forming additional hydrogen bonds.

**Hydrogen bonding** between collagen chains of tropocollagen, **covalent cross-linking** between tropocollagen molecules, and **bundling** of collagen fibrils into fibres.

The tropocollagen are arranged in a **staggered** pattern.

### G-protein linked receptor (GPLR) or G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR)

* G-protein linked receptor (GPLR) is a transmembrane protein, embedded in the cell surface membrane, involved in cell signalling.
* GPLR is a tertiary protein (no quaternary structure) with a single polypeptide that has large variety in terms of length and sequence of amino acids.
* GPLRs constitute one of the largest and most diverse known protein families (>800 genes in humans).
* They serve as cell surface receptors to mediate most cellular responses to hormones and neurotransmitters, as well as being responsible for vision, olfaction, and taste.
* In general, GPLR binds to a **specific signal molecule** or ligand on the **extracellular domain**, and **induces a conformational change** on the **cytoplasmic domain**, transmitting an external signal into the cell (cross reference to topic: Cell Signalling).

**Structure** **Function**

\begin{tabular}{|p{227.6pt}|} \hline
**GPLR consists of 7 transmembrane \(\alpha\)-helices, spanning the phospholipid bilayer seven times, with hydrophobic R groups projected out of the helices.** \\ \hline There are a **large variety** of GPLRs in terms of length and sequence of amino acids, contributing to a large variety of extracellular and intracellular domains. \\ \hline The **hydrophilic extracellular domain** of the GPLR is folded into a ligand binding site with a **specific conformation that is complementary to its ligand**. \\ \hline The **hydrophilic intracellular domain** of the GPLR is folded into a **specific conformation complementary to G-protein**. \\ \hline The **hydrophilic intracellular domain** of the GPLR is folded into a **specific conformation complementary to G-protein**. \\ \hline \end{tabular} This allows **binding of ligand** to the GPLR. The binding **triggers a conformational change** in the GPLR.

This allows **weak association** with G-protein, enabling the **transmission of an external signal into the cell**, as the **conformational change in the GPLR activates the G-protein for downstream signalling.

## 6 Denaturation

LO: (n) explain the effects of temperature and pH on protein structure

### Normal protein folding is crucial to function

* The combination of primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary levels of structure is responsible for the diversity of sizes and shapes observed in proteins.
* Protein folding is directed by the sequence of amino acids present in the primary structure.
* Protein folding is spontaneous. In terms of energy, the folded molecule is more stable than the unfolded molecule.
* The secondary, tertiary, and quaternary levels of protein structure maintained by weaker interactions can be disrupted by heat or chemical treatment.
* Denaturation is the loss of three-dimensional structure sufficient to cause loss of function.
* The denatured state does not necessarily equate with complete unfolding of the protein and randomisation of conformation.
* Denaturation may be reversible or irreversible.
* Renaturation is the regaining of native three-dimensional structure and biological activity.

Figure 14: Cooked egg whites are denatured protein ovalbumin (Garrett & Grisham, 2010)

About 10% of the mass of an egg white is protein, and 54% of that is ovalbumin. Cooking causes the nearly transparent raw egg while proteins to unfold precipitate out of solution. The unfolded proteins aggregate into the solid white mass that we are familiar with.

## Appendix B Effect of temperature on protein structure

* Increasing temperature increases the average kinetic energy of atoms, causing them to vibrate faster.
* This disrupts the hydrogen bonds, ionic bonds and hydrophobic interactions in secondary, tertiary and quaternary structures, causing protein structure to unfold.
* Non-polar side chains, previously folded in the core of the protein, becomes exposed to aqueous environment.
* This causes them aggregate randomly with other polypeptides, resulting in irreversible change to the protein structure.

## Appendix C Effect of pH on protein structure

* Changes in pH may disrupt ionic interactions and hydrogen bonding between side chains.
* Decreasing pH through the addition of acids, increases H+ concentration in the solution. The additional H+ combines with R groups e.g. -COO to form -COOH, and -NH2 to form -NH3+.
* Increasing pH through the addition of alkalis, increases OH+ concentration in the solution. The additional OH removes the H+ from R groups e.g. -NH3+ to form -NH2, and -COOH to form -COO'.
* If either -COO or -NH3+ become uncharged, ionic bonds will be disrupted.
* If either -COOH or -NH2 become charged, hydrogen bonds will be disrupted.
