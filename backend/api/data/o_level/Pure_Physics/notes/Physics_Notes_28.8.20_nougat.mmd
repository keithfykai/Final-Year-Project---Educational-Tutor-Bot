Qualities of a good thermometer

- An easy-to-read-scale.

- Responsive to temperature changes.

- Sensitive to small temperature changes.

- Can measure a wide range of temperatures.

Thermometric substances

- Have physical properties that vary continuously and linearly with temperature for the range of temperatures measured.

\begin{tabular}{|p{142.3pt}|p{142.3pt}|} \hline
**Physical Property** & **Example of Thermometer** \\ \hline Volume of fixed mass of liquid & Mercury-in-glass thermometer, Alcohol thermometer. \\ \hline Electromotive force or electrical voltage & Thermocouple thermometer \\ \hline Electrical resistance of a piece of metal & Resistance thermometer \\ \hline \end{tabular}

**Constructing a Thermometer**

1. Choose an appropriate thermometric substance to be used in the thermometer.
2. Choose two fixed points which are easily obtainable and reproducible. Usually, the temperature of pure melting ice at one atmosphere and the temperature of steam from boiling water at one atmosphere are used as fixed points.
3. Record the values of the substance level in the thermometer stem at these fixed points.
4. Divide the interval between these two fixed points in 100 equal parts 5. Each of these equal parts on the scale represents a measure of 1 oC

**Ice / melting point**

- The temperature of pure melting ice at one atmospheric pressure, 0\({}^{\circ}\)C.

**Steam / boiling point**

- The temperature of steam from boiling water at one atmospheric pressure, 100\({}^{\circ}\)C.

**Precautions when calibrating thermometers**

- Ice point: Use crushed ice to ensure good contact between the bulb and ice, use a funnel to allow melted ice to flow away so that the thermometer only measures the temperature of the melting ice.

- Steam point: Use a manometer to check if the pressure inside the apparatus is the same as the atmospheric pressure outside. If the pressure is not equal, adjust the flame accordingly.

## Chapter 9: Kinetic Model of Matter

* Kinetic model of matter states that the tiny particles that make up matter are always in continuous random motion.

**Brownian Motion**

* A phenomenon that provides evidence for the continuous and random motion of tiny particles.

**Relationship between pressure, volume and temperature**

* _At constant pressure,_

* At higher temperatures, gas particles have higher kinetic energy. If volume is constant, the frequency of collisions, and hence pressure, will increase. In order for the pressure to remain constant, the distance between the walls of the container must increase so that the average time between each collision is increased. Therefore, at constant pressure, the volume of a gas increases with increasing temperature.
* _At constant temperature,_

* When volume is increased, the distance between the walls of the container is increased. This causes the average time between each collision of the gas particles to increase, and the frequency of collisions to decrease. Therefore, at constant temperature, the pressure of a gas decreases with increasing volume.
* _At constant volume,_

* When temperature increases, the gas particles have greater kinetic energies and move faster. They collide with the walls of the container more frequently and with greater average force. This causes the pressure in the container to increase. Therefore, at constant volume, the pressure of a gas increases with increasing temperature.

## Chapter 10: Transfer of Thermal Energy

* Thermal energy always flows from a region of higher temperature to a region of lower temperature. Net flow of thermal energy occurs only when there is a difference in temperature.

### 11.1 Conduction

* The transfer of thermal energy by molecular vibration through a medium without any flow of the medium.
* Particles, when heated, gain kinetic energy and vibrate vigorously about their fixed positions.
* They collide with neighboring particles, making them vibrate more vigorously. The neighboring regions of the object (rod) become hot. Eventually, the particles at the other end of the rod are also set into vigorous vibration.
* Free electron diffusion (metals only): The free electrons at the heated end absorb thermal energy, and hence gain kinetic energy. The free electrons that gain kinetic energy move at greater speeds, and move to the cooler regions of the rod. As these electrons move, they collide with the atoms in the cooler parts of the rod, making them vibrate more vigorously. Thermal energy is transferred via the motion of the free electrons. The cooler end of the rod becomes hot.
* Speed: Solid > Liquid > Gas.
* Distance between particles is inversely proportional to the frequency of collisions.

### 11.2 Convection

* The transfer of thermal energy by means of convection currents in a fluid, due to a difference in density,.
* Involves the bulk movement of the fluid that carries the thermal energy. a. When the flask is heated, the water molecules at the bottom of the flask gain thermal energy through conduction, and thus speed up and expand, hence decreasing in density. As these molecules are less dense than the surrounding water above, they rise. As the upper region of the water is more dense, it sinks to displace the hot water molecules. Hence a convection current is set up, and thermal energy is transferred throughout the water.

## Radiation

* The transfer of thermal energy in the form of electromagnetic waves such as infrared radiation without the aid of a medium, i.e. in vacuum.
* Thermal energy from infrared radiation is called radiant heat. All objects emit radiant heat.

**Factors affecting radiation:**

* Colour and texture of the surface: Dull and black materials are better emitters/absorbers of radiant heat.
* Surface temperature: The higher the surface temperature in comparison with the surroundings, the higher the rate of emission.
* Surface area: Objects with larger surface area emit/absorb at a higher rate than objects with smaller surface areas.

## Chapter 11: Thermal Properties of Matter

\(Q=mc\Delta\theta\)

**Internal Energy**

### 12 Melting

- Temperature remains constant as the thermal energy is absorbed to overcome the strong bonds between particles.

### 13 Freezing

- Temperature remains constant as there is no change in the kinetic energy of the molecules, as intermolecular bonds are formed during freezing and only the potential energy of the substance's molecules decreases.

### 14 Boiling

- Temperature remains constant as thermal energy is absorbed to break the intermolecular bonds between particles, provide energy for particles to push back on the surrounding atmosphere and increase the average space between particles.

**Boiling vs evaporation**

\begin{tabular}{|p{113.8pt}|p{113.8pt}|} \hline
**Boiling** & **Evaporation** \\ \hline Occurs only at boiling point. & Occurs at any temperature. \\ \hline Relatively fast. & Relatively slow. \\ \hline Takes place throughout the liquid. & Takes place only at the surface. \\ \hline Temperature remains constant. & Temperature usually decreases. \\ \hline Bubbles formed in the liquid. & No bubbles formed in the liquid. \\ \hline External thermal energy source needed. & External thermal energy source not needed. \\ \hline \end{tabular}

**Process of evaporation:**

- Molecules of a liquid have different kinetic energies. When they constantly bombard each other, energy is being transferred. At the surface of the liquid, the most energetic molecules can overcome the downward attractive forces of other liquid molecules and the atmospheric pressure to escape from the surface of the liquid, hence evaporation occurs.
- As the less energetic molecules are left behind, the average kinetic energy of the molecules in the liquid decreases, hence the temperature of the liquid decreases.

**Factors affecting rate of evaporation**

- Surrounding temperature.

- Humidity.

- Pressure.

- Surface area.

- Heat capacity of liquid.

- Wind.

* Low. High.
* Friction: When charged, the electrons remain at the surface where the electrons can be easily transferred to and away, leaving it electrically material.

### 16.3 Electronics

* The study of static electric charges

### 16.4 Charging by Friction

* Before rubbing, the glass rod and the piece of silk are electrically neutral. As different materials have different affinities (extent of attraction) for electrons, when the glass rod and the piece of silk are rubbed together, the atoms at their surfaces are disturbed and some electrons from the atoms at the surface of the glass rod are transferred to the piece of silk. As the glass rod loses electrons, it becomes positively charged. As the piece of silk gains electrons, it becomes negatively charged.

**Induction**

* The process of charging a conductor without contact between the conductor and the charging body
* Charging 2 metal spheres
* Place the 2 conductors side by side such that they are touching each other. Bring a negatively charged rod near but not touching sphere A. This causes the electrons in both metal spheres to be repelled to the far end of sphere B. Now, sphere A has excess positive charges which sphere B has excess negative charges. While holding the charged rod in place, pull sphere B away from sphere A. Remove the charged rod. Spheres A and B have an equal number of opposite charges.
* Charging a single Conductor
* Bring a positively charged glass rod near a metal conductor. The free electrons in the metal are drawn towards the positively charged glass rod. Without removing the glass rod, earth the positively-charged end of the metal conductor by touching it to neutralise the positive charges. With the glass rod still in place, remove your hand to stop the earthing and remove the glass rod. The negative charges will redistribute throughout the conductor to make it negatively charged.

**Discharging an Insulator**

* Intense heat from flame ionises air particles which neutralise the excess charges onthe insulator to discharge it.

* The direction of an electric field is the direction of that force that would act on a small positive charge.
* Lines always go from the positive to the negative.
* Lines are curved due to the resultant force exerted by the attraction and repulsion of both charges.
* Strength of the field is indicated by how close the field lines are to one another.

## Chapter 17: Current Electricity

**Electron flow**

- Flow of electrons from the negative terminal of the battery to the positive terminal.

**Conventional current**

- Flow of current from the positive terminal of the battery to the negative terminal.

- Should be connected in series.

**Electromotive force**

- The electromotive force of an electrical energy source is the work done by the source in driving a unit charge around a complete circuit.

\[\varepsilon=\frac{WD}{Q}\]

**Potential difference**

- The potential difference across a component in an electric circuit is the work done to drive a unit charge through the component.

\[V=\frac{W}{Q}\]

**Resistance**

- The resistance of a component is the ratio of the potential difference V across it to the current I flowing through it. R is directly proportional to V (p.d.) and inversely proportional to I.

\[V=IR\]

**Ohm's Law**

* The conductor obeys Ohm's law IF and only IF
- The gradient of the graph is constant.
- The graph has an origin of 0.

**Non-ohmic Conductors**

* Example: Filament lamp
- Diode: Allows current to flow in the forward direction only

**Ammeter**

* Ammeter is connected in series to measure the amount of current flowing in the circuit. It has a negligible resistance so as to not increase the total amount of resistance in the circuit and cause the current reading to be inaccurate.

**Voltmeter**

* Voltmeter is connected in parallel to measure the potential difference across a component. It has infinite resistance such that it does not draw any current, which may otherwise affect the value of the voltage.

**Resistance of a wire**

\[R=\frac{pl}{A}\] \[p=\frac{RA}{T}\]

* Low Resistivity = Good conductor.
- Can be used for wires.
- High Resistivity = Poor Conductor.
- Heating Coils in electric kettles (Nichrome): Produces a lot of thermal energy when a current passes through.

## Chapter 18 D.C. Circuits

### 18.1 Series Circuits

* Current at every point is the same.
* Sum of the potential difference across each component is equal to the p.d. Across the whole circuit and the electromotive force of the battery.
* Resistors of larger resistance will have a higher p.d. than resistors of smaller resistance.
* The effective resistance R is the sum of all the resistances.

### 18.2 Parallel Circuits

* Sum of current in individual branches is equal to to the main current flowing in or out of the parallel branches.
* Branch with the least resistance has the largest current flowing through it.
* Potential difference across separate parallel branches and the total potential difference is the same.
* Reciprocal of the effective resistances of resistors in parallel is equal to the sum of the reciprocal of all the individual resistances.
* Adding additional resistors to a circuit decreases the effective resistance due to the increased current.
* This increases the energy requirement on the energy source.

#### Advantages of parallel circuits:

* The current flowing through each bulb in a parallel circuit is larger than the current flowing through each bulb in a series circuit, hence bulbs connected in parallel glow more brightly than bulbs connected in series.
* When a bulb in a parallel circuit blows, the other bulbs in the circuit will still work as each parallel branch forms a complete circuit.

#### Disadvantage of parallel circuits

* The current flowing through the electrical energy source in a parallel circuit is higher than the current flowing through that of a series circuit. Hence the electrical energy source of a parallel circuit provides more power and is thus depleted more quickly than in a series circuit.

## 6 Potential Divider

* A line of resistors connected in series. Used to provide a fraction of the voltage of a source to another part of the circuit. \[V_{out}=\frac{R_{2}}{R_{2}+R_{1}}\times V_{\varepsilon}\] \[V_{out}=\frac{I_{2}}{I_{2}+I_{1}}\times V_{\varepsilon}\]

**Rheostat vs Potentiometer**

* An additional resistor is added to prevent a large current from flowing through the circuit when the variable resistor's resistance is 0, which will cause appliances to overheat.

## Input transducers

* Thermistor, Light dependant resistor
- The higher the temperature / light level, the lower the resistivity

### Dangers of Electricity

#### Damaged insulation

- Insulating materials can become worn with time, and expose the conducting wires inside.

- The exposed conducting wires can cause electric shocks if touched.

#### Overheating of cables

- Overloaded power sockets: With many appliances in a power socket in parallel, a large current flows.

- Inappropriate wires: Wires which are thin have a higher resistance and produce more heat. Hence when used with appliances which require a lot of power, the wires may overheat.

#### Damp environments

- Water provides a conducting path with a small resistance for the current to flow.

If on Neutral: Live wire causes metal casing to have high voltage as it is still connected to the metal casing, hence a person will get an electric shock if he touches the casing and a large current flows through him to the earth.

- Mains should be switched off before replacing

- Common fuse ratings: 1A, 3A, 5A, 7A, 10A, 13A.

**Magnetic Materials**

- Steel

- Iron

- Nickel

- Cobalt

**Identifying magnets**

- One side is attracted to a side of a known magnet, the other side is repelled from the side of the known magnet.

**Magnetic induction**

- The process whereby an object made of a magnetic material becomes a magnet when it is near or in contact with a magnet.

**Theory of Magnetism**

- Every atom is a magnet.

- A magnetic domain consists of a group of atomic magnets pointing in the same direction.

**Magnetizing magnetic materials**

- _Stroking_

- Unmagnetised steel bar is stroked several times in one direction with one of the poles of a permanent magnet. Pole at the end of the steel bar where the strokes finish is opposite to the stroking pole used.

- Large direct current aligns the magnetic domains.
- Right-hand grip rule.
- Grip solenoid with right hand.
- Curl fingers in the direction of the current flow
- Thumb points to the north pole and current flow

#### Demagnetizing magnets

* Heat causes vigorous vibration of atoms hence causing the magnetic domains to lose their alignment.
- _Hammering in an east-west direction._
- Alters the alignment of the magnetic domains.
- _Electrical method using an alternating current_
- Place the magnet inside a solenoid in an east-west direction.
- Connect it to an a.c. supply.
- Withdraw the magnet in an east-west direction while the solenoid is still on.

#### Magnetic fields

* Plotted with sprinkling iron filings/compass.
- Closer lines = Stronger Magnetic Force.
- Earth's geographical North is a magnetic South.

## Chapter 21: Electromagnetism

### 21.1 Electromagnetism

Electromagnetic Effects of a Current

- A current-carrying conductor produces a magnetic field around it.

- Strength of magnetic field increases when the current increases.

- The direction of the magnetic field of a current-carrying wire is reversed when the direction of the current is reversed

- Drawing: Magnetic Field lines should be further apart with increasing distance from the wire

**Forces acting on a beam of charged particles in a magnetic field (protons or electrons)**

Direction of current flow is the direction of conventional current, i.e. direction of positive particle flow / opposite to direction of negative particle flow.

Point index finger in direction of magnetic field, point middle finger in the direction where the particle would move if undisturbed, resultant movement is between the thumb and middle finger.

Reversing the direction of the current flow changes the direction of the force acting on the particle.

Reversing the direction of the magnetic field also changes the direction of the force acting on the particle.

Opposite Charge = reversed direction.

Direction of movement of the particle is the resultant of the directions of the force, the current and the magnetic field Current-Carrying Coil Conundrums.

### Motor

Two Carbon Brushes at XY: Low friction + Path for current to flow.

Addition of split-ring commutator: Hole cuts off the current when coil is vertical, momentum carries coil forward and allows for another cycle.

Reverses the direction of the current every half a revolution to allow it to continue spinning in one direction.

Force is greatest when horizontal.

Rheostat: Set at maximum R before switch is closed and decreased over time to prevent overheating due to large current through small R wire.

Increasing Turning Effect

Increasing number of turns per unit length.

Increasing current in coil.

Adding a soft iron core.

## Chapter 22: Electromagnetic Induction

- The process through which an induced e.m.f. is produced in a conductor due to a changing magnetic field.

- E.m.f: Work done by the source in driving a unit charge around a closed circuit

**Faraday's law**

- Faraday's law of electromagnetic induction states that the magnitude of the induced e.m.f. in a circuit in directly proportional to the rate of change of magnetic flux (quantity of magnetic field) in the circuit.

- Deals with magnitude, or strength, of the induced current.

**Ways to increase the magnitude of the induced e.m.f.**

- Increase number of turns per unit length of coil

- Increases the number of magnetic field lines linked to the coil (magnetic flux linkage)

- Increase the speed at which the magnet moves in / out of the coil.

- Increase the strength of the magnet.

**Lenz's law**

- Lenz's law states that the direction of the induced e.m.f., and hence the induced current in a closed circuit, is always such that its magnetic effect opposes the motion or change producing it.

- If magnet enters solenoid south-first, south pole produced by current at end of entry to push away.

- If magnet leaves solenoid south-first, north pole produced by current at end of entry to pull back.

- Current acts in opposite direction of movement of magnet.

- Galvanometer needle will be deflected in the direction of current.

- Deals with the direction of the induced current.

### A.C. Generator

- Transforms mechanical energy into electrical energy.

- Works on principle of electromagnetic induction.

- Current reverses direction, hence "alternating current".

- Parallel Axel = Rate of Change of magnetic flux is maximum.

- When the coil rotates, it cuts across the magnetic field lines and there is a change in magnetic flux in the coil. By Faraday's Law, this change induces an e.m.f. in the coil.

**Fleming's right hand rule**

- Similar to left-hand rule.

- Used to find out the direction of the current.

**Differences between left-hand and right-hand rule**

**Left-hand rule**

**Right-hand rule**

**Applies to D.C. motors.**

**Applies to A.C. generators.**

**Gives the direction of resultant force.**

**Gives the direction of the induced current.**

**Slip rings**

- Ensure that the induced current in the coil is transferred to the external circuit

**Ways to increase the magnitude of induced e.m.f.**

- Increase number of turns per unit length of the coil.

- Increasing the strength of the permanent magnets.

- Increasing the frequency of rotations of the coil.

- Winding the coil around a soft iron core to strengthen the magnetic flux linking the coil

**Fixed coil generator**

- An a.c. generator where magnets rotate instead of coils rotate

- Bike dynamo

- Practically, fixed coil generators are favoured because

- Does not require carbon brushes, which wear out easily and need to be replaced frequently.

- They are Less likely to break down from overheating.

- Does not use slip rings and carbon brushes, eroded connection increases resistance which may cause overheating.

- More compact

**Transformers**

- A device that can change a high alternating voltage (at low current) to a low alternating voltage (at high current), or vice versa.

- Used in electrical power transmission from power stations to households.

- Used to regulate voltages for the proper operation of electrical appliances.

- A transformer is based on electromagnetic induction. An a.c. in the primary coil induces a varying magnetic field in the iron core which creates an alternating induced e.m.f in the secondary coil which generates an induced current.

**Features of a transformer**

- **Laminated soft iron core.**

- **Compprises of thin sheets of soft iron.**

- **Insulated by sheets of lacquer.**

- **Soft iron is used because it is easily magnetised.**

- **Ensure better magnetic flux linkage.**

- **Lamination reduces heat loss.**

**Equation of power transmission**

\[\frac{V_{\varepsilon}}{V_{p}}=\frac{N_{\varepsilon}}{N_{p}}=\frac{I_{p}}{I_{s}}\]

**Types of transformers**

- **Step up**

- **Increases voltage, decreases current.**

- **Number of turns in the secondary coil is greater than that of the primary coil.**

- **Step down**

- **Decreases voltage, increases current.**

- **Number of turns in the primary coil is greater than that of the secondary coil.**

\[V_{s}=\frac{N_{s}}{N_{p}}\times V_{p}\]

\[I_{s}=\frac{N_{s}}{N_{p}}\times I_{p}\]

**Power transmission**

- **Ideal transformer has no power loss.**

- **Equation to calculate efficiency:**

\[\frac{P_{out}}{P_{in}}\times 100\%\]

\[\frac{V_{s}I_{s}}{V_{p}I_{p}}\times 100\%\]

**- **However, resistance of coils, leakage of magnetic flux in transformers, decrease the efficiency of transformers.**

**Why are transformers used to transmit electricity over distances?**

- **Loss of power due to heating of wire.**

- **To reduce loss of power, decrease current through step-up.**

- **Cannot increase diameter of cables due to increased construction costs.**

- **Stepped-down at homes for suitable voltages.*** [15] J.-P. Wang, J.-P. Wang, and J.-P. Wang, "A new method for the calculation of the energy loss of a single crystal in a crystal," _Journal of Physics B: Atomic and Molecular Physics_, vol. 10, no. 1, pp. 103-113, 2009.
