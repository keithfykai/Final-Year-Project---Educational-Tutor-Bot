The resultant waveform has the following features:

* The wave profile does not propagate. As such, the resultant wave is known as a stationary wave or standing wave.
* Every particle of the wave merely oscillates (except at the nodes) about their respective equilibrium positions with the same frequency, but different amplitudes. The frequency is the same as that of the two component waves.
* An **intinode** is a point in a standing wave where the amplitudes the maximum Particles at the antinodes vibrate with the greatest amplitude. These are labelled 'A' on Fig. 3. The amplitude of oscillation at the antinodes is double that of the component waves.
* A **hadil** is a point in a standing wave where the amplitude is zero. They are labelled 'N' on Fig. 3.
* Within two consecutive nodes, every particle oscillates in phase, i.e., they reach their respective maxima, minima and equilibrium positions at the same instant. Note that these particles do not have the same amplitude.
* Distance between two adjacent nodes (or antinodes) is \(\chi\lambda\).
* Particles in neighbouring segments vibrate 180\({}^{\circ}\) (or \(\pi\) rad) out of phase with each other.

**Note:**

* At the fixed ends, there must be nodes (since the string cannot vibrate).
* In reality, multiple harmonics give the timbre or characteristics of an instrument.

* Explain why it is necessary to adjust either the length of the string or the frequency of the oscillator in order to obtain observable stationary waves on the string.
* What is meant by a node? Explain why a node must exist at the pulley.
* Since the tension of the string is constant, the velocity of the wave on the string is fixed. Stationary waves will only be formed if the length of the string is equal to certain \(\nicefrac{{\lambda}}{{\lambda}}e_{\nicefrac{{\lambda}}{{\lambda}}}\) multiples of half-wavelength of the wave (i.e. when \(\nicefrac{{\lambda}}{{\lambda}}e_{\nicefrac{{\lambda}}{{\lambda}}}\) resonance occurs). Hence, it is necessary to adjust the length of the string to fit multiples of half-wavelength, or adjust the frequency (and thus wavelength) to fit the length of the string.
* A node is a point on the stationary wave where the particle is always at rest. A node must exist at the pulley because the pulley, and hence the string, is fixed in position.

Note:
* The end of the string which is attached to the oscillator is also considered as a node because its amplitude of oscillations is considered small compared to that of the antinode.
* The speed \(\nu\) of a wave in a string is given by \(\nu=\sqrt{T/\mu}\), where \(T=\) tension, \(\mu=\) mass per unit length.

Open Pipes

When a sound wave is sent into an open pipe, a stationary wave is formed as shown in Fig. 9. As the air molecules are able to move freely at both ends, displacement antinodes are formed at both ends.

Note:

As a sound wave travels down an open pipe and reaches the other end, part of the wave is reflected. The reflected and incident waves superpose to produce a pressure node at the open end so that the pressure there is atmospheric. Hence, a displacement antinode occurs at the open end.

Figure 11: The degree of diffraction depends on the relative size of the wavelength and the aperture.

Generally, diffraction is pronounced when the wavelength of the wave is of the same order of magnitude as the width of the aperture or obstacle. (Diffraction of waves is explained by Huygenâ€™s principle in Sect 12.9 in pg 22).

This is the reason why under normal circumstances, we do not observe any diffraction of light because the holes and apertures that we come across everyday are much larger than the wavelengths of light.

Figure 12: Ripple tank images of water waves emerging from an opening. As the wavelength is increased from (a) to (c), the effect of diffraction becomes more pronounced.

The waves or sources must be _coherent_ (i.e. they have the same frequency and a constant phase difference).

The waves must have approximately the _same amplitude_ (for a better\({}^{\prime}\)) _on_\({}_{4}\)(\(\mu\) contrast).

The waves must, _overlap_ and be of the same type (to produce regions of constructive and destructive interference).

For transverse waves, they must be _inpolarised_ or _polarised_ in the same plane.

Two ball-ended dippers S\({}_{1}\) and S\({}_{2}\), attached to a mechanical oscillator (and hence are coherent sources), send out two sets of circular wavefronts (let's say crests). These waves interfere when they overlap as shown in Fig. 14.

By the principle of superposition, **constructive interference** takes place along the **anti-nodal lines (dark lines)** when the two waves are in **phase**.

In between anti-nodal lines are the **nodal lines (dotted lines)** along which the waves arrive **exactly \(\pi\)** rad out of phase. Destructive interference occurs.

To determine the positions of the dark fringes or minima, the path difference between waves from the two secondary sources is an odd number of half-wavelengths. This argument is applied to any point in the top-half of the slit and one a distance \(B/2\) below it in the lower half of the slit:

\[\text{Path difference, }\frac{b}{2}\sin\theta =(2n-1)\frac{\lambda}{2},\text{ where }n\text{ is a positive integer}\] \[b\sin\theta =(2n-1)\lambda\qquad\qquad\qquad\text{- equation (1)}\] \[=\lambda,3\lambda,5\lambda...\text{odd number of wavelengths}\]

If we divide the wavefront into four quarters and apply the same argument to determine the positions of destructive interference, we now get:

\[\frac{b}{4}\sin\theta =(2n-1)\frac{\lambda}{2},\text{ where }n\text{ is a positive integer}\] \[b\sin\theta =2(2n-1)\lambda\qquad\qquad\text{- equation (2)}\] \[=2\lambda,4\lambda,6\lambda...\text{even number of wavelengths}\]

Combining equations (1) and (2), for single-slit interference pattern, the minima or destructive interference occurs at angle \(\theta\) according to:

\[b\sin\theta=n\lambda,\text{ where }n\text{ is a positive integer.}\]

Hence, the angle \(\theta\) of the first minima from the straight-through position for light of wavelength \(\lambda\) incident on a single slit of width \(b\) is

\[\sin\theta=\frac{\lambda}{b}.\qquad\text{- equation (3)}\]

For \(\theta<6^{\circ}\), the width \(y\) of the central bright fringe on a screen a distance \(D\) away is therefore

\[\gamma\approx D\big{(}2\theta\big{)}\approx\frac{2D\lambda}{b},\qquad\text{ where }\theta\approx\frac{\lambda}{b}.\]

* Equation (3) is only valid when the distance \(D\) of the screen from the single-slit is much larger than the width \(b\) of the single-slit as the rays used in the derivation are assumed to be parallel.
* To determine the positions of the minima, the wavefront along the slit can only be divided into even parts such as 2, 4, 6, 8, etc. This is to allow an even number of wavelets to interfere destructively to produce a minimum. If there were an odd number of sections in the wavefront, complete destructive interference is not possible.
* Huygen's principle cannot be used to determine positions of constructive interference because a set of wavelets which arrive at a point in phase, may not be in phase with another set of wavelets (which are in phase among themselves).

* _all divide overload into all red-level eye

Figure 25: Lord Rayleigh arbitrarily set the criterion that two images are just resolved through a slit of width \(b\) when their angular separation \(\theta\) satisfies

\[\theta\approx\frac{\lambda}{b},\]

where \(\lambda\) is the wavelength of the light radiating or reflected from the two objects. This happens when the peak intensity of one image lies on the first minimum of the other image. (For a circular aperture, \(\theta\approx 1.22\frac{\lambda}{b}\)). If the smallest resolvable separation between images is to be reduced (i.e. increasing the resolving power), shorter wavelength light might be used. For example, using UV light, rather than visible light, allows finer details to be seen.

## Appendix B Measuring Space to \(k\)-Sum Input

The speed of sound in air can be measured either using a cathode-ray oscilloscope or a resonance tube.

_Using Cathode-Ray Oscilloscope_

1. A small microphone, connected to a CRO, is positioned between a reflecting board and a loudspeaker connected to a signal generator.
2. Sound wave of constant frequency travels from the loudspeaker towards the reflecting board. Interference between the incident and reflected sound waves produces a stationary wave.
3. As the microphone is moved slowly towards the loudspeaker, the amplitude of the waveform on the CRO increases to a maximum (pressure antinode) at position A and then the next maximum at position B.
4. Since the distance \(L\) between two successive pressure antinodes (or displacement nodes) is \(\gamma\lambda\) and the frequency \(f\) can be determined from the CRO, the speed of the sound can be calculated using \[\nu=f\lambda=2fL.\]

_Using Resonance Tube_

1. A tuning fork of frequency \(f\) is struck and held over the top of a tube filled with water.
2. The water level is gradually lowered or drained until the note is at its loudest as shown in (a). Note the length of the air column \(L_{1}\). The air column is said to be resonating with the frequency of the tuning fork: \(L_{1}+c=\gamma_{4}\lambda\) -- (a)
3. Repeat the above steps while lowering the water level further until a second weaker resonance is heard in (b). Note the new length \(L_{2}\): \(L_{2}+c=\gamma_{4}\lambda\) -- (b)
4. As shown in the diagram, equations (b) - (a): \[\gamma_{2}\lambda=L_{2}-L_{1}\]
5. Since the frequency \(f\) of the tuning fork is known, speed of sound in air can be calculated using (a) (b)

## Appendix C

Voxelizing a longitudinal radiotherapy survey (USA).

The following diagram shows the actual position of the particles in a longitudinal stationary wave. Dark regions represent areas of maximum compression (highest pressure) while light regions represents areas of maximum rarefaction (lowest pressure).

Notice that both the maximum compressions and maximum rarefactions occur at the nodes. This means that the displacement nodes are also the pressure antinodes and vice versa.
