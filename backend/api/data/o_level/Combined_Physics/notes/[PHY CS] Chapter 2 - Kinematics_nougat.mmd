**Average speed** is the total distance travelled over a period of time.

Formula:

**Average speed = Total Distance / Total Time**

**Instantaneous speed** is the speed at a specific point in time.

**Total Distance = Area under graph**

\(=(\texttt{b}\times\texttt{2}\times\texttt{10})+(\texttt{4}\times\texttt{10})+( \texttt{b}\times\texttt{2}\times\texttt{10})+(\texttt{b}\times\texttt{4}\times \texttt{10})\)

**= 80m**

**Average speed = 80m** / 12s

**= 6.67 ms**

***Area of graph in negative region is in the reverse direction**

**What is the average velocity of the car at 1s is 5 ms**

**.**

**Acceleration**

**Acceleration is the rate of change of velocity with respect to time.**

**What is the acceleration of the car in the first 2 seconds?**

**Acceleration = change in velocity / time**

**What is the acceleration of the car between 2s - 6s?**

**The car is travelling at constant velocity, hence there is no acceleration.**

**Describe what is happening to the car from 6s to 12s.**

**From 6s to 8s, the car starts to decelerate, reducing its velocity from 10ms\({}^{+}\) to 0ms\({}^{+}\).**

**At the 8s mark, the car is at rest momentarily before moving in the opposite direction. As it is reversing, it speeds up to reach -10ms\({}^{+}\).**

**At 10s, the car slows down while traveling in the opposite direction before coming to rest at 12s.**

## Acceleration of free fall

As all objects have mass, they will experience a **gravitational force**. Free fall occurs when an object falls under the sole influence of gravity (no air resistance).

### Air Resistance

Air resistance is a **frictional force** that **opposes the motion** of **moving** objects due to collision with air particles present in the air.

For any object travelling in a non-vacuum, it will experience air resistance as the object will collide with air particles.
