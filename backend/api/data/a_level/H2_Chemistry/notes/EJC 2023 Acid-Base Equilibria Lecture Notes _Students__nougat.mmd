## 1 Theories of Acids and Bases

* (a) show understanding of and apply the Arrhenius theory of acids and bases (b) show understanding of and apply the Bronsted-Lowy theory of acids and bases, including the concept of conjugate acids and conjugate bases (c) show understanding of and apply the Lewis theory of acids and bases (including non-aqueous system, e.g. reaction between BF\({}_{3}\) and NH\({}_{3}\)).

The concept of acids and bases has developed over time as chemists sought a model that could accurately classify, rationalise and predict acid-base chemistry. The Greeks first identified acids based on properties such as having a sour taste (the Latin word for sour is _Acidus_) and whether the substance could change the colour of some plant extracts.

The first historical concept developed came from Antoine Lavoisier, who proposed that all acids contain oxygen (e.g. HNO\({}_{3}\)). This was refuted by Humphry Davy, who found that hydrochloric acid has acidic properties, even though it does not contain oxygen. The next significant concept came from Justus von Liebig, who analysed empirical data and proposed that acids contained hydrogen, which is replaced by a metal, producing hydrogen gas (acid-metal reaction).

This was the paradigm for about 50 years until Svante Arrhenius put forth his theory of acids and bases in 1884. This became the foundation of the modern idea of acids and bases, which was further advanced by Johannes Bronsted, Thomas Lowry and Gilbert Newton Lewis. The findings of these chemists brought us to our current understanding of acids and bases.

We will explore the strengths and limitations of the different models proposed to explain the characteristics of acids and bases, namely the Arrhenius Theory, the Bronsted-Lowry Theory, and the Lewis Theory.

Each theory starts off with either the proposal of a hypothesis to explain empirical data, or to address the limitations of a previous theory. With each iteration, we obtain a better understanding of the science behind acids and bases. This is the nature of scientific knowledge.

(see **Example 1A**, 1)

You will realise that the Arrhenius theory is a sub-set of the Bransted-Lowry theory. The concept of the generation of H+ and OH- ions in the Arrhenius theory is linked to the concept of proton donors (H+ generated) and proton acceptors (OH- generated to accept H+) in the Bransted-Lowry theory. The Bransted-Lowry theory too is a sub-set of the Lewis theory, which involves electron pair-donors (the base donates its lone pair to H+) and acceptors (H+ accepts a lone pair from the base).

### The Hydrogen Ion

Central to the Arrhenius and Bransted-Lowry definition of an acid is the hydrogen ion or **proton**, a fundamental particle. It is very small (10-15 m diameter) compared with other cations (around 10-10 m diameter), and thus has a **very high charge density**\(\left(\text{charge density}\propto\frac{q_{{}_{+}}}{r_{{}_{+}}}\right)\). As such the proton does not exist on its own and a Bransted-Lowry acid does not dissociate to give an isolated H+.

Rather a Bransted-Lowry acid attracts a lone pair of electrons of a particle, the Bransted-Lowry base, and transfer the H+ to (_i.e. protonate_) the base:

An Arrhenius acid is thus a special case of a Bransted-Lowry acid in _aqueous medium_, where water serves as the Bransted-Lowry base to generate the **hydronium ion**, H3O+:

It is important to note that both symbols, H+(aq) and H3O+(aq) can be used to represent the hydronium ion, H3O+, and are often used interchangeably. H+(aq) is more commonly used for simplicity's sake. H3O+ is also sometimes referred to as the 'hydroxonium ion' or 'oxonium ion'.

For the rest of this topic of Acid-Base Equilibria, we will be concerned primarily with Bransted-Lowry acids and bases in water.

**Ccheckpoint for Section 1**

At the end of this section, you should know that:

1. An Arrhenius acid dissociates and releases hydrogen ions when dissolved in water.
2. An Arrhenius base dissociates and releases hydroxide ions when dissolved in water.
3. A Bransted-Lowry acid is a proton donor.
4. A Bransted-Lowry base is a proton acceptor.
5. A Bransted-Lowry acid-base reaction involves transferring of a proton from an acid to a base.
6. A Bransted-Lowry base must have at least one lone pair of electrons.
7. A Lewis acid is an electron-pair acceptor.
8. A Lewis acid usually contains either empty orbitals or a partial/whole positive charge.
9. A Lewis base is an electron-pair donor.
10. A Lewis acid-base reaction involves transferring of a pair of electrons from a base to an acid.

## 2 **Bronsted-Lowry Acids and Bases**

In this section, we will utilise our knowledge of the **Bronsted-Lowry theory** to help us understand the different relationships between the different types of acids and bases in aqueous solutions and their respective pH.

Bronsted-Lowry acid, HA, in water :

Bronsted-Lowry base, B, in water :

### **Conjugate Acid-Base Pairs**

LO: (b) show understanding of and apply the Bransted-Lowry theory of acids and bases, including the concept of conjugate acids and conjugate bases.

Consider the following reversible proton-transfer reaction, _not necessarily_ in water :

B + HA = BH\({}^{+}\) + A-

We can identify two acids and two bases:

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|} \cline{2-3} \multicolumn{1}{c|}{} & **Bronsted-Lowry Acid** & **Bronsted-Lowry Base** \\  & (proton donor) & (proton acceptor) \\ \cline{2-3} in the **forward** reaction & **HA** & **B** \\ \cline{2-3} in the **backward** reaction & **BH\({}^{+}\)** & **A\({}^{-}\)** \\ \end{tabular}

* Two substances which **differ from each other by only one H\({}^{+}\)** are known collectively as a **conjugate acid-base pair**.
* Every **acid** has a **conjugate base**; this is the substance formed after the acid donates its proton. A conjugate base has one H\({}^{+}\) fewer than its acid.
* Every **base** has a **conjugate acid**; this is the substance formed after the base accepts a proton. A conjugate acid has one H\({}^{+}\) more than its base.

In other words,

* BH\({}^{+}\) is the **conjugate acid** of base B, and B is the **conjugate base** of acid BH\({}^{+}\).
* HA is the **conjugate acid** of base A\({}^{-}\), and A\({}^{-}\) is the **conjugate base** of acid HA.

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:9]

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:10]

At this temperature, the **concentration of H\({}_{3}\)O\({}^{+}\) ions** in water can be calculated in the following way: Since [**H\({}_{3}\)O\({}^{+}\)**] = [OH\({}^{+}\)] in _pure_ H\({}_{2}\)O,

\[\begin{split} K_{w}=&\left[\text{H}_{3}\text{O}^{+} \right]\left[\text{OH}^{-}\right]=\left[\text{H}_{3}\text{O}^{+}\right]^{2}= \left[\text{OH}^{-}\right]^{2}\\ \left[\text{H}_{3}\text{O}^{-}\right]=&\left[\text{OH}^{ -}\right]=\sqrt{K_{w}}=\sqrt{10^{-14}}\\ =&\text{10}^{-7}\text{ mol}\,\text{dm}^{-3}\end{split}\]

Since \(K_{w}\) is an equilibrium constant, **its value will change when temperature changes**. The variation of \(K_{w}\) values of pure water with temperature, \(T\), is shown in the table below:

\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|c|c|c|} \hline \(T\)/ \({}^{o}\)C & 0 & 10 & 20 & 40 & 50 & 100 \\ \hline \(K_{w}\)/ 10\({}^{-14}\) mol\({}^{2}\) dm\({}^{-6}\) & 0.114 & 0.293 & 0.681 & 2.916 & 5.476 & 51.3 \\ \hline \end{tabular}

When temperature increases, \(K_{w}\) increases. In other words, water dissociates to a larger extent at higher temperatures, and both [H\({}_{3}\)O\({}^{+}\)] and [OH\({}^{+}\)] at equilibrium increases, leading to larger values of \(K_{w}\). Hence, the forward dissociation of water must be _endothermic_, favoured at higher temperatures to absorb the heat. We will examine the consequences of this in the next section.

### pH and pOH

* (e) explain the terms pH; \(K_{w}\); pK\({}_{3}\); pK\({}_{3}\); pK\({}_{3}\); \(K_{w}\) and apply them in calculations, including the relationship \(K_{w}=K_{w}K_{0}\) (f) calculate [H\({}^{+}\)(aq)] and pH values for strong acids, weak monobasic (monoprotic) acids, strong bases, and weak monoacidic bases

* pH is a measure of the concentration of hydrogen ions in a solution, and is **defined as the negative logarithm of the hydrogen ion concentration in mol dm\({}^{3}\)**.

\begin{tabular}{|l|c|} \hline pH = -lg[H\({}_{3}\)O\({}^{+}\)] & Note: pH does **not** have units \\ \hline \end{tabular}

A solution that has a **lower pH** has a **higher [H\({}_{3}\)O\({}^{+}\)]** than a solution with a higher pH, and _vice versa_.

* **pOH** on the other hand is a measure of the concentration of hydroxide ions in a solution. It is defined as the negative logarithm of the hydroxide ion concentration in mol dm\({}^{-3}\).

\begin{tabular}{|l|c|} \hline pOH = -lg[OH\({}^{-}\)] & Note: pOH does **not** have units \\ \hline \end{tabular}

A solution that has a **lower pOH** has a **higher [OH\({}^{-}\)]** than a solution with a higher pOH, and _vice versa_.

* **Relationship between pH and pOH** \[\begin{split} K_{w}=&\left[\text{H}_{3}\text{O}^{-} \right]\left[\text{OH}^{-}\right]\\ -lgK_{w}=&-lg\left(\left[\text{H}_{3}\text{O}^{-} \right]\left[\text{OH}^{-}\right]\right)\\ -lgK_{w}=&\left(-lg\left[\text{H}_{3}\text{O}^{-} \right]\right)+\left(-lg\left[\text{OH}^{-}\right]\right)\\ \end{split}\]
* **Therefore,** \[\begin{split} pK_{w}=\text{pH}+\text{pOH}\end{split}\]
* **Eunoa Junior College** \[\begin{split} 11\text{|}\text{Page}\\ \end{split}\]Acid-Base Equilibria

For **aqueous** solutions at **298** K, \(pK_{w}=-\lg(1.00\times 10^{-14})=14\)

Therefore,

This relationship holds true for any solution in _water_.

On top of that, in _pure_ water,

\[\begin{bmatrix}H_{3}O^{-}\\ -lg\left[H_{3}O^{-}\right]=-lg\left[OH^{-}\right]\\ pH=pOH=\frac{14}{2}=7\text{, at 298 K}\end{bmatrix}\]

### pH and Neutrality

We have derived what you learnt in secondary school, that the pH of **pure water** at **298 K (25 \({}^{\text{o}}\)C)** is **7**.

Now, let's calculate the pH of **pure water at 373 K (100 \({}^{\text{o}}\)C)**, using the \(K_{w}\) value of \(51.3\times 10^{-14}\) at that temperature.

\[\begin{split} K_{w}=&\left[H_{3}O^{-}\right]\left[OH^{- }\right]=51.3\times 10^{-14}\\ \left[H_{3}O^{-}\right]=&\left[OH^{-}\right]=\sqrt{K_{w}}= \sqrt{51.3\times 10^{-14}}\\ =&7.16\times 10^{-7}\text{ mol dm}^{-3}\\ pH=-\lg\left(7.16\times 10^{-7}\right)=\underline{6.14}\end{split}\]

Since the pH of water at 373 K is below 7, does it mean that water is acidic at its boiling point?

**NO!**

_Important:_

pH is a measure of concentration of hydrogen ions in the solution. It does not tell us the acidity or basicity of a solution on its own. Rather,

A solution is **acidic** if [H\({}_{3}\)O\({}^{+}\)] > [OH\({}^{+}\)].

A solution is **neutral** if [H\({}_{3}\)O\({}^{+}\)] = [OH\({}^{+}\)].

A solution is **basic** if [H\({}_{3}\)O\({}^{+}\)] < [OH\({}^{+}\)].

For water at 373 K, the solution **remains neutral** as [H\({}_{3}\)O\({}^{+}\)] and [OH\({}^{+}\)] are the same. The decrease in pH is merely a consequence of the higher [H\({}_{3}\)O\({}^{+}\)] due to the larger extent of dissociation of water.

So, both the pH and pOH of pure water decrease as temperature increases because the \(K_{w}\) of water increases.

### Strength of Acids and Bases

* (d) explain qualitatively the differences in behaviour between strong and weak acids and bases in terms of the extent of dissociation.

In the following discussion, we will focus on \(\underline{\text{B}}\)_B_ransted-L_owny acids and bases in aqueous medium. However, the concept is applicable to non-aqueous medium as well.

\begin{tabular}{|p{142.3pt}|p{142.3pt}|} \hline

In water, the strength of an acid or base depends on the **position** of the following equilibria:

\begin{tabular}{|p{142.3pt}|p{142.3pt}|} \hline
**solvent role** & \multicolumn{1}{p{142.3pt}|}{solvent (water) as base} & \multicolumn{1}{p{142.3pt}|}{solvent (water) as acid} \\ \hline
**equilibrium** & \(\text{H}_{2}\text{O}\): & \(\text{H}_{2}\text{O}\): & \(\text{H}_{3}\text{O}^{+}\text{-}\textNotice that a **strong acid HA**, where the position of equilibrium (HA + H\({}_{2}\)O \(\rightleftharpoons\) H\({}_{3}\)O\({}^{+}\) + A\({}^{-}\)) lies largely to the right, will give a **weak conjugate base A\({}^{-}\)** as the backward reaction involving protonation of A\({}^{-}\) is not favourable, and _vice versa_.

Similarly, a strong base B will give a weak conjugate acid BH\({}^{+}\), and _vice versa_. (See SS4.4 on page 18)

**Checkpoint for Section 3**

At the end of this section, you should know that:

1. The ionic product of water, \(K_{\rm w}\) = [H\({}^{+}\)]\({}_{\rm oorn}\) [OH\({}^{-}\)]\({}_{\rm oorn}\) = 1.00 \(\times\) 10\({}^{-14}\) mol\({}^{2}\) dm\({}^{-6}\) at 298 K (25 \({}^{\circ}\)C).
2. p\(K_{\rm w}\) = 14 at 298 K (25 \({}^{\circ}\)C).
3. \(K_{\rm w}\) increases (_i.e._ p\(K_{\rm w}\) decreases) with temperature as the dissociation of water is endothermic.
4. pH is a measure of [H\({}^{+}\)] and is calculated by pH = -lg [H\({}^{+}\)].
5. pOH is a measure of [OH\({}^{+}\)] and is calculated by pOH = -lg [OH\({}^{+}\)].
6. pH + pOH = p\(K_{\rm w}\) = 14 at 298 K (25 \({}^{\circ}\)C).
7. A solution is

\({}^{\star}\) acidic if [H\({}_{3}\)O\({}^{+}\)] > [OH\({}^{+}\)], _i.e._ pH < pOH

\({}^{\star}\) neutral if [H\({}_{3}\)O\({}^{+}\)] = [OH\({}^{+}\)], _i.e._ pH = pOH

\({}^{\star}\) basic if [H\({}_{3}\)O\({}^{+}\)] < [OH\({}^{+}\)], _i.e._ pH > pOH
8. Strength of an acid, HA, depends on the position of the equilibrium:

HA(aq) + H\({}_{2}\)O(\(\eta\)\(\rightleftharpoons\) H\({}_{3}\)O\({}^{+}\)(aq) + A\({}^{-}\)(aq)
9. Strength of a base, B, depends on the position of the equilibrium:

\[{\rm B(aq)}+H_{2}\)O(\(\eta\)\(\rightleftharpoons\) BH\({}^{+}\)(aq) + OH\({}^{+}\)(aq)
10. A strong acid dissociates completely in water to form H\({}_{3}\)O\({}^{+}\)(aq).
11. A weak acid dissociates partially in water to form H\({}_{3}\)O\({}^{+}\)(aq).
12. A strong base dissociates completely in water to form OH\({}^{+}\)(aq).
13. A weak base dissociates partially in water to form OH\({}^{-}\)(aq).

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:15]

A Acid-Base Equilibria

We have seen in SS3.5 that the strength of an acid depends on the _position_ of the equilibrium

\[\text{HA(aq)}+\text{H}_{2}\text{O}(\emptyset)\rightleftharpoons\text{H}_{3}\text{O}^ {*}\text{(aq)}+\text{A}^{-}\text{(aq)}\]

and we learnt in Topic 7, Chemical Equilibria, that the equilibrium constant, \(K_{\text{c}}\), is a measure of the extent of an equilibrium reaction, which is _independent of the initial concentrations_.

\begin{tabular}{l l} LO (e) & explain the terms pH; \(K_{\text{i}}\); \(pK_{\text{i}}\); \(K_{\text{b}}\); \(pK_{\text{i}}\); \(K_{\text{w}}\) and apply them in calculations, including the relationship \(K_{\text{w}}=K_{\text{a}}K_{\text{b}}\) \\ \end{tabular}

### Acid Dissociation Constant, \(K_{\text{a}}\)

Consider the partial dissociation of a weak monobasic acid, HA(aq):

\[\text{HA(aq)}+\text{H}_{2}\text{O}(\emptyset)\rightleftharpoons\text{H}_{3} \text{O}^{*}\text{(aq)}+\text{A}^{-}\text{(aq)}\]

Since water is the solvent in the system, we can write the equilibrium constant, which is known as the **acid dissociation constant**, \(K_{\text{a}}\).

\begin{tabular}{l l} \hline \(K_{\text{a}}=\frac{\left[\text{H}_{3}\text{O}^{*}\right]_{\text{eqm}}\left[ \text{A}^{-}\right]_{\text{eqm}}}{\left[\text{HA}\right]_{\text{eqm}}}\) & units: mol dm\({}^{-3}\) \\ \end{tabular}

Since \(K_{\text{a}}\) is an equilibrium constant, it is **constant** at **constant temperature**.

The \(K_{\text{a}}\) values of different acids can be used to compare the **strength** of weak acids as it gives us a quantitative indication of the extent to which the acid is dissociated. However, as \(K_{\text{a}}\) values are typically very small for weak acids, it is usually more convenient to compare the acid strength using \(pK_{\text{a}}\) values.

\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|} \hline
**acids** & \(K_{\text{a}}\) / mol dm\({}^{-3}\) & \(pK_{\text{a}}\) \\ \hline HF(aq) & \(6.76\times 10^{-4}\) & 3.17 \\ \hline C\({}_{6}\)H\({}_{5}\)CO\({}_{2}\)H(aq) & \(6.31\times 10^{-5}\) & 4.20 \\ \hline CH\({}_{3}\)CO\({}_{2}\)H(aq) & \(1.75\times 10^{-5}\) & 4.76 \\ \hline HCN(aq) & \(6.17\times 10^{-10}\) & 9.21 \\ \hline C\({}_{6}\)H\({}_{5}\)OH(aq) & \(1.12\times 10^{-10}\) & 9.95 \\ \end{tabular}

Note: \(\underline{\text{\bf Larger}}\)\(K_{\text{a}}\) value or \(\underline{\text{\bf smaller}}\)\(pK_{\text{a}}\) value \(\Rightarrow\)\(\underline{\text{\bf Stronger}}\) acid, and _vice versa_.

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|} \hline
**dissociation** & **equilibrium** & \(K_{\text{a}}\) / mol dm\({}^{-3}\) & \(pK_{\text{a}}\) \\ \hline first, \(K_{\text{a}1}\) & H\({}_{3}\)PO\({}_{4}\)(aq) + H\({}_{2}\)O(\(\eta\)) \(\rightleftharpoons\) H\({}_{3}\)O\({}^{*}\)(aq) + H\({}_{2}\)PO\({}_{4}\)(aq) & 7.08 \(\times\) 10\({}^{-3}\) & 2.15 \\ \hline second, \(K_{\text{a}2}\) & H\({}_{2}\)PO\({}_{4}\)(aq) + H\({}_{2}\)O(\(\eta\)) \(\rightleftharpoons\) H\({}_{3}\)O\({}^{*}\)(aq) + HPO\({}_{4}^{2-}\)(aq) & 6.31 \(\times\) 10\({}^{-8}\) & 7.20 \\ \hline third, \(K_{\text{a}3}\) & HPO\({}_{4}^{2-}\)(aq) + H\({}_{2}\)O(\(\eta\)) \(\rightleftharpoons\) H\({}_{3}\)O\({}^{*}\)(aq) + PO\({}_{4}^{3-}\)(aq) & 4.47 \(\times\) 10\({}^{-13}\) & 12.35 \\ \hline \end{tabular}

From the table, you will notice that the value of \(K_{\text{a}}\) decreases upon each dissociation, _i.e._\(K_{\text{a}2}<K_{\text{a}1}\) and \(K_{\text{a}3}<K_{\text{a}2}\). This is because it is **more difficult to lose a proton** due to the **stronger electrostatic forces of attraction** between the **increasingly negatively charged conjugate base and the proton.

### Base Dissociation Constant, \(K_{\text{b}}\)

Consider the partial dissociation of a weak monoacidic base, B(aq):

\[\text{B(aq)}+\text{H}_{2}\text{O(}\eta\text{)}\rightleftharpoons\text{BH} ^{+}\text{(aq)}+\text{OH}^{+}\text{(aq)}\]

Like how \(K_{\text{a}}\) is derived, we can derive the **base dissociation constant**, \(K_{\text{b}}\) and \(pK_{\text{b}}\) of a weak base:

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|} \hline
**bases** & **formula** & \(K_{\text{b}}\) / mol dm\({}^{-3}\) & \(pK_{\text{b}}\) \\ \hline ethylamine & CH\({}_{3}\)CH\({}_{2}\)NH\({}_{2}\) & \(5.62\times 10^{-4}\) & 3.25 \\ \hline methylamine & CH\({}_{3}\)NH\({}_{2}\) & \(4.54\times 10^{-4}\) & 3.34 \\ \hline ammonia & NH\({}_{3}\) & \(1.74\times 10^{-5}\) & 4.76 \\ \hline phenylamine & C\({}_{6}\)H\({}_{5}\)NH\({}_{2}\) & \(4.27\times 10^{-10}\) & 9.37 \\ \hline \end{tabular}

Note: **Larger \(K_{\text{b}}\) value or smaller p\(K_{\text{b}}\) value \(\Rightarrow\) Stronger** base, and vice versa.

pH of a 1.5 mol dm\({}^{-3}\) aqueous solution of hypochlorous acid.

degree of dissociation of hypochlorous acid.

Let the [H\({}_{3}\)O\({}^{+}\)] at equilibrium be \(x\) mol dm\({}^{-3}\).

\[\begin{array}{ccccc}\text{HOC}l(\text{aq})&+&\text{H}_{2}\text{O}(l)& \rightleftharpoons&\text{H}_{3}\text{O}^{+}(\text{aq})&+&\text{C}l\text{O}^{-}( \text{aq})\\ \text{initial concentration/ mol dm${}^{-3}$}&1.5&0&0\\ \text{change in concentration/ mol dm${}^{-3}$}&-x&+x&+x\\ \text{equilibrium concentration/ mol dm${}^{-3}$}&1.5-x&x&x\\ \end{array}\]

What happens if we do not make the approximation that [HA]\({}_{\text{eqm}}\approx\)[HA]\({}_{\text{initial}}\)?

\[\begin{array}{ccccc}2.0\times 10^{-8}&=&\frac{x^{2}}{1.5-x}\\ \left[\text{H}_{3}\text{O}^{-}\right]&=&x=\frac{-\left(2\times 10^{-8} \right)\pm\sqrt{\left(2\times 10^{-8}\right)^{2}-4\left(-3\times 10^{-8} \right)}}{2}\\ &=&1.732\times 10^{-4}\text{ mol dm${}^{-3}$}\\ \text{pH}&=&-\text{lg}\left[\text{H}_{3}\text{O}^{-}\right]=3.76\\ \end{array}\]

Since \(x\) is so much smaller than the initial concentration of the acid, making the approximation does not result in any significant impact on the final answer. Hence, it is safe to make the approximation.

\[\begin{array}{ccccc}\text{(b)}&\alpha=\frac{\text{amount dissociated}}{ \text{total initial amount}}&\text{or}&\alpha=\sqrt{\frac{K_{a}}{\left[\text{HA} \right]_{\text{total}}}}\\ \end{array}\]

## 6 Acid and Base Properties of Salt Solutions

A salt is formed by the reaction of an acid and a base. It is made up of a cation which comes from the base and an anion which comes from the acid. For example, ammonium ethanoate, CH\({}_{3}\)CO\({}_{2}\)NH\({}_{4}^{+}\) comes from CH\({}_{3}\)CO\({}_{2}\)H and NH\({}_{3}\).

Salts can be soluble, sparingly soluble or insoluble in water. Soluble salts dissociate completely in water, forming hydrated ions. If the ions do not undergo _hydrolysis_, the solution will remain neutral. If the ions undergo _hydrolysis_, they will form either acidic or alkaline solutions. As such, these salts can be classified as either acidic or basic respectively.

NH\({}_{4}^{+}\)(aq) + H\({}_{2}\)O(\(l\)) \(\rightleftharpoons\) NH\({}_{3}\)(aq) + H\({}_{3}\)O\({}^{+}\)(aq)

NH\({}_{4}^{+}\)(aq) + H\({}_{2}\)O(\(l\)) \(\rightleftharpoons\) NH\({}_{3}\)(aq) + H\({}_{3}\)O\({}^{+}\)(aq)

\[K_{\rm a}=\frac{\left[\text{NH}_{3}\right]\left[\text{H}_{3}\text{O}^{+}\right]}{ \left[\text{NH}_{4}^{+}\right]}\]

**(Note: Do you see that this calculation is similar to Example 5C?)**

Consider the salt ammonium chloride, NH\({}_{4}\)Cl, wherein the NH\({}_{4}^{+}\) ion hydrolyses to give an acidic solution.

NH\({}_{4}^{+}\)(aq) + H\({}_{2}\)O(\(l\)) \(\rightleftharpoons\) NH\({}_{3}\)(aq) + H\({}_{3}\)O\({}^{+}\)(aq)

The acid dissociation constant, \(K_{\rm o}\) of the conjugate acid can be derived from the base dissociation constant, \(K_{\rm o}\) of the base it was formed from using \(K_{\rm w}\) (refer to SS4.4)

_i.e._

\[K_{\rm o}\)(NH\({}_{4}^{+}\)) \(\times\)\(K_{\rm o}\)(NH\({}_{3}\)) = \(K_{\rm w}\]

Similarly, a basic salt such as sodium ethanoate, wherein the CH\({}_{3}\)CO\({}_{2}\) ion hydrolyses to give a basic solution.

CH\({}_{3}\)CO\({}_{2}\)(aq) + H\({}_{2}\)O(\(l\)) \(\rightleftharpoons\) CH\({}_{3}\)CO\({}_{2}\)H(aq) + OH-(aq)

The base dissociation constant, \(K_{\rm o}\) of the conjugate base can be derived from the acid dissociation constant, \(K_{\rm o}\) of the acid it was formed from using \(K_{\rm w}\) (refer to SS4.4)

_i.e._

\[K_{\rm o}\)(CH\({}_{3}\)CO\({}_{2}\)) \(\times\)\(K_{\rm o}\)(CH\({}_{3}\)CO\({}_{2}\)H) = \(K_{\rm w}\]

**Checkpoint for Section 6**

At the end of this section, you should know that:

1. The salt formed from a reaction between a strong acid and a strong base will dissolve in water to give a neutral solution, as neither the cation nor the anion undergoes hydrolysis.
2. The salt formed from a reaction between a strong acid and a weak base will dissolve in water to form an acidic solution, as the cation is a moderately strong conjugate acid that hydrolys in water.
3. The salt formed from a reaction between a weak acid and a strong base will dissolve in water to form an alkaline solution, as the anion is a moderately strong conjugate base that hydrolys in water.
4. Both the cation and anion of a salt formed from a reaction between a weak acid and a weak base will hydrolyse in water.

### pH of a Buffer (not in H1 syllabus)

Consider an acidic buffer containing an acid, HA, and its conjugate base, A-,

HA(aq) + H2O(\(\mathit{\hbar}\)\(\rightleftharpoons\) H3O*(aq) + A-(aq) NaA(aq) \(\rightarrow\) Na*(aq) + A-(aq) HA, being a weak acid, undergoes slight dissociation in aqueous solution. Its dissociation is suppressed by the high concentration of A- ions from the complete dissociation of the salt, NaA. This is in accordance with Le Chatelier's Principle.

Hence, [HA]eqm = [HA]initial - [A-]fromHA [HA]

[HA]initial

[A-]eqm = [A-]fromNaA [A-]fromNaA

Hence for an acidic buffer solution,

\[K_{\mathrm{a}}\left(\mathrm{HA}\right) = \frac{\left[\mathrm{H}_{\mathrm{3}}\mathrm{O}^{\mathrm{+}}\right] \left[\mathrm{A}^{\mathrm{-}}\right]_{\mathrm{fromNaA}}}{\left[\mathrm{HA} \right]_{\mathrm{final}}}\] \[\left[\mathrm{H}_{\mathrm{3}}\mathrm{O}^{\mathrm{-}}\right] = K_{\mathrm{a}}\left(\mathrm{HA}\right)\frac{\left[\mathrm{HA} \right]_{\mathrm{final}}}{\left[\mathrm{A}^{\mathrm{-}}\right]_{\mathrm{ fromNaA}}}\] \[-\mathrm{lg}\left[\mathrm{H}_{\mathrm{3}}\mathrm{O}^{\mathrm{-}} \right] = -\mathrm{lg}K_{\mathrm{a}}\left(\mathrm{HA}\right)-\mathrm{lg}\frac{ \left[\mathrm{HA}\right]_{\mathrm{final}}}{\left[\mathrm{A}^{\mathrm{-}} \right]_{\mathrm{fromNaA}}}\] \[\mathrm{pH} = pK_{\mathrm{a}}\left(\mathrm{HA}\right)+\mathrm{lg}\frac{ \left[\mathrm{A}^{\mathrm{-}}\right]_{\mathrm{fromNaA}}}{\left[\mathrm{HA} \right]_{\mathrm{final}}}\]

Consider a basic buffer containing a base, B, and its conjugate acid, BH+,

B(aq) + H2O(\(\mathit{\hbar}\)\(\rightleftharpoons\) BH+(aq) + OH-(aq) BHC_l(aq) \(\rightarrow\) BH+(aq) + _Cl-(aq) B_, being a weak base, undergoes slight dissociation in aqueous solution. Its dissociation is suppressed by the high concentration of BH+ ions from the complete dissociation of the salt, BHC_l. This is in accordance with Le Chatelier's Principle.

Hence, [B]eqm = [B]initial- [BH+]fromB [BH

### Buffer Capacity

Buffer capacity, \(\beta\), refers to the amount of acid or base that need to be added to a buffer solution for each unit change in pH. It represents the ability of a buffer to resist changes in pH. Buffer is at its **maximum buffer capacity**, when the ratio of the concentrations of the weak acid (or base) and its conjugate base (or acid) is 1 : 1, since it will be _equally efficient_ in removing added acid and base. When this is achieved,

\[\text{pH} =\text{p}K_{\text{a}}+\text{lg}\frac{\left[\left(\text{conjugate} \right)\text{ base}\right]}{\left[\left(\text{conjugate}\right)\text{ acid}\right]}\] \[=\text{p}K_{\text{a}}+\text{lg}1\] \[=\text{p}K_{\text{a}}\]

The **effective buffer range** is about one pH unit on either side of this maximum, _i.e._\(\text{p}K_{\text{a}}\pm 1\). Beyond this range, the pH of the solution changes appreciably upon the addition of small amounts of acid or base. Hence, we will select a buffer whose **acid form** has a **pK_a close to the desired pH.

This pH range translates to the ratio of the concentrations of the (conjugate) base to (conjugate) acid to be kept within

\[\text{p}K_{\text{a}}-1 \leq\text{pH} \leq\text{p}K_{\text{a}}+1\] \[\text{p}K_{\text{a}}+\text{lg}\frac{1}{10} \leq\text{p}K_{\text{a}}+\text{lg}\frac{\left[\left(\text{conjugate} \right)\text{ base}\right]}{\left[\left(\text{conjugate}\right)\text{ acid}\right]} \leq\text{p}K_{\text{a}}+\text{lg}\frac{10}{1}\] \[\frac{1}{10} \leq\]

Besides the ratio, buffer capacity **increases with the concentration** of the weak acid (or base) and its conjugate base (or acid) making up the buffer, and these should be kept high to ensure efficiency.

\begin{tabular}{|c c c|} \hline \multicolumn{3}{|c|}{Example 7A} \\ \multicolumn{3}{|c|}{Phosphoric acid is a tribasic acid.} \\ \(\text{H}_{3}\text{PO}_{4}(\text{aq})\)\(\rightleftharpoons\) H+(aq) + H2PO4(aq) & \(\text{p}\text{K}_{\text{st}}=2.15\) \\ \(\text{H}_{2}\text{PO}_{4}(\text{aq})\)\(\rightleftharpoons\) H+(aq) + HPO4(aq) & \(\text{p}\text{K}_{\text{a2}}=7.20\) \\ \(\text{HPO}_{4}^{2+}(\text{aq})\)\(\rightleftharpoons\) H+(aq) + PO4(aq) & \(\text{p}\text{K}_{\text{a3}}=12.35\) \\ \hline \end{tabular}

Suggest how a buffer at pH 6.80 can be prepared from 1.00 mol dm\({}^{-3}\) NaOH and 1 dm\({}^{3}\) of 1.00 mol dm\({}^{-3}\) H3PO4.

\[\text{pH} = \text{p}\text{K}_{\text{a}}+\text{lg}\frac{\left[\text{conjugate base} \right]}{\left[\text{acid}\right]}\] \[6.80 = 7.20+\text{lg}\frac{\left[\text{HPO}_{4}^{2-}\right]}{\left[ \text{H}_{2}\text{PO}_{4}^{-}\right]}\] \[\frac{\left[\text{HPO}_{4}^{2-}\right]}{\left[\text{H}_{2}\text{PO} _{4}^{-}\right]} = 10^{-0.40}=0.3981\] \[n_{\text{HPO}_{4}^{2-}} = 0.3981n_{\text{H}_{\text{p}O}_{4}}\]

Both H2PO4 and HPO4 are obtained by reacting H3PO4 with an appropriate amount of NaOH:

\[\text{H}_{3}\text{PO}_{4}(\text{aq})\text{ + OH}^{-}(\text{aq})\text{ \rightarrow H}_{2}\text{PO}_{4}^{-}(\text{aq})\text{ + H}_{2}\text{O}(\text{l})\] \[\text{H}_{3}\text{PO}_{4}(\text{aq})\text{ + 2OH}^{-}(\text{aq})\text{ \rightarrow H}\text{PO}_{4}^{2-}(\text{aq})\text{ + 2H}_{2}\text{O}(\text{l})\] \[n_{\text{HPO}_{4}^{2-}}+n_{\text{H}_{\text{p}O}_{4}} = n_{\text{H}_{\text{p}O}_{4}}=1.00\text{ mol}\] \[0.3981n_{\text{H}_{\text{p}O}_{4}}+n_{\text{H}_{\text{p}O}_{4}

### Uses of Buffers

Buffer solutions are used in situations in which it is necessary to maintain a constant pH. A few examples are given below:

1. In industry, buffers are used widely to control chemical processes including electroplating, manufacture of dyes, photographic materials and leather.
2. Chemists use buffers in analysis _e.g._ in calibration of pH meters.
3. Analytical biochemists use buffers to determine the number and type of amino acids present in proteins by electrophoresis, a technique which involves the migration of charged particles in solution through an electric field.
4. Many biological systems where a change in pH can have a great effect on the functioning of a cell. Therefore, _e.g._ all intravenous injections and eye drops are buffered as human blood and tears have specific pH.
5. In bacteriological research, buffer solution is used to maintain the pH of culture media used for the growth of bacteria.
6. In maintaining pH of soils for growth of certain plants _e.g._ azalea, rhododend - pH 4

_Blood Buffer System_

The pH of human blood must be maintained within a narrow range of 7.35 - 7.45. It is important for pH of blood to be kept constant so that enzymes in the blood which only work within a small pH range can function properly.

In a healthy person, the pH of blood never departs more than approximately 0.2 pH unit from the average value. If the pH of blood falls below 6.8 or rises above 7.8, death may result.

The buffer in blood mainly consists of proteins, a mixture carbonates (HCO3/H2CO3), and a mixture of phosphates (HPO2-/H2PO2)

1. The proteins are made up of amino acids containing acidic and basic side chains, which act as buffers (_e.g._ lysine, arginine, aspartic acid)
2. CO2 produced as the by-product of metabolic reactions in the body, dissolves to form carbonic acid which dissociates partially to give hydrogen carbonate (or bicarbonate) ion, HCO3-.

CO2(g) + H2O(l) = H2CO3(aq) + H2CO3(aq) + H2CO3(aq) + H3O*(aq)

H2CO3/HCO3 forms a buffer system in blood plasma.

If the concentration of H3O+ increases (_e.g._ from lactic acid which is produced during exercise), HCO3- present reacts and removes the additional H3O+ ions to resist changes in pH.

H3O*(aq) + HCO3(aq) \(\rightarrow\) H2CO3(aq)

## 8 Indicators

An indicator is a substance that changes colour in response to pH changes of the solution it is added to. Most indicators are usually weak acids or bases, which change colour depending on the pH of the solution. Different colours will be exhibited by their dissociated and un-dissociated forms. Indicators are used to detect the end-point in acid-base titrations.

Let the undissociated indicator be a weak acid, HIn.

At equilibrium,

\[\begin{array}{ll}\text{HIn(aq) + H}_{2}\text{O($l$)}&\rightleftharpoons&\text{H}_{3}\text{O^{+}(aq) + In^{-}(aq)}\\ \text{weak acid}&\text{conjugate base}\\ \text{(colour A)}&\text{(colour B)}\end{array}\]

The dissociation constant of an indicator is termed \(K_{\text{in}}\).

\[\begin{array}{l}\mathcal{K}_{\text{in}}=\frac{\left[\text{H}_{3}\text{O^{ +}}\right]\left[\text{In^{-}}\right]}{\left[\text{HIn}\right]}\\ \left[\frac{\left[\text{In^{-}}\right]}{\left[\text{HIn}\right]}\right]=\frac{ \mathcal{K}_{\text{in}}}{\left[\text{H}_{3}\text{O^{+}}\right]}\end{array}\]

At different pH, the proportion of HIn to In's different, giving rise to different colours.

At **low pH**, [H\({}_{3}\)O\({}^{+}\)] is high, the equilibrium position shifts to the **left**. Hence, there is a larger proportion of **HIn** and **colour A** is observed.

At **high pH**, [H\({}_{3}\)O\({}^{+}\)] is low (as large amounts of H\({}_{3}\)O\({}^{+}\) is consumed during the titration), the equilibrium position shifts to the **right**. Hence there is a larger proportion of **In\({}^{-}\)** and **colour B** is observed.

For the 2 colours to be distinguishable by the human eye, one form must be about **10 times more concentrated** than the other form, _i.e._ in the ratio of \(1:10\).

_i.e._ If \(\left[\text{In^{-}}\right]=0.1\), colour A is observed. \(\Rightarrow\) pH = p\(K_{\text{in}}-1\)

If \(\left[\text{In^{-}}\right]=10\), colour B is observed. \(\Rightarrow\) pH = p\(K_{\text{in}}+1\)

If \(\left[\text{In^{-}}\right]=\left[\text{HIn}\right]\), colour changed observed is a combination of A and B \(\Rightarrow\) pH = p\(K_{\text{in}}\)

Hence, an indicator is found to change colour over an approximate pH range of **p\(K_{\text{in}}\pm 1\)**, which is called the **working pH range** of the indicator.

### Choice of indicator

An indicator is suitable for a titration if the **working pH range of the indicator** (pH range for colour change) **lies within** the **range of rapid pH change for the titration**.

The working pH range of some indicators can be found in the table below

\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|c|c|} \hline  & \multicolumn{2}{c|}{**colour**} & \multicolumn{1}{c|}{} & \multicolumn{1}{c|}{} \\ \cline{2-5}
**indicator** & **HIn** & **In\({}^{*}\)** & **pK\({}_{\text{in}}\)** & **pH range/** \\  & **(undissociated)** & **(dissociated)** & & **working range** \\ \hline thymol blue\({}^{\text{A}}\) & red & yellow & 1.6 & \(1.2-2.8\) \\ \hline methyl orange & red & yellow & 3.4 & \(3.1-4.4\) \\ \hline \hline screened methyl orange\({}^{*}\) & violet & green & 3.4 & \(3.1-4.4\) \\ \hline methyl red & red & yellow & 5.1 & \(4.2-6.3\) \\ \hline litmus & red & blue & 6.5 & \(6.0-8.0\) \\ \hline thymol blue\({}^{\text{A}}\) & yellow & blue & 8.9 & \(8.0-9.6\) \\ \hline phenolphthalein & colourless & pink & 9.3 & \(8.2-10.0\) \\ \hline thymolphthalein & colourless & blue & 9.9 & \(9.3-10.5\) \\ \hline \end{tabular}

\({}^{\text{A}}\) Thymol blue is a dibasic acid and there are three forms: H\({}_{2}\)In (red), HIn\({}^{*}\) (yellow) and In\({}^{2-}\) (blue).

\({}^{*}\) Screened methyl orange is a mixture of methyl orange and an inert blue dye, xylene cyanide FF, to make the end-point more prominent.

### What is the difference between equivalence point and end-point of a titration?

* **Equivalence point** is the point at which stoichiometric amounts of acid and base **react completely**.
* **End-point** is an experimentally determined value and it is reached when the **first drop of titrant changes the colour of the indicator permanently**.

When an appropriate indicator is chosen, the **end-point will be close to the equivalence point**. Hence, the end-point of titration depends on the indicator being used.

\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|c|} \hline  & \multicolumn{1}{c|}{} & \multicolumn{1}{c|}{} & \multicolumn{1}{c|}{} \\ \cline{2-5}

* **Equivalence point** is the point at which stoichiometric amounts of acid and base **react completely**.
* **End-point** is an experimentally determined value and it is reached when the **first drop of titrant changes the colour of the indicator permanently**.

When an appropriate indicator is chosen, the **end-point will be close to the equivalence point**. Hence, the end-point of titration depends on the indicator being used.

**(d) When excess base is added (after equivalence point)**

* From now on, the base added has nothing to react with, so the pH rises towards a final value of 14.
* 2.70 = 11.3 The pH changes rapidly near the equivalence point (from 2.70 at 24.90 cm\({}^{3}\) of base to 11.3 at 25.10 cm\({}^{3}\) of base in this case).

_Suitable Indicators:_

Suitable indicators for a strong acid-strong base titration: **methyl orange/screened methyl orange and thymolphthalein/phenolphthalein**. However, note that shape of the titration curve also depends on concentrations of the acids and bases.

When the concentrations of the acids and bases are too low, there may not be a sharp change in pH at the equivalence-point (below 1.0 \(\times\) 10\({}^{-4}\) mol dm\({}^{-3}\)), or the region of sharp pH change may not coincide with that of the usual indicators (below 1.0 \(\times\) 10\({}^{-1}\) mol dm\({}^{-3}\)).

[FIGURE:S4.F1][ENDFIG

### Weak Acid - Strong Base Titration

Consider a titration of a weak acid, 25.0 cm\({}^{3}\) of 1.00 mol dm\({}^{-3}\) CH\({}_{3}\)CO\({}_{2}\)H (\(K_{\text{a}}\) = 1.74 \(\times\) 10\({}^{-5}\) mol dm\({}^{-3}\)), with a strong base, 1.00 mol dm\({}^{-3}\) NaOH.

[MISSING_PAGE_POST]

Solution is an **acidic buffer** as a weak acid, CH\({}_{3}\)CO\({}_{2}\)H and its conjugate base, CH\({}_{3}\)CO\({}_{2}\)Na salt is present.

\[\text{pH}=\text{p}K_{\text{a}}+\text{lg}\frac{\left[\text{conjugate base}\right]}{\left[\text{acid}\right]}=-\text{lg}(1.74\times 1 0^{-5})+\text{lg}\frac{0.01+\frac{35}{1000}}{0.015+\frac{35}{1000}}\]

\[=\text{\bf 4.58}\]

When 12.50 cm\({}^{3}\) of 1.00 mol dm\({}^{-3}\) NaOH is added to 25.0 cm\({}^{3}\) of 1.00 mol dm\({}^{-3}\) CH\({}_{3}\)CO\({}_{2}\)H,

**Half-equivalence point**: where half of the acid present in the reaction mixture is neutralised

_i.e._ volume at half-equivalence point = \(\frac{\text{\bf 1}}{\text{\bf 2}}\)**x volume at equivalence point**

At this point,

[weak acid] = [conjugate base]

**Buffer is at its maximum buffer capacity**

**pH = pK\({}_{\text{a}}\)** (because pH = pK\({}_{\text{a}}\) + lg 1, and lg 1 = 0)

pH = pK\({}_{\text{a}}\) = **4.76**

**(c) At equivalence point**

The pH at equivalence point is > 7 due to the hydrolysis of CH\({}_{3}\)CO\({}_{2}\)Na.

\[\text{CH}_{3}\text{CO}_{2}(\text{aq})\ +\ \text{H}_{2}\text{O}(\text{l}) \rightleftharpoons\text{CH}_{3}\text{CO}_{2}\text{H}(\text{aq})\ +\ \text{OH}^{-}(\text{aq})\]

\[\left[\text{CH}_{3}\text{CO}_{2}^{-}\right]=0.025+0.05=0.5\ \text{mol dm}^{-3}\]

\[K_{\text{b}}\left(\text{CH}_{3}\text{CO}_{2}^{-}\right)=\frac{K_{\text{w}}}{K _{\text{a}}\left(\text{CH}_{3}\text{CO}_{2}\text{H}\right)}=5.75\times 10^{-10} \ \text{mol dm}^{-3}\]

\[\left[\text{OH}^{-}\right]=\sqrt{K_{\text{b}}\left[\text{CH}_{3}\text{CO}_{2}^ {-}\right]}=\sqrt{5.75\times 10^{-10}\times 0.5}\]

\[=1.70\times 10^{-5}\ \text{mol dm}^{-3}\]

pOH = -lg[OH] = -lg(1.70\times 10^{-5})=4.77\]

pH = 14 - pOH = 14 - **4.77 = 9.23**

**(d) When excess base is added (after equivalence point)**

From now on, the base added has nothing to react with, so the pH rises towards a final value of 14 (_i.e._ the pH of 0.1 mol dm\({}^{-3}\) NaOH).

When excess base is added, the mixture contains excess strong base and the salt formed.

The OH\({}^{-}\) in the mixture is primarily due to the strong alkali since hydrolysis of the conjugate base is suppressed by the excess OH\({}^{-}\) added.

Hence, the [OH\({}^{-}\)] from hydrolysis is negligible.

_Suitable Indicators_:

The region of rapid pH change lies between 7 and 11.

Any indicator which changes colour over the range of pH 7 to 11 can be used to gauge the equivalence point.

Suitable indicators: **thymolphthalein/phenolphthalein**.

### Strong Acid - Weak Base Titration

Consider a titration of a strong acid, 25.0 cm\({}^{3}\) of 1.00 mol dm\({}^{-3}\) HC_l_, with a weak base, 1.00 mol dm\({}^{-3}\) NH\({}_{3}\) (K\({}_{6}\) = 1.77 \(\times\) 10\({}^{-5}\) mol dm\({}^{-3}\)).

Hence, the [H\({}^{+}\)] from hydrolysis is negligible.

The pH at equivalence point is **< 7** due to the hydrolysis of NH\({}_{4}\)_CL_

NH\({}_{4}^{+}\)(aq) \(\rightleftharpoons\) NH\({}_{3}\)(aq) + H\({}^{+}\)(aq)

NH\({}_{4}^{+}\) = \(\sqrt{K_{\text{a}}\left[\text{NH}_{4}^{+}\right]}\) = \(\sqrt{5.65 \times 10^{-10}\times 0.5}\)

(a) Before titration (at initial point)

At the initial point, the solution contains only **strong acid**. The pH of the solution is caused by the strong acid present.

NH\({}_{4}^{-}\) = \(\frac{K_{\text{w}}}{K_{\text{b}}\left(\text{NH}_{3}\right)}\) = 5.65 \(\times\) 10\({}^{-10}\) mol dm\({}^{-3}\)

NH\({}_{4}^{-}\) = \(\sqrt{K_{\text{a}}\left[\text{NH}_{4}^{+}\right]}\) = \(\sqrt{5.65 \times 10^{-10}\times 0.5}\)

NH\({}_{4}^{-}\) = 1.68 \(\times\) 10\({}^{-6}\) mol dm\({}^{-3}\)

NH\({}_{4}^{+}\) (aq) \(\rightleftharpoons\) NH\({}_{3}\)(aq) + H\({}^{+}\)(aq)

NH\({}_{4}^{-}\) = 0.

**(d) When excess base is added (after equivalence point)**

* In this region, the mixture consists of the additional **weak base** and the **conjugate acid** from neutralisation, forming a **basic buffer**.
* pH gradually increases but resists pH change near maximum buffer capacity.

When 50.00 cm\({}^{3}\) of 1.00 mol dm\({}^{-3}\) NH\({}_{3}\) is added to 25.0 cm\({}^{3}\) of 1.00 mol dm\({}^{-3}\) HC\({}_{4}\)

* **Maximum buffer capacity** occurs when **[weak base] = [conjugate acid]**
* pH = **pK\({}_{\text{a}}\)** (where _K\({}_{\text{a}}\)_ is for NH\({}_{4}^{+}\))**
* This point occurs at _2V cm\({}^{3}\)_

where \(V\) cm\({}^{3}\) is the volume of base required to neutralise the acid completely.

_Suitable Indicators:_

* The region of rapid pH change generally lies between 3 and 7.
* Any indicator which changes colour over the range of pH 3 to 7 can be used to gauge the equivalence point.
* Suitable indicators: **methyl orange/screened methyl orange**.

### Weak Acid - Weak Base Titration (not required to know)

Consider a titration of 25.0 cm\({}^{3}\) of a weak acid, 1.00 mol dm\({}^{-3}\)CH\({}_{3}\)CO\({}_{2}\)H (\(K_{\rm a}\) = 1.74 \(\times\) 10\({}^{-5}\) mol dm\({}^{-3}\)) with weak base, 1.00 mol dm\({}^{-3}\) NH\({}_{3}\) (\(K_{\rm b}\) = 1.77 \(\times\) 10\({}^{-5}\) mol dm\({}^{-3}\)).

(a) **Before titration (at initial point)**

* At the initial point, the solution contains only weak acid. The pH of the solution is caused by the weak acid present. \(\left[{\rm H^{+}}\right]\)=\(\sqrt{K_{\rm a}\times\left[{\rm HA}\right]_{\rm initial}}\) = 4.17 \(\times\) 10\({}^{-3}\) mol dm\({}^{-3}\) pH = -lg(4.17 \(\times\) 10\({}^{-3}\)) = 2.38
**(b) When acid is partially neutralised (after initial, before equivalence point)**

* pH gradually increases as the weak acid is being neutralised by added weak base.
* In this region, the mixture consists of the remaining **weak acid** (CH\({}_{3}\)CO\({}_{2}\)) and the **conjugate base** (CH\({}_{3}\)CO\({}_{2}\)) formed from neutralisation, forming an **acidic buffer**.
* The conjugate acid of the weak base, NH\({}_{4}^{+}\), does not contribute significant to the [H\({}^{+}\)] as it is a much weaker acid than CH\({}_{3}\)CO\({}_{2}\)H. \(K_{\rm a}\left({\rm NH_{4}^{+}}\right)\)=\(\frac{K_{\rm w}}{K_{\rm b}\left({\rm NH_{3}}\right)}\) = 5.65\(\times\)10\({}^{-10}\) mol dm\({}^{-3}\).

When 12.50 cm\({}^{3}\) of 1.00 mol dm\({}^{-3}\) NH\({}_{3}\) is added to 25.0 cm\({}^{3}\) of 1.00 mol dm\({}^{-3}\) CH\({}_{3}\)CO\({}_{2}\)H,

**Half-equivalence point:** where half of the acid present in the reaction mixture is neutralised

_i.e._ volume at half-equivalence point = \(\frac{1}{2}\)**x volume at equivalence point**

At this point,

* [weak acid] = [conjugate base]
* **Buffer is at its maximum buffer capacity**
* pH = pK\({}_{\rm a}\) = 4.76 (because pH = pK\({}_{\rm a}\) + lg 1, and lg 1 = 0)

\[\begin{array}{cccccccc}\text{H}_{2}\text{A(aq)}&+&\text{H}_{2}\text{O}(l)& \rightleftharpoons&\text{HA}^{-}\text{(aq)}&+&\text{H}_{3}\text{O}^{\text{*}} \text{(aq)}&\text{p}K_{41}\\ \text{HA}^{-}\text{(aq)}&+&\text{H}_{2}\text{O}(l)&\rightleftharpoons&\text{A}^{2 -}\text{(aq)}&+&\text{H}_{3}\text{O}^{\text{*}}\text{(aq)}&\text{p}K_{62}\\ \end{array}\]

As expected, pK\({}_{41}\) < pK\({}_{62}\) for all cases. However, two equivalence points are not always observed:

* The first equivalence point is not obvious for sulfuric acid and malic acid.
* Although the first equivalence point is seen in ethanoliotic acid, there is no sharp change in pH.
* Only phosphorous acid has a well-defined first equivalence point, which allow titration as a _monoprotic acid_ using (screened) methyl orange as indicator.

The first equivalence point is generally not well-defined when pK\({}_{41}\) and pK\({}_{62}\) are too close to one another (difference less than 5 units).

Nonetheless, all four acids have well-defined second equivalence points, which allow titration as a _diprotic acid_ using phenolphthalein or thymolphthalein as indicator.

Also, there is no way (at A-level) to calculate the pH at the first equivalence point accurately, although it should be a 0.500 mol dm\({}^{-3}\) solution of HA\({}^{-}\)(aq). This is due to HA\({}^{-}\) being a reasonably strong conjugate base, besides being a weak acid itself, hence causing the actual pH at the first equivalence point to be higher than calculated assuming it is only an acid.

pH of 0.500 mol dm\({}^{-3}\) of HA\({}^{-}\) (aq) = -lg\(\left[\text{H}^{+}\right]\) = -lg\(\sqrt{K_{\text{a2}}\times\left[\text{HA}^{-}\right]}\) = -lg\(\sqrt{10^{-\text{pK}_{\text{a2}}}\times 0.500}\)

< pH at first equivalence point

Nevertheless, the pH at the first equivalence point can be readily estimated as the average of pK\({}_{41}\) and pK\({}_{62}\): pH at first end-point \(\approx\frac{pK_{41}+pK_{62}}{2}\)

However, pH at the second equivalence point can be calculated as a 0.333 mol dm\({}^{-3}\) solution of A\({}^{2-}\)(aq), since A\({}^{2-}\) functions only as a weak base and not an acid.

pH of 0.500 mol dm\({}^{-3}\) of A\({}^{2-}\) (aq) = 14 - pOH = 14 +lg\(\sqrt{\frac{10^{-4}}{10^{-pK_{62}}}\times 0.333}\)

\[\approx\text{pH at second equivalence point}\]

Phosphoric acid is a triprotic acid, and has three pK\({}_{6}\) values:

\[\begin{array}{cccccccc}\text{H}\text{sPO}_{4}\text{(aq)}&+&\text{H}\text{ zO}(l)&\rightleftharpoons&\text{H}\text{zPO}_{4}\text{(aq)}&+&\text{H}\text{sO}^{ \text{*}}\text{(aq)}&\text{p}K_{41}=2.15\\ \text{H}\text{zPO}_{4}\text{(aq)}&+&\text{H}\text{zO}(l)&\rightleftharpoons& \text{H}\text{PO}_{4}^{2-}\text{(aq)}&+&\text{H}_{3}\text{O}^{\text{*}}\text{( aq)}&\text{p}K_{62}=7.20\\ \text{H}\text{PO}_{4}^{2-}\text{(aq)}&+&\text{H}\text{zO}(l)&\rightleftharpoons& \text{PO}_{4}^{2-}\text{(aq)}&+&\text{H}_{3}\text{O}^{\text{*}}\text{(aq)}& \text{p}K_{63}=12.35\\ \end{array}\]

The pK\({}_{6}\) values increase from each dissociation step for phosphoric acid. This implies that H\({}_{3}\)PO\({}_{4}\) is a much stronger acid than H\({}_{2}\)PO\({}_{4}^{-}\), which is in turn stronger than HPO\({}_{4}^{2-}\).

_Theoretically_, we would expect **three equivalence points** in the titration of H\({}_{3}\)PO\({}_{4}\) against NaOH. However, the titration of H\({}_{3}\)PO\({}_{4}\) is an interesting case. The pH curve obtained when 25.0 cm\({}^{3}\) of 0.100 mol dm\({}^{-3}\) H\({}_{3}\)PO\({}_{4}\) is titrated against 0.100 mol dm\({}^{-3}\) NaOH is shown on the next page.

The titration curve contains only **two inflection points** and phosphoric acid can be titrated either as a _monoprotic acid_ or as a _diprotic acid_.

* the acid is titrated with an indicator that changes colour at around pH 9.65 (for example thymolphthalein, working range 9.3
- 10.5). Phenolphthalein cannot be used, as it starts to change colour around pH 8.2, when phosphoric acid is titrated in about 95%.

It is interesting to mention, that phosphoric acid can be titrated as triprotic - if the PO\({}_{4}^{3-}\) anion is precipitated first using a suitable metal ions (for example Ca\({}^{2+}\) or Ag\({}^{+}\)):

\[2\text{H}_{3}\text{PO}_{4}(\text{aq})+3\text{Ca}\text{C}\text{L}_{2}(\text{aq} )\rightarrow\text{Ca}_{3}(\text{PO}_{4})_{2}(\textbf{s})+6\text{HC}I(\text{aq})\]

After precipitation HC_I_ can be titrated against NaOH.

How many equivalence point(s) will there be, if NaOH(aq) [in the conical flask] is titrated against H\({}_{3}\text{PO}_{4}(\text{aq})\) [from the burette] instead?

### Double Indicator Titrations

The use of two different acid-base indicators (which change colour at different pH from one another) can be applied to determine the composition of mixtures of weak and strong bases (or acids), or in the titration of polyprotic substances with two equivalence points or more. Some common examples are:

* Acid-carbonate titrations
* Titration of a mixture of carbonate and hydrogen carbonate solution

### Titration of sodium carbonate solution against strong acid

The reaction of CO\({}_{3}^{2-}\) with acids occurs in 2 steps:

**Step 1:**: \(\text{CO}_{3}^{2-}(\textbf{aq})+\text{H}^{+}(\textbf{aq})\rightarrow\text{ HCO}_{3}^{2-}(\textbf{aq})\)
**Step 2:**: \(\text{HCO}_{3}^{2-}(\textbf{aq})+\text{H}^{+}(\textbf{aq})\rightarrow\text{ CO}_{2}(\textbf{g})+\text{H}_{2}\text{O}(\textbf{l})\)

Overall: \(\text{CO}_{3}^{2-}(\textbf{aq})+2\text{H}^{+}(\textbf{aq})\rightarrow\text{ CO}_{2}(\textbf{g})+\text{H}_{2}\text{O}(\textbf{l})\)

This implies that there are two sharp changes observed in the titration, as illustrated below for the titration of \(V\) cm\({}^{3}\) of 1.00 mol dm\({}^{-3}\) Na\({}_{2}\)CO\({}_{3}\) against 1.00 mol dm\({}^{-3}\) HC_I_:

[FIGURE:S4.F1][ENDFIGU
When HC_I_ is first added to Na\({}_{2}\)CO\({}_{3}\), **reaction 1** will occur and an indicator, such as phenolphthalein can be used to detect the first end-point since the working pH range of phenolphthalein (_i.e._ pH 8.2 - 10.0) coincides with the sharp pH change of the equivalence point of **reaction 1**.

Similarly, when **reaction 2** starts to occur, methyl orange or screened methyl orange can be used to detect the second end-point, since the working pH range of methyl orange (_i.e._ 3.1 - 4.4) coincides with the sharp pH change of the equivalence point of **reaction 2**.

**Checkpoint for sections 8 and 9**

At the end of these two sections, you should know that:

1. At low pH, a larger proportion of HIn is present and the colour corresponding to the acidic form is observed.
2. At high pH, a larger proportion of In\({}^{-}\) is present and the colour corresponding to the basic form is observed.
3. When [HIn] = [In\({}^{-}\)], the colour observed is a mixture of both the acidic and basic form, where pH = p_K\({}_{\text{n}}\).
4. An indicator changes colour over an approximate pH range of p_K\({}_{\text{n}}\pm 1\)_, which is the working pH range of the indicator.
5. An indicator is suitable for use if the working pH range of the indicator lies within the range of rapid pH change for the titration.
6. For a strong acid-strong base titration, the pH of the solution at equivalence point is 7 because the salt does not hydrolyse.
7. For a weak acid-strong base titration, the pH of the solution at equivalence point is > 7 because the anion of the salt formed (conjugate base) hydrolyses to give an alkaline solution.
8. For a strong acid-weak base titration, the pH of the solution at equivalence point is < 7 because the cation of the salt formed (conjugate acid) hydrolyses to give an acidic solution.
9. For a weak acid-weak base titration, the pH of the solution at equivalence point depends on the _K\({}_{\text{a}}\)_ and _K\({}_{\text{b}}\)_ of the conjugate acid and conjugate base formed.
10. If a titration has more than one equivalence point, then each equivalence point can be determined by a different indicator as long as a sharp change in pH occurs at that equivalence point.

### The Levelling Effect of Water

Let us consider the scenarios where we introduce a strong acid (such as 0.20 mol dm\({}^{-3}\)HCl) or strong base (such as 0.20 mol dm\({}^{-3}\) NaOH) to water, the changes in pH of the solution tends to follow the curve in **Fig. 10.1**.

As we can see from the figure, the changes to pH tends to "level off" at a certain value after a large enough quantity of acid or base is added. In the case where an _infinite_ volume of 0.20 mol dm\({}^{-3}\) of HCl_i_ is introduced to 50 cm\({}^{3}\) of water, the effective concentration of H\({}_{3}\)O\({}^{+}\) approaches 0.20 mol dm\({}^{-3}\), and the measured pH of the solution tends to be -lg (0.20) = **0.699**. Similarly, if another hydraulic acid, such as HBr, is used, the measured pH will have the same values. This is **counter-intuitive**, especially if we were to taken into consideration that the \(K_{\text{s}}\) values of HCl_i_ and HBr are \(1.3\times 10^{6}\) and \(1.0\times 10^{9}\) respectively. It suggests that the pH value is independent of the identity of the (strong) acid added.

This observed phenomenon is due to the **levelling effect**, which suggests that:

* An acid stronger than the conjugate acid of the solvent cannot exist in any appreciable concentration in that solvent, and
* A base stronger than the conjugate base of the solvent cannot exist in any appreciable concentration in that solvent,

which arises due to the acid/ base dissociating completely in the solvent.

Figure 10.1: (a) When 0.20 mol dm\({}^{-3}\)HCl_i_ is added to 50.0 cm\({}^{3}\) of distilled water, the pH rapidly decreases until it reaches a minimum at the pH of 0.20 mol dm\({}^{-3}\)HCl_i_ (b) Conversely, when 0.20 mol dm\({}^{-3}\) NaOH is added to 50.0 cm\({}^{3}\) of distilled water, the pH rapidly increases until it reaches a maximum at the pH of 0.20 mol dm\({}^{-3}\) NaOH

For _weak acid_, at initial concentration between 1 \(\times\) 10\({}^{-4}\) mol dm\({}^{-3}\) and 1 \(\times\) 10\({}^{-6}\) mol dm\({}^{-3}\),

* For CH\({}_{3}\)CO\({}_{2}\)H, \(\sqrt{K_{\mathrm{s}}\times[\)CH\({}_{3}\)CO\({}_{2}\)H\(]}>\left[\mathrm{H}^{+}\right]\) as the approximation that \([\)CH\({}_{3}\)CO\({}_{2}\)H\(]_{\mathrm{e}am}\approx[\)CH\({}_{3}\)CO\({}_{2}\)H\(]_{\mathrm{initial}}\) (see SS5.2) breaks down, because the degree of dissociation, \(\alpha\), increases with dilution. So \([\)CH\({}_{3}\)CO\({}_{2}\)H\(]_{\mathrm{e}am}\approx[\)CH\({}_{3}\)CO\({}_{2}\)H\(]_{\mathrm{initial}}-[\)H\(]\) instead.
* For the even weaker acid, C\({}_{6}\)H\({}_{3}\)OH, \(\sqrt{K_{\mathrm{s}}\times[\)C\({}_{6}\)H\({}_{3}\)OH\(]}<\left[\mathrm{H}^{+}\right]\) as \([\)H\(]\) from the acid is too low to suppress the auto-ionisation of water and H\({}^{+}\) from water contributes significantly to the total \([\)H\(]\) at concentration of 1 \(\times\) 10\({}^{-4}\) mol dm\({}^{-3}\) and lower.

For simplicity, H\({}^{+}\)(aq) from auto-ionisation of the water solvent is taken into considerations if the **initial concentration of the acid is _lower_ than 1 \(\times\) 10\({}^{-7}\) mol dm\({}^{-3}\).

So, for _dilute solutions_ (\(<\) 1 \(\times\) 10\({}^{-7}\) mol dm\({}^{-3}\)) of

* strong acids, H\({}^{+}\) from the water solvent is taken into considerations by simply **adding 1 \(\times\) 10\({}^{-7}\) mol dm\({}^{-3}\)** to the \([\)H\(]\) from the strong acid itself.
* weak acids, we assume that the weak acid is **fully ionised**, behaving just like a strong acid, and can be treated in the same way by **adding 1 \(\times\) 10\({}^{-7}\) mol dm\({}^{-3}\)** to the \([\)H\(]\) from the weak acid itself.

For example, to calculate the pH of 10\({}^{-8}\) mol dm\({}^{-3}\) nitric acid.

\[\begin{array}{l}\mathrm{HNO_{3}(aq)}+\mathrm{H_{2}O(\mathit{l})}\to\mathrm{H_{3 }O^{+}(aq)}+\mathrm{NO_{3}(aq)}\\ \mathrm{H_{2}O(\mathit{l})}+\mathrm{H_{2}O(\mathit{l})}\rightleftharpoons \mathrm{H_{3}O^{+}(aq)}+\mathrm{OH^{-}(aq)}\\ \\ \left[\mathrm{H_{3}O^{+}}\right]_{\mathrm{total}}=\left[\mathrm{H_{3}O^{+}} \right]_{\mathrm{HNO_{3}}}+\left[\mathrm{H_{3}O^{+}}\right]_{\mathrm{H_{3}O}}\\ \\ =10^{-8}+10^{-7}\ \ (\mathrm{assume\ at\ 298\ K})\\ =1.1\times 10^{-7}\ \ \mathrm{mol\ dm^{-3}}\\ \\ \mathrm{pH}=-\mathrm{lg}(1.1\times 10^{-7})=\mathbf{6.96}\\ \end{array}\]

Due to the **low concentration** (_i.e._\(\leq\)10\({}^{-7}\) mol dm\({}^{-3}\)) of HNO\({}_{3}\), contribution of **H\({}_{3}\)O\({}^{+}\)** from the **auto-ionisation of water** is **significant** and should not be ignored.
