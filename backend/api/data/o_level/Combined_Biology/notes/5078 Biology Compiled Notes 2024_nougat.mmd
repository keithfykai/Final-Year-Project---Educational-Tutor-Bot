## Chapter 5 - PLANT NUTRITION

(b) State the word equation for photosynthesis.

* The site of photosynthesis is the leaf (specifically, the palisade and spongy mesophyll cells).

(d) State that chlorophyll traps light energy and converts it into chemical energy for the formation of carbohydrates and their subsequent uses and storage of starch

* What is the fate of the products of photosynthesis?
* Some glucose is converted into sucrose to be transported from the leaf to other parts via the phloem by translocation.
* Excess glucose is converted into starch and stored in the leaf or in storage organs.
* Oxygen gas and glucose produced from photosynthesis is used to carry out respiration to release energy for growth and repair.

(f) Briefly explain why most life forms are completely dependent on photosynthesis.

Photosynthesis is important for the survival of all living organisms because...

1. Green plants are producers which can carry out photosynthesis because they contain chloroplasts to trap light energy. Through photosynthesis, they convert light energy into chemical energy stored in glucose. Other organisms do not have chloroplasts and have to obtain chemical energy from plants indirectly or directly by consuming them.

2. Photosynthesis removes carbon dioxide from the air and releases oxygen that is needed for respiration carried out by all organisms for energy.

(a) Identify the cellular and tissue structure of a dicot leaf, as seen in cross-section under the microscope and state their functions:

* photosynthesis** \(\circ\) The highest concentration of chloroplasts, and hence the highest rate of photosynthesis occurs the palisade mesophyll cells, then spongy mesophyll cells, followed by guard cells. * Because the palisade mesophyll cells receive the most light, so they have the most number of chloroplasts to trap light for photosynthesis.
* gas exchange** \(\circ\) During photosynthesis, oxygen produced diffuses down a concentration gradient from the mesophyll cells, into air spaces, then out of leaf through stomata. Carbon dioxide diffuses down a concentration gradient from the surrounding air into the stomata, then into air spaces, then into mesophyll cells. * During respiration, the reverse occurs.

* transport** \(\circ\) Xylem vessels transport water and minerals from roots to the leaves (mesophyll cells) for use in photosynthesis, by transpiration pull. \(\circ\) Phloem transports sugars (sucrose) manufactured in the leaves (mesophyll cells) to all parts of the plant for respiration or storage, by translocation.

How does this help to destarch the plant?

In the dark...

Photosynthesis stops \(\rightarrow\) no new starch is produced.

Plants use up starch reserves to carry out respiration to release energy.

Why need to destarch the plant before experiment?

**Rationale:**

remove all the existing starch present in the leaves before using it for an experiment

so that any starch found present is produced due to the leaf photosynthesis during the experiment

(Pathway of water)

Movement of WATER in Plants (Steps 1 to 8)

(6) Water moves from cell to cell in the leaf by osmosis until it reaches palisade/ spongy mesophyll cells for photosynthesis.

(7) Water in spongy mesophyll

lesaves, by transpiration

water vapour diffuses in the air spaces.

from air spaces out through stomata into the air, down a conc gradient.

This is transpiration ->

loss of water vapour from stomata.

(3) Water then moves from root cell into xylem by osmosis,

down a water potential gradient.

Example: Water potential of S > T.

So water moves from root cells into xylem.

(1) Root hair cells absorb water by osmosis (and minerals by diffusion).

Example: Water potential of P > Q > R > S.

- Adaptations of RHC

- WP gradient for osmosis

Water moves by osmosis from P to Q to R to S from a region of higher to lower water potential in a direction towards xylem.

**Germination of Pollen Tube \(\supset\) leading to Fertilisation**

After pollination, pollen grains have landed on the mature stigma.

1. **Sugary fluid secreted by mature stigma causes pollen grain to germinate (grow).**
2. **A pollen tube grows out from each pollen grain. Male gametes from pollen grain enters pollen tube.**
3. **Pollen tube grows down the style and ovary towards the ovule. To do so, pollen tube secretes enzymes to digest surrounding tissue of style and ovary.**
4. **Pollen tube enters ovule through the micropyle.** (_Micropyle = an opening in the ovule wall_).**

## Chapter 11 - molecular genetics

(b) State the structure of DNA in terms of the bases, sugar and phosphate groups found in each of the nucleotides.

* DNA consists of 2 strands of polynucleotides which are antiparallel, and coiled together in a double helix structure.
* Each polynucleotide strand of DNA is made up of smaller basic units called nucleotides joined together, sharing a sugar-phosphate backbone.
* A deoxyribose pentose sugar molecule, a phosphate group and A nitrogeneous base.
* Adenine (A), Thymine (T), Guanine (G) and Cytosine (C). The type of base determines the type of nucleotide it is.
* A always binds to T and G always binds to C, according to the rule of complementary base-pairing.

(c) State the rule of complementary base pairing.

 Adenine always only binds to Thymine and Guanine always only binds to Cytosine, with the formation of hydrogen bonds.

(d) State that DNA is used to carry the genetic code (no need translation, transcription), which is used to synthesise specific polypeptides

(e) State that each gene is:

(i) a sequence of nucleotides, as part of a DNA molecules (structure)

(ii) controls the production of one polypeptide (function)

A chromosome is DNA in a form that is wrapped around proteins, coiled, and condensed.

A gene is only a segment of the entire DNA molecule.

While the chromosome and DNA contains genetic information for the whole organism,

coding for different polypeptides,

each gene only codes for 1 specific polypeptide for 1 specific function, according to the specific sequence of nucleotides of the gene

EXAMPLE QUESTION (Family Tree questions)

The diagram on the right shows the inheritance of hair colour in the Smith family.

_How to approach Family Tree questions:_

Is the trait sex-linked?

(_ie. Would a male have higher chance of getting disease?_)

Figure out what is the dominant and recessive phenotypes.

Label genotype for all recessive phenotypes first.

Annotate the possible genotypes for the rest, starting from the ones nearest the labelled recessive phenotypes, see if you can decide the genotype for the others.

(e) State why observed ratios often differ from expected ratios, especially when there are small numbers of progeny.

The observed ratio of traits (and sex) inherited is often different from the expected ratio from our genetic crosses and calculations because of **2 main reasons**:

1. The **sample size is too small** so the ratio is statistically inaccurate.
2. The combination of sex chromosomes during **fertilisation is random**. [sex-determination] OR The combination of alleles during fertilisation is random. [inheritance of traits]

## Chapter 13 Organisms & Environment

(a) Briefly describe the non-cyclical nature of energy flow

* At each trophic level, most of the energy is lost to the environment in the form of heat energy from respiration, or chemical energy, trapped in uneaten tissues or eagested/excreted wastes.
* The lost energy is not returned to the organisms in the ecosystem.
* Hence, more light energy has to be constantly supplied to the producers in ecosystem.
* Hence, the energy flow in ecosystems is linear and not cyclical.

(b) Establish the relationship of the following in food webs: producer, consumer, herbivore, carnivore, decomposer, food chain, trophic level

**(e)**: Describe how carbon is cycled within an ecosystem and Explain the importance of the carbon cycle and outline the role of forests and oceans as carbon sinks.

**Importance of Carbon Cycle: 3 Reasons**

1. _About Photosynthesis:_

* Ensures that there is continuous supply of carbon dioxide for plants to continue to carry out photosynthesis as producers in food chains.
2. _About Energy flow in food chains:_

* Enables energy to flow through food chains in ecosystems through processes like feeding and decomposition.
* Organisms which do not photosynthesis rely on plants to convert light energy to chemical energy, which are then passed down to these organisms when they feed on plants.
3. _About Carbon dioxide in atmosphere:_

* Maintains correct concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere

How Carbon is Cycled in an Ecosystem:

* Carbon is an organic molecule that is present and continuously recycled in our environment in the carbon cycle
* in various forms such as carbohydrates (starch, sugars), fossil fuels, and carbon dioxide gas.
* Carbon is continuously removed from our environment through photosynthesis,
* and released into our environment through processes like aerobic respiration, combustion, decomposition.
* Carbon compounds trapped in the tissues of organisms is also transferred from one organism to the next in the food chain through the process of feeding.

Role of Forests & Oceans as Carbon Sinks:

**Carbon Sinks:**

* An area that stores carbon compounds for an indefinite (very long) period.
* Since it stores more carbon dioxide than it releases,

it can help remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and act as a carbon reservoir to store it

 reduces global warming as carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas

\begin{tabular}{|p{113.8pt}|p{113.8pt}|p{113.8pt}|} \hline Carbon & **Oceans** & **Forests** \\
**Sinks** & & \\ \hline Why it is a good carbon sink & * Largest carbon sink in the world absorb CO2 from the atmosphere & Plants in forests absorb CO2 from atmosphere for photosynthesis \\ sink & * Absorb CO2 from the atmosphere & * Large amount of carbon compounds formed from photosynthesis is stored in the trees for a very long time and can become fossil fuels after death \\ \hline \end{tabular}

* Evaluate and explain the effects of:
* Water pollution by sewage
* 1. Untreated sewage discharged into water bodies/Excess fertilisers may be washed away into nearby water bodies like rivers. 2. Untreated sewage/ Fertiliser run-off contains
* 3. These cause rapid/increased growth of water plants and algae in the water *resulting in eutrophication. 4. Excessive growth of water plants and algae cause overcrowding and blocks sunlight from reaching submerged plants in the water. 5. Submerged plants receive insufficient light for photosynthesis and die. 6. Used plants and algae are then decomposed by aerobic bacteria in the water, which uses up oxygen. 7. As **decomposer bacteria and fungi grow and multiply, they use up more oxygen. 8. There is insufficient oxygen for aerobic respiration for water organisms like fish, and die.**
* Pollution due to insecticides including bioaccumulation up food chains, and impact on top carnivores
* 1. Inorganic substances are non-biodegradable and remain in the soil or water for a long time. 2. They are consumed by primary consumers like plankton, and are stored in their tissues
* 3. With time, as primary consumers consume more of such inorganic substances, the **concentrations stored in their tissues increase.
* Bioaccumulation occurs. 4. The inorganic substances are then passed along the food chain to the secondary consumers and the subsequent consumers, with increasing concentrations passed along with each trophic level. 5. The last consumer in the food chain would contain the highest concentrations of the inorganic substances, and hence, may face harmful effects (or more harmful effects as compared to organisms in the lower trophic levels.).
