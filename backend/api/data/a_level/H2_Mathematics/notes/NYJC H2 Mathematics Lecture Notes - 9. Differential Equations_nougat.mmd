### Terminologies

Consider the equations \(y=2x+1,\ y=2x-3\), and \(y=2x\). If we compare their graphs, we will see that they are straight lines with the same gradient. They all exhibit the property \(\frac{\mathrm{d}y}{\mathrm{d}x}=2\).

In mathematics and in real life, we may be given the differential equation first, in this case \(\frac{\mathrm{d}y}{\mathrm{d}x}=2\), and we want to find the functions that satisfy this 'property'.

The idea is to find a function of the form \(y=\mathrm{f}(x)\) whose rate of change with respect to \(x\) is \(2\). By inspection, we can see that \(y=2x\) is a solution. However, there are also other possible solutions such as \(y=2x+1,y=2x-3\). So in general, we can deduce that any function of the form \(y=2x+C\), where \(C\) is any real constant, is a solution of the differential equation \(\frac{\mathrm{d}y}{\mathrm{d}x}=2\).

We can obtain the solution by direct integration as \(y=\big{\lceil}\,2\ \mathrm{d}x\ =2x+C\) where \(C\) is a constant.

**Note:**

1. \(y=2x+C\) is called the **general solution** of the differential equation \(\frac{\mathrm{d}y}{\mathrm{d}x}=2\).
2. \(C\) is called an **arbitrary constant**, meaning it can be _any_ real number. If the solution does not contain any arbitrary constant (e.g. \(y=2x\), \(y=2x+1\), \(y=2x-3\)), then it is called the **particular solution** of the differential equation.
3. The general solution of a _first order_ DE contains _one_ arbitrary constant.

### Solving First Order Differential Equations

We will focus on solving first order differential equations of the following forms.

1. \(\frac{\mathrm{d}y}{\mathrm{d}x}=\mathrm{f}\left(x\right)\) (i.e. RHS is an expression involving \(x\) only)
2. \(\frac{\mathrm{d}y}{\mathrm{d}x}=\mathrm{g}\left(y\right)\) (i.e. RHS is an expression involving \(y\) only)

Both forms are known as **separable DEs**. We will solve DE of form (a) via _direct integration_ and DE of form (b) via _separation of variables_.

1. \(\frac{\mathrm{d}y}{\mathrm{d}x}=\mathrm{f}\left(x\right)\) (via "direct integration")
2. \(\frac{\mathrm{d}y}{\mathrm{d}x}=\mathrm{g}\left(y\right)\) (via "separation of variables")

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:3]

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:4]

**Note:**

1) To find the _particular solution_ of the DE, we will need to find the general solution of the DE first and then use the given initial conditions to determine the specific value of the arbitrary constant.

2) A different set of initial conditions will give different particular solution.

**Example 13.5**:

A curve \(C\) with cartesian equation \( y=\mathrm{f}\left(x\right)\) obeys the differential equation \(\frac{\mathrm{d}y}{\mathrm{d}x}=x\mathrm{e}^{2x}\).

**(i)**: What can you say about the gradient of the curve \(C\) as \( x\to\pm\infty\)?

[You may assume that \( x\mathrm{e}^{2x}\to 0\) as \( x\to-\infty\) ]
**(ii)**: Write down the \(x\)-coordinate of the stationary point on \(C\) and determine the nature of this stationary point without referring to the graph of \(C\).
**(iii)**: Given that \(C\) passes through the origin, find the cartesian equation of \(C\).
**(iv)**: Sketch the graph of \(C\).

**Solution:**

**(f)**: \(\frac{\mathrm{d}y}{\mathrm{d}x}=x\mathrm{e}^{2x}\to\infty\) as \( x\to\infty\)

so the gradient of the curve approaches infinity as \( x\to\infty\).

\(\frac{\mathrm{d}y}{\mathrm{d}x}=x\mathrm{e}^{2x}\to 0\) as \( x\to-\infty\)

so the gradient of the curve approaches zero as \( x\to-\infty\).
**(ii)**: \(\frac{\mathrm{d}y}{\mathrm{d}x}=0\Rightarrow x\mathrm{e}^{2x}=0\Rightarrow x=0\) (as \(\mathrm{e}^{2x}>0\) for all \(x\in\mathbb{R}\) )

So \(C\) has a stationary point at \(x=0\).

\[\frac{\mathrm{d}y}{\mathrm{d}x}=x\mathrm{e}^{2x}\begin{cases}<0\ \ \mathrm{if}\ x<0\\ >0\ \ \mathrm{if}\ x>0\end{cases}\]

\[\begin{array}{|c|c|c|}\hline x&0^{-}&0&0^{+}\\ \hline\mathrm{Sign\ of}\ \mathrm{d}y/\mathrm{d}x&-&0&+\\ \hline\mathrm{Shape\ of\ tangent}&\framebox{$\phantom{\frac{\mathrm{d}y}{\mathrm{d}x} }$}&\framebox{$\phantom{\frac{\mathrm{d}y}{\mathrm{d}x}}$}\\ \hline\end{array}\]

Thus the stationary point is a minimum point by the first derivative test.

**(iii)**: Integrating directly,

#### 13.3.2 Reduction to a Separable DE by Substitution

Very often we encounter DEs that are not separable (i.e. not of the form \(\frac{\mathrm{d}y}{\mathrm{d}x}\!=\!\mathrm{f}\left(x\right)\) or \(\frac{\mathrm{d}y}{\mathrm{d}x}\!=\!\mathrm{g}\left(y\right)\)). In this case, we have to reduce the DE to a separable one via a suitable substitution first before solving.

In general, we may follow this set of procedures:

**Step 1:** Differentiate the given substitution.

**Step 2:** Apply the substitution and simplify into a separable DE

**Step 3:** Solve the separable DE, which is now in the new variables

**Step 4:** Change back to original variables

**Example 13.7**

The variables \(x\) and \(y\) are related by the differential equation \(3xy^{2}\frac{\mathrm{d}y}{\mathrm{d}x}\!+\!y^{3}-2x\!=\!0\). Show that by using the substitution \(u\!=\!xy^{3}\), the differential equation may be reduced to \(\frac{\mathrm{d}u}{\mathrm{d}x}\!=\!2x\). Hence find the general solution of the differential equation \(3xy^{2}\frac{\mathrm{d}y}{\mathrm{d}x}\!+\!y^{3}-2x\!=\!0\).

**Solution:**

Step 1: Differentiate the given substitution with respect to the independent variable (i.e. \(x\)) of the original DE.

Step 2: Apply the substitution \(u\!=\!xy^{3}\) and \(\frac{\mathrm{d}u}{\mathrm{d}x}\!=\!y^{3}+3xy^{2}\frac{\mathrm{d}y}{\mathrm{d }x}\!\) into the original DE. The new dependent variable becomes \(u\).

Step 3: DE is now in the separable form of \(\frac{\mathrm{d}u}{\mathrm{d}x}\!=\!\mathrm{g}\left(x\right)\). Solve for \(u\).

Step 4: Change the DE back to its original variables by using replacing \(u\) with \(xy^{3}\).

**Note:**

It is not necessary to express \(y\) explicitly in terms of \(x\) when finding the solution of the DE unless required by the question.

**Example 13.8**: By using the substitution \(y=ux^{2}\), find the general solution of the differential equation \(x^{2}\frac{\frac{\mathrm{d}y}{\mathrm{d}x}}{\mathrm{d}x}-2xy=y^{2}\), giving your answer in the form \(y=\mathrm{f}(x)\).

**Solution:**

Step 1: Apply implicit differentiation and product rule.

Step 2: Substitute and simplify.

We obtain a separable DE of the form

\(\frac{\mathrm{d}u}{\mathrm{d}x}=\mathrm{g}\left(u\right)\).

The new dependent variable is \(u\).

Step 3: Separate the variables and solve.

\(\int\frac{1}{u^{2}}\mathrm{d}u=\int u^{-2}\mathrm{d}u=\frac{u^{-4}}{-1}+C\)

Step 4: Replace \(u\) with the original variable

\(y\) using \(y=ux^{2}\) (i.e \(u=\frac{y}{x^{2}}\))

**Example 13.9** (MC N91/II/14b modified): Show that the differential equation \(x^{2}\frac{\mathrm{d}y}{\mathrm{d}x}-2xy+3=0\) may be reduced by means of the substitution \(y=ux^{2}\) to \(\frac{\mathrm{d}u}{\mathrm{d}x}=-\frac{3}{x^{4}}\).

Hence, or otherwise, show that the general solution for \(y\) in terms of \(x\) is \(y=Cx^{2}+\frac{1}{x}\), where \(C\) is an arbitrary constant. Sketch, for \(x>0\), a solution curve corresponding to \(C>0\).

**Solution:**

\(y=ux^{2}\Rightarrow\frac{\mathrm{d}y}{\mathrm{d}x}=2ux+x^{2}\frac{\mathrm{d}u }{\mathrm{d}x}\Rightarrow x^{2}\frac{\mathrm{d}y}{\mathrm{d}x}=2ux^{3}+x^{4} \frac{\mathrm{d}u}{\mathrm{d}x}\)

Substituting into DE gives

\(2ux^{3}+x^{4}\frac{\mathrm{d}u}{\mathrm{d}x}-2x\left(ux^{2}\right)+3=0\)

\(\Rightarrow\frac{\mathrm{d}u}{\mathrm{d}x}=-\frac{3}{x^{4}}\)

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:10]

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:11]

For mathematics at H2 level, you should obtain one differential equation which takes the form of either \(\frac{\mathrm{d}y}{\mathrm{d}x}=\mathrm{f}(x)\), \(\frac{\mathrm{d}y}{\mathrm{d}x}=\mathrm{g}(y)\) or \(\frac{\mathrm{d}^{2}y}{\mathrm{d}x^{2}}=\mathrm{h}(x)\).

A modelling problem involves the following stages:

(i) identifying the dependent and independent variables

(ii) inferring the initial conditions

(iii) solving the resulting DE, usually separable

(iv) interpreting the solution of the DE and making prediction about the behaviour of the system in the long run

**Tips:**

(1) When formulating the differential equation, remember that the

Rate of change of variable = Rate of increase - Rate of decrease

(2) When solving the differential equation, do pay attention to some key words in the question such as "_initially_", "_at the beginning_" or "_originally_" which implies \(t=0\).

**Example: 13.12**

Formulate differential equations describing the scenarios below.

(a) The rate of growth of the population of a certain organism is proportional to the population of the organism.

(b) Newton's law of cooling states that the rate of decrease in the temperature of a hot body is proportional to the difference in temperature between the body and the surrounding.

(c) Water is poured into a filtration device at a constant rate of \(a\) litres per minute. The device discharges water at a rate proportional to the volume of water in the device.

**Solution:**

(a) Let \(\rho\) (dependent variable) denotes the population of the organism at any time \(t\) (independent variable).

(a) rate of increase \(\kappa\)p

(b) rate of decrease :0

(c) Therefore \(\frac{\mathrm{d}t}{\mathrm{d}x}=\kappa\)p-0

(a) Note: \(k\) is called the constant of proportionality.

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:13]

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:14]

**Example 13.15** (2016 Prelim RVHS/I/8 - Logistics model): In a certain fish farm, the growth of the population of garoupa is studied. The population of garoupa at time \(t\) days is denoted by \(x\) (in thousands). It was found that the rate of birth per day is twice of \(x\), and the rate of death per day is proportional to \(x^{2}\).

1. Given that there is no change in the population of garoupa when its population hits 10000, write down a differential equation relating \(\dfrac{\mathrm{d}x}{\mathrm{d}t}\) and \(x\).
2. Its owner decides to sell away 1800 garoupa daily. Modify the differential equation in part (i) and show that the resulting differential equation can be written as \(\dfrac{\mathrm{d}x}{\mathrm{d}t}=-\dfrac{1}{5}\Big{[}(x-5)^{2}-a^{2}\Big{]}\), where \(a\) is a constant to be determined. Given that the initial population of garoupa is 13000, solve this modified differential equation, expressing \(x\) in terms of \(t\). Deduce the long term implication on the population of garoupa in the farm, and sketch the curve of \(x\) against \(t\).

Chapter 13 Learning Experience (I) Application of Differential Equation: Radiocarbon \(C^{14}\) Dating

In Example 13.13, the time taken for 100 g of the radioactive mass to decrease to 50 g is 263 hrs. In fact, the time taken for the radioactive mass to decrease from 50 g to 25 g is also 263 hrs. It is known as the **half-life** of the radioactive substance, which is characteristic to that radioactive substance.

One of the radioactive substances that is present in all living matters is isotope carbon-14 (C-14). After the death of the living matter, the amount of C-14 in the dead material decreases at a rate proportional to the amount present. (Similar to Example 13.13). If we know how much C-14 is left in the dead material, we can estimate the length of time the matter has been dead. The half-life of the C-14 is approximately 5600 years.

**Task:** A cypress beam found in the tomb of Sneferu in Egypt contained 55% of the radioactive carbon-14 that is found in living cypress word. Using the working in Example 13.13, show that the tomb is at least 4830 years old.

Let \(r\) be the amount of radioactive carbon-14 in a cypress beam found in the tomb of Sneferu at time \(t\).

Environmental conditions such as acidity, temperature, oxygen levels and toxins influence the rate of growth of microorganisms. A biologist investigates the change of population of a particular type of microorganism of size \(n\) thousand at time \(t\) days under different conditions. In both models I and II, the initial population of the microorganism is 3000 and the population reaches 2000 after 1 day.

**(i)**: Under model I, the biologist observes that the rate of growth of microorganism is a constant whereas the death rate is proportional to its population. He also observes that when the population of the microorganism is 1000, it remains at this constant value. By setting up and solving a differential equation, show that \(n=1+2^{1-t}\). [8]
**(ii)**: Under model II, the biologist observes that \(n\) and \(t\) are related by the differential equation \(\dfrac{\mathrm{d}^{2}n}{\mathrm{d}t^{2}}=4-6t\). Find the particular solution of this differential equation. [3]

**(iii)** By sketching the graphs of \(n\) against \(t\) for both model I and II, state and explain which of the two models is more harmful for the growth of this type of microorganism. [2]
* 9 2016 **Prelim TJC/1/11** On the remote island of Squiro, ecologists introduced a non-native species of insects that can feed on weeds that are killing crops. Based on past studies, ecologists have observed that the birth rate of the insects is proportional to the number of insects, and the death rate is proportional to the square of the number of insects. Let \(x\) be the number of insects (in hundreds) on the island at time \(t\) months after the insects were first introduced. Initially, 10 insects were released on the island.

A researcher decides to fit a mathematical model for the path of the fast-moving charged particle under the influence of the magnetic field. The particle was observed for the first 1.5 seconds.

\(A=6x^{2}+8x\left(\frac{100}{x^{2}}\right)\left(k+1\right)=6x^{2}+\frac{800\left(k+1 \right)}{x}\)

When \(A\) is stationary, \(\frac{\mathrm{d}A}{\mathrm{d}x}=0\). Thus

It is mandatory to do a first or second derivative test to ensure that \(A\) is minimum even if only one value of \(x\) is obtained for \(\frac{\mathrm{d}A}{\mathrm{d}x}=0\).

\(A\) is a minimum when \(x=\left[\frac{200\left(k+1\right)}{3}\right]^{\frac{1}{3}}\).

(ii) find the ratio \(\frac{y}{x}\) in terms of \(A\)

\(y=\frac{100}{x^{2}}\)\(\Rightarrow\)\(\frac{y}{x}=\frac{100}{x^{3}}=100+\frac{200\left(k+1\right)}{3}=\frac{3}{2\left(k+1 \right)}\)

(iii) find the values between which \(\frac{y}{x}\)\(\left[\frac{3}{2\left(k+1\right)}\right]\) must lie

\(0<k\leq 1\)\(\Rightarrow\)\(1<k+1\leq 2\)\(\Rightarrow\)\(2<2\left(k+1\right)\leq 4\)

\(\Rightarrow\)\(\frac{1}{2}>\frac{1}{2\left(k+1\right)}\geq\frac{1}{4}\)\(\Rightarrow\)\(\frac{3}{2}>\frac{3}{2\left(k+1\right)}\geq\frac{3}{4}\)

Hence \(\frac{3}{2}>\frac{y}{x}\geq\frac{3}{4}\).

(iv) find the value of \(A\) when the box has square ends.

If the box has square ends, then

\(x=0\) (reject), \(\frac{R}{\sqrt{2}},-\frac{R}{\sqrt{2}}\) (reject)

Therefore \(x=\frac{R}{\sqrt{2}}\)

Observe that \(R+\sqrt{2}x>0\) since \(R>0\) and \(x>0\).

When \(x=\left(\frac{R}{\sqrt{2}}\right)^{-}\), \(x<\frac{R}{\sqrt{2}}\)\(\Rightarrow\)\(R-\sqrt{2}x>0\), so

When \(x=\left(\frac{R}{\sqrt{2}}\right)^{+}\), \(x>\frac{R}{\sqrt{2}}\)\(\Rightarrow\)\(R-\sqrt{2}x<0\), so

\(\frac{\mathrm{d}A}{\mathrm{d}x}=\)

Hence, when \(x=\frac{R}{\sqrt{2}}\), \(A\) is maximum.

\(x=\frac{R}{\sqrt{2}}\Rightarrow 2x^{2}=R^{2}\).

\(\therefore\)\(h=\sqrt{4R^{2}-4x^{2}}=\sqrt{4(2x^{2})-4x^{2}}\)

\(=\sqrt{4x^{2}}=2x=\) diameter of cylinder

Hence, the maximum value of \(A\) is obtained when the height \(h\) of the cylinder is equal to its diameter \(2x\).
