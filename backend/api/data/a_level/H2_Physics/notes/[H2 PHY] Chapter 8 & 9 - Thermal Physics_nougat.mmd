Thermodynamics* [leftmargin=*]
* is a base quantity that measures average kinetic energy of the molecules of a substance.
* higher temperature indicates that a substance has molecules with higher KE.

* is energy transferred between two objects due to the temperature difference between them.
* This occurs as molecules undergo **collisions** with one another.
* Kinetic energy is **transferred** from faster-moving molecules (in the **high-temperature** object) to slower-moving molecules (in the **low-temperature** object).
* Heat tends to equalize the temperatures between the two bodies in contact.

**Thermal Equilibrium**

Two objects are said in thermal equilibrium:

1. when there is **no net flow of heat** between two objects in thermal contact.
2. if and only if they are at the same **temperature.*** [leftmargin=*]
* Temperature scales (thermometers) measure temperature of a substance which rely on measuring physical property (known as **thermometric property**) of a substance that varies with temperature.

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|} \hline
**Therometer** & **Therometric Property** \\ \hline Liquid-in-gas & Volume of a fixed mass of liquid \\ \hline Platinum resistance & Resistance of a metal \\ \hline Constant volume gas & Pressure of a fixed mass of a gas at constant volume \\ \hline Thermocouple & e.m.f produced between junctions of dissimilar metals \\  & that are at different temperature \\ \hline \end{tabular}

* Three Criteria for a Thermometric Property

A suitable thermometric property should:

* **vary uniquely** with temperature (different values for different temperatures).
* **change appreciably** with temperature.
* **be reproducible** and can be accurately measured over a wide range of temperature.

## Chapter 1 Temperature Scale

Kelvin Temperature Scale

* The thermodynamic temperature scale (an **absolute scale** of temperature).
* does not depend on the thermometric property of any particular Kelvin
* is defined as \(\frac{1}{273.16}\) of the thermodynamic temperature of the triple point of water.

* Unit: degree Celsius (\({}^{\circ}\)C) commonly used in everyday life, science, and industry

* Unit: degree Fahrenheit (\({}^{\circ}F\)) commonly used in the United States.

* \(T_{c}=\frac{5}{9}[T_{F}-\ 32]\)

* \(T_{F}=\frac{9}{5}T_{C}+\ 32\)
[FIGURE

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:9]

* is defined as a gas that is governed by the equation \(pV=nRT\) where \(p\) is the pressure, \(V\) is the volume, and \(T\) is thermodynamic temperature of the gas.

Specific Capacity and Specific Latent Heat

First Capacity

Synthesis C

S1 unit: Joule per Kelvin [J/K]

Scalar

The **numerical value** of the heat capacity of a body is the quantity of **heat**

required to **raise the temperature** of the body by **one degree**

\[C=\frac{Q}{\Delta T}\]

\[Q=\] quantity of heat

\[\Delta T=T_{f}-T_{i}=\text{change in temperature}\]

\[\star\Delta T\]

in Celsius degree is the same as the \[\Delta T\] in Kelvin. So, there is no need to convert to Kelvin if temperatures are given in the Celsius scale

Specific Heat Capacity

S1 unit: Joule per kilogram per Kelvin [J/(kg K)]

Scalar

The **numerical value** of the heat capacity of a substance is the quantity if the heat required to raise the temperature of unit mass of the substance by one degree.

\[Q=\] quantity of heat

\[m=\text{mass of the body}\]

\[\Delta T=\text{change in temperature}\]

& [3]The internal energy U of an ideal gas is purely kinetic

& [4]Notes
* [5]Molecules have _kinetic energy_ because they are in _constant motion_.
* [6]Molecules have _potential energy_ due to the interactions between them.
* [7]Rise in temperature increases the ave. KE of the molecules which in turn increases the internal energy of the system.
* [8]U is **state-dependent** and **path independent** (i.e the order of expansion/contraction of a gas does not change U.)

## Appendix A Special Processes

The following processes are special cases for a fixed amount of gas in a cylinder with a free moving piston.

### **Temperature \(T\) is constant.**

* If the change in pressure and volume takes place without change in temperature.

## Appendix A Appendix

### Appendix B Appendix

The **work** done can be calculated as the **area** within the enclosed loop of a cyclic process.

* Negative work is done by the gas if it compresses at higher pressure (right figure). Path is counterclockwise -ADCB.

Consider a \(p-V\) diagram below wherein the process takes place in two steps. The system is an ideal gas in which heat can flow in or out. The pressure decreases from 223 kPa to 142 kPa at constant volume (**a\(\rightarrow\)_b_**), then this is followed by increase in volume from 5900 cm\({}^{3}\) to 9200 cm\({}^{3}\) at constant pressure (**_b\(\rightarrow\)c_**).

Determine the total work done by the gas in the process.

Find the \(\Delta U\) of the gas in the process.

Solve the total heat transferred into or out of the gas.

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:30]

We use equation (2) of the ideal gas law: \(pV=NkT\to N=\frac{pV}{kT}\)

At STP: \(T=0^{\circ}C=273.15K\), \(p=101.3\ kPa\)

The volume of a sphere is

\[V=\frac{4}{3}\pi r^{3}=\frac{4}{3}(3.14)(0.24)^{3}=57.9\times 10^{-3}m^{3}\]

\[N=\frac{\left(101.3\times 10^{3}\right)\left(57.9\times 10^{-3}\right)}{\left(1.3 8\times 10^{-10}\right)\left(273.15\right)}=1.56\times 10^{24}\text{ molecules}\]

**Practice Example 4**

The tire is sealed, so the initial and final volume and number of moles in the tire is constant.

\[V_{1}=V_{2}\rightarrow\frac{n_{1}RT_{1}}{p_{1}}=\frac{n_{2}RT_{2}}{p_{2}}\]

The R and \(n_{1}=n_{2}\) cancels out:

\[p_{2}=p_{1}\frac{T_{2}}{T_{1}}\]

We convert the temperatures:

\[T_{1}=0^{\circ}C=273.15K;\qquad T_{2}=35^{\circ}C=308.15\ K\]

The pressure at noon time is

\[p_{2}=(20.7\times 10^{3})\frac{308.15}{273.15}=23.4\ kPa\]

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:34]

**Explanation:**

Q: For A and C, there is no heat transferred in or out of the system so Q=0. The oil in the wok is heating up so Q is positive.

W: Work is done on the system if it compresses. For A, the air in the pump compresses so +. For B, there is no volume or pressure change so W=0. Lastly, air in the tire expands as some escapes so negative.

\(\Delta U\): For A and C, Q=0 so \(\Delta U=W\). For B, \(\Delta U=Q\).
