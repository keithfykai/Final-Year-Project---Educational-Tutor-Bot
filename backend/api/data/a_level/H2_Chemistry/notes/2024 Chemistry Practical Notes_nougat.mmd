* If need to see if reached end point
* Record the value first, then add another drop from burette
* if colour changed, use the previous value
* Solution with unknown concentration should be in conical flask

### Possible question types:

Whether a value calculated from the experimental results will be more accurate if an instrument of a better precision is used to measure out the reactant used in excess * No, the precision of the volume measured for the reactant does not matter if it is used in excess

Why need to dilute some reactants before putting them inside the conical flask

* If 25.00 \(cm^{3}\) of those reactants were used, they require >50.00 \(cm^{3}\) of the reactant used inside burette.

This exceeds burette capacity (50.00 \(cm^{3}\)) need to refill > Higher percentage error

## Gas Collection

Possible question types:

How to ensure reliability of mass of solid measured

* Heat solid gently first (prevents solid from splattering), then heat strongly
* Heat, cool, Reweigh. Repeat this process until a constant mass is obtained

### Chemical energetics/ Calorimetry

* Enthalpy change of neutralisation = -57.3k.J/mol
* Graph drawn need to start from origin

Possible question types:

Predicting whether replacing a (strong acid) with a (weak acid) will change the enthalpy change

* Only strong acid + strong alkali reaction will be -57.3k.J/mol. For the remaining acid + alkali reactions, the reaction is less exothermic as some energy from the reaction is absorbed to dissociate the acid completely

Predicting whether doubling the volume of both reactants (acid + alkali) will affect temperature change

* Temperature change remain constant \(\rightarrow\) double the heat produced, distributed double the volume of solution (link to heat capacity)

Why graphical method to determine maximum temperature change is more accurate than direct measurement of initial and maximum temperature reached

* Graphical accounts for heat lost to surroundings

Sources of error for spirit lamp experiment + modifications to minimise the error

* Incomplete combustion \(\rightarrow\) Flush more \(O_{2}\) to ensure complete combustion
* Burning of wick produces heat, which accounts for the temperature rise \(\rightarrow\) use a fibre wick that does not burn. Ensures that heat transferred to calorimeter is entirely due to combustion of (substance in spirit lamp) only

### Reaction Kinetics

Homogeneous catalyst \(\rightarrow\) Consumed by the reaction & gets regenerated

Heterogeneous catalyst \(\rightarrow\) Catalyst is different phase from reactants & products

Tables:

\begin{tabular}{l} Average \\ temperature (T) \\ of reaction \\ mixture = \(\frac{1}{2}\) ( \\ \(T_{initial}\) + \(T_{final}\) \\ )/ \({}^{\circ}\)C \\ Time (t) for \\ blotting out the \\ cross / s \\ \end{tabular}

Possible question types:

Explain why water is added to the reaction mixtures

* To keep the total reaction volume constant across all experiments. This allows concentration of reactants used to be directly proportional to its volume added

Explain why \(\frac{1}{t}\) is a measure of the rate of reaction
* Since the same end point is reached, it means that the same fixed amount of (product) is formed in each reaction. Thus, \(\frac{1}{t}\) is directly proportional to rate of reaction

## 7 % error

* Formula: % error = \(\pm\)(max error)/ volume measured x 100%
* Max error = half the smallest division on instrument x no. Of times you read the instrument
* Exception to the above max error: Measuring cylinder (can read smallest division instrument)
* From the formula, observe that greater volume measured would decrease % error

Some words of encouragement/ advice:

1. Stay calm. Don't panic. Fretting = shaky hands = have to redo experiments @
2. Spend about 20-25 mins on planning. To practice, try 30 mins first then slowly reduce the time limit. Do planning first cos your mind can still function the best at this time. After 25 mins, die die must stop planning already.
3. Do 2 perfect titrations. Don't waste time on a rough one (Still need refill burette). How to know when going to change colour soon: the colour in the solution starting to take longer time to turn back to original colour.

4. Your bunsen burner is working fine. They checked prior to the exam, so don't ask for help. Invigliator will only on to show you it works then off for you to on by yourself. Outcome: You know that your bunsen burner works even though that was already known from the start & you may potentially have lost some marks.

All the best for practicali
