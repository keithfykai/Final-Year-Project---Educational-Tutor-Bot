# H2 Topic 14 - Current of Electricity

###### Abstract

One of William Gilbert's (1544 - 1603) contribution to the field of science was his study on static electricity. He established the "amber effect" (now called the triboelectric effect) - that certain materials such as amber can become electrically charged by friction with other materials. As Amber is called eikron in Greek, and electrum in Latin, Gilbert decided to refer to the phenomenon by the adjective"electrics". giving birth to the word "electricity".

### Introduction

Previously from oscillations through waves, we used a simplified _microscopic_ model of individual particles oscillating and linked them to the _macroscopic_ behaviour of wave properties. The study of the large-scale behaviour saves us the effort of having to model all of the individual behaviour of particles, and allows us to investigate interactions and changes, such as multiple waves meeting and overlapping with each other.

Here we study the macroscopic behaviour of electrons flowing through components and wires.

### Electric Current

When an electrical conductor is conducting electricity, an electric current is said to flow through it. This current is made up of a _net flow_ of charged carriers (or charged particles) such as electrons (negatively charged), protons (positively charged) or ions (either polarities).

Universal specified, _conventional flow_ is assumed when working with current flow.

Current is a scalar quantity; it does not obey vector addition laws.

Electric current \(I\) is one of the 7 base S.I. quantities and has the S.I. unit of Ampere (A). It is _chosen_ as a base quantity because it is easier to define the unit of electric current (from the _macroscopic_ model)), than to derive the coulomb from the flow of charged particles (_microscopic mode_).

Since current is the rate of flow of charge \(I=\frac{\text{d}Q}{\text{d}t}\). For constant current: \(I=\frac{Q}{t}\) and \(Q=It\).

#### Drift Velocity

For a current-carrying conductor,

\[I=nA\nu q\]

\[I:\text{current (A)}\]

\[n:\text{number density of charge carriers (m${}^{-3}$)}\]

\[A:\text{cross sectional area (m${}^{-2}$)}\]

\[V:\text{drift velocity (m s${}^{-1}$)}\]

\[q:\text{charge (C)}\]

Electrons in metals exhibit such random, haphazard motion because they are delocalised from the metal atoms (which form a giant lattice of metal cations), and make up a sea of free, delocalised electrons. The electrons collide with the lattice or amongst themselves, giving rise to _resistance_.

**Derivation**

For a current \(I\) in a wire that causes the charge carriers to have a drift velocity \(\nu\), derive an equation relating current to the number density of charge carriers in the wire \(n\), the cross sectional area of the wire \(A\) and the charge on each charge carrier \(q\).

**Solution**

For a wire segment of length \(L\), total charge in this volume is

\[Q = \left(\text{number of charge carriers in volume}\right)q\] \[= n\left(\text{volume}\right)q\] \[= nALq\]

Time taken \(t\) for charge carriers to have net displacement of \(L\)

\[L=\nu t\]

Current is the rate of flow of charge

\[I=\frac{Q}{t}=\frac{nALq}{L/\nu}=nA\nu q\]

**Example 1**

A copper wire of diameter of 0.500 mm carries a current of 1.0 A. Estimate the number density of free, delocalised electrons in the wire.

**Solution**

Assuming all charge carriers are free delocalised electrons:

\[I =nAvq\] \[n =\frac{I}{Avq}=\frac{I}{\left(\pi r^{2}\right)vq}=\frac{I}{\left( \pi\left(\frac{q}{2}\right)^{2}\right)\nu q}\] \[\approx\frac{1}{\left(\pi\left(\frac{0.5\times 10^{-3}}{2} \right)^{2}\right)\left(10^{-4}\right)\left(1.6\times 10^{-19}\right)}\] \[=3.2\times 10^{29}\ \mathrm{m}^{-3}\]

**Example 1 illustrates 2 important concepts:**

An electron that contributes to current moves at about \(10^{-4}\ \mathrm{m}\ \mathrm{s}^{-1}\); it may take forever for an electron to travel from a battery to a light bulb, _but it doesn't need to_.

An electron carries a small finite amount of charge \(q=1.6\times 10^{-19}\ \mathrm{C}\) but there are _many_ moving (albeit slowly) at the same time.

**Why does the lightbulb light up almost immediately when the switch is closed?**

When a circuit is closed,

the electric field inside the circuit is

set up almost instantaneously so that

_all_ electrons in wire and bulb filament

start to move at the same time.

**Definition 4**: The variation of current flow through an electric component with the potential difference applied across it is shown below. Find

**Solution**

\[\begin{array}{l}\text{(a)}\\ R=\frac{V}{I}=\frac{7.0}{0.3}\\ =23.3\ \Omega\\ \end{array}\qquad\qquad R=\frac{V}{I}=\frac{9.0}{1.3}\\ =6.92\ \Omega\\ \end{array}\qquad\qquad R_{\max}=\frac{6}{0.1}\\ =60.0\ \Omega\\ \end{array}\]

**Note**: the gradient of an _I-V_ or _V-I_ has no useful meaning - only the value of \(V\) and \(I\) at each point on the curve can allow us to find the resistance.

#### 14.3.1 I-V Curves

E.g. 4 shows an _I-V_ curve, which seems counter-intuitive as resistance is defined as _V/I_. When industries characterise components, engineers vary the p.d. applied across (independent variable) and measure the current passing through it (dependent variable), hence the convention \(I\) against \(V\).

#### Temperature Affects Resistance

The resistance of a component depends on two factors:

1. the number density of charge carriers,
2. the extent of vibration of the atomic lattice.

Resistors are typically made of metals - generally the resistance of metals increase with increasing temperature.
2. valence electrons of metal atoms make up the sea of delocalised electrons responsible for conduction - the number density is therefore fixed.
3. higher temperatures result in greater vibration of the giant metallic lattice, more frequent collisions with delocalised electrons and disrupts charge flow.

Thermistors are typically semiconductors - the resistance generally decrease with temperature.

1. With higher temperatures, more electrons are set free to carry charge. The freed electrons also creates holes that can act as mobile _positive_ charge carriers.
2. The increased number density of charge carriers is greater in effect than the increased vibration of lattice causing more frequent collisions with charge carriers.

#### Geometry Affects Resistance

\begin{tabular}{p{113.8pt} p{113.8pt}} Resistance is related to geometry via & With all other physical conditions being constant (including temperature), the resistance of a component will also be affected by its geometry. \\ \(R=\frac{\rho L}{A}\) & We characterise the resistance of a component using a property of the material called resistivity \(\rho\) (units is \(\Omega\) m). Do not confuse it with density since they are represented by the same symbol. \\ \(L:\) length (m) & \(L\) is the length of the conductor along the direction of current flow, and \(A\) is the cross-sectional area "normal" to the current flow (quotation marks because current is a scalar quantity and does not have a direction to define a normal with). \\ \end{tabular}

#### Internal Resistance

Most real-world e.m.f. sources are not ideal in that they inherently has some resistance. We represent a _practical_ cell on circuits as a combination of an ideal source of e.m.f. \(\varepsilon\) housed together with a resistor representing the _internal resistance_.

**Example 7**

Explain why the terminal p.d. of a cell with internal resistance may be less than the e.m.f..

**Solution**

e.m.f. represents total amount of energy per unit charge around complete circuit.

when cell supplies a current, some of the available energy is transformed into other forms of energy in the internal resistance,

causing a drop in potential difference across the internal resistance

**Note**: some texts describe the process as power being wasted in the cell

**Example 8**

The current in the circuit shown is 0.65 A. Find

(i) the terminal p.d. of the battery,

(ii) the internal resistance \(r\) of the battery,

(iii) the power dissipated in the (external) resistor

(iv) the efficiency of the battery.

**Solution**

**Note**: if a battery is shorted, _all_ available energy is transformed into heat within internal resistance, the battery heats up rapidly and risks exploding.

### Efficiency vs Power Transfer

When we design simple electronics and electrical appliances, efficiency and power output are opposing trade-offs that needs to be balanced according to needs.

For the following section we will consider a simplified circuit shown here. The speaker is a component which converts available p.d. into sound waves. The volume ("loudness") of the speaker is measured by the power output across its resistance \(P_{\text{load}}=I\textsubscript{$V_{\text{load}}$}=I^{2}R_{\text{load}}=\frac{ \textsubscript{$V_{\text{load}}^{2}$}}{R_{\text{load}}}\).

#### Maximising Efficiency

For efficiency, we study the ratio of the total power supplied and the useful power output.

Since current is the same throughout the circuit, efficiency increases with increasing load resistance because more of the proportion of power is shifted over to the component.

The maximum limit of 100% efficiency then occurs when the source has no internal resistance.

When working with practical sources of e.m.f. where internal resistance is present, the condition to increase efficiency necessitates increasing the load resistance.

However, because overall circuit resistance would have increased, the actual amount of power (not ratio) being output at the component will be decreased as a result.

#### Maximum Power Transfer Theorem

Maximum power transfer happens when

resistance of external load

is the same resistance

as the internal resistance of source of e.m.f.

Using the example of the speaker, we trade-off by either choosing (i) a very efficient circuit where most of the power is being used by the speaker but the speaker output is very soft or (ii) the speaker operates at the loudest possible given the fixed internal resistance of the e.m.f. source but operates at 50% efficiency.

### Ending Notes

This topic emphasizes the fundamental understanding of components and their individual behaviour when subject to potential differences.

In the next topic H215 DC circuits we will consider how do different components interact with each and delve deeper into analysis of circuits.
