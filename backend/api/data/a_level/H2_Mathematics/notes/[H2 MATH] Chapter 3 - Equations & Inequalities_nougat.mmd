\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|} \hline Group & Children & Adults & Senior Citizens & Total Cost \\ \hline X & 8 & 3 & 1 & 5140.90 \\ \hline Y & 5 & 7 & 4 & 5215.80 \\ \hline Z & 11 & 6 & 2 & 5237.30 \\ \hline \end{tabular}

To solve a linear equations questions such as the one on the left:

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|} \hline Group & Children & Adults & Senior Citizens & Total Cost \\ \hline X & 8 & 3 & 1 & 5140.90 \\ \hline Y & 5 & 7 & 4 & 5215.80 \\ \hline Z & 11 & 6 & 2 & 5237.30 \\ \hline \end{tabular}

Create equations to find the cost of each ticket for the different categories.

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|} \hline Group & Children & Adults & Senior Citizens & Total Cost \\ \hline X & 8 & 3 & 1 & 5140.90 \\ \hline Y & 5 & 7 & 4 & 5215.80 \\ \hline Z & 11 & 6 & 2 & 5237.

**For simultaneous inequalities:**

Split both sides and solve separately, then determine the solution by finding overlaps in the number line later

\[-3\leq\frac{x}{x+1}\leq 5\]

\[-3\leq\frac{x}{x+1}\text{ or }\frac{x}{x+1}\leq 5\]

**For modulus inequalities:**

Square both sides and solve accordingly OR bring modulus to one side and solve both + and -

\[\frac{3}{(2x-1)^{2}}\succ\frac{2}{(x+3)^{2}}\]

\[\frac{9}{(2x-1)^{2}}\succ\frac{4}{(x+3)^{2}}\]

\[\frac{9}{(2x-1)^{2}}\succ\frac{4}{(x+3)^{2}}\succ 0\]

\[9(x+3)^{2}-4(2x-1)^{2}\succ 0\]

**Inequalities**

_Recall: The inequality sign is reversed if a negative constant is multiplied or divided throughout the inequality_

In general, there are 2 ways to solve inequality questions:

1. Use G.C. to solve graphically: 1. Plot all equations of the inequality on the G.C. OR move all equations to one side, sketch that and the line \(y=0\) 2. find the points of intersections using G.C. 3. Determine the solution: 1. LHS < RHS : values of x for which the LHS graph is below the RHS : LHS : values of x for which the LHS graph is above the RHS
2. Manipulate the inequality to solve algebraically: 1. Move all variables to one side of the inequality 2. Manipulate by: 1. Factorising polynomials 2. Combining algebraic fractions and factorising 3. Find the critical values by equating factors to be 0 4. Use a number line to mark critical values and determine the signs for each interval 5. State the final solution from the sign test: \(<\) : values for x for which interval has - sign \(>\) : values for x for which interval has + sign
