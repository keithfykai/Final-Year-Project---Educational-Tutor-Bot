## Appendix C Circuit Symbols

The following are some basic circuit symbol:

## Appendix C Circuit Symbols

## Appendix C Circuit SymbolsSeries Circuit

* is a closed circuit in which the current follows one path, and the same current flows through every part of the circuit

* By **conservation of energy**, the algebraic sum of emf is equal to of p.d. of all individual component 

## Part 2 Parallel Circuit

* is a closed circuit in which circuit components share common 2 points

* By conservation of charge (current is divided in junction \(A\)),

** By conservation of energy (all resistors are directly connected to battery),

## Appendix A

## Appendix A Potential DMider

* is a chain of two or more resistors connected in series, across which a p.d. is applied, with the output taken from the junction(s) of the resistors.
* is used to produce an output p.d. that is a _fraction_ of the voltage supply

As the circuit is series, the fig statements are valid:

a. The current \(t\) at any point in the circuit is the same.

b. \(v=V_{out}=V_{in}+V_{in}\)

By Ohris's law (\(V\)=H).

\(c=N_{dec}=I_{Note}=I(R_{1}+R_{2})\)

Solving for the current \(I\)

\[I=\frac{e}{R_{1}+R_{2}}=\frac{V_{in}}{R_{1}+R_{2}}\]

In determining \(V_{out}\) and \(V_{in}\), we need to solve for the p.d. across individual resistors using Ohris's law.

Output p.d. across \(R_{1}\):

Output p.d. across \(R_{2}\):

\(V_{in}=I_{1}=\big{(}\frac{V_{in}}{V_{in}+R_{2}}\big{)}_{R_{1}}=\big{(}\frac{R _{1}}{V_{in}+R_{2}}\big{)}_{V_{in}}\)

From the above results, the general formula for the output p.d. \(V_{out}\) across a resistor \(R\) is given by the highlighted formula above.

Ex. For \(V_{out}\) across \(R_{1}\), the equation is \(V_{out}=\big{(}\frac{R_{1}}{V_{in}}\big{)}e\)

## Appendix A Proof Example 3

The potential divider circuit shown on the rights used for providing

Variable output potential difference \(V_{AB}\). The resistance \(R_{2}\) of the

variable resistor ranges from \(1.0k\Omega\) to \(50k\Omega\). Given by the input p.d of

\(60V\) and \(R_{1}=30k\Omega\), find the range of out p.d. \(V_{AB}\) that can be produced.

Use minimum value of \(R_{2}=1k\Omega\) for solve the min output p.d:

\[V_{AB,min}=\left(\frac{R_{2}}{R_{1}+R_{2}}\right)\varepsilon=\left(\frac{1k \Omega}{30k\Omega+1k\Omega}\right)60V=1.94\mathbb{W}\]

Use maximum value of \(R_{2}=50k\Omega\) for solve the max output p.d:

\[V_{AB,max}=\left(\frac{50k\Omega}{30k\Omega+50k\Omega}\right)60V=37.5\mathbb{W}\]

Answer: \(1.94\mathbb{W}\leqq_{AB}\leqq 37.5\mathbb{W}\)

## Appendix 0.1 Potential and Potential Difference

**POTENTIAL and POTENTIAL DIFFERENCE**

Potential at a point in a circuit depends on the chosen reference point.

you are free to choose the reference point and give it an arbitrary value. It affects the potential but not the p.d.

The ground is the reference point (zero potential, 0V) if it is included in the circuit.

If there is no ground, assigning the negative terminal to be the zero potential is more convenient for calculations.

Potential difference is the same regardless of the chosen reference point.

**PROBLEM SOLVING TIPS**

Identify the reference point (ground or negative terminal).

Draw the direction of conventional current.

Calculate p.d. across each circuit component using potential divider formula.

Label (+ or -) potential values on points starting from the reference point. (Current flows point of higher to lower potential.)

## Appendix ABalance Point

The contact point where the test cell nullifies the current flowing in the lower circuit. (galvanometer shows no deflection)

This is where \(V_{AB}=E\)

Balance Length

\(L_{AB}=\frac{V_{AB}}{V_{AC}}\,L_{AC}\)

Note:

Though at balance point, no current flows in the lower circuit, there is still a constant current flowing in the main loop For more notes & learning materials, visit:
