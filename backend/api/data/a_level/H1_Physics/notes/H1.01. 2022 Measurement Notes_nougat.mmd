**Introduction**

Physics is an experimental science in which measurements are made. Evidence from measurements is the ultimate authority in establishing physics theories. Precise measurements enable the checking of experimental data against theoretical prediction. Accurate measurements allow us to overcome the unreliability of our human senses and for the purpose of standardisation. Precise measurements made possible many applications e.g. study of the structure of matter, from geophysics to astronomy, in the medical industry where development of measuring instruments provides data that are crucial in informing clinical decisions. In this chapter, you will not only learn conceptsassociated with measurements, but also vectors to represent physics quantities, and enable us to compute quantities and solve problems.

### Essential Questions

* Why is there a need for standards in measurements and how are the standards of measurements defined or established?
* Why are uncertainties inherent in all measurements and how can uncertainties be reduced?
* Why do we need to know the uncertainty of a measurement?
* How is the skill of making approximations of particular physical quantities useful in science?

#### 1.1.1 Physical Quantities

* Quantities which can be measured.
* Examples: length, density, time, force, pressure, velocity, energy, temperature, magnetic field strength, wavelength, frequency, etc.
* Stated with a numerical value, and, its unit. For example, mass of man is 65 kg.
* The standard system of measure adopted in Physics is the _International System of Units_ (SI). [Be familiar with the 'Summary of Key Quantities, Symbols and Units' listed in the Appendix at the end of this Module Notes.]

#### 1.1.2 Base Quantities & Base Units

* A set of quantities chosen by scientists, which, by convention, cannot be defined in terms of any other base quantities.
* These are the quantities by which all other physical quantities are defined.
* There are seven base quantities:

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|} \hline
**Base quantity** & **SI Base unit** & **Symbol** \\ \hline Length & metre & m \\ \hline Mass & kilogram & kg \\ \hline Time & second & s \\ \hline Temperature & kelvin & K \\ \hline Electric current & ampere & A \\ \hline \end{tabular}

#### 1.1.3 The mole & Avogadro's Number

One mole is defined as the amount of substance that contains as many elementary particles as there are atoms in 0.012 kg (12 g) of carbon-12 isotope.

The Avogadro constant N\({}_{\text{A}}\) is the number of atoms in 0.012 kg of carbon-12 isotope, and has been determined to have a value of \(6.02\times 10^{23}\) mol-1.

Hence, one mole of a substance contains \(6.02\times 10^{23}\) particles.

The mass of 1 mole of substance is known as the **molar mass** of the substance expressed in g mol-1.

Since there are N\({}_{\text{A}}\) particles in 1 mole of any element, the mass of an atom for a given element is

\[m_{\text{atom}}=\frac{\text{molar mass}}{\text{N}_{\text{A}}}\]

As such, _molar_ quantities refer to physical quantities associated with 1 mole of a substance. As an example, the molar volume of CO\({}_{2}\) means the volume occupied by 1 mole of CO\({}_{2}\) and so on.

**Example 1**

The Hope Diamond and the Rosser Reeves Ruby

The Hope diamond is almost pure carbon which has a mass of 44.5 carats. The Rosser Reeves ruby is primarily aluminium oxide (Al\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{3}\)) which has a mass of 138 carats.

One carat is equal to a mass of 0.200 g.

Determine

(i) the number of Al\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{3}\) molecules in the ruby, and

(ii) the number of moles of carbon atoms in the diamond.

Solution:

(i)

Mass of the Rosser Reeves ruby = 138 \(\times\) 0.2 = 27.6 g

Molar mass of Al\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{3}\) molecules = 2 \(\times\) 27 + 3 \(\times\)16 = 102 g mol-1

No. of moles of aluminium oxide, \(n=\frac{\text{mass}}{\text{mal\,mass}}=\frac{27.6}{102}=0.271\) mol

No. of aluminium oxide molecules in the Rosser Reeves ruby, N = nN\({}_{\text{A}}\)

\(=0.271\times 6.02\times 10^{23}\)

\(=1.63\times 10^{23}\) molecules

(ii)_Try it yourself!_

Mass of the Hope diamond = 44.5 x 0.200 g = 8.90 g

Molar mass of carbon atoms = 12 g mol-1

No. of moles of carbon atoms, \(n=\frac{\text{mass of sample}}{\text{mal\,mass}}=0.742\) mol

No. of carbon atoms in the Hope diamond = N

= nN\({}_{\text{A}}\)

= (0.742) x (6.02 x 10\({}^{23}\))

= 4.47 \(\times\) 10\({}^{23}\) atoms

#### 1.1.4 Derived Quantities & Derived Units

Derived quantities are all other physical quantities other than the base quantities.

Derived units are obtained by using the defining equation of that derived quantity.

Derived units are called SI units if they are constructed from the 7 base units.

In calculations, square brackets, "[ ]", denote "units of".

#### Example 2

\begin{tabular}{|c|l|l|c|c|} \hline

_Note: 'newton', 'joule', 'coulomb', 'joule per second', 'watt' are SI units but not SI base units._

**Example 3** (Determining units of unknown quantities in an equation):

The relation between the pressure P of a sample of gas at a certain temperature T and the volume V available to it is given to a good approximation, by the Van der Waals' relation

\[\left(\text{P}+\frac{\text{a}}{\text{V}^{2}}\right)\left(\text{V}-\text{b} \right)=\text{KT}\]

where a, b and k are constants. Find the units of a, b and k.

Solution:

_Thinking questions:_

_1) What are the terms in the equation? What are their base units?_

_2) What are the rules that can be applied to derive the unknown units?_

Let [ ] denote "units of".

\[\left[\frac{\text{a}}{\text{V}^{2}}\right]=\text{[P]}\]

[a] = [P] x [V\({}^{2}\)]

Thus the terms P and \(\frac{\text{a}}{\text{V}^{2}}\) have the same units.

Also,

[b] = [V] = m\({}^{3}\)

Comparing units on both sides of the equation, we have:

\[\left[\text{P}+\frac{\text{a}}{\text{V}^{2}}\right]\text{.}[\text{V}-\text{b} ]=\text{[k]}[\text{T}]\]

Therefore,

\[\text{[k]}=\left[\text{P}+\frac{\text{a}}{\text{V}^{2}}\right]\left[\text{V}- \text{b}\right]\left[\text{T}^{-1}\right]=\left(\text{kg}\,\text{m}^{-1}\, \text{s}^{-2}\right)\left(\text{m}^{3}\right)\text{K}^{-1}\]

\[=\text{kg}\,\text{m}^{2}\,\,\text{s}^{-2}\text{K}^{-1}\]

This whole term, \(\left(\text{P}_{+}\frac{\text{a}}{\text{V}^{2}}\right)\) has the units of (kg m\({}^{-1}\,\text{s}^{-2}\)) and the term (V-b) has the units of m\({}^{3}\). Thus units on the left side of equation is (kg m\({}^{-1}\,\text{s}^{-2}\))(m\({}^{3}\)).

## 14 Background and Uncertainty

An **error** is the difference between a measured quantity and its true value.

If the true value is not known, then it is more correct to refer to an uncertainty.

An **uncertainty** is the range of values on both sides of a measurement in which the true value of the measurement is expected to lie.

A measurement quoted as (36.4\(\pm\)0.3) cm implies that the most likely value is 36.4 cm with an uncertainty of \(\pm\) 0.3 cm. The actual value is likely to lie between 36.1 cm and 36.7 cm.

Absolute uncertainty is an estimate of the maximum likely difference between a value obtained from measurement, and, the average value. For example, the height of a person measured using a measuring tape could be expressed as (170.0 \(\pm\) 0.1) cm. This means the _average_ of repeated measurements is 170.0 cm, and, the _absolute uncertainty_ is 0.1 cm.

#### Estimation of Absolute Uncertainty for DIRECT measurements

Factors that determine the absolute uncertainty in a measurement include:

1. Precision of measuring instrument
2. Experimental procedure
3. Factors of the physical environment

Absolute uncertainty of a quantity that can be measured directly by an instrument may be determined from the smallest division of the instrument, usually taken to be half or a whole of the smallest division of the measuring scale.

However, if factors 2 or 3 above are more significant compared to factor 1, then the maximum uncertainty is quoted.

#### Expressing Uncertainty

We quote the measurement with its absolute uncertainty as (X \(\pm\) OX) (units).

The fractional uncertainty of the measurement is given by OX/X.

The percentage uncertainty of the measurement is given by (AX/X) x 100%.

Uncertainty is just an estimation; hence absolute uncertainty OX is always rounded off to 1 significant figure.

X is always expressed to the same order of precision as OX.

E.g. (120 \(\pm\) 20) g, (121 \(\pm\) 5) g, (121.3 \(\pm\) 0.1) g, (121.35 \(\pm\) 0.01) g

_Rationale: It doesn't make sense if the calculated quantity is more precise than the uncertainty._

**Example 7**

A thermometer has small scale divisions of 1 \({}^{0}\)C and the temperature measured is twenty-five degree centigrade.

i)   Estimate the absolute error of the measurement of T.

ii)   How should the reading be expressed?

iii)   Hence calculate the fractional and percentage error of the temperature measured.

Solution:

i)   Absolute Uncertainty of the measurement of T, \(\Delta\)T = 0.5 \({}^{0}\)C  (half of a division)

ii)   T = (25.0 + 0.5) \({}^{0}\)C  (\(\Delta\)T must be in 1 s.f. T must be expressed to the same number of d.p. as \(\Delta\)T.)

iii)   Fractional error of T, \(\Delta\)T / T = 0.5 / 25.0 = 0.02  (1 s.f.)

Percentage error of T = Fractional error of T x 100 % = 2 %  (1 s.f.)

#### Estimating uncertainties of DERIVED quantities

Many physical quantities cannot be measured directly. Instead, they are derived from measurement of certain basic quantities. For example, the value of the acceleration due to gravity (g) can be estimated from an experiment involving measuring the length and period of oscillations of a pendulum. 'g' is the derived quantity; while the length and timings performed are the basic quantities.

Uncertainties in the measurement of these individual basic quantities will then combine, resulting in a _larger_ uncertainty in the derived quantity.

Uncertainties always add up, they do not cancel each other.

(a) **Addition/Subtraction rule**

If A = x + y, then \(\Delta\)A = \(\Delta\)x + \(\Delta\)y

If B = x - y, then \(\Delta\)B = \(\Delta\)x + \(\Delta\)y

(b) **Product/Quotient rule**

For a quantity that is expressed by multiplying or dividing other quantities, its absolute error CANNOT be found directly, we need to first find its fractional error:

1. If A = xyz

fractional error in A is \(\Delta\)A = \(\Delta\)x + \(\Delta\)y + \(\Delta\)z

absolute error in A is \(\Delta\)A = \(\left(\frac{\Delta\)x + \(\Delta\)y + \(\Delta\)z }\right)\)A

(13)2. If \(A=\frac{x}{y}\) fractional error in \(A\) is \(\frac{\Delta A}{A}=\frac{\Delta x}{x}+\frac{\Delta y}{y}\) absolute error in \(A\) is \(\Delta A=\left(\frac{\Delta x}{x}+\frac{\Delta y}{y}\right)A\) (c) Multiply with a constant If \(A=kx,\text{ where }k\) is a constant absolute error in \(A\) is \(\Delta A=k\Delta x\) fractional error in \(A\) is \(\Delta A=\frac{\Delta x}{x}\) (d) Constant power if \(A=x^{p}\) fractional error in \(A\) is \(\frac{\Delta A}{A}=\left|p\right|\frac{\Delta x}{x}\) (e) General case If \(A=\frac{kx^{p}y^{q}}{z^{r}}\) fractional error in \(A\) is \(\frac{\Delta A}{A}=\left|p\right|\frac{\Delta x}{x}+\left|q\right|\frac{\Delta y }{y}+\left|r\right|\frac{\Delta z}{z}\) (c) to (e) may in fact be derived from (a) and (b). (f) Combination of Addition, Subtraction, Product, Quotient, Trigonometry and/or Logarithms (Extreme values method) When faced with such an equation, for example: \(A=a+\frac{b}{c\left(cos\,\theta\right)}\) It is simpler to use the _extreme values method_.

1. Calculate the maximum and minimum values of the subject of the equation (in the case above, A), by substituting the highest or lowest values of the quantities in the equation.
2. The absolute uncertainty will be equivalent to : \[\Delta\Delta=\frac{\text{maximum value of A - minimum value of A}}{2}\] The extreme values method is also applied when the same quantity appears in both the numerator and denominator, for example: \[B=\frac{\text{mn}}{\text{m}+\text{n}}\] If the product/quotient rule is applied, the uncertainty in m and n will have varying effects on the numerator and denominator and thus cannot be applied.

**Example 8**

The diameter of a wire is \((0.56\pm 0.01)\) mm. Express the cross-sectional area of the wire with its uncertainty.

Solution:

\[\text{Cross -sectional area of wire, A}=\pi r^{2}=\pi\frac{\text{d}^{2}}{4}\] \[=\pi\times\frac{0.56^{2}}{4}\] \[=0.2464\text{ mm}^{2}\] \[\frac{\Delta\text{A}}{\text{A}}=2\frac{\Delta\text{d}}{\text{d}} \qquad\text{(since A}=\pi\frac{\text{d}^{2}}{4})\] \[=2\times\frac{0.01}{0.56}\] \[=0.0357\] \[\therefore\Delta\Delta=0.0357\times\text{A}\] \[=0.0357\times\text{0.2464}\] \[=0.0088\text{ mm}^{2}\] \[=0.009\text{ mm}^{2}\text{ (1sig. fig.)}\] Hence cross-sectional area of wire (A \[\pm\Delta\text{A}\] ) = \((0.246\pm 0.009)\) mm\({}^{2}\). _(Note: A is expressed to the same number of decimal places as \(\Delta\text{A}\).)_

**Recall: The uncertainty is expressed to 1 significant figure and the calculated value should have the same order of precision as the uncertainty.

**Example 9**

The energy of a mass is given by: \(E=\text{mgh}+\frac{1}{2}\text{mv}^{2}\)

where measurements show that

\(\text{m}=(2.500\pm 0.002)\) kg, \(\text{h}=(3.00\pm 0.01)\) m, \(\text{v}=(1.00\pm 0.01)\) m s\({}^{-1}\)

Determine E and its uncertainty using the value of g as 9.81 m s\({}^{-2}\).

Solution:

Highest value of E = 2.502(9.81 x 3.01 + \(\text{\%}\) x 1.012) = 75.155 J

Lowest value of E = 2.498(9.81 x 2.99 + \(\text{\%}\) x 0.992) = 74.495 J

Absolute error in E, \(\Delta\text{E}=\frac{75.155-74.495}{2}=0.330=0.3\) J (1 s.f.)

Average value of E = \(\frac{75.155+74.495}{2}=74.82\) J =74.8 1 (to the same number of d.p. as \(\Delta\text{E}\))

Hence, E = (\(74.8\pm 0.3\)) J

#### 1.4.4 What is random error?

A random error is an error which gives a scatter of readings about an average value. It has an equal chance of being positive or negative and can be reduced by averaging.

1. Random error is revealed by repeated measurements of a particular quantity.
2. Common sources of random errors are i. fluctuating factors in the physical environment - e.g. room temperature ii. errors of judgement or inconsistent procedural errors - e.g. the observer's estimation of a fraction of the smallest division of measuring instrument used may vary in repeated measurements; parallax error may be inconsistent in repeated measurements iii. disturbances - e.g. mechanical vibrations from nearby rotating machinery iv. imperfections in the objects being measured - e.g. diameter of a wire (wire is not uniform)
3. The effects of random error may be reduced by i. taking the average of repeated measurements ii. graphical means (drawing the line of best-fit)2

#### What is systematic error?

A systematic error is a constant deviation of readings from the true value in one direction. All measurements will be too high or too low by the same amount. It can be reduced by correct laboratory practice.

1. Systematic errors are not revealed by repeated measurements, and cannot be reduced by taking the average or drawing the line of best-fit.
2. Common sources of systematic errors are i. an instrument having a zero error - instrument shows non-zero readings when nothing is being measured ii. an instrument being incorrectly calibrated (e.g. a slow running stopclock). iii. end error (e.g. due to wear and tear at the ends of a ruler after being used for many years). iv. experimental conditions - an instrument used under experimental conditions (e.g. temperature and pressure) different from those for which it was calibrated. v. background measurement (e.g. when using the Geiger-Muller counter and forgetting to subtract the background radiation count-rate; note that background radiation contributes to _both_ systematic and random errors due to the random nature of radioactivity.) vi. consistent procedural errors (e.g. consistently reading off the volume of water in a measuring cylinder from the highest point of its meniscus).
3. Systematic errors can be eliminated or corrected by i. taking into account zero errors of the instrument to determine the actual value of the measurements. ii. checking the instruments used against other similar instruments and recalibrate the instrument, if necessary, before using. iii. ensuring that instrument is used in the same experimental conditions (e.g. temperature and pressure) which it is calibrated for. iv. ensuring correct techniques or procedures are used to take measurements.

4. Systematic errors can be revealed by comparing the measurements with the true value or by graphical means. On a graph, a systematic error would manifest itself as an intercept on the y-axis other than the expected y-intercept. For example, in a pendulum experiment to investigate \(T\) (Period) against \(I\) (length) all the lengths measured may be too small because the student did not add the radius of the bob. A straight line graph passing through the origin is expected to be obtained by plotting \(T^{2}\) against \(I\). Because every measured value of \(I\) is too short by the radius, a straight line would still be obtained but the line will not pass through the origin, which is the expected y-intercept. In such cases, the y-intercept of the plotted straight line graph revealed the systematic error.

#### Precision vs Accuracy

\begin{tabular}{|p{142.3pt}|p{142.3pt}|} \hline
**Precision** (of an instrument): & a term used to describe the level of uncertainty in an instrument's scale. High precision instruments have small scale divisions. \\ \hline
**Accuracy** (of an instrument): & is the closeness of a reading on an instrument to the true value of the quantity being measured. An accurate instrument will give readings close to the true values. \\ \hline
**Precision** (of a set of readings): & is the degree of closeness of the readings with one another. It is associated with small random error. \\ \hline
**Accuracy** (of a set of readings): & is the degree of closeness of the average value of the readings to the true value. It is associated with small systematic error. \\ \hline \end{tabular}

Further notes: Precision vs Accuracy (of a set of readings):

1. If an experiment has small systematic errors, it is said to have high accuracy.
2. If an experiment has small random errors, it is said to have high precision.
3. The figure below illustrates the meaning of 'accurate readings' and 'precise readings':

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:19]

**Example 10**: Four students made a series of measurements of the acceleration of free fall g where g = 9.81 ms\({}^{-2}\). The table shows the results obtained. Which student obtained a set of results that could be described as precise but not accurate? (N96/1/3)

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|} \hline Student & \multicolumn{4}{c|}{Results g / m s\({}^{-2}\)} \\ \hline A & 9.81 & 9.79 & 9.84 & 9.83 \\ \hline B & 9.81 & 10.12 & 9.89 & 8.94 \\ \hline C & 9.45 & 9.21 & 8.99 & 8.76 \\ \hline D & 8.45 & 8.46 & 8.50 & 8.41 \\ \hline \end{tabular}

Solution:

_Thinking questions:_

_1) What should we be looking at if we need to determine if the data collected is precise?_

_2) What should we be looking at if we need to determine if the data collected is accurate?_

determines accuracy

determines precision

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|} \hline Student & \multicolumn{4}{c|}{Results g / m s\({}^{-2}\)} & \multicolumn{2}{c|}{_Range_} & \multicolumn{1}{c|}{_Mean value_} \\ \hline A & 9.81 & 9.79 & 9.84 & 9.83 & _0.05_ & _9.82_ \\ \hline B & 9.81 & 10.12 & 9.89 & 8.94 & _1.18_ & _9.69_ \\ \hline C & 9.45 & 9.21 & 8.99 & 8.76 & _0.69_ & _9.10_ \\ \hline D & 8.45 & 8.46 & 8.50 & 8.41 & _0.09_ & _8.46_ \\ \hline \end{tabular}

From the 'Mean value' and 'Range', we can conclude that Student D's result is precise but not accurate because:

1. The mean value of Student D is the furthest to the true value of 9.81 m s\({}^{-2}\).

2. The range of readings of Student D is the 2nd smallest value in comparison to the rest of the students.

**Answer: D**

**Example 11**: An object falls freely from rest and travels a distance \(s\) in time \(t\). A graph of \(t^{2}\) against \(s\) is plotted and used to determine the acceleration of free fall g.

The gradient of the graph is found to be 0.218 s\({}^{2}\) m\({}^{-1}\) and g is determined by the equation:

\[\text{g}=\frac{2}{\text{gradient of graph}}\]

Which statement about the value obtained for g is correct?

**A**: It is accurate but not precise.
**B**: It is both precise and accurate.
**C**: It is neither precise nor accurate.
**D**: It is precise but not accurate.

Solution:

1) How to determine 'accuracy' from the graph?

Compare the 'average value of the readings', which is given by the gradient of the line of best fit

with the true value of g, which is 9.81 m s\({}^{-2}\)

By calculation, average value of g = \(\frac{2}{0.218}\) = 9.17 m s\({}^{-2}\). This is not an accurate value.

2) How to determine 'precision' from the graph?

A quick way, not always clear-cut, is to look at how much scattering of data points there is about the line of best fit. We see here there is hardly any point that lies on the line.

A more rigorous way is to draw 2 'extreme lines' by pivoting about the expected/theoretical/accurate coordinate (0, 0), since at t=0, s=0. The gradient of these 2 'extreme lines' gives the maximum and minimum values of g obtained from each experimental reading when taken separately. Without having to calculate the gradients of these 2 'extreme lines', simply judging the difference in gradients between them, one can get a sense of the range of values of g obtained from these experiment data.

Since the deviation of gradient between the 2 'extreme lines' is not small, the value of \(g\) is not precise.

#### 1.5.1 SCALARS & VECTORS

A **scalar** quantity is a quantity that has magnitude only, not direction.

e.g. speed, distance, volume, mass, energy, power, temperature.

A **vector** quantity is a quantity that has both magnitude and direction.

e.g. displacement, velocity, acceleration, momentum, force, gravitational field strength, electric field strength and magnetic flux density.

1. Arrows are used to represent vectors. The direction of the arrow gives the direction of the vector. The length of a vector arrow is proportional to the magnitude of the vector.
2. Negative vector is one with the same magnitude but its direction is reversed.

Note: Vector \(\overset{\rightarrow}{\mathbf{A}}\) has the same magnitude as vector \(-\overset{\rightarrow}{\mathbf{A}}\), but vector \(\overset{\rightarrow}{\mathbf{A}}\) is at an angle \(\theta\) above the horizontal and vector \(-\overset{\rightarrow}{\mathbf{A}}\) is (180\({}^{\circ}\)- \(\theta\)) below the horizontal. The angle of the vector made with the horizontal is the direction of vectors.
3. To describe a vector, we must specify both its magnitude and its direction. For example, if Vector \(\overset{\rightarrow}{\mathbf{A}}\) is displacement, we can write

Magnitude of \(\overset{\rightarrow}{\mathbf{A}}=200\) m

Direction of \(\overset{\rightarrow}{\mathbf{A}}=30^{\circ}\) anticlockwise above the horizontal

#### 1.5.2 Vector Addition & Subtraction - Finding Resultant of vectors

If you earn $20 on Friday and $40 on Saturday, your net income for 2 days is the sum of $20 and $40. With numbers, the word net implies addition. The same is true with vectors in that vectors can be added (vector addition). The sum of two vectors is called the **resultant vector**.

If vector \(\overset{\rightarrow}{\mathbf{B}}\) is added to vector \(\overset{\rightarrow}{\mathbf{A}}\), we can write the resultant vector \(\overset{\rightarrow}{\mathbf{R}}\) of the two vectors:

\[\overset{\rightarrow}{\mathbf{R}}=\overset{\rightarrow}{\mathbf{A}}+\overset{ \rightarrow}{\mathbf{B}}\]Vectors have magnitudes and directions, so different rules apply in vector addition to determine the resultant vector.

You can add the two vectors \(\stackrel{{\rightharpoonup}}{{\boldsymbol{A}}}\) and \(\stackrel{{\rightharpoonup}}{{\boldsymbol{B}}}\) with the three-step procedure (_head-to-tail method_) to determine the resultant vector \(\stackrel{{\rightharpoonup}}{{\boldsymbol{R}}}\), where \(\stackrel{{\rightharpoonup}}{{\boldsymbol{R}}}=\stackrel{{ \rightharpoonup}}{{\boldsymbol{A}}}+\stackrel{{ \rightharpoonup}}{{\boldsymbol{B}}}\), as show below:

If Vector\(\stackrel{{\rightharpoonup}}{{\boldsymbol{B}}}\) is _subtracted_ from Vector\(\stackrel{{\rightharpoonup}}{{\boldsymbol{A}}}\), this vector subtraction is a special case of vector addition:

\[\stackrel{{\rightharpoonup}}{{\boldsymbol{A}}}-\stackrel{{ \rightharpoonup}}{{\boldsymbol{B}}}=\stackrel{{ \rightharpoonup}}{{\boldsymbol{A}}}+\left(-\stackrel{{ \rightharpoonup}}{{\boldsymbol{B}}}\right)\]

Since the minus sign means that the direction of a vector is opposite that of the one with a plus sign, Vector\(-\stackrel{{\rightharpoonup}}{{\boldsymbol{B}}}\) has the same magnitude as the Vector\(\stackrel{{\rightharpoonup}}{{\boldsymbol{B}}}\) but in the opposite direction.

[FIGURE:S4.F1][ENDFIGU

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:25]

**Example 12** (Resultant Displacement): A car travels 10 km in a North-East (NE) direction, followed by 5 km towards the South. Determine the resultant displacement.

We can use a scale drawing of a vector diagram to determine the resultant displacement. A protractor is used to draw the angles accurately. The resultant displacement is determined by drawing a vector \(s\), from start point to end point. The vector \(s\) is drawn from the TAIL of the first vector representing 10 km to the HEAD of the last vector representing 5 km.

Since the length of arrow \(s\) is proportional to the magnitude of vector \(s\), the resultant displacement \(s\) is then determined through measurement using a ruler and multiplying it with the scaling factor.

For example, the measurement of the resultant displacement \(s\) using a ruler is is 2.2 cm. Therefore, the actual represented distance is \((10\div 3)\times 2.2=7.3\) km. _(Note: The method of using scale diagram is not recommended. Only use it if the question specify for it.)_

Using cosine rule to determine the resultant displacement:

\(s^{2}=10^{2}+5^{2}-2\) (10) (5) \(\cos\) 45\({}^{*}\)

\(s=7.4\) km

Using sine rule to find the angle \(\alpha\),

\(\dfrac{\sin 45}{7.4}=\dfrac{\sin\alpha}{5}\)

\(\alpha=28.6^{*}\)

\((90^{*}-(45^{*}+28.6^{*}))=16.4^{*}\)

The resultant displacement is at an angle \(16.4^{*}\) above the horizontal.

**Example 13** (Resultant Velocity): A boat is crossing a river perpendicular to the river bank at a speed of 4.0 m s-1. Water flows parallel to the river bank at 3.0 m s-1. Determine the resultant velocity of the boat (i.e., the velocity relative to an observer on the shore).

Diagram above shows top view of boat crossing river

Diagram above shows vector diagram for velocity of boat, velocity for water flow and resultant velocity of boat

The resultant velocity of the boat can be determined by drawing a vector arrow joining the TAIL of the velocity vector of the boat to the HEAD of the velocity vector of the water flow. We can use Pythagoras theorem to solve for the resultant velocity as the vectors form a right-angle triangle.

Magnitude of resultant velocity = \(\sqrt{(3^{2}+4^{2})}\)= 5 m s-1 Direction of resultant velocity = tan-1 (\(\dfrac{3}{4}\)) = 36.9o Resultant Velocity of the boat is 5 m s-1 at 36.9o clockwise from the direction of boat's velocity.

Which direction should the boat be steered if we want the boat to travel the shortest distance (i.e. in a direction perpendicular to the banks)?

Diagram above shows vector diagram of velocity for boat, water flow and resultant velocity.

The vector diagram is now modified such that the resultant velocity is in a direction perpendicular to the river bank as that is the direction we want the boat to be steered in. We need to find the angle \(\theta\).

\[\sin\theta =\frac{3}{4}\] \[\theta =48.6^{\circ}\]

The boat should be steered in a direction \(48.6^{\circ}\) counter-clockwise from the boat's resultant velocity.

#### 1.5.3 Application of Vector Subtraction

In this subtopic, we consider how to use vector subtraction to determine

1. Change in velocity
2. Relative velocity
3. Finding CHANGE in velocity

If an object moves with an initial velocity and changes its velocity, we can determine the **CHANGE in velocity** of the object. Since velocity is vector, the **CHANGE in velocity** of the object is also a vector.

Therefore, **CHANGE in velocity** can be written, using vector subtraction, as follows:

**Change in velocity = final velocity - initial velocity**

\(\Delta\vec{v}\) = \(\vec{v}_{f}-\vec{v}_{i}\)

where,

\(\Delta\vec{v}\) is the vector representing **change in velocity**,

\(\vec{v}_{i}\) is the vector representing the **final velocity** and

\(\vec{v}_{i}\) is the vector representing the **initial velocity**

**Example 14**

A football approaches a player at 8 m s\({}^{-1}\) in a straight line. After the player kicks the ball, find the **change in velocity** of the football if it is deflected through 90\({}^{o}\) and moves away from the player at 10 m s\({}^{-1}\).

Solution:

Approach to solving the question:

1. Write down the equation: **Change in velocity = final velocity - initial velocity** \(\Delta\vec{v}\) = \(\vec{v}_{t}-\vec{v}_{i}\)
2. Convert the equation so that a vector addition can be done: \(\Delta\vec{v}\) = \(\vec{v}_{t}+\left(-\vec{v}_{i}\right)\) Recall that putting a minus in front of \(v_{i}\) reverses its direction.
3. Draw the vector diagram to help in solving. The change in velocity vector is drawn by connecting the TAIL of \(\vec{v}_{t}\) to the HEAD of \(-\vec{v}_{i}\).

* Since the vector diagram is a right angle triangle, use Pythagoras theorem to solve. (If it is not a right angle triangle, use cosine or sine rule to solve.)
* Since change in velocity is a vector quantity, we will need to determine and specify the direction. \(\theta=\tan^{-1}\left(\frac{\theta}{10}\right)=38.7^{0}\)

Change in velocity is 12.8 m s\({}^{-1}\) at 38.7\({}^{\circ}\) clockwise from the final velocity of the incident ball.

## 2 Finding Relative velocity

The velocity of **object B relative to object A** is the velocity which B appears to have, to an observer who is moving with A. Using vector subtraction,

Velocity of **B relative to A**, \(\vec{v}_{\mbox{\tiny BA}}=\vec{v}_{\mbox{\tiny B}}-\vec{v}_{\mbox{\tiny A}}\)

where,

\(\vec{v}_{\mbox{\tiny A}}\) is the vector representing the velocity of object A and

\(\vec{v}_{\mbox{\tiny B}}\) is the vector representing the velocity object B

Similarly, the velocity of **object A relative to object B** is the velocity which A appears to have, to an observer who is moving with B:

Velocity of **A relative to B**, \(\vec{v}_{\mbox{\tiny AB}}=\vec{v}_{\mbox{\tiny A}}-\vec{v}_{\mbox{\tiny B}}\)

**Example 15**:

Object A moves at 4 m s\({}^{-1}\) while object B moves at 1 m s\({}^{-1}\) in the same direction.

a) What is the velocity of A relative to B?

b) What is the velocity of B relative to A?

Solution:

Take direction of A, \(\vec{v}_{\rm A}\), as positive,

a) \(\vec{v}_{\rm AB}=\vec{v}_{\rm A}-\vec{v}_{\rm B}=\vec{v}_{\rm A}+\left(-\vec{v} _{\rm B}\right)=4+\left(-1\right)=3\) m s\({}^{-1}\)

The relative velocity of A with respect to B is 3 m s\({}^{-1}\) along the direction of A.3

b) \(\vec{v}_{\rm BA}=\vec{v}_{\rm B}-\vec{v}_{\rm A}=\vec{v}_{\rm B}+\left(-\vec{v }_{\rm A}\right)=1+\left(-4\right)=-3\) m s\({}^{-1}\)

The relative velocity of B with respect to A is 3 m s\({}^{-1}\) opposite to the direction of A.

#### Vector Resolution & Component vectors

Any vector can be thought of as an addition of two other vectors in different directions.
* _Resolving a vector_ in two dimensions means re-representing the vector by two other vectors at right angles to each other, such that the summation of these two vectors, \(\tilde{\textbf{{v}}}\) and \(\tilde{\textbf{{v}}}\) give the original vector \(\left(\tilde{\textbf{{r}}}=\tilde{\textbf{{v}}}+\tilde{\textbf{{v}}}\right)\).
* Each of the two-dimensional vector is known as a component of \(\tilde{\textbf{{r}}}\). \(\tilde{\textbf{{v}}}\) is the x-component of \(\tilde{\textbf{{r}}}\). \(\tilde{\textbf{{v}}}\) is the y-component of \(\tilde{\textbf{{r}}}\).

Steps in resolving a vector:

1. Choose two _convenient_ perpendicular directions to resolve the vector in. (e.g. x and y directions in the above example).
2. Use trigonometry to obtain the magnitude of the components. In trigonometry:

## Chapter 3 MINPERSITY
