## Introduction

**Uni-cellular** organisms are composed of a single cell, while **multi-cellular** organisms are composed of many cells.

**E.g) Uni-cellular:** _E. coli_**, Amoeba E.g.) Multi-cellular: Plants and Animals In multi-cellular organisms... Cells \(\rightarrow\) Tissues \(\rightarrow\) Organs \(\rightarrow\) System \(\rightarrow\) Organism Multiple cells come together to form tissues. Multiple tissues come together to form organs. Multiple organs form an organ system. An organism comprises of an organ system.

## Introduction

**Prokaryotic and Eukaryotic Cells**

Organisms can be divided into 2 categories, namely,

**prokaryotes** and **eukaryotes**.

**Prokaryotes**

A prokaryotic cell **lacks a true nucleus** and **lacks**

**membrane-bound organelles**.

Genetic material exists as a **circular DNA molecule** that

lies freely in the cytoplasm in a region called the **nucleoid**.

An example of a prokaryote is bacteria.

## Introduction

**Prokaryotic and Eukaryotic Cells**

Organisms can be divided into 2 categories, namely,

**prokaryotes** and **eukaryotes**.

**Eukaryotes**

A eukaryotic cell has a true, membrane-bound nucleus and

**membrane-bound organelles**.

Genetic material exists as DNA molecules that are closely

associated with histone proteins to form chromatin.

Eukaryotic cells are generally larger than prokaryotic cells.

Examples of eukaryotes: all plants, animals, fungi and protists.

## Introduction

## Introduction

Given the small size of cells, the microscope is used to measure the dimensions of a cell and its organelles.

It can also be used to observe organelles and physiological processes.

There are two types of microscopy, namely, light microscopy and electron microscopy.

Cells and their molecules are often measured in micrometers (\(\mu\)m) and nanometers (nm).

The conversions between the units of length are as follow:

\(\bullet\) 1 meter (m) = 1000 millimeters (mm)

\(\bullet\) 1 mm (10\({}^{\text{-}}\)3 m) = 1000 micrometers (\(\mu\)m)

\(\bullet\) 1 \(\mu\)m (10\({}^{\text{-}}\)6 m) = 1000 nanometers (nm)

**Cellular Structures and Functions**

**a) Nucleus - contains the genetic material of the organism in the form of DNA. Structurally, the nucleus comprises: nuclear envelope with nuclear pores, nucleoplasm, chromatin and nucleolus.**

**b) Cytoplasm - semi-fluid mixture of cytosol and organelles. The cytosol is the aqueous solution of ions and organic molecules/compounds, excluding organelles.**

**c) Ribosomes - non-membrane bound organelles that comprise of a large subunit and a small subunit. One subunit is made up of rRNA and ribosomal proteins. They are 705 ribosomes in prokaryotes and 805 ribosomes in eukaryotes.**

**a) Ribosomes function as the main site of protein synthesis, where they translate messenger RNA (mRNA) into a polypeptide chain.**

## Cellular Structures and Functions

### Endomembrane System

#### Endoplasmic Reticulum - an interconnected network of tubules, vesicles and sacs.

Rough Endoplasmic Reticulum (rER) - consists of a three-dimensional network of interconnecting flattened membrane-bound sacs called cisternae. It looks rough because of the ribosomes attached to the cytoplasmic side of the ER membranes.

The rER functions in folding polypeptides into their native three-dimensional conformations (i.e., proteins), transporting proteins and chemical modification of proteins (e.g., glycosylation)

Smooth Endoplasmic Reticulum (sER) - consists of a three-dimensional network of interconnecting membrane-bound tubules called cisternae. It has a more tubular structure than the rER and has no ribosomes attached to the outer surface, hence giving it a smoother shape.

The sER functions in synthesizing lipids, detoxification, calcium storage and carbohydrate metabolism.

## 6 Cellular Structures and Functions

### Endomembrane System

Golgi Apparatus (GA) - consists of one or several stacks of flattened, curved membrane-bound sacs called cisternae.

New cisternae are constantly formed at the _cis_ (receiving) _face_ by fusing with transport vesicles from the _r_ER and _s_ER, while _Golgi vesicles_ bud off from the _trans_ (secreting) _face_.

The GA functions in _chemical modification of proteins and lipids_ from the _r_ER and _s_ER (e.g., _glycosylation_ and _phosphorylation_), _temporary storage and packaging of proteins_ from the _r_ER and _formation of lysosomes_.

In other words, the GA functions primarily for _chemically modifying, sorting_, and _packaging_ cellular macromolecules for cell secretion or use within the cell.

## 5 Cellular Structures and Functions

### Endomembrane System

**Vesicles** - are tiny sacs bound by a single membrane, formed when a small piece/area of a membrane buds/pinches off while enclosing a substance. Vesicles are formed when they bud/pinch off from the rER, sER and GA. They function to transport substances from one membrane compartment to another. Vesicles play a key role in endocytosis.

**Lysosomes** - are small, spherical vesicles containing hydrolytic enzymes found in eukaryotic cells. These enzymes include proteases, nucleases, lipases and acid phosphatases. The internal environment of the lysosome is often acidic, providing the optimal pH for the enzymes to function. (_Recall: Lysosomes are absent in plant cells_)

Lysosomes function in digestion of food/foreign.particles during the process of phagocytosis, the removal of unwanted or damaged organelles in the process of autophagy.

### Cellular Structures and Functions

* are cylindrical/rod-shaped organelles, bound by a double-membrane where the _inner membrane is extensively folded to form cristae_. This extensive folding _increases the surface area_ of the inner membrane, allowing for many proteins and enzymes to be embedded, such as: _electron carriers_ and stalked particles containing _ATP synthase_. The inner and outer membranes are separated by an intermembrane space, and the semi-fluid mitochondrial matrix contains _circular DNA_, _705 ribosomes_, _Krebs cycle enzymes_, _givcogen granules_.
* The primary role of the mitochondrion is to function as the _site of cellular respiration_, where _glucose is metabolized_ to _synthesize adenosine triphosphate (ATP)_. ATP is the main _energy_ source of cellular processes.
* are cylindrical organelles bound by a double-membrane, where the _inner membrane gives rise to thylakoids and lamellae_. Thylakoids are stacked to form _grana_ (consisting of multiple _granum_), and extensive folding of thylakoids _increases the surface area_ for proteins and enzymes to be embedded, such as: _electron carriers_ and stalked particles containing _ATP synthase_. The interior of the chloroplast is filled with a gel-like matrix called the _stroma_, which contains circular _DNA_, _705 ribosomes_, _Calvin cycle enzymes_, and _starch grains_.
* The primary tole of the chloroplast is to function as the site of _photosynthesis_, where light energy trapped by pigments is used to synthesize organic compounds such as sugars from carbon dioxide and water.

**Cellular Structures and Functions**

What do you think are the similarities between mitochondria and chloroplasts?

1. Both are bounded by a double.

2. Both contain and embedded in the inner membrane.

3. They contain ribosomes.

4. They contain single, DNA.

5. They can divide by the process of.

**Cellular Structures and Functions**

* are pairs of rod-like structures.** positioned at right angles to each other. They are composed of nine sets of triplet microtubules arranged in a ring. Centrioles function during animal **cell division** where they **replicate and migrate to opposite poles** of the cell to **organize microtubules into spindle fibers**. This helps to align the chromosomes during metaphase and **pull** the chromosomes apart during anaphase.

## Cellular Structures and Functions

* a network of fibers extending throughout the cytoplasm that organizes the structures and activities within the cell. The 3 main types of fiber that make up the cytoskeleton are: microtubules, microfilaments and intermediate filaments.
* are the thickest class of cytoskeletal fibers that are made up of a helically arranged globular protein (tubulin). They are able to resist compression, have a certain degree of stiffness and can lengthen or shorten by polymerization and depolymerization of tubulin. * They function in the movement of chromosomes during cell division. They also function in the movement of organelles within the cell, whereby motor proteins carry organelles along microtubules to their destination (E.g., Vesicle movement). Finally, microtubules provide mechanical support and maintains the shape of the cell.
* are the thinnest class of the cytoskeletal fibers, made up of solid rods of globular protein called actin. * They are involved in cleavage furrow formation during cell division, play a role in cell motility and helps to maintain and change cell shape.

## Cellular Structures and Functions

* **Plant Cell Wall -** is a structure that comprises cellulose microfibrils that run through a matrix of complex polysaccharides, pectins and hemicellulose.
* The cell wall's primary function is to **provide mechanical strength and support** for the individual plant cells, and hence the plant as a whole. It **maintains the shape of plant cells** due to its high tensile strength**. Furthermore, the cell wall is **highly rigid** and **resistant to expansion**. This causes the development of **turbidity** when water enters the cell via osmosis.

Cell Membrane
* **Cell membranes** refer to the membranes outlining the surface of all living cells and membrane-bound organelles in eukaryotic cells. Some examples of such organelles are the endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, nucleus, mitochondria and chloroplasts.
* The main components of a cell membrane are **phospholipids, proteins, glycoproteins, glycolipids and cholesterol.** Different membranes have different compositions of lipids and proteins, depending on the membrane's function.
* The **fluid mosaic model** is used to describe the cell membrane.
* **Fluid** refers to how the **phospholipids and proteins** comprising the membrane can **move freely** (laterally) within the bilayer.
* **Mosaic** refers to how **protein molecules are embedded and scattered** among the phospholipids. Some proteins are for example, channel proteins, receptors, enzymes and glycoproteins.

**Cell Membrane**

* amphipathic, consisting of a hydrophilic phosphate group and 2 hydrophobic fatty acid tails.**
* **Membrane proteins can be divided into extrinsic or intrinsic proteins. Extrinsic proteins are further divided into either internal or external, while intrinsic proteins are divided into unilateral or transmembrane.**

**Cell Membrane**

* There are a variety of membrane proteins each with their own functions such as:
* Transport proteins: e.g. Channel proteins and carrier proteins. Enzymes
* Receptor proteins for signal transduction
* Glycoprotein and glycolipids refer to proteins and lipids with addition of short carbohydrate chains. They primarily function for cell-cell recognition, cell-cell adhesion and can also serve as receptor sites.
* Cholesterol is a class of sterols found in the membranes of animal cells. It is interspersed across the bilayer and prevents the close packing of phospholipids. It functions to regulate fluidity of the cell membrane, maintains mechanical stability and prevents leakage of small polar molecules.

Transport

* Transport of substances across membranes is an important process that occurs in cells.
* This allows the cell to: Obtain nutrients Maintain optimal pH Secret products Exrete metabolic waste Generate an ionic gradient
* are non-polar molecules and do not favor interaction with water molecules. For instance, small hydrophobic non-polar molecules such as oxygen can dissolve in the hydrophobic fatty acid tails of the phospholipid bilayer, hence passing through the membrane,
* can be polar molecules or charged ions. Small polar substances such as water molecules can pass through the gaps between phospholipids. Large polar substances such as glucose require help from transport proteins as they cannot pass through the membrane easily. Charged ions also require help from transport proteins.
Transport

* There are 3 main modes of transport.
* the movement of substances down a concentration gradient without the use of ATP.
* the net movement of molecules down a concentration gradient until a dynamic equilibrium is reached.
* the net movement of molecules down a concentration gradient with the help of specific transport proteins until a dynamic equilibrium is reached.
* the net movement of water molecules down a water potential gradient until dynamic equilibrium is reached.
* the movement of substances against a concentration gradient, using energy in the form of ATP.
