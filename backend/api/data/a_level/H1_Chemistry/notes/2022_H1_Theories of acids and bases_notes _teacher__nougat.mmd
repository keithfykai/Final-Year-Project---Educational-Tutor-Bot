**Candidates should be able to:**

* Explain qualitatively the differences in behavior between strong and weak acids and bases in terms of the extent of dissociation.

### Strength of Acids and Bases

**Strong acid completely dissociates in water.**

_E.g.:_ **HC\(I\) (g) + aq + **HC\(I\)**(aq) Most mineral acids are strong acids. E.g.: HI, HBr, H\({}_{2}\)SO\({}_{4}\), HNO\({}_{3}\) etc. represents complete dissociation**

**Weak acid partially dissociates in water.**

_E.g.:_ **CH\({}_{3}\)COOH (\(I\)) + aq + **CH\({}_{3}\)COO\({}^{\prime}\)**(aq) + **H\({}^{\prime}\)**(aq) Most organic acids are weak acids. E.g.: CH\({}_{3}\)COOH, H\({}_{2}\)CO\({}_{3}\), HCN etc. = means an equilibrium is established between the undissociated molecules and the dissociated ions.**

**Strong base completely dissociates in water.**

_E.g.:_ **NaOH(s) + aq + Na\({}^{+}\)(aq) + OH\({}^{\prime}\)(aq) Examples of strong bases are NaOH, KOH, Ba(OH)\({}_{2}\) etc.**

**Weak base partially dissociates in water.**

_E.g.:_ **NH\({}_{3}\) + H\({}_{2}\)O + NH\({}_{4}\)\({}^{+}\)(aq) Examples of weak bases are NH\({}_{3}\), CH\({}_{3}\)NH\({}_{2}\), Na\({}_{2}\)CO\({}_{3}\) etc.**

**Which is a stronger acid, 0.0001 mol dm\({}^{-3}\)HC\(I\) or 1 mol dm\({}^{-3}\)CH\({}_{3}\)COOH?**

**HC\(I\) is a strong acid, regardless of its concentration.**

**CH\({}_{3}\)COOH is a weak acid, regardless of its concentration. It only partially dissociates in water Strength of acid \(\neq\) Concentration of acid**

**Candidates should be able to:**

explain pH and apply them in calculations

### The pH scale

Concentration of H+ can be used as a measure of acidity and alkalinity of a solution.

However, [H+] can be very small values. Hence, we can express these values as pH.

**pH = - log10 [H+]** or [H+] = 10-PH [H+] in mol dm-3

A solution with low pH has a high [H+], and is more acidic than a solution with higher pH.

Similarly,

**pOH = - log10 [OH+]**

_Note: The logarithm used are to the base 10 (not to the base e), so make sure when doing calculations, you press the log or lg button on your calculator (not the ln button)_

### Basicity of acid

* HC_l_ and CH_3COOH are monoprotic (monobasic) acids as each acid can only lose one H+.
* H2SO4 is a **diprotic** (dibasic) acid as it can lose two H+.
* H3O* + HSO4 conjugate base
* H3O* + SO42
- conjugate base
* Conversely for bases, NaOH is a monoacidic base and Ca(OH)2 is a diacidic base.

**Candidates should be able to:**

* explain \(K_{\rm w}\) and apply them in calculations
* calculate [H+(aq)] and pH values for strong acids and strong bases

## 2 Autoionisation of water

Water dissociates very slightly to give ions.

When [H+] = [OH+], the solution is neutral.

When [H+] > [OH+], the solution is acidic.

When [H+] < [OH+], the solution is alkaline.

We name the equilibrium constant for the autoionisation of water as ionic product of water, \(K_{w}\).

\begin{tabular}{|c c|} \hline \(K_{w}\) & = [H\({}^{+}\)] [OH\({}^{-}\)] \\ \hline _Note: [H\({}_{2}\)O] is not reflected in \(K_{w}\)_ \\ \end{tabular}

\begin{tabular}{|c c|} \hline \(\mathrm{pK}_{w}\) = - \(log_{10}K_{w}\) = - \(log_{10}\) ([H\({}^{+}\)] [OH\({}^{+}\)] ) \\ \(=\) - \(log_{10}\) (H\({}^{+}\)] - \(log_{10}\) [OH\({}^{+}\)] \\ \(\mathrm{pK}_{w}\) = \(\mathrm{pH}\) + \(\mathrm{pOH}\) \\ \hline \end{tabular}

_Note: Derivation of \(pK_{w}\)is not required_

\begin{tabular}{|c c|} \hline \(K_{w}\) & = 1.00 x 10\({}^{-14}\) mol\({}^{2}\) dm\({}^{-6}\) \\ \hline \(\mathrm{pK}_{w}\) = 14 \\ \(\mathrm{pK}_{w}\) = pH + \(\mathrm{pOH}\) \\ \(\mathrm{14}\) = pH + \(\mathrm{pOH}\) \\ \hline \end{tabular}

_Note: Derivation of \(pK_{w}\)is not required_

In pure water at 25\({}^{\circ}\)C,

\begin{tabular}{|c c|} \hline \(H_{2}\)O(\(l\)) & H\({}^{+}\)(aq) + OH\({}^{-}\)(aq) \\ \([H^{+}]\) = [OH\({}^{+}\)] = 1.00 x 10\({}^{-7}\) mol dm\({}^{-3}\) \\ pH = pOH = - \(lg\) (1.00 x 10\({}^{-7}\)) = 7.0 \\ \end{tabular}

The autoionisation of water molecules is an endothermic process.

\begin{tabular}{|c c|} \hline \(H_{2}\)O(\(l\)) & H\({}^{+}\)(aq) + OH\({}^{-}\)(aq) & \(\Delta\)H \(>\) 0 \\ \(K_{w}\) = \(\frac{\mathrm{\bf{sf}}}{\mathrm{\bf{k}}\mathrm{\bf{i}}}\). When temperature increases, both \(k_{\mathrm{f}}\) and \(k_{\mathrm{b}}\) increases. Since the forward reaction is endothermic and is favoured, \(k_{\mathrm{f}}\) increases more than \(k_{\mathrm{b}}\). Hence, \(K_{w}\)increases when temperature increases.

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|} \hline Temperature / \({}^{\circ}\)C & \(K_{w}\) / mol\({}^{2}\) dm\({}^{-6}\) \\ \hline
20 & 0.68 x 10\({}^{-14}\) \\ \hline

**Exercise 4**

The concentration of OH- ions in a certain household ammonia cleaning solution is 0.0025 mol dm-3. Calculate the pH of the solution.

\begin{tabular}{|c|} \hline
[OH+] = 0.0025 mol dm3 \\ Since [H+] [OH+] = 10 -14 \\

## 3 Dissociation of weak Acids and Bases

### Dissociation constants of acids/bases, \(K_{\text{a}}\)/\(K_{\text{b}}\)

**I. Acid dissociation constant, \(K_{\text{a}}\) for a weak acid**

For a weak monobasic (monoprotic) acid, the dissociation can be represented as follows:

\begin{tabular}{|c|} \hline HA(aq) \(\xrightarrow{\text{H}^{+}(aq)}\) + A-(aq) \\ \end{tabular}

We name the equilibrium constant for the dissociation of an acid its **acid dissociation constant**, \(K_{\text{a}}\).

\begin{tabular}{|c|} \hline
[H+] = 0.0025 mol dm3 \\ Since [H+] [OH+] = 10 -14 \\
[H+] = \(\frac{K_{w}}{[OH^{-}]}\) \\ \(=\frac{10^{-14}}{0.0025}\) \\ \(=\frac{4\times 10^{-12}\,\text{mol dm}^{-3}}{0.0025}\) \\ pH = \(-\) Ig (4 x 10-12) \\ \(=\) 11.4 \\ \hline \end{tabular}

**Candidates should be able to:**

explain the terms \(K_{\text{a}}\); \(K_{\text{b}}\).

**Candidates should be able to:**

* explain the choice of suitable indicators for acid-base titrations, given appropriate data in terms of the strengths of the acids & bases

## 5 INDICATORS

### Indicators for acid-base titrations

Most indicators for acid-base titrations are themselves weak acids or bases that exhibit different colours in their dissociated and undissociated forms.

For example, let the formula of methyl orange be HIn

At equilibrium,

HIn

H+

In-

(undissociated form)

Red

Yellow

At low pH, [H+] is high, the equilibrium position lies to the left.

[HIn] >> [In-],

colour observed: red

At high pH, [H+] is low, the equilibrium position lies to the right.

[In-] >> [HIn]

colour observed: yellow

**End point of titration**

The end point of a titration occurs when the indicator changes colour.

In the case of methyl orange, the end point occurs when it changes colour from red to orange, or yellow to orange, when the initial solution is acidic or basic respectively.

**Choice of indicator**

The choice of an indicator for a particular titration is based on its pH range for colour change (working range), which must coincide with the region of rapid pH change in the titration curve (vertical section of the titration curve). (See titration curve in next section)* [6]**MonoProttic Acid-BASE titration CURVES**

Consider a titration carried out by adding a base/acid from a buret to an acid/base in a conical flask.

The change in pH throughout the titration can be recorded using a pH meter as shown below.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|c|} \hline
**Indicator** & \multicolumn{2}{c|}{**Colour**} & \multicolumn{2}{c|}{**pH range for colour change /**} \\ \cline{2-4}  & **Acid** & **Base** & **working range** \\ \hline Methyl orange & Red & Yellow & \(3.2-4.4\) \\ \hline Screened methyl orange & Violet & Green & \(3.2-4.4\) \\ \hline Bromothymol blue & Yellow & Blue & \(6.0-7.6\) \\ \hline Phenolphthalein & Colourless & Pink & \(8.2-10.0\) \\ \hline Thymolphthalein & Colourless & Blue & \(9.3-10.5\) \\ \hline
**Titration** & **Type of salt formed** & **Indicator** \\ \hline strong acid – strong base & Neutral salt & Any indicator \\ \hline weak acid – strong base & Basic salt & Phenolphthalein \\  & & Thymolthalein \\ \hline strong acid – weak base & Acidic salt & methyl orange \\  & & screened methyl orange \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 5: Some common Acid–base IndicatorsIf the pH is plotted against volume of base added, a titration curve will be obtained. Several possible types of titration curve are obtained.

* **Titration of strong acid against strong base / strong base against strong acid**
* **Titration of weak acid against strong base / strong base against weak acid**
* **Titration of strong acid against weak base / weak base against strong acid**

### Strong Acid - Strong Base titration

Consider a titration of 25.0 cm\({}^{3}\) of 1.00 mol dm\({}^{-3}\) HCl/ with 1.00 mol dm\({}^{-3}\) NaOH.

HCl (aq) + NaOH(aq) Na\(Cl\) (aq) + H\({}_{2}\)O(\(l\))

**Strong acid only**

[H+] = [HC/]\({}_{\rm initial}\)

**Note: NaOH (aq) is in the burette.**

HCl (aq) is in the conical flask.**

The conical flask contains only strong acid.

Eg:

[H+] = [HC/] = 1.00 mol dm\({}^{-3}\)

pH = 0

_When some strong acid is neutralised (before equivalence point)_

pH increases as the acid in the conical flask is gradually neutralised by the added base.

The solution in the conical flask contains remaining strong acid and salt formed. The remaining strong acid determines the pH.

_Eg: When 24.90 cm\({}^{3}\) of 1.00 mol dm\({}^{-3}\) NaOH is added to 25.0 cm\({}^{3}\) of 1.00 mol dm\({}^{-3}\) HCl_

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|} \hline Initial amt / mol & 0.0249 & 0.025 \\ \hline Amt after neutralisation/ mol & 0 & 0.025 - 0.0249 = 0.0001 \\ \hline
[H\({}^{+}\)] = [HC] = [49.97100] & 2.004 x 10\({}^{-3}\) mol dm\({}^{-3}\) \\ pH = 2.70 & & \\ \end{tabular}

_At equivalence point_

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|} \hline \(\diamond\) & The number of moles of base added just neutralise the number of moles of acid present. \\ \(\diamond\) & The solution in the conical flask contains only the neutral salt and water formed. Hence, pH = 7 at 25\({}^{\circ}\)C (from the dissociation of water at 25\({}^{\circ}\)C). \\ \end{tabular}

_When excess strong base is added (after equivalence point)_

All the strong acid in the conical flask has been completely neutralised at equivalence point. As excess strong base is still added, the solution in the conical flask contains excess strong base and the salt previously formed. The excess strong base determines the pH of the solution.

_Eg:_ When 25.10 cm\({}^{3}\) of 1.00 mol dm\({}^{-3}\) NaOH is added to 25.0 cm\({}^{3}\) of 1.00 mol dm\({}^{-3}\) HCl_,

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|} \hline NaOH(aq) & + & HCl (aq) & NaC_I_ (aq) + H\({}_{2}\)O(_I_) \\ \hline Initial amt / mol & 0.0251 & 0.025 \\ \hline Amt after neutralisation/ mol & 0.0251 - 0.025 = 0.0001 & 0 \\ \hline
[OH\({}^{+}\)] = [NaOH] = \(\frac{\textbf{0.0001}}{\textbf{0.0251+0.025}}\) = 1.996 x 10\({}^{-3}\) mol dm\({}^{-3}\) \\ pH = - _lg_ (1.996 x 10\({}^{-3}\)) \\ = 2.699 & \\ pH = 14 - 2.699 & \\ = 11.3 & \\ \end{tabular}

The pH changes rapidly near the equivalence point from pH = 2.70 when 24.90 cm\({}^{3}\) of NaOH was added, to pH = 11.3 when 25.10 cm\({}^{3}\) of NaOH was added.

_Suitable Indicator:_

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|} \hline \(\diamond\) & Any indicator which changes colour within the region of rapid pH change in the titration curve is suitable: methyl orange / screened methyl orange / phenolphthalein / \\ thymolphthalein. & \\ \hline \end{tabular}

The solution in the conical flask contains the basic salt and water formed.

After equivalence point

All the weak acid in the conical flask has been completely neutralised at equivalence point. As excess strong base is still added, the solution in the conical flask contains excess strong base and the salt previously formed. The excess strong base determines the pH of the solution.

pH < 7 - equivalence point

[H\({}^{+}\)] = [HC\(l\)]\({}_{\rm initial}\)

The conical flask contains only strong acid.

Before equivalence pointThe solution in the conical flask contains remaining strong acid and the salt formed. The remaining strong acid determines the pH of the solution.

At equivalence pointThe number of moles of base added just neutralise the number of moles of acid present. The solution in the conical flask contains the acidic salt and water formed.

After equivalence pointAll the acid in the conical flask has been completely neutralised at equivalence point. As excess weak base is still added, the solution in the conical flask contains excess weak base and its conjugate acid from the salt previously formed.

**Suitable Indicator**

## 7 Buffer Solutions

### Definition of buffer

A buffer solution is a solution whose pH remains almost unchanged when a small amount of H\({}^{+}\) or OH\({}^{-}\) is added to it. It maintains the pH by removing the added H\({}^{+}\) or OH\({}^{-}\).

In general there are two types of buffer:

a) _Acidic buffer_ - A solution of a weak acid and its conjugate base

_E.g._ CH\({}_{3}\)COOH and CH\({}_{3}\)COONa

b) _Basic buffer_- A solution of a weak base and its conjugate acid

_E.g_ NH\({}_{3}\) and NH\({}_{4}\)CI_

### Action of a buffer

_a)__Acidic buffer_

Consider a mixture of

CH\({}_{3}\)COOH - weak acid

CH\({}_{3}\)COONa - contains its conjugate base, CH\({}_{3}\)COO-

On adding a small amount of H+

H+ CH\({}_{3}\)COO- CH\({}_{3}\)COOH

The small amount of added H+ is removed by the large amount of CH\({}_{3}\)COO- in the buffer.

On adding small amount of OH-

OH- + CH\({}_{3}\)COOH - CH\({}_{3}\)COO- + H\({}_{2}\)O

The small amount of added OH- is removed by the large amount of CH\({}_{3}\)COOH in the buffer.

Therefore pH remains almost unchanged.

_b)__Basic buffer_

Consider a mixture of

NH\({}_{3}\) - weak base

NH\({}_{4}\)Cl - contains its conjugate acid NH\({}_{4}\)+

On adding a small amount of OH-

OH- + NH\({}_{4}\)+ NH\({}_{3}\) + H\({}_{2}\)O

The small amount of added OH- is removed by the large amount of NH\({}_{4}\)+ in the buffer.

On adding a small amount of H+

H+ + NH\({}_{3}\) NH\({}_{4}\)+

The small amount of added H+ is removed by the large amount of NH\({}_{3}\) in the buffer.

Therefore, pH remains almost unchanged.

### Uses of Buffer Solutions

Buffer solutions are used in situations where it is necessary to maintain pH.

In many biological systems, a change in pH can have a great effect on the functioning of a cell. Therefore, they are usually buffered.

**Blood buffer system of H\({}_{2}\)CO\({}_{3}\) and HCO\({}_{3}\)-**

The pH of human blood must be maintained within a narrow range of \(7.35-7.45\). The buffer in blood consists of a mixture carbonates (HCO\({}_{3}\)-H\({}_{2}\)CO\({}_{3}\)).

The cells in our body produce CO\({}_{2}\) as a product of aerobic respiration. CO\({}_{2}\) dissolves with water in the blood to form carbonic acid, which dissociates partially to give hydrogen carbonate.

H\({}_{2}\)CO\({}_{3}\)\(\xrightarrow{\phantom{\rule{0.0pt}{0.0pt}}}\) HCO\({}_{3}\)- + H\({}^{+}\)

H\({}_{2}\)CO\({}_{3}\)/HCO\({}_{3}\)- forms a buffer system in blood.

When [H\({}^{+}\)] in the blood increases (e.g. from the lactic acid which is produced during exercise), HCO\({}_{3}\)-reacts with H\({}^{+}\), decreasing the [H\({}^{+}\)] and helps keep the pH almost constant.

H\({}^{+}\) + HCO\({}_{3}\)- \(\xrightarrow{\phantom{\rule{0.0pt}{0.0pt}}}\) H\({}_{2}\)CO\({}_{3}\)

When [H\({}^{+}\)] in the blood decreases (e.g: from hyperventilation), the position of equilibrium shifts right, increasing the [H\({}^{+}\)] and helps keep the pH almost constant.

H\({}_{2}\)CO\({}_{3}\) + OH\({}^{-}\) + HCO\({}_{3}\)- + H\({}_{2}\)O

When [OH\({}^{-}\)] in the blood increases, H\({}_{2}\)CO\({}_{3}\)reacts with OH\({}^{-}\), decreasing the [OH\({}^{-}\)] and helps keep the pH almost constant.
