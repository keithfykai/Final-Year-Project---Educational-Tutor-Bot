**Introduction**

The study of physics often begins with _Newtonian Mechanics_ which investigates relationships between force and motion. The study of motion can be divided into two aspects: how objects move **(kinematics)** and why objects move in different ways **(dynamics)**. Models and representations such as motion diagrams, graphs and equations are used to quantify, describe and predict motion. Motion in the real world is rather complex. The study of motion at this level is made simple with the use of assumptions. One valid assumption is to model the moving body as a point with no size where effects such as rotation or change of shape are not considered. It is also appropriate to ignore air resistance in solving most problems.

**Key Questions:**

1. How do we describe the motion of objects?
2. How can the motion of objects be represented, quantified and predicted?
3. How can we tell if an object is moving with a constant acceleration?
4. For an object falling freely in a gravitational field, how would it move?

**Example 2**

The man in Example 1 took 1 hour to move 4.0 km due East to point B, and another 1 hour to move 3.0 km due North to point C.

Determine the man's average speed and average velocity for the entire journey.

Avg speed = 

The average velocity is 2.5 km h-1

in a direction 37\({}^{\circ}\) North of East.

**Example 3**

The man in Example 1 took 1 hour to move 4.0 km due East to point B, and another 1 hour to move 3.0 km due North to point C.

Determine the man's average speed and average velocity for the entire journey.

Avg speed = 

Since velocity is a vector quantity, change in velocity \(\Delta\nu\) is also a vector with a magnitude and a direction. A change in velocity occurs when either the magnitude or the direction changes, or both the magnitude and direction change.

**Example 3**

A particle has an initial horizontal velocity \(\nu_{i}\) of 10 m s-1 towards the right. A short time later, its velocity \(\nu_{i}\) is 15 m s-1 at an angle of 60\({}^{\circ}\) to the horizontal, as shown.

Calculate the change in velocity that has taken place.

\(\Delta\bar{\nu}=\bar{\nu}_{r}-\bar{\nu}_{i}=\bar{\nu}_{r}+(-\bar{\nu}_{i})\)

\((\Delta\nu)^{2}=10^{2}+15^{2}-2(10)(15)\) cos 60\({}^{\circ}\)

\(\Delta\nu=13.2\) m s-1

\(\frac{10}{\sin\theta}=\frac{13.2}{\sin 60}\)\(\beta=41^{\circ}\)

The change in velocity is 13.2 m s-1 at an angle

of 41\({}^{\circ}\) to the left of the final velocity.

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|} \hline
**physical** & **symbol** & **definition** & **nature** & **Sl base unit** \\ \hline displacement & \(s\) & linear distance from a reference point, along a specified direction. & vector & m \\ \hline speed & \(\nu\) & rate of change of distance travelled. & scalar & m s\({}^{-1}\) \\ \hline velocity & \(\nu\) & rate of change of displacement. & vector & m s\({}^{-1}\) \\ \hline acceleration & \(a\) & rate of change of velocity. & vector & m s\({}^{-2}\) \\ \hline \end{tabular}

### Using a and a to represent directions

For 1-D (straight line) motion, directions of displacement, velocity and acceleration can be represented using '+' and '-' signs. The figure below shows the usual sign convention to denote directions.

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|} \hline
**displacement with respect to reference point** \\ \hline + & right & above \\ \hline - & left & below \\ \hline \multicolumn{3}{|c|}{**velocity and acceleration**} \\ \hline + & towards right & upwards \\ \hline - & towards left & downwards \\ \hline \end{tabular}

Note that the sign convention can be reversed. It is valid as long as it is consistently applied within the same context.

### Acceleration vs Acceleration

Deceleration is a term used to describe an object slowing down (speed decreases). It is not the same as negative acceleration as the negative sign denotes direction only. The sign of the acceleration is not sufficient to provide information on whether the object is moving faster or slower. For example, if upwards is taken as positive, a ball then falls with an acceleration of -9.81 m s\({}^{-2}\). The negative sign denotes the downward direction of acceleration, hence the ball speeds up as it falls.

To determine if an object speeds up or slows down, we need to look at both the velocity and acceleration at the same time.

* When an object's velocity and acceleration are in the same direction, the speed of the object increases with time.
* When an object's velocity and acceleration are in the opposite direction, the speed of the object decreases with time. The object is said to be undergoing deceleration.

### Free fall

An object is said to be in free fall if the only force acting on it is the gravitational force of the Earth.

The downward acceleration of a body undergoing free fall is known as _acceleration of free fall, g_, and has a constant value of 9.81 m s\({}^{-2}\). All free-falling objects have this acceleration, independent of their masses and direction of motion.

For a falling object, true free fall only exists in a vacuum where there is no air resistance.

## 2 Graphical Representation of Motion

* _Use graphical methods to represent distance, displacement, speed, velocity and acceleration._
* _Identify and use the physical quantities from the gradients of displacement-time graphs and areas under and gradients of velocity-time graphs, including cases of non-uniform acceleration._

### Displacement-time graph

The motion of a moving object can be represented and analysed using a displacement-time (s-f) graph, which charts the variation of displacement with time.

* Gradient of a \(s\)-f graph = \(\dfrac{\text{d}s}{\text{d}t}\) = velocity at a particular instant

The diagrams below are some common displacement-time graphs:

* A ball placed at the zero mark of a vertical rule is released from rest. A motion sensor records the ball's displacement (with reference to the rule's zeroth mark) and corresponding time. The displacement-time graph is shown below.

* The gradient of the graph increases with time. Since the gradient of a displacement-time graph represents the velocity, the ball's velocity increases with time.
* When \(t=0.3\) s, gradient of tangent = velocity = \(\dfrac{0.72-0.00}{0.40-0.15}\) = 2.9 m s

### Graphical Interpretation of Vector Vector Vector and Instantaneous Vector

For a journey taken from point A to point B,

_Average velocity_ = \(\dfrac{\text{change in displacement}}{\text{time taken}}\)

Mathematically, \(\left\langle\nu\right\rangle=\dfrac{\Delta S}{\Delta t}=\dfrac{S_{2}-S_{1}}{t_{ 2}-t_{1}}\)

Graphically, the average velocity between times \(t_{1}\) and \(t_{2}\) is derived from the gradient of the line joining these two points.

_Instantaneous velocity_ refers to velocity at a particular instant.

Mathematically, \(\nu=\dfrac{dS}{dt}\)

Graphically, it is determined from the gradient of the tangent at that instant.

\(\Rightarrow\) Instantaneous velocity at A = \(\dfrac{y_{A}}{X_{A}}\)

Instantaneous velocity at B = \(\dfrac{y_{B}}{X_{B}}\)

The motion of a moving object can also be represented and analysed using a velocity-time (\(\nu\)-\(\theta\) graph, which charts the variation of velocity with time.

**Example 5**:

A ball is projected vertically upwards with a speed of \(\nu_{o}\). The ball reaches a maximum height and falls down. A motion sensor records the ball's velocity and time, and a velocity-time graph is shown below.

Using the graph,

(a) describe how the ball's acceleration varies with time,

(b) describe how the ball's displacement varies with time,

(c) determine in terms of \(\nu_{o}\) and \(t_{0}\),

(i) the displacement for the whole journey,

(ii) the distance covered for the whole journey.

1. The acceleration, which is represented by the gradient of the velocity-time graph, is constant, directed downward (negative gradient).
2. The displacement increases to a maximum value in time \(\dfrac{t_{0}}{2}\) and then falls back to zero in the same amount of time \(\dfrac{t_{0}}{2}\).
3. (i) displacement = 0 (ii) distance = 2(\dfrac{1}{2})\nu_{o}\bigg{(}\dfrac{t_{0}}{2}\bigg{)}=\dfrac{\nu_{o}t_{0}}{2}\) (total area of the two triangles)

**Example 6**: A toy car is moving along a straight path, and its motion is represented by a velocity-time graph as shown.

(a) Describe the motion of the toy car. (b) Sketch the displacement-time and acceleration-time graphs. (a) For the first 1 s, the car is travelling at a constant velocity of 1 m s\({}^{-1}\). In the next 2 s, it accelerates uniformly with an acceleration of 0.5 m s\({}^{-2}\) to 2 m s\({}^{-1}\). From \(t\) = 3 s to \(t\) = 4 s, it then decelerates uniformly at 2 m s\({}^{-2}\) to rest momentarily. In the last 1 s, it moves in the opposite direction and accelerates at 1 m s\({}^{-2}\) until it reaches a velocity of \(-\)1 m s\({}^{-1}\). (b)

## 6 Derivation of Equations of Motion from Graphs

For kinematics graphs, (1) gradient of velocity-time graph = acceleration \(a\) and (2) area under velocity-time graph = displacement \(s\)

For the velocity-time graph shown,

\[\text{gradient}=a=\frac{\nu-u}{t-0}\] \[\text{area}=s=\frac{1}{2}(\nu+u)t\] \[\text{Hence, }\;a=\frac{\nu-u}{t}\Rightarrow\;\nu=u+at\] \[\;s=\frac{1}{2}(\nu+u)t \tag{2}\]

Substituting (1) into (2) by replacing \(\nu,\;s=ut+\frac{1}{2}at^{2}\) - - (3)

Substituting (1) into (2) by replacing \(t,\;\nu^{2}=u^{2}+2as\) - - (4)

## 7 Stem Covention

Since \(u,\;\nu,\;a\) and \(s\) are vector quantities, their directions must be taken into account when solving problems. Appropriate signs must be assigned to them when using these equations. Once determined, the sign convention must apply for the equation, for all the vectors.

If, say, upward direction is taken to be positive, then

displacement is negative for points below the initial position

velocity of body moving downward is negative

acceleration directed downward is negative

## 8 Example 7

A ball is projected vertically upwards from point O. Taking the upward direction as positive, identify the sign of the displacement \(s\), velocity \(\nu\) and acceleration \(a\), during its flight from O, through A, B, C, D to E. (Ignore air resistance)

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:12]

**Example 9**

A man standing at the edge of a cliff throws a ball vertically upwards with a velocity of 20 m s\({}^{-1}\).

Determine the maximum height above the cliff reached by the ball.

If the cliff is 30 m high, determine

(i) the time taken for the ball to reach the base of the cliff;

(ii) the ball's speed just before it hits the base of the cliff.

Taking upwards as positive:

\(u=20\)\(\nu^{2}=u^{2}+2as\)

\(\nu=0\)\(0=20^{2}+2(-9.81)h\)

\(a=-g=-9.81\)\(h=20.4\) m

\(s=7\)

(b)(i) \(u=20\)\(s=ut+\frac{1}{2}\,a\ell^{2}\)

\(a=-9.81\)\(-30=20t+\frac{1}{2}(-9.81)\ell^{2}\)

\(s=-30\)\(4.905\ell^{2}-20t-30=0\)

\(t=?\)\(t=\frac{20\pm\sqrt{(-20)^{2}-4(4.905)(-30)}}{2(4.905)}=5.24\) s

(ii) \(u=20\)\(\nu^{2}=u^{2}+2as\)OR\(\nu=u+at\)

\(\nu=?\)\(\nu^{2}=20^{2}+2(-9.81)(-30)\)\(\nu=20+(-9.81)(5.24)\)

\(a=-9.81\)\(\nu=\pm 31.4\)\(=-31.4\) m s\({}^{-1}\)

\(s=-30\)\(\nu=-31.4\) m s\({}^{-1}\)

\(t=5.24\)

**Example 10**

A parachuter falls from a hovering helicopter at an altitude of 1.5 km. For the first 10 s, he falls freely, and then he pulls the ripcord. The parachute opens and he falls with an upward acceleration of 20 m s\({}^{-2}\) until the downward speed is 5.0 m s\({}^{-1}\). Thereafter, he falls at a constant velocity. How long does the entire trip take?

The trip may be divided into 3 stages. Taking downward as positive:

\begin{tabular}{l l l} For stage 1 (first 10 s, & \(u_{1}=0\) & s = \(ut+\frac{1}{2}\,a\ell^{2}\) \\ free fall), & \(\nu_{1}=?\) & \(s_{1}=0+\frac{1}{2}(9.81)(10)^{2}=490.5\) m \\  & \(a_{1}=9.81\)\(\nu=u+at\) \\  & \(s_{1}=?\) & \(\nu_{1}=0+(9.81)(10)=98.1\) m s\({}^{-

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:14]

As the object travels down, its velocity and air resistance both increase. However, the air resistance is now acting upwards, opposite to Earth's gravitational pull. This causes the object's velocity to increase at a slower rate than the case without air resistance (smaller acceleration). Hence, as compared to the free fall case, it acquires a lower final velocity.

As compared to its upward motion, the object hence takes a longer time, on its downward motion to return to its starting position, than it took to travel up.

Comparing the s-_t_ and _v-t_ graphs with and without air resistance, we get the following:

### Terminal velocity

If an object falls through a long enough distance, and air resistance is present, the object's velocity will increase until it reaches a maximum velocity known as _terminal velocity_.

As the object falls, its velocity increases. This causes the opposing air resistance to increase. The air resistance increases until it is equal to the object's weight. The resultant force on the object is now zero. Hence the downward acceleration is zero and the object continues to move down with a constant velocity (terminal velocity).

Taking downward to be positive, the following graphs represent motion leading to terminal velocity.

Two Dimensional Motion

_(g) Describe and explain motion due to a uniform velocity in one direction and a uniform acceleration in a perpendicular direction._

## 6 Current Current Flow Detection and Zero Interaction

Below shows the snapshots of three different types of motion:

An example of the third type of motion shown above is projectile motion, where an object moving in air (with no air resistance) has acceleration only in the vertical direction.

Galileo, the first physicist to describe projectile motion accurately, stated that the horizontal and vertical components of the motion can be analysed separately.

Motion along each direction is independent of each other.

## 7 Analysis Procedure Motion

Consider an object projected in air at an angle of \(\theta\) above the horizontal. The path traced out by the object is parabolic in shape, as shown below:

The initial velocity \(u\) can be resolved into 2 perpendicular components.

The horizontal component is \(u_{k}=u\cos\,\theta\)and the vertical component is \(u_{y}=u\sin\,\theta\).

Assume that air resistance is ignored,

* there is no horizontal acceleration and therefore horizontal velocity \(u_{x}\)is constant;
* vertical acceleration is due to gravity only (\(\alpha_{y}=g\) or \(\alpha_{y}=-g\)), therefore vertical motion is uniformly accelerated;
* the equations of motion can be applied to solve for the quantities in the \(x\) (horizontal) and \(y\) (vertical) directions;
* time \(t\) is the same for both \(x\), \(y\) components.

Example of a second-by-second exposure of an object projected at an angle to the horizontal is shown below. Assume \(g=10\) m s\({}^{-2}\).

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|} \hline missing & general equations & equations for projectile motion: \\ variable & of motion & & \\ \cline{2-4}  & horizontal component & vertical component \\  & \(\left(\alpha_{x}=0\right)\) & \(\left(\alpha_{y}\neq 0\right)\) \\ \hline s & \(\nu=u+at\) & \(\nu_{x}=u_{x}\) & \(\nu_{y}=u_{y}+\alpha_{y}t\) \\ \hline \(\nu\) & \(s=ut+\dfrac{1}{2}at^{2}\) & s\({}_{x}=u_{x}t\) & s\({}_{y}=u_{y}t+\dfrac{1}{2}\alpha_{y}t^{2}\) \\ \hline \(a\) & \(s=\left(\dfrac{u+\nu}{2}\right)t\) & s\({}_{x}=u_{x}t\) & s\({}_{y}=\left(\dfrac{u_{y}+\nu_{y}}{2}\right)t\) \\ \hline \(t\) & \(\nu^{2}=u^{2}+2as\) & \(\nu_{x}=u_{x}\) & \({\nu_{y}}^{2}={u_{y}}^{2}+2\alpha_{y}s_{y}\) \\ \hline \end{tabular} The final velocity \(\nu\) (at any point along the path) is determined by recombining \(\nu_{x}\) and \(\nu_{y}\);

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|} \hline \(\nu^{2}={\nu_{x}}^{2}+{\nu_{y}}^{2}\) \\ \(\tan\alpha=\dfrac{\nu_{y}}{\nu_{x}}\) \\ \hline \end{tabular} The object's velocity is \(\nu\), at an angle of \(\alpha\) below the horizontal.

The direction of the velocity vector \(\nu\) is the tangent to the path at the point.
