## 1 Introduction

### The d-block elements

* These elements have atoms in which either the **inner 3d**, 4d**, 5d or 6d subshells are being filled up. Their atoms are characterised by 'inner building' of d subshells.
* We will focus on the first row of the **d-block elements**.
* The 3d row contains **ten elements**, because the **3d subshell** contains **five orbitals**, each able to accommodate up to two electrons. These elements involve the filling of the 3d orbitals.
* They are all metals and tend to be hard metals compared with the s-block metals.

### Ionisation Energies

The first ionisation energies of the transition elements from Ti to Cu is **almost constant /** relatively invariant.

The graph below shows the variation of 1st ionisation energies (IE) from Ti to Cu.

First IE of transition elements is almost constant / relatively invariant. This is because

The electron being removed comes from the **4s orbital**.

Across a period, **proton number increases** and thus **nuclear charge increases**.

As electrons are added to the 3d subshell, the increase in the number of **inner 3d electrons provide more shielding** between the nucleus and the outer 4s electrons.

This **increase in shielding effect offsets the increase in nuclear charge** considerably.

Hence, the electrostatic attraction between the nucleus and outer 4s electrons **increases minimally**.

Thus, energy required to remove the first electron is **almost constant / relatively invariant.**

### Melting Points and Boiling Points

**Comparing s-block and transition elements, the melting point of transition elements are generally higher than the s-block elements in the same period.**

**Reason:**

The valence 3d and 4s electrons are close in energy (see Atomic Structure notes).

Thus, both **3d and 4s electrons are available for delocalisation** into the sea of electrons.

With a greater number of delocalised electrons and higher charge density of the cations, the metallic bonding is stronger in the transition elements.

**Explain why the melting point of Ti is higher than that of Ca.**

Both Ti and Ca are metals. Ti is a transition element and both its 3d and 4s electrons are available for delocalisation into the sea of electrons since the 3d and 4s electrons are close in energy. With a greater number of delocalised electrons and higher charge density of the titanium cations, Ti has stronger metallic bonding than Ca, which requires more energy to overcome.

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|} \hline Element & Ca & Sc & Ti & V & Cr & Mn & Fe & Co & Ni & Cu \\ \hline Density /g cm\({}^{-3}\) & 1.54 & 2.99 & 4.50 & 5.96 & 7.20 & 7.20 & 7.86 & 8.90 & 8.90 & 8.92 \\ \hline \end{tabular}

**Comparing s-block and transition elements**, the transition elements are generally **much denser** than the s-block elements in the same period.

Transition elements have

smaller atomic size/radius (see _Data Bookle_) and thus have more atoms per unit volume.

larger atomic mass

compared to s-block elements. Hence, transition elements have greater mass per unit volume (i.e. higher density) compared to s-block elements

**Comparing transition elements** from Ti to Cu, there is a gradual increase in density.

* The almost constant atomic radius, coupled with increasing relative atomic mass, accounts for most of this trend.

## 3 CHARACTERISTIC CHEMICAL PROPERTIES

Some important characteristic chemical properties of transition elements are listed below and contrasted against those of s-block elements.

1. **The transition elements form compounds in which the transition element shows a variety of oxidation states.** Examples: +2 +3 +6 FeCl\({}_{2}\) FeCl\({}_{3}\) K\({}_{2}\)FeO\({}_{4}\)
2. **The transition elements form coloured compounds and ions.** Examples: [CuCl\({}_{4}\)]\({}^{2-}\)(aq) yellow [Cu(NH\({}_{3}\))\({}_{4}\)]\({}^{2+}\)(aq) dark blue [Cr(f\({}_{2}\)O)\({}_{6}\)]\({}^{3+}\)(aq) green [Cr(OH)\({}_{6}\)]\({}^{3-}\)(aq) dark green [Cu(H\({}_{2}\)O)\({}_{6}\)]\({}^{2+}\)(aq) blue [Fe(SCN)(H\({}_{2}\)O)\({}_{5}\)]\({}^{2+}\)(aq) blood-red
3. **The transition elements and their compounds often show catalytic activity.** Examples: [Fe/Fe\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{3}\) N\({}_{2}\)(g) + 3H\({}_{2}\)(g) -2NH\({}_{3}\)(g)
4. **The transition elements show a great tendency to form stable complexes.** Examples: [Fe(CN)\({}_{6}\)]\({}^{3-}\)(aq), [Cr(OH)\({}_{6}\)]\({}^{3-}\)(aq), [CuCl\({}_{4}\)]\({}^{2-}\)(aq), [Fe(SCN)(H\({}_{2}\)O)\({}_{5}\)]\({}^{2+}\)(aq)
5. **The s-block elements form compounds in which they exist in a fixed oxidation state.** Examples: +1 +1 +1 KCl \({}_{2}\)SO\({}_{4}\)
6. **The s-block elements form compounds that are usually white in the solid state and colourless in aqueous solution.** Examples: CaSO\({}_{4}\)(s) white CaCl\({}_{2}\)(aq) colourless
7. **The s-block elements and their compounds show little or no catalytic activity.**
8. **The s-block elements show much less tendency to form stable complexes.** Examples: [Be(OH)\({}_{4}\)]\({}^{2-}\)(aq), [Ca(edta)]\({}^{2-}\)(aq)

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:7]

* **Highest possible oxidation state** An observation can be made that **in general**, highest possible oxidation state = No. of unpaired d-electrons + 4s electrons Example: Co: [Ar] [1] [1] [1] [1] [1] [1] No. of unpaired d-electrons = 3, No. of 4s electrons = 2 Maximum oxidation state of Co = 3 + 2 = +5

**Some generalisations**

1. From Sc to Mn, the number of available oxidation states for the element increases. The value of the highest oxidation number for Sc to Mn suggests that in each element all the available 3d and 4s electrons may be used for bonding.
2. From Mn to Zn, there is a decrease in the number of oxidation states exhibited by the elements.
3. The common oxidation states for each element include +2 or +3 or both.
4. Oxides of elements in low oxidation states tend to be basic as they are ionic while oxides of elements in high oxidation states tend to be acidic as they are covalent. Using compounds of manganese as an example, 

### Redox systems involving transition metal ions

1. The relative stabilities of different oxidation states are best understood in terms of standard electrode potentials. 

A more positive value position of equilibrium position lies more to the right, i.e. the +2 oxidation state is favoured over the +3 oxidation state.

1. Going across the transition elements, there is a **general** increase in \(E^{\oplus}\) value. 2. There is a decrease in \(E^{\oplus}\) from Mn\({}^{3+}\)/Mn\({}^{2+}\) to Fe\({}^{3+}\)/Fe\({}^{2+}\). 2. Addition of an electron to Fe\({}^{3+}\) results in a 3d\({}^{6}\) configuration, where there is inter-electronic repulsion between the paired electrons in the same 3d orbital. Thus, reduction of Fe\({}^{3+}\) to Fe\({}^{2+}\) is less favoured.

2. Aqueous KMnO\({}_{4}\) acidified with dilute H\({}_{2}\)SO\({}_{4}\) and aqueous K\({}_{2}\)Cr\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{7}\) acidified with dilute H\({}_{2}\)SO\({}_{4}\) are common oxidising agents used in laboratories.

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|} \hline MnO\({}^{-}\) + 8H\({}^{+}\) + 5e\({}^{-}\) & \(\rightleftharpoons\) & Mn\({}^{2+}\) + 4H\({}_{2}\)O & \(E^{\nu}\) = +1.52 V \\ purple & & very light pink & & \\  & / colourless & & \\ Cr\({}_{2}\)O\({}^{2-}\) + 14H\({}^{+}\) + 6e\({}^{-}\) & \(\rightleftharpoons\) & 2Cr\({}^{3+}\) + 7H\({}_{2}\)O & \(E^{\nu}\) = +1.33 V \\ orange & & green & & \\ \hline \end{tabular}

## 5 CATALYTIC ACTIVITY

* Transition elements, both in the elemental form and in their compounds, are effective and important catalysts.
* **What is a catalyst?** A catalyst is a substance which increases the rate of a reaction without itself undergoing any permanent change.
* **How does a catalyst increase the rate of a reaction?** A catalyst increases the rate of a reaction by providing an alternative pathway for the reaction, one with a lower activation energy than that of the uncatalysed reaction. Consequently more reactant particles have energy greater than or equal to the activation energy, leading to a higher effective collision frequency and hence a faster reaction rate. A lower activation energy also results in a larger rate constant, k, and hence a faster reaction.
* **What are the two types of catalysis?**

1. heterogeneous catalysis - catalyst and the reactants are in different physical phases
2. homogeneous catalysis - catalyst and the reactants are in the same phase
* Transition elements and their compounds are useful in both heterogeneous catalysis and homogeneous catalysis.

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|} \hline Transition element & & & \\ or their compounds & & Reaction catalysed & Type of catalysis \\ used as catalyst. & & & \\ \hline \(\forall_{2}\)O\({}_{5}\) & 2SO\({}_{2}\)(g) + O\({}_{2}\)(g) \(\longrightarrow\) 2SO\({}_{3}\)(g) & Contact process & Heterogeneous \\ \hline MnO\({}_{2}\) & 2H\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{2}\)(aq) \(\longrightarrow\) 2H\({}_{2}\)O(\(l\)) + O\({}_{2}\)(g) & - & Heterogeneous \\ \hline Fe/Fe\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{3}\) & N\({}_{2}\)(g) + 3H\({}_{2}\)(g) \(\longrightarrow\) 2NH\({}_{3}\)(g) & Haber process & Heterogeneous \\ \hline Ni & & Hardening of vegetable & \\  & & oils (e.g. manufacture of & Heterogeneous \\  & & margarine) & \\ \hline FeCl\({}_{3}\) & C\({}_{6}\)H\({}_{6}\) + Cl\({}_{2}\) \(\longrightarrow\) C\({}_{6}\)H\({}_{5}\)Cl + HCl & Electrophilic substitution & \\  & & of benzene & Homogeneous \\ \hline Mn\({}^{2+}\) & 2MnO\({}_{4}\) + 5C\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{4}\)\({}^{2-}\)+16H\({}^{+}\) & An example of & \\  & \(\longrightarrow\) 2Mn\({}^{2+}\) + 10CO\({}_{2}\) + 8H\({}_{2}\)O & autocatalysis & Homogeneous \\ \hline \end{tabular}

### Heterogeneous Catalysis

* In heterogeneous catalysis, the **cataly and the reactants are in different phases**.
* The catalyst is usually in the solid phase and it provides **active sites*
* at which the reaction can take place and the reactants are usually liquids or gases.
* For heterogeneous catalysis to occur, the reactant molecules need to be readily adsorbed onto the catalyst surface. Such type of catalysis is a surface effect which involves the formation of weak attractive forces between reactant molecules and the atoms of the surface of the catalyst.
* **What are the important features of first row transition elements (and their compounds) that enable them to function effectively as heterogeneous catalysts?*
* The availability of **a partially filled 3d subshell*
* allows for ready exchange of electrons to and from reactant molecules, facilitating the formation of weak bonds with the reactant molecules.
* This is due to the availability of 3d electrons for bond formation with reactant molecules or the availability of low-lying vacant orbitals which can accept electron pairs from the reactant molecules.

## 1 Diffusion

Reactant molecules diffuse towards catalyst surface.

* Reactant molecules become **adsorbed*
* onto the **active sites*
* of the catalyst surface through attractive forces. This adsorption leads to an **increase in reaction rate*
* the **bonds*
* within the reactant molecules are weakened, thereby **reducing the activation energy*
* the reactant molecules are brought into **close contact*
* with **correct orientation*
* for reaction

## 3 Chemical Reaction

This reaction has lower activation energy than the uncatalysed reaction

## 4 Desorption

This is the reverse of adsorption. The product molecule eventually breaks free from the catalyst surface.

## 5 Diffusion

The product molecule diffuses away from the surface. The vacant active sites are now available for adsorbing other reactant molecules.

### Homogeneous Catalysis

* In homogeneous catalysis, the **cataly and the reactants are in the same phase**, either liquid, aqueous or gaseous.
* Consider a reaction A + B \(\longrightarrow\) D catalysed by Ct **Uncatalysed reaction:** A + B \(\longrightarrow\) D
* **Catalysed reaction:** _Step 1_  A + Ct \(\longrightarrow\) Ct' _Step 2_  Ct' + B \(\longrightarrow\) D + Ct _Overall reaction_  A + B \(\longrightarrow\) D
* Typical features of homogeneous catalysis: 1. The catalyst (Ct) takes part in the reaction by being **converted into an intermediate** compound (Ct').
2. The intermediate compound subsequently undergoes reaction to yield the product(s) and the **catalyst is regenerated**.
3. The larger activation energy for the uncatalysed reaction is, in this case, replaced by two smaller activation energies for the catalysed reaction.
* **What are the important features of transition elements which enable them to function effectively as homogeneous catalysts?** 1. Their ability to exist in different oxidation states, and 2. The relative ease of conversion from one oxidation state to another. These features facilitate the formation of, and decomposition of, the intermediate formed from the transition metal ion catalyst and the reactants.
* **Example of homogeneous catalysis*
* The reaction between peroxodisulfate ions and iodide ions **catalysed by Fe\({}^{2+}\) or Fe\({}^{3+}\).*
* 2S\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{8}\)\({}^{2-}\)(aq) + 2I\(\cdot\)(aq) \(\longrightarrow\) 2SO\({}_{4}\)\({}^{2-}\)(aq) + I\({}_{2}\)(aq) **(i) Uncatalysed reaction*
* **S\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{8}\)\({}^{2-}\)(aq) + 2I\(\cdot\)(aq) \(\longrightarrow\) 2SO\({}_{4}\)\({}^{2-}\)(aq) + I\({}_{2}\)(aq)
* Since \(E^{\infty}\)\(=\) 2.01 \(-\) 0.54 \(=\) +1.47 V \(>\) 0 V, the uncatalysed reaction is spontaneous (thermodynamically feasible) under standard conditions.
* However, the uncatalysed reaction involves the collision between negatively charged ions. The electrostatic repulsion between these negatively charged ions causes the reaction to have a **high activation energy** and hence proceeds slowly.

**(ii)** **Reaction catalysed by Fe\({}^{3+}\) or Fe\({}^{2+}\)**

**(iii)** **Exercise 4**

**Q1** - Write equations to show how the reaction is catalysed by **Fe\({}^{3+}\) ion**.

**Step 1:**

\[E^{\infty}{}_{\rm{col}}=\]

**Step 2:**

\[E^{\infty}{}_{\rm{col}}=\]

**The catalysed reaction proceeds via two steps. For each step, E\({}^{\infty}{}_{\rm{col}}\) > 0 V indicating that each step is spontaneous (thermodynamically feasible) under standard conditions.**

**Each step involves a reaction between oppositely charged ions which have a natural tendency to attract each other. This lowers the activation energy and enhances the reaction rate.**

**Q2** - Write equations to show how the reaction is catalysed by **Fe\({}^{2+}\) ion**.

**Step 1:**

\[E^{\infty}{}_{\rm{col}}=\]

**Step 2:**

\[E^{\infty}{}_{\rm{col}}=\]

**In the above given example, it is expected that other couples involving transition metal cations would also act as catalysts, as long as their** \(E^{\infty}\) **values are between 0.54 V and 2.01 V.**

## 6Complexes

###Introduction

**One of the most important chemical properties of transition elements is their ability to form complexes.**

**This ability is** **not confined to the transition elements e.g.** \(A\)**/ forms the complex ion** \([A\)**/(OH)\({}_{4}]^{-}\)**, I forms the tri-iodide complex ion** \({\rm I}_{3}^{-}\) **and Pb forms the complex** \([{\rm PbCl}_{4}]^{2-}\)**.**

* **What is a** **complex?**

**A** **complex contains a** **central metal atom or ion** **linked to one or more surrounding ions or molecules (called ligands) by** **co-ordinate bond (or dative covalent bond)**. If the species carries an overall charge, it is called a** **complex ion**.**

* **What is a** **ligand?**

**A** **ligand** **is an ion or a molecule which contains at least one atom bearing a** **lone pair of electrons** **which can be donated into a** **low-lying vacant orbital of a central metal atom or ion forming a** **co-ordinate bond (or dative covalent bond)**, resulting in the formation of a complex.**

**Examples of ligand:** \({\rm Cl}^{-}\)**,** \({\rm OH}^{-}\)**,** \({\rm H}_{2}\)**,** \({\rm NH}_{3}\)**,** \({\rm CO}\)**,** \({\rm H}_{2}\)**N-CH\({}_{2}\)**CH\({}_{2}\)-NH\({}_{2}\)****

**Based on the definition, ligands act as** **Lewis bases** **and the central metal atom or ion they bond to is a** **Lewis acid**.*** For complexes, the number of bonds formed with the metal ion exceeds the oxidation state of the metal ion. For example, \(\mathrm{CuCl_{2}}\) is not a complex. Oxidation state of Cu is +2 and there are 2 bonds. \([\mathrm{CuCl_{2}}]^{*}\) is a complex. Oxidation state of Cu is +1 and there are 2 bonds.
* A complex species may be neutral, cationic or anionic. 

* The **co-ordination number** of the central metal ion (or atom) is the **total number of co-ordinate bonds** that the central metal ion (or atom) forms with ligands.
* The net charge on the complex ion is the algebraic sum of the charge on the central metal ion and the total charge carried by the ligands. For example, 

* Summary of terms applied to the \([\mathrm{Fe(CN)_{6}}]^{3-}\) complex 

* Salts containing complex ions are known as complex salts (co-ordination compounds).

* Salts containing complex ions are known as complex salts (co-ordination compounds).

### Types of Liands

* Ligands are classified according to the number of co-ordinate bonds that the ligand forms with the central metal atom or ion.

\begin{tabular}{|l|c|} \hline _Type of ligand_ & _Number of co-ordinate bonds which the ligand forms with the central metal ion_ \\ \hline monodentate ligand & 1 \\ \hline polydentate ligand & \textgreater{} 1 \\
1. bidentate ligand & 2 \\
2. tridentate ligand & 3 \\
3. hexadentate ligand & 6 \\ \hline \end{tabular}

* **Monodentate ligands*
* A monodentate (or unidentate) ligand is one which can form **only one co-ordinate bond*
* with a central metal ion (or atom).

Examples of monodentate ligands: C\(l^{-}\), OH\({}^{-}\) CN\({}^{-}\), H\({}_{2}\)O, NH\({}_{3}\), C\(\equiv\)O Examples of complexes with monodentate ligands: [Fe(SCN)(H\({}_{2}\)O)\({}_{5}\)]\({}^{2+}\), [CoC\(l_{4}\)]\({}^{2-}\)
* **Bidentate ligands*
* A bidentate ligand is one which can **form two co-ordinate bonds*
* simultaneously with the central metal ion (or atom).

## 7 Stereochemistry of Complexes

### Shapes of complexes

The shape of the complex ion depends on the coordination number and nature of the metal ion.

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|} \hline
**Co-ordination** & **Shape** & **Examples** & \\ \hline
2 & linear & [Ag(NH\({}_{3}\))\({}_{2}\)]\({}^{+}\) & [H\({}_{3}\)N \(\longrightarrow\) Ag \(\longrightarrow\) NH\({}_{3}\)]\({}^{+}\) \\  & & [CuC\({}_{2}\)]\({}^{-}\) & [Cl \(\longrightarrow\) Cu \(\longrightarrow\) Cl]\({}^{-}\) \\ \hline  & & Ni(CO)\({}_{4}\) & \\  & tetrahedral & [Zn(NH\({}_{3}\))\({}_{4}\)]\({}^{2+}\) & \\  & tetrahedral & [CoC\({}_{4}\)]\({}^{2-}\) & \\  & & [Cu(CN)\({}_{4}\)]\({}^{3-}\) & \\  & & [CuC\({}_{4}\)]\({}^{2-}\) & \\
4 & & & \\  & square planar & [Ni(CN)\({}_{4}\)]\({}^{2-}\) & \\  & & [Cu(NH\({}_{3}\))\({}_{4}\)]\({}^{2+}\) & \\  & & & \\
6 & octahedral & [Fe(CN)\({}_{6}\)]\({}^{3-}\) & \\  & & [Fe(CN)\({}_{6}\)]\({}^{4-}\) & \\  & & [Ni(NH\({}_{3}\))\({}_{6}\)]\({}^{2+}\) & \\ \hline \end{tabular}

**Note:**

[Cu(NH\({}_{3}\))\({}_{4}\)(H\({}_{2}\)O)\({}_{2}\)]\({}^{2+}\) vs [Cu(NH\({}_{3}\))\({}_{4}\)]\({}^{2+}\) : both are commonly used and accepted. However, the shape about Cu\({}^{2+}\) in [Cu(NH\({}_{3}\))\({}_{4}\)(H\({}_{2}\)O)\({}_{2}\)]\({}^{2+}\) is octahedral instead of square planar.

### Isomerism in compounds of transition elements

Compounds of transition elements can undergo isomerism. For example, when green crystals of chromium(III) chloride, [Cr(H\({}_{2}\)O)\({}_{4}\)Cl\({}_{2}\)]Cl\({}_{2}\)]Cl\({}_{2}\)]Cl\({}_{2}\)]H\({}_{2}\)O, are dissolved in water, the following changes occur.

\begin{tabular}{|c c c c c c|} \hline
**Cr(H\({}_{2}\)O)\({}_{4}\)Cl\({}_{2}\)]**Cl\({}_{7}\)**2H\({}_{2}\)O & \(\longrightarrow\) & [Cr(H\({}_{2}\)O)\({}_{5}\)Cl]Cl\({}_{2}\)**+H\({}_{2}\)O & \(\longrightarrow\) & [Cr(H\({}_{2}\)O)\({}_{6}\)]Cl\({}_{3}\) \\  & green & blue-green & violet \\ \hline \end{tabular}

The compounds produce different amounts of free chloride ions and hence can be distinguished by precipitation of the free chloride ion using aqueous silver nitrate.

The complex cations [Cr(H\({}_{2}\)O)\({}_{4}\)Cl\({}_{2}\)]\({}^{+}\), [Cr(H\({}_{2}\)O)\({}_{5}\)Cl]\({}^{2+}\), [Cr(H\({}_{2}\)O)\({}_{6}\)]\({}^{3+}\) are different even though they originate from the same ionic compound: chromium(III) chloride.

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:20]

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:21]

* **What determines the observed colour of a coloured object?** The observed colour is the colour due to the combination of wavelengths of visible light reflected (for opaque objects) or transmitted (for transparent objects).
* **The observed colour is usually estimated using the idea of complementary colours.**

* **Complementary colours** **Each colour has a complementary colour as shown in the table above. A colour wheel can be used to help predict the colour that will be seen when absorption occurs in part of the visible spectrum. Colours directly opposite each other on the colour wheel are called complementary colours.*** **Example: A green object** When white light (containing a broad spectrum of all visible wavelengths) passes through a substance that absorbs red light, the colour observed is green; green is the complement of red.
* The observed colour is said to be **complementary** to the colour of light absorbed. Hence if a compound absorbs light of one colour, we see the complement of that colour.

### Absorption of Light Energy and Electronic Transition

* When light energy is absorbed by a substance, an electron in the atom or ion of that substance is promoted from an orbital of lower energy to one of higher energy.
* The atom or ion absorbing the radiation changes from what is described as its **ground state** to an **excited state**.
* There can be more than one electronic transition. The different electronic transitions involve the absorption of radiation of different wavelengths (or different frequencies) and if **the absorbed wavelengths are in the visible region of the spectrum, then the substance appears coloured.

### Sodium chloride solution

Why is an aqueous solution of sodium chloride colourless?

* Consider the ground state and the excited state of the Na+ ion. (ground state) 1s2 2s2 2p6 1s2 2s2 2p5 3s1
* The excitation of an electron from the lower energy 2p orbital to the higher energy 3s orbital requires wavelength of light well beyond the range of visible spectrum. Radiation from the visible spectrum does not provide sufficient energy to promote electrons in Na+ ions to even the lowest of their possible excited electronic states.

* **Crystal Field Theory** provides a way of determining, by simple electrostatic considerations, how the energies of the metal ion orbitals will be affected by the set of surrounding ligands.
* In an isolated metal ion in the gaseous phase, the five 3d orbitals all have the same energy and are said to be **degenerate**.
* In an octahedral complex, six ligands L approach the central metal ion M **along the x, y and z axes.** This results in electrostatic repulsion between the electrons in the 3d orbitals and the lone pairs on the ligands, and thus an increase in potential energy. Hence the energy of an electron in either of the 3d orbitals in a complex of M is higher than in an isolated M atom.
* **3d\({}_{x}\)\({}^{2}\)-y\({}^{2}\) and 3d\({}_{x}\)\({}^{2}\)**: These orbitals have their greatest electron density **along** the co-ordinate axes on which the ligands are situated. Hence electrons in these orbitals are pointing towards the lone pairs of ligands, and will be **repelled** by them.
* **3d\({}_{xy}\), 3d\({}_{yz}\), 3d\({}_{xz}\)** : These orbitals have their greatest electron density in **between** the co-ordinate axes. Hence the repulsion between electrons in these orbitals and those of the approaching ligands will be **less** compared to electrons in 3d\({}_{x}\)\({}^{2}\)\({}^{2}\) or 3d\({}_{x}\)\({}^{2}\) orbitals.
* Thus, **the five 3d orbitals are affected differently by the approach of the ligands**. The 3d\({}_{x}\)\({}^{2}\)\({}^{2}\) and 3d\({}_{x}\)\({}^{2}\) orbitals experience greater repulsion, causing their orbitals to have a higher energy level than that of the 3d\({}_{xy}\), 3d\({}_{yz}\) and 3d\({}_{xz}\) orbitals. Hence, the orbitals are split into two energy levels with an energy gap between them, and the degeneracy of the five 3d orbitals is destroyed in complexes.

**Worked Example 1**

Using the Cartesian axes, draw and label diagrams to show the d orbitals that the electrons in a transition metal ion might occupy.

(in between \(x\) and \(z\) axes) (in between \(x\) and \(y\) axes) (in between \(y\) and \(z\) axes) (along \(z\) axis) (along \(x\) and \(y\) axes)

(a) The splitting of the five d-orbitals in octahedral complexes

In the presence of the ligands, the five 3d orbitals of the central metal ion are split into two energy levels as illustrated.

* The resulting **small energy gap (i.e. \(\Delta\)E\({}_{\text{o}}\))** between the two sets of d-orbitals turns out to correspond to energies of electromagnetic radiation in the **visible region of the spectrum**.
* Transition metal compounds are therefore coloured because radiation in the visible region of the spectrum is of the right quantity of energy to promote electrons from d-orbitals of lower energy to one of higher energy (i.e. **d-d transitions**). The colour observed is the **complement** of the colour absorbed.

## 8 Why is an aqueous solution of NiCl\({}_{2}\) coloured?

In aqueous solution, Ni\({}^{2+}\) exists as an octahedral complex [Ni(H\({}_{2}\)O)\({}_{6}\)]\({}^{2+}\).

The presence of the H\({}_{2}\)O ligands causes the splitting of the five originally degenerate 3d orbitals in the Ni\({}^{2+}\) ion into two sets of slightly different energy levels.

Since the 3d subshell is partially filled (Ni\({}^{2+}\): [Ar] 3d\({}^{8}\)), the electrons from the lower energy d orbitals can absorb energy corresponding to certain wavelengths from the visible spectrum and get promoted to the higher energy d orbitals.

Such d-d transitions are responsible for the colour observed in NiCl\({}_{2}\)(aq). The colour observed is the complement of the colour absorbed.

\begin{tabular}{|c|l|} \hline \hline \(\bullet\) & presence of ligands causes the \\ S & \(\bullet\) **splitting** of the five 3d orbitals into two sets of slightly different energy levels. \\ P & \(\bullet\) **Since these 3d subshell is partially filled**, \\ E & \(\bullet\) **electrons** from the lower-energy d orbitals can absorb energy corresponding to certain wavelengths from the visible spectrum and get promoted to the higher-energy d orbitals. \\ C & \(\bullet\) **The colour observed** is the complement of the colour absorbed. \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}

### Factors affecting the Colour of Transition Metal Complexes

\(\bullet\) The colour of a transition metal complex is dependent on the energy gap (\(\Delta\)E) between the two groups of d orbitals. This in turn depends on the following factors.

1. **The identity of the metal and its oxidation state (which depends on the number of d electrons present).** [Cr(H\({}_{2}\)O)\({}_{6}\)]\({}^{2+}\)(aq) [Cr(H\({}_{2}\)O)\({}_{6}\)]\({}^{2+}\)(aq) [Fe(H\({}_{2}\)O)\({}_{6}\)]\({}^{3+}\)(aq) [Ar] 3d\({}^{4}\) [Ar] 3d\({}^{3}\) [Ar] 3d\({}^{5}\) [Ar] 3d\({}^{5}\) blue violet pale green [Iiac]

\(\bullet\) Compounds of the same element in different oxidation states show different colours.

[Fe(H\({}_{2}\)O)\({}_{6}\)]\({}^{2+}\) and [Fe(H\({}_{2}\)O)\({}_{6}\)]\({}^{3+}\) have different no. of d-electrons and repel the electrons of the ligands to different extent, thus the energy gap between the split d-orbitals are different.

2. **The nature of the ligands bonded to the central metal ion/atom.** [Ni(H\({}_{2}\)O)\({}_{6}\)]\({}^{2+}\)(aq) green [Cu(H\({}_{2}\)O)\({}_{6}\)]\({}^{2+}\)(aq) blue [Ni(NH\({}_{3}\))\({}_{6}\)]\({}^{2+}\)(aq) blue [Cu(NH\({}_{3}\))\({}_{4}\)(H\({}_{2}\)O)\({}_{2}\)]\({}^{2+}\)(aq) dark blue

\(\bullet\) Different ligands split the d orbitals of the metal ion into two sets of slightly different energy levels to **different extents**. Hence different transition metal complexes **absorb different wavelengths of light** from the visible spectrum for d-d transitions (i.e. the promotion of electrons from the lower energy d orbitals to the higher energy d orbitals).

\(\bullet\) Consequently, different colours, corresponding to the complements of the different colours absorbed, are observed for different complexes.

### Splitting of d-orbitals in Tetrahedral Complexes

* In tetrahedral complexes, the situation is the reverse of that in octahedral complexes. The four ligands in tetrahedral complexes approach the central metal ion **in between** the x, y and z axes.
* Electrons in the 3d\({}_{xy}\), 3d\({}_{yz}\) and 3d\({}_{xz}\) orbitals now experience the greatest electrostatic repulsion from the ligand lone pairs, so have a higher energy than electrons in the 3d\({}_{x}\)-\({}_{y}\)\({}^{2}\) and the 3d\({}_{z}\)\({}^{2}\) orbitals.

## 9 Ligand Exchange

### Stability constant

* An aqueous solution of nickel(II) sulfate contains [Ni(H\({}_{2}\)O)\({}_{6}\)]\({}^{2+}\) ions. When **excess** aqueous ammonia is added to this solution, there is a noticeable change of colour because some of the [Ni(H\({}_{2}\)O)\({}_{6}\)]\({}^{2+}\) ions are converted into [Ni(NH\({}_{3}\))\({}_{6}\)]\({}^{2+}\) ions.
* A **ligand exchange reaction** occurs and the following equilibrium is established: [Ni(H\({}_{2}\)O)\({}_{6}\)]\({}^{2+}\)(aq) + 6NH\({}_{3}\)(aq) \(\rightleftharpoons\) [Ni(NH\({}_{3}\))\({}_{6}\)]\({}^{2+}\)(aq) + 6H\({}_{2}\)O(I) [Ni(H\({}_{

### Ligand exchange in terms of stability constants

The formation of a complex ion can be regarded as a competition between two ligands for the metal ion. In general, the ligands forming the complex of higher stability constant will replace those forming the complex of lower stability constant.

(a) **Complexes of copper(II) with water and ammonia**

\(K_{\text{stab}}\) **of complexes of copper(II)**

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|} \hline complex & [CuCu\(I_{4}\)]\({}^{2-}\) & [Cu(NH\({}_{3}\))\({}_{4}\)(H\({}_{2}\)O)\({}_{2}\)]\({}^{2+}\) & [Cu(edta)]\({}^{2-}\) \\ \hline log \(K_{\text{stab}}\) & 5.6 & 13.1 & 18.8 \\ \hline colour & yellow & dark blue & light blue \\ \hline \end{tabular}

\(\underline{\Omega}\) **Worked Example 2 (N93/2/1a)**

\begin{tabular}{|c|} \hline
**(i)** Describe and explain what happens when dilute aqueous ammonia is gradually added to an aqueous solution containing Cu\({}^{2+}\)(aq). \\ \hline \([\text{Cu(H}_{2}\text{O})_{6}]^{2+}\)(aq) & \(\underbrace{\text{NH}_{3}\text{(aq)}}_{\text{light blue precipitate}}\) & \(\text{Cu(OH)}_{2}\)(s) \\ \hline \end{tabular}

\(\underline{\Omega}\) **Aqueous NH\({}_{3}\) is a weak base which ionises in water to form OH\({}^{-}\) ions.**

\(\text{NH}_{3}\)**(aq) + H\({}_{2}\)**O(I) = NH\({}_{4}\)**(aq) + OH\({}^{-}\)(aq)**

**An aqueous solution containing Cu\({}^{2+}\) ions is blue due to the presence of [Cu(H\({}_{2}\)O)\({}_{6}\)]\({}^{2+}\) ions. When dilute NH\({}_{3}\)(aq) is gradually added, a pale blue precipitate of Cu(OH)\({}_{2}\) is first formed since ionic product of Cu(OH)\({}_{2}\) exceeds the \(K_{\text{sp}}\) of Cu(OH)\({}_{2}\).**

\[[\text{Cu(H}_{2}\text{O})_{6}]^{2+}\text{(aq) + 2OH}\text{-(aq) \rightleftharpoons[\text{Cu(OH)}_{2}(H_{2}\text{O})_{4}](s) + 2H_{2}\text{O(I)}\quad............. \tag{1}\]

**blue solution**

\[\text{or}\qquad\text{Cu}^{2+}\text{(aq)+ 2OH}\text{-(aq) \rightleftharpoons[\text{Cu(OH)}_{2}(s)}\]

**When excess NH\({}_{3}\) is added, a ligand exchange reaction occurs and the following equilibrium is established.**

\[[\text{Cu(H}_{2}\text{O})_{6}]^{2+}\text{(aq) + 4NH}_{3}\text{(aq) \rightleftharpoons[\text{Cu(NH}_{3})_{4}(H_{2}\text{O})_{2}]^{2+}\text{(aq) + 4H_{2}\text{O(I)}\ \..........(2)}\]

**blue solution**

**The equilibrium position of reaction (2) lies very much to the right as the formation of the more stable [Cu(NH\({}_{3}\))\({}_{4}\)(H\({}_{2}\)O)\({}_{2}\)]\({}^{2+}\) ion is favourable.**

**The formation of [Cu(NH\({}_{3}\))\({}_{4}\)(H\({}_{2}\)O)\({}_{2}\)]\({}^{2+}\) ions results in a decrease in the concentration of [Cu(H\({}_{2}\)O)\({}_{6}\)]\({}^{2+}\) and hence decreases the ionic product of Cu(OH)\({}_{2}\) to below its \(K_{\text{sp}}\) value. Hence the pale blue precipitate of Cu(OH)\({}_{2}\) dissolves to give a dark blue solution of [Cu(NH\({}_{3}\))\({}_{4}\)(H\({}_{2}\)O)\({}_{2}\)]\({}^{2+}\).**

**Note:**

**1.**: In this case, there exist two **competing equilibria**, (1) and (2). Both NH\({}_{3}\) and OH\({}^{-}\) compete to combine with Cu\({}^{2+}\)(aq). With a large excess of NH\({}_{3}\) (i.e. higher [NH\({}_{3}\)]), the formation of [Cu(NH\({}_{3}\))\({}_{4}\)(H\({}_{2}\)O)\({}_{2}\)]\({}^{2+}\) is more favourable.

**2.**: The following equation is sometimes used to represent the dissolution of the pale blue precipitate upon the addition of excess aqueous NH\({}_{3}\).

\(\text{Cu(OH)}_{2}\)(s) + 4NH\({}_{3}\)(aq) + 2H\({}_{2}\)O(I) \(\longrightarrow\) [Cu(NH\({}_{3}\))\({}_{4}\)(H\({}_{2}\)O)\({}_{2}\)]\({}^{2+}\)(aq) + 2OH\({}^{-}\)(aq)

**(ii)**: Describe and explain what happens when an aqueous solution of edta is added to the solution in **(i)**.

When aqueous edta is added to a dark blue solution containing the [Cu(NH\({}_{3}\))\({}_{4}\)(H\({}_{2}\)O)\({}_{2}\)]\({}^{2+}\) ions, the colour of the solution lightens considerably as a ligand exchange reaction occurs. The hexadentate edta ligand replaces the NH\({}_{3}\) and H\({}_{2}\)O ligands to form the more stable [Cu(edta)]\({}^{2-}\) ions leading to the formation of a light blue solution. The following equilibrium is established and the equilibrium position lies more to the right.

\([\)Cu(NH\({}_{3}\))\({}_{4}\)(H\({}_{2}\)O)\({}_{2}\)]\({}^{2+}\)(aq) + edta\({}^{4-}\)(aq) = [Cu(edta)]\({}^{2-}\)(aq) + 4NH\({}_{3}\)(aq) + 2H\({}_{2}\)O(_l_)

**(ii)**: Worked Example 3

**J91/4/1bil**: Describe and explain what is seen when concentrated hydrochloric acid is added to a solution of Cu\({}^{2+}\) ions in water.

A solution of Cu\({}^{2+}\) ions in water is blue in colour due to the presence of [Cu(H\({}_{2}\)O)\({}_{6}\)]\({}^{2+}\) ions. A ligand exchange reaction occurs where the Cl\({}^{\prime}\) ligands replace the water ligands in the [Cu(H\({}_{2}\)O)\({}_{6}\)]\({}^{2+}\) ions to form the more stable [CuCl\({}_{4}\)]\({}^{2-}\) ions. The following equilibrium is established:

\([\)Cu(H\({}_{2}\)O)\({}_{6}\)]\({}^{2+}\)(aq) + 4Cl\({}^{\prime}\)(aq) = [CuCl\({}_{4}\)]\({}^{2-}\)(aq) + 6H\({}_{2}\)O(l) blue

The presence of both the blue [Cu(H\({}_{2}\)O)\({}_{6}\)]\({}^{2+}\) ions and yellow [CuCl\({}_{4}\)]\({}^{2-}\) ions results in a green solution.

Addition of more concentrated HC_l_ to the green solution increases the Cl\({}^{\prime}\) concentration, causing the equilibrium position of the above reaction to shift further right. The green solution turns yellow as more yellow [CuCl\({}_{4}\)]\({}^{2-}\) ions are formed.

**(b)**: **Complexes of Ag(l)**:
* One of the fascinating and intriguing demonstrations of different ligands for a particular cation is outlined in the sequence reactions involving Ag\({}^{+}\) shown below.

**Note: Some of the reactions in the sequence result in the precipitation of insoluble solids. Being uncharged, they are less readily hydrated by polar water molecules than the charged complexes and so they are less likely to dissolve in water.**

Going down the table, the ligands are increasing in strength and become stronger competitors for Ag\({}^{+}\): H\({}_{2}\)O < Cl\({}^{\prime}\) < NH\({}_{3}\) < Br\({}^{-}\) < S\(\mathrm{2O_{3}}\)\({}^{2-}\) < \(\Gamma\) < CN\({}^{-}\) < S\({}^{2-}\) < edta\({}^{2-}\).

\(\Box\)**Exercise 7: (J96/IV/22)**

The following table lists some stability constants for the following reaction.

\([M(H_{2}O)_{6}]^{m+}+nL^{-}\rightleftharpoons[M(H_{2}O)_{6-}L_{n}]^{(m-\eta_{+} }+nH_{2}O\) (where \(m\) and \(n\) are whole numbers)

\begin{tabular}{c c c c} \hline \(M^{m+}\) & \(L^{-}\) & \(n\) & \(K_{\text{stab}}\) \\ \hline Fe\({}^{3+}\) & SCN\({}^{-}\) & 1 & \(9\times 10^{2}\) \\ Fe\({}^{3+}\) & CN\({}^{-}\) & 6 & \(1\times 10^{31}\) \\ Co\({}^{3+}\) & CN\({}^{-}\) & 6 & \(1\times 10^{64}\) \\ \hline \end{tabular}

* Rewrite the above equation for the case of \(M^{m+}=\) Fe\({}^{3+}\) and \(L^{-}=\) CN\({}^{-}\). Write the expression for the equilibrium constant, \(K_{\text{stab}}\), and state its units.
* Use the data given in the table to predict what would be the predominant complex formed when

1: a solution containing equal concentrations of both SCN\({}^{-}\) and CN\({}^{-}\) ions was added to a solution containing Fe\({}^{3+}\)(aq) ions;

2: a solution containing equal concentrations for Fe\({}^{3+}\)(aq) and Co\({}^{3+}\)(aq) ions was added to a solution containing CN\({}^{-}\) ions.

[5]

* The body of an adult contains about 4 g of iron, 75% of which is in the form of haemoglobin. This vital oxygen-carrying constituent of the blood contains iron(II).
* red pigment in red blood cells
- acts as a transporter of oxygen in blood
- contains iron(II) which has a co-ordination number of six

Structure:

* The iron(II) exhibits hexa co-ordination.
* Four of the co-ordination sites are taken up by nitrogen from a ring system called a porphyrin which acts as a tetradentate ligand. This complex is called 'haem'.
* Above the plane of this ring is a fifth nitrogen atom, acting as a ligand. This atom is part of a complex protein called globin.
* The oxygen molecule may become **reversibly** bonded at the sixth site allowing the haemoglobin to carry oxygen from one part of the body to another.

Better ligands than oxygen can bond strongly (almost irreversibly) to the iron(II) and thus destroy the oxygen carrying capacity of haemoglobin. This accounts for the toxic nature of carbon monoxide and cyanide ions, both of which are very good ligands.

### Effect of Liqand Exchange on \(E^{\circ}\) values

* Replacement of H\({}_{2}\)O ligands in an aqua-complex by other ligands can cause large changes in electrode potential values.
* **Effect of CN- ligand on the relative stability of Fe(II) and Fe(III)** [Fe(H\({}_{2}\)O)\({}_{6}\)]\({}^{3+}\)(aq) + e\({}^{-}\) = [Fe(H\({}_{2}\)O)\({}_{6}\)]\({}^{2+}\)(aq) \(E^{\circ}\) = +0.77 V [Fe(CN)\({}_{6}\)]\({}^{3-}\)(aq) + e\({}^{-}\) = [Fe(CN)\({}_{6}\)]\({}^{4-}\)(aq) \(E^{\circ}\) = +0.36 V
* Replacing the H\({}_{2}\)O ligand by the CN- ligand causes the \(E^{\circ}\) value for the Fe(III)/Fe(II) system to become less positive i.e. Fe(III) becomes less easily reduced and hence less oxidising.
* Hence there is stabilisation of the +3 oxidation state of iron relative to the +2 oxidation state of iron by the CN- ligand.
* The positively charged [Fe(H\({}_{2}\)O)\({}_{6}\)]\({}^{3+}\) ion accepts an electron more readily since oppositely charged species attract each other naturally. The negatively charged [Fe(CN)\({}_{6}\)]\({}^{3-}\) ion does not accept an electron readily since there is naturally repulsion between similarly charged species.

**How can it be shown experimentally that [Fe(CN)\({}_{6}\)]\({}^{3-}\)(aq) is a weaker oxidising agent than [Fe(H\({}_{2}\)O)\({}_{6}\)]\({}^{3+}\)(aq)?**

By reacting both species with KI(aq). Data: \(\gamma_{\rm{I2}}\)(aq) + e\({}^{-}\) = \(\Gamma\)(aq) \(E^{\circ}\) = +0.54 V

[Fe(H\({}_{2}\)O)\({}_{6}\)]\({}^{3+}\)(aq) + \(\Gamma\)(aq) \(\longrightarrow\) [Fe(H\({}_{2}\)O)\({}_{6}\)]\({}^{2+}\)(aq) + \(\gamma_{\rm{I2}}\)(aq) \(E^{\circ}\)\({}_{\rm{cell}}\) = +0.23 V > 0 V Since \(E^{\circ}\)\({}_{\rm{cell}}\) > 0 V, the reaction is thermodynamically feasible under standard conditions.

**Observation:** Brown solution of I\({}_{2}\)(aq) formed.

[Fe(CN)\({}_{6}\)]\({}^{3-}\)(aq) + \(\Gamma\)(aq) \(\longrightarrow\) [Fe(CN)\({}_{6}\)]\({}^{4-}\)(aq) + \(\gamma_{\rm{I2}}\)(aq) \(E^{\circ}\)\({}_{\rm{cell}}\) = -0.18 V < 0 V Since \(E^{\circ}\)\({}_{\rm{cell}}\) < 0 V, the reaction is thermodynamically not feasible under standard conditions.

**Observation:** Brown solution of I\({}_{2}\)(aq) is not produced.

**(b)** **Effect of NH\({}_{3}\) and CN- ligands on the relative stability of Co(II) and Co(III)**

\begin{tabular}{|c c c|} \hline \([\)Co(H\({}_{2}\)O)\({}_{6}]^{3+}\)(aq) + e\({}^{-}\) = \([\)Co(H\({}_{2}\)O)\({}_{6}]^{2+}\)(aq) & \(E^{\circ}\) = +1.82 V \\ \([\)Co(NH\({}_{3}\))\({}_{6}]^{3+}\)(aq) + e\({}^{-}\) = \([\)Co(NH\({}_{3}\))\({}_{6}]^{2+}\)(aq) & \(E^{\circ}\) = +0.10 V \\ \([\)Co(CN)\({}_{6}]^{3-}\)(aq) + e\({}^{-}\) = \([\)Co(CN)\({}_{6}]^{4-}\)(aq) & \(E^{\circ}\) = -0.80 V \\ \(\ O_{2}+4H^{+}+4e^{-}\) = 2H\({}_{2}\)O & \(E^{\circ}\) = +1.23 V \\ \(\ O_{2}+2H_{2}O+4e^{-}\) = 4OH- & \(E^{\circ}\) = +0.40 V \\ \hline \end{tabular}

* The \(E^{\circ}\) values show that there is stabilisation of Co(III) with respect to Co(II) by the NH\({}_{3}\) and the CN- ligands.
* \([\)Co(H\({}_{2}\)O)\({}_{6}]^{3+}\) ions are so strongly oxidising that they react with water to produce oxygen.
* \([\)Co(NH\({}_{3}\))\(]^{2+}\)(aq) and \([\)Co(CN)\({}_{6}]^{4-}\)(aq) are so strongly reducing that they are oxidised by air.

## Appendix A Appendix

### (I) Rules for Nomenclature of Complexes

The following rules apply to all complexes, whether or not they are derived from transition elements.

* **Formulae of Complexes*
* The symbol for the central atom is written first, followed by anionic ligands and neutral ligands in that order. **Example: [Fe(OH)(H\({}_{2}\)O)\({}_{6}\)]\({}^{2+}\)*
* Within each ligand class, the order should be alphabetical in terms of the symbol for the donor atom of the ligand. **Example: [Cu(NH\({}_{3}\))\({}_{4}\)(H\({}_{2}\)O)\({}_{2}\)]\({}^{2+}\)*
* N is the donor atom in NH\({}_{3}\).
* O is the donor atom in H\({}_{2}\)O.
* Polyatomic ligands, but not monatomic ligands, are enclosed in curved brackets, and the formula of the whole complex is enclosed in square brackets. **Example: [CrCl\({}_{2}\)(NH\({}_{3}\))\({}_{4}\)]\({}^{*}\)*
* (b) Naming of Complexes*
* The cation is always named before the anion.
* The names of the ligands precede the name of the central atom or ion.
* The oxidation state of the central atom or ion is shown in Roman numerals in brackets immediately after its name.
* Metals forming complex anions are given the word-ending -_a_fe, whereas complex cations and neutral complexes are given their usual names.
* Ligands are listed in alphabetical order, the multiplying prefix being ignored.
* When a number prefix (e.g. di-, tri-) is already included in the name of the ligand, the name of the ligand is placed in a bracket with the prefix bis-, tris-, tetrakis- instead of di-, tri-, tetra- respectively.
* Notice that the complex ion names are written as one word, with no spacing between the name and the oxidation state of the central atom.
