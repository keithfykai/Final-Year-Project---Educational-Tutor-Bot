## 2 Physical Reports

### Boiling point

* Carbonyls are **moderately polar** because of permanent \(\delta\)+ charge on the carbonyl C atom and the \(\delta-\) charge on the O atom of the C=O functional group. (_recall that oxygen is more electronegative than carbon_)
* Hence they have _higher boiling point_ than alkanes with similar number of electrons but _lower boiling point_ than alcohols with similar number of electrons (comparable M\({}_{\text{i}}\)).

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|} \hline _compound_ & _M\({}_{\text{r}}\)_ & _b.p. / \({}^{\circ}\)C_ & _dominant intermolecular forces_ \\ \hline CH\({}_{3}\)CH\({}_{2}\)CH\({}_{3}\) & 44 & \(-\) 42 & instantaneous dipole-induced dipole interactions \\ \hline CH\({}_{3}\)CHO & 44 & 21 & permanent dipole-permanent dipole interactions \\ \hline CH\({}_{3}\)CH\({}_{2}\)OH & 46 & 78 & hydrogen bonding \\ \hline \end{tabular} _Recall that for compounds with similar M\({}_{\text{r}}\), more energy is required to overcome stronger intermolecular hydrogen bonds than permanent dipole-permanent dipole interactions!_

### Solubility in water

* Both ketones and aldehydes are _soluble_ in water as they are _polar_ and are able to form _hydrogen bonding_ with water molecules.
* Both can dissolve _polar_ and _non-polar_ solutes.
* Solubility in H\({}_{2}\)O _decreases_ as _M\({}_{\text{r}}\)_ increases because as the carbon chain increases, the extent of intermolecular hydrogen bonding between the carbonyl compounds and water (solvent-solute interaction) decreases. Thus, less energy is released which makes it more difficult to overcome the hydrogen bonding between water molecules (solvent-solvent interaction).
* Laboratory Rejected

Students should be able to

_a) describe the formation of aldehydes and ketones from, and their reduction to, primary and secondary alcohols respectively_

### Oxidation of alcohols

* primary (1\({}^{\circ}\)) alcohols oxidation
* secondary (2\({}^{\circ}\)) alcohols

**Oxidation of primary alcohols (1\({}^{\circ}\))** to prepare aldehydes

Reagents and conditions: K\({}_{2}\)Cr\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{\text{r}}\)(aq), H\({}_{2}\)SO\({}_{4}\)(aq), heat with immediate distillation

\(\text{RCH}_{2}\)OH + [O]

RCHO + H\({}_{2}\)OMaking thinking visible

Why is immediate distillation of aldehyde necessary?

If the aldehyde is not distilled immediately, further heating with acidified dichromate will oxidise the aldehyde to a carboxylic acid. _(oxidation of alcohol to carboxylic acid will be covered in the topic of carboxylic acids and derivatives)_

Why is distillation of aldehyde possible in a mixture of the alcohol and aldehyde product?

The aldehyde product will always have a lower boiling point than its corresponding alcohol and hence will be boiled off and collected first in the distillation setup.

Why is KMnO4(aq) not used to oxidise primary alcohol to aldehyde?

KMnO4(aq) is a very strong oxidising agent that will readily oxidise the aldehyde further to carboxylic acid.

Oxidation of secondary alcohols (2o) to prepare ketones

Reagents and conditions: K2Cr2O7(aq), H2SO4(aq), heat

or KMnO4(aq), H2SO4(aq), heat

Why is immediate distillation of ketone not necessary?

Ketone cannot be further oxidised even with further heating under reflux. Therefore, ketone does not need to be distilled immediately.

Wired Example?

Write down the observations of the following reactions and draw the structures of the organic products.

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:6]

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:7]

This is because the **carbonyl carbon** (e.g. in CH\({}_{3}\)CHO) is **planar**. Nucleophiles can **attack from the top and bottom of the plane with equal probability**, giving rise to **a racemic mixture** of the product.

#### 4.1.1.1 Reactions involving cyanohydrin

Cyanohydrin is a useful intermediate in organic synthesis; it **increases** the number of carbon atoms in a reactant molecule (**step up reaction**). It can also be transformed into other functional groups.

_cyanohydrin is a type of nitrile. Its reactions are similar to nitrile that you have learnt in halogen derivatives!_

### Reduction of aldehydes and ketones

* Aldehydes (1\({}^{\circ}\)) (1\({}^{\circ}\)) alcohols
* Ketones (2\({}^{\circ}\)) alcohols

Reagents and conditions: LiAH\({}_{4}\) in dry ether

or NaBH\({}_{4}\) in methanol or ethanol (works in aqueous medium too!)

or H\({}_{2}\), Ni catalyst, heat

or H\({}_{2}\), Pt catalyst

Reduction of aldehydes to primary (1\({}^{\circ}\)) alcohol

* The reduction of carbonyls with nucleophilic reducing agents (LiAIH\({}_{4}\) and NaBH\({}_{4}\)) follow a nucleophilic addition mechanism.

LiAH\({}_{4}\) and NaBH\({}_{4}\) cannot reduce alkenes as the nucleophilic reducing agents cannot attack an electron-rich C=C bond. Hence, LiAIH\({}_{4}\) and NaBH\({}_{4}\) are preferentially used for selective reduction of carbonyl in compounds that also contain C=C bond.

### Oxidation of aldehydes (reducing property of aldehydes)

Students should be able to

_deduce the nature (aldehyde or ketone) of an unknown carbonyl compound from the results of simple tests (i.e. Fehling's and Tollens' reagents; ease of oxidation)_

This _distinguishes_ aldehydes from ketones as ketones CANNOT be oxidised under normal conditions.

#### 4.3.1 With potassium dichromate or potassium manganate(VII)

### Tri-iodomethane formation (iodoform test)

Students should be able to

_f_) _deduce the presence of a CH\({}_{3}\)CO- group in a carbonyl compound from its reaction with alkaline aqueous iodine to form tri-iodomethane_

Carbonyl compounds with the following structural unit (methyl carbonyl group)

\begin{tabular}{|l|} \hline
**lodoform Test** _(a type of oxidation or oxidative cleavage)_ \\ Reagents and conditions: **I\({}_{2}\)**, NaOH(aq), heat** \\ \hline \end{tabular}

Negative test for CH\({}_{3}\)CO- in carboxylic acid \\ acryl chloride \\ ester \\ \hline \end{tabular}

Positive test for RCOCH\({}_{3}\) with iodide substituents like RCOCH\({}_{2}\)I, RCOCHI\({}_{2}\), RCOCl\({}_{3}\)

Wicked Examples

Which of the following carbonyls **do not** show a positive iodoform test?
