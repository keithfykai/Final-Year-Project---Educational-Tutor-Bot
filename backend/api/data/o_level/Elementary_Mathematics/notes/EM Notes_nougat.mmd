**Number Sequence and Problem Solving**

**Revision Notes:**

A number sequence is a set of numbers arranged in such a way that each successive number follows the preceding of according to a certain rule. The numbers in a sequence is called the terms of the sequence.

One way to define a sequence is to give a formula for the \(n^{\text{a}}\) term.

E.g. The \(n^{\text{a}}\) term of the sequence 3, 5,7,9, \(\ldots\) is \(2n+1\).

**Worked Example**

_Example 1_

Find the \(n\)th term of the following sequence:

1. 5, 8,11,14, (b) 4,9,16,25,\(\ldots\).

**Solution**:

1. 3\(n+2\) (b) (n\(\pm 1\))\({}^{2}\)

_Example 2_

1. The \(n\)th term of a sequence is given by \(2n^{2}+1\). Write down the first 4 terms.
2. The first \(\bar{4}\) terms of another sequence are \(1\), \(7\), \(17\), \(31\), \(\ldots\).
2. Write down the next term.
3. By comparing this sequence with your answer to (a), write down the \(n\)th term.

_Solution_:

1. 2(1)\({}^{2}+1\), 2(2)\({}^{2}+1\), 2(3)\({}^{2}+1\), 2(4)\({}^{2}+1\) = 3, 9, 19, 33
2. (i) 49
3. \(n\)th term = 2n\({}^{2}+1-2-2n^{2}-1\)

**Example 3**

Consider the pattern:

1\({}^{2}-0^{2}=1\),

2\({}^{2}\)--1\({}^{2}=3\),

3\({}^{2}\)--2\({}^{2}=5\)

4\({}^{2}\)--3\({}^{2}=7\)

5\({}^{2}\)--y\({}^{2}\)=101

Page 15 of 62* Write down the 7th fine in the pattern.
* Find the value of \(143^{2}-142^{2}\).
* Find integer values of \(x\) and \(y\) which satisfy the equation \(x^{2}-y^{2}=101\)

_Solution_:

\(43^{2}-6^{2}=13\)

\(43^{2}-142^{2}=143+142=285\)

\(x^{2}-y^{2}=101\)

\((x+y)(x-y)=101\)

We need to find two consecutive integers whose sum is \(101\) and the difference is \(1\).

Since \(101+2=50\not\times_{2}\) we choose \(x=51\) and \(y=50\).

**1.** Pythagoras' theorem**

**In a right-angled triangle, the square of the hypotenuse (side opposite right angle) is equal to sum of squares of the other two sides, i.e., \(c^{2}=a^{2}+b^{2}\).**

**Conversely, if a triangle has sides \(a\), \(b\) and \(c\) such that \(c^{2}=a^{2}+b^{2}\), then the triangle is a right angled triangle.**

**2.** Trigonometrical Ratios of Acute Angles**

**For a right-angle triangle,** \(PQR\)**, with reference to the angle** \(\theta\)**, the side opposite the right angle is called the hypotenuse (the longest of the 3 sides of the triangle). Opposite refers to the side that is directly opposite the angle** \(\theta\) **and adjacent the third side.**

**Vectors**

**Revision Notes:**

**I.** Vectors

A vector is a quantity which has both magnitude and direction..

E.g. velocity is a vector but temperature is not

**2.** Magnitude of Vectors

\(\mathrm{If}x=\begin{pmatrix}x\\ y\end{pmatrix}\), then its magnitude \(|\,\mathrm{r}\,|=\sqrt{x^{2}+y^{2}}\,\,\,\mathrm{units}\).

E.g. \(\mathrm{If}x=\begin{pmatrix}4\\ 3\end{pmatrix}\), then \(|\,\mathrm{r}\,|=\sqrt{4^{2}+3^{2}}-5\,\,\mathrm{units}\)

**3.** Vector Addition.**

(a) Triangle law of vector addition

**4.** Vector Subtraction

The subtraction of vectors a - b; can be expressed as the addition of vectors, a + (-b).

**Probability**

**Revision Notes:**

**1. Definition**

The probability that an event, \(A\), will happen is written as \(P(A)\) and is given by

\[P(A)=\frac{\text{number of times event $A$ can occur}}{\text{total number of occurrences}}.\]

**2. Properties of Probability**

1. If \(A\) is any event, \(0\leq P(A)\leq 1\). If \(A\) is an impossible event; then \(P(A)=0\) If \(A\) is a sure event, then \(P(A)=1\).
2. The probability that the event \(A\), does not happen is called the complement of \(A\) and is written as \(P(A)^{*}\) and is given by \(P(A)=1-P(A)\).
3. Two events are mutually exclusive if the event of one happening excludes the other of happening. In other words, they both cannot happen at the same time. If \(A\) and \(B\) are two mutually exclusive events, then \(P(A\text{ or }B)=P(A)+P(B)\)
4. Two events are independent if the occurrence of one happening does not affect the occurrence of the other. If \(A\) and \(B\) are independent events, then \(P(A\text{ and }B)=P(A)+P(B)\).
**3. Possibility Diagrams**

A possibility diagram uses dot or a table to list all the possible outcomes of an experiment.

**E.g.** The four faces of a red die are marked \(1,2,2\) and \(3\). The four faces of a blue, die are marked \(1,2,5\) and When such a die is thrown, the score is the number on the face on which it lands. The two dice are thrown together and their scores added. The possibility diagram below shows all the possible outcomes.

1. **Presentation of Data**

**(a) Tabulation**

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|} \hline Game & Badminton & Table Tennis & Tennis & Others \\ \hline Number of pupils & 100 & 120 & 80 & 60 \\ \hline \end{tabular}
**(b) Pictogram**

A pictogram is a diagram using pictures or symbols to represent data.

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|} \hline Badminton & & & \\ \hline Table Tennis & & & \\ \hline Tennis & & & \\ \hline Others & & & \\ \hline \end{tabular}

Each: represents 10 pupils
**(c) Pie Chart**

In a pie chart, the whole set of data is represented by a circle. The angle of the sector is proportional to quantity of the category, represented by the sector.

**E.g. Angle of sector for Tennis = \(\frac{80}{360}\)\(\times\)360\({}^{\circ}\)=80\({}^{\circ}\)**

* **Histogram** A histogram is used to represent a frequency distribution. It is similar to the bar chart except that there is no gap between the rectangular columns. The area of each rectangle, represents the frequency. It all the classes have die same width then all the rectangles will be the same width and the frequencies are then represented by the height of the rectangles. **E.g.** The histogram shows the number of hours spend doing homework bn a particular day by 25 pupils. **Frequency** E.g., The frequency table below shows the parking times, in minutes, of 20 cars. **Parking time (\(x\) minutes)** \(0<x\leq 30\) **30**\(<x\leq 60\) **60**\(<x\leq 90\) **90**\(<x\leq 120\) **Frequency** \(5\) **3** **8** **4** The table can be represented using a histogram. **Page 57 of **62** **www.tuitionwithjason.sg*** **Choice of Statistical Graphs** (i): A pictogram is more suitable when the data needs to be presented in a lively and interesting manners. Although it is not a very, accurate way of representing data, it can still be more, informative effective than other methods for presenting data to the general public: (ii): A bar chart and a histogram are useful for comparing quantities in the different categories and they represent data more accurately: (iii): Compared with a bar chart or a histogram, a pie chart is a better way of show how a total is broken into different parts, it clearly compares the sizes of these parts to the whole. (iv): A line graph is suitable to show data that changes with time:
* **Dot Diagram** A dot diagram is drawn by placing dots that the values of a set of data above the horizontal line. The number, dots above each valve indicates how many times each value occurred. **E.g.,** The number of children in each of 20 families is given below. \[\begin{array}{ccccc}3&0&2&1&1\\ 5&3&2&1&0\\ 1&1&3&2&3\\ 2&2&1&3&0\\ \end{array}\] The dot diagram below displays this information. \[\begin{array}{ccccc}\text{Page 58 of 62}\\ \text{www.tuitionwithjason.sg}\\ \text{\end{array}}\]
