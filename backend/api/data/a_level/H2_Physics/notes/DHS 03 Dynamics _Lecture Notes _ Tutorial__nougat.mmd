## 0 Introduction

In _kinematics_, we described motion in terms of displacement, velocity and acceleration. In this chapter, we investigate what causes change in motion. The relationship between a force and the acceleration it causes was first understood by Sir Isaac Newton (1642 - 1727). The study of the relationship is called Newtonian mechanics. In this topic, the focus is on Newton's three laws of motion.

Newtonian mechanics does not apply in the following situations:

When the speeds of the interacting bodies are very large (i.e. approaching the speed of light). In this case, Einstein's special theory of relativity replaces Newtonian mechanics.

When the interacting bodies are on the atomic scale. In this case, quantum mechanics replaces Newtonian mechanics.

Physicists now view Newtonian mechanics as a special case of these two more comprehensive theories.

Mass is a **scalar** quantity while weight is a **vector** quantity.

Note that the mass of an object is constant all over the universe, but its weight is a force whose magnitude depends on the value of \(g\). The direction of \(W\)is always in the direction of \(g\). In the context of Earth, weight will always point towards the centre of the Earth.

**Example 1**

Determine the acceleration of free fall on the surface of Earth and Moon if a 70.0 kg mass weighs 687 N on Earth and 114 N on Moon.

### _LO_ (f) relate resultant force to the rate of change of momentum

**Newton's 2nd Law of Motion** states that:

The rate of change of momentum of a body is directly proportional to the resultant force acting on the body and occurs in the direction of the resultant force.

### Mathematical Interpretation of Newton's 2nd Law

From Newton's 2nd Law of Motion,

\[F_{R}\propto\frac{dp}{dt}=k\frac{dp}{dt}=k\frac{d(m\nu)}{dt}\]

where \(k\) is a constant of proportionality.

For constant mass, then

\[F_{R}=k\frac{d(m\nu)}{dt}=k\cdot m\frac{d\nu}{dt}=k\cdot m\]

We make the constant \(k\) equals to 1 by defining the newton to be such that a resultant force of 1 N gives a mass of 1 kg an acceleration of 1 m s\({}^{-2}\):

\[F_{R}=m\alpha\] (only valid for constant mass)

\[F_{R}=\frac{dp}{dt}\] (general form)

Note that both \(F_{R}\) and \(a\) are vectors - the force determines not only the magnitude of the acceleration, but also its direction - a body accelerates in the direction of the resultant force on it.

### Newton's 3rd Law of Motion** states that:

If body A exerts a force on body B, then body B exerts a force of the same type that is equal in magnitude and opposite in direction on body A.

Newton's 3rd Law of Motion implies that forces occur in pairs, which fulfils the following conditions:

1. The two forces act on two different bodies.
2. The forces are equal in magnitude.
3. The forces are opposite in direction.
4. The forces must be of the same type.

These two forces are known as an **action-reaction** pair of forces.

Examples:

Action: rocket pushes on gas Reaction: gas pushes on rocket

Action: earth pulls on ball

Action: man pulls on spring Reaction: spring pulls on manIn the free-body diagram of a book resting on a table, explain why the normal contact force, \(N\), and the weight, \(W\), do not form an action-reaction pair of forces even though \(N\) and \(W\) are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction.

A 0.50 kg ball experiences an acceleration of free fall of 9.81 m s\({}^{-2}\). Find the acceleration of the Earth towards the ball (assume the ball and Earth are the only two objects in the universe).

Free-Body Diagrams

When solving problems, a free-body force diagram is vital to help you analyse the question effectively. A free-body force diagram shows **all the forces acting on the body** (in which you are interested) without showing the forces acting on the environment or other bodies. This is a useful tool used to find the resultant or net external force acting on a body and we can then set up equations to calculate the acceleration of the body using Newton's 2nd Law of Motion.

**Common Forces in Free-Body Force Diagrams**

**weight, _W_**

Gravitational force exerted by the source mass (e.g. Earth) on the body. It acts from the centre of gravity of the body and is in the same direction of the gravitational field strength, \(g\).

\(W=F_{G}=mg\)

**tensile and compressive forces**

If the body is attached to a spring, the tension or compression of the spring will act on it. The spring can pull (tension) or push (compression).

For a spring that obeys **Hooke's Law**, the extension/compression \(e\) of the material is directly proportional to the tensile/compressive force acting on it.

\(T=k\)e

If the body is attached to a string, the tension of the string will act on it.

Tension always pulls, never pushes.

**normal contact force, _N_**

If the body is in contact with anything, there will be a normal reaction force exerted by the contact surface on the body. It acts in the direction perpendicular to the area of contact (i.e. along the normal).

(The reaction force by a hinge can act at any angle to a hinged object, so insert it at an unknown angle.)

**frictional force, _f_**

Friction will act if the body is in contact with a rough surface, and if it is moving or has any "tendency" to move. Having a "tendency" to move means the body would move if there was no friction. Friction exerted by the surface acts parallel to the surface, in the direction opposite to the way the body moves or would tend to move.

**viscous force, _Fviscous_ (including air resistance/drag, _Fmag_)

The resistance to the movement of a body through a fluid is the viscous force exerted **by** the fluid **on** the body. It acts in the direction opposite to that of the motion of the body.

**upthrust, _U_**

Upward force exerted on submerged objects in a fluid (liquid or gas). It acts from the centre of gravity of the displaced fluid.

Aircraft experience a **lift** force vertically upwards. Lift is a mechanical aerodynamic force produced by the motion of the airplane through the air, perpendicular to the air flow direction.

What is wrong with the following free body diagrams?

In the following situations, draw the free body diagrams of the underlined body or system of bodies. Label all the forces.

(i) accelerating up the plane at 2.0 m s\({}^{-2}\),

(ii) moving with a steady velocity of 15 m s\({}^{-1}\).

Three blocks are connected on a horizontal frictionless table and pulled to the right with a force \(T_{1}\) = 60 N. If \(m_{1}\) = 30 kg, \(m_{2}\) = 20 kg and \(m_{3}\) = 10 kg, find the tensions \(T_{2}\) and \(T_{3}\).

Two masses \(m_{i}\) and \(m_{2}\) are connected by a cord passing over a smooth and light pulley and held in the position shown. Find the tension in the cord and the acceleration of the two bodies when they are released from rest.

## 2 Conservation of Momentum

_LO_ (h) **state the principle of conservation of momentum**

The principle of conservation of momentum states that the total momentum of a system of bodies is constant provided no resultant external force acts on the system.

**Justifying the Principle of Conservation of Linear Momentum**

Suppose two bodies, of masses \(m_{1}\) and \(m_{2}\) collide with initial velocities be \(u\) and \(u\) respectively such that \(u_{1}>u_{2}\).

When they collide, they will be deformed with forces acting on them.

During the collision, body 1 exerts a force \(F_{2}\) on body 2, and body 2 exerts a force \(F_{1}\) on body 1.

By Newton's \(3^{rd}\) law, these forces are equal and opposite:

\(F_{2}=-F_{1}\)

Both forces act for the same time \(\Delta t\) (however long the collision takes).

Therefore, the impulses of the forces are equal and opposite.

Since impulse equals change in momentum, the changes in momentum of 1 and 2 are equal and opposite:

\(\Delta p_{2}=-\Delta p_{1}\)

By definition of change in momentum,

\(m_{2}\left(\nu_{2}-u_{2}\right)=-m_{1}\left(\nu_{1}-u_{1}\right)\)

Rearranging the above equation gives

\(m_{1}u_{1}+m_{2}u_{2}=m_{1}\nu_{1}+m_{2}\nu_{2}\)

Total momentum of system before collision = Total momentum of system after collision

**Note:**

There must be no resultant external force acting on the objects.

Momentum is a vector quantity so direction must be taken into account.

Momentum is conserved before, during, and after a collision.

A 7.0 kg bowling ball of velocity \(u\) collides head-on with a 2.0 kg bowling pin. The pin flies forward with a velocity of 3.0 m s\({}^{-1}\) and the ball continues with a velocity of 1.8 m s\({}^{-1}\). What was the initial velocity \(u\) of the ball?

**Example 14**

A gun of mass 1.0 kg has a bullet of mass 0.10 kg inside. The bullet leaves the gun when fired at a velocity of 200 m s\({}^{-1}\). Calculate the velocity of the gun after firing.

**Example 15**_[2008/H1/P2/OG][part]_

The momentum of the person increases during free fall. Explain whether this is a violation of the principle of conservation of momentum.

**Example 16** (Relative speed of approach and separation): In each case, the velocities of two bodies **A** and **B** are represented. Assuming that rightwards is the positive direction, what is the relative speed (of approach or separation) in each case?

**Example 17**: A 25.0 kg ball moving to the right at 20.0 m s\({}^{-1}\) catches up and collides elastically with a 10.0 kg ball moving in the same direction at 15.0 m s\({}^{-1}\). Find the velocity of each object after the collision.

**Example 18**: A 10.0 kg ball moving to the right at 10.0 m s\({}^{-1}\) makes an elastic head-on collision with a 15.0 kg ball moving to the left at 30.0 m s\({}^{-1}\). Find the velocity of each object after the collision.

**Inelastic collision**

In most collisions, kinetic energy is not conserved although the momentum is conserved. The decrease in kinetic energy of the system is transferred to heat and sound, or is used to change the shape of the bodies involved.

An inelastic collision in which the colliding bodies stick together (coalesce) and move off as one body after the collision is called a **completely inelastic collision.**

**Example 19**

A cue ball of mass 0.15 kg initial velocity 5.0 m s\({}^{-1}\) collides head-on with a billiard ball of mass 0.20 kg initially at rest. After the collision, the billiard ball moves with a velocity of 4.0 m s\({}^{-1}\).

Calculate the velocity of the cue ball after the collision.

Is the collision elastic?

**Example 20**

A ball A of mass 0.10 kg moves with a velocity of 6.0 m s\({}^{-1}\) undergoes completely inelastic head-on collision with ball B of mass 0.20 kg initially at rest. Find the velocity of ball A after collision.

**Note:**

We may not know the directions of the balls/objects after collision. To solve the problem, we need to assume of the direction. If we obtain a negative value, it indicates movement in the opposite direction.

**Definition List**

Force is directly proportional to the rate of change of momentum. The direction of the force is in the direction of the change of momentum.

Newton's First Law

An object at rest will remain at rest and an object in motion will remain in motion at constant velocity in the absence of an external resultant force.

Newton's Second Law

The rate of change of momentum of a body is directly proportional to the resultant force acting on the body and occurs in the direction of the resultant force.

Newton's Third Law

If body A exerts a force on body B, then body B exerts a force of the same type that is equal in magnitude and opposite in direction on body A.

Note: Same type means if one is gravitational force, the other one must be gravitational force too.

Inertia

The reluctance of a body to change its state of rest or uniform motion in a straight line.

Mass

The amount of matter or substance in the body. It is a measure of body's inertia to changes in velocity.

Weight

The force acting on a mass due to a gravitational field.

One newton

Defined as the force which when it acts on a body of mass 1 kg causes the body to have an acceleration of 1 m s\({}^{-2}\). (1 N = 1 kg m s\({}^{-2}\))

Linear momentum

The linear momentum of a body is the product of the mass and its velocity.

The linear momentum is in the same direction as its velocity.

Impulse

Product of constant force \(F\) and the time duration \(\Delta t\) for which the constant force acts. Impulse = \(F\cdot\Delta t\).

Impulse-Momentum

The impulse of a force acting on an object is equal to the change in momentum of the object.

Principle of

The principle of conservation of linear momentum states that the total conservation of a system of bodies is constant provided no resultant external force acts on the system.

Elastic collision

The total momentum and total kinetic energy are the same before and after the collision.

Note: If the number of marks given is 3, the following can be included in addition to the answer above:

The relative velocity of approach equals relative velocity of separation.

Inelastic collision

Total kinetic energy is not the same before and after the collision, although total momentum is conserved.

Perfectly inelastic collision

The total kinetic energy is not the same before and after the collision, although total momentum is conserved, AND, the objects stick together after collision.

All collisions

Total momentum and total energy are conserved.

Note: For collision of nuclear particles,

Total momentum and Total mass-energy are conserved.
