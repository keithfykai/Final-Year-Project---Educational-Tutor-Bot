# Why Do Light Rays Undergo Refraction?

Rays Refraction?

Winy Do Light Rays Undergo Refraction?

Light rays bend due to the **difference in speed of light** in different optical mediums.

Imagine this scenario

You are trying to get from point A to point B. You walk faster on land than start in water.

What path will allow you to reach point B in the shortest amount of time?

You will not just simply travel in a straight line because that means spending an equal amount of time in water and on land when you travel faster on land.

Given that you walk faster on land, you would cut short the distance you swim in water and attempt to get on land as soon as possible. You will probably travel in a path as shown above.

Light behaves in the same way, taking the fastest path.

Light rays bend due to the difference in speed of light in different mediums.

LAM OF REFRACTION

1. The incident ray, the refracted ray and the normal at the point of incidence all lie in the same plane.
2. For light passing through any two mediums, the ratio of **sin 1/ sin **r** is a constant (refractive index).

### BENDING OF LIGHT Rays

When light travel from a **less dense** medium to a **denser** medium, the refracted ray will **bend towards** the normal.

When light travel from a **denser** medium to a **less dense** medium, the refracted ray will **bend away** from the normal.

PRINCIPLE OF REVERSIBILITY

The principle of reversibility states that light will follow the

same path even if its direction of travel is reversed.

Given that,

\[n=\sin{1}\,/\sin{r}\]

But if we reverse the lights direction,

\[n=\sin{r}\,/\sin{1}\]

(due to principle of reversibility)

The **rule of thumb** is to make sure **value of \(n\) is always bigger than 1.**

Use \(n=\sin{r}\,/\sin{i}\) (principle of reversibility) if the light ray is traveling from denser to less dense medium.

The best way to approach this is:

\[n=\sin{(angle\,\,in\,\,air)}\,/\sin{(angle\,\,in\,\,medium)}\]
## 1 Total Internal Reflection

As angle of incidence increases, the angle of refraction also increases.

Total internal reflection occurs once the angle of incidence exceeds the **critical angle**, causing the light ray to not leave the optically denser medium and instead, reflect internally.

Critical angle, c, is defined as the angle of incidence in the optically denser medium for which angle of refraction in the optically less dense medium is exactly 90\({}^{\circ}\).

### Formula:

\[\sin c=1/n\]

_where \(n\) is refractive index._

### Hence. the 2 conditions for total internal reflections. are:

1) Light ray must be travelling from optically denser medium to an optically less dense medium (so that it bends away from the normal until it hits 90\({}^{\circ}\))

2) angle of incidence must be greater than the critical angle

### Applications:

- Glass Prisms

- Optic Fibre
