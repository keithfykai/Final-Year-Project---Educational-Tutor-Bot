## Chapter 1 Kinetic Particle Theory

### Gases

Gases are easily compressed as the volume of gas particles is negligible compared to the volume occupied by the gas.

### Chapter 2 Measurement and Experimental Techniques

### Apparatus for Measurement

The accuracies of apparatuses used for measurement in ascending order are beaker, graduated measuring cylinder, burette then pipette.

### Collection of Gases

The collection of poisonous gases (e.g. chlorine) when carrying out downward delivery should be carried out in a fume cupboard.

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|} \hline
**Method** & **Suitability** & **Examples** \\ \hline Displacement of water & \(\bullet\) & Insoluble or slightly soluble in water & \(\bullet\) & Hydrogen \\  & & \(\bullet\) & Carbon dioxide \\  & & \(\bullet\) & Oxygen \\ \hline Downward delivery & \(\bullet\) & Soluble in water & \(\bullet\) & Hydrogen chloride \\  & \(\bullet\) & Denser than air & \(\bullet\) & Chlorine \\ \hline Upward delivery & \(\bullet\) & Soluble in water & \(\bullet\) & Ammonia \\  & \(\bullet\) & Less dense than air & \(\bullet\) & \\ \hline \end{tabular}

### Drying of Gases

We can dry a gas by passing it through a drying agent. Using conc. sulfuric acid to dry ammonia is unsuitable as the sulfuric acid will react with the ammonia to produce ammonium sulfate.

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|} \hline
**Drying agent** & **Suitability and examples** \\ \hline Conc. sulfuric acid & \(\bullet\) & Most gases \\ \hline Quicklime & \(\bullet\) & Ammonia \\ \hline Calcium chloride & \(\bullet\) & Most gases \\ \hline \end{tabular}

## 0.4 Graphite - Being Slippery

Graphite contains layers of carbon atoms and these layers are held by weak intermolecular forces. The layers slide over each other very easily, making graphite slippery.

### Metallic Bonding

Metallic bonding is between metallic and metallic elements. Metals have free-moving electrons in their outer shells which form a sea of delocalised electrons around the closely-packed positive ions. These electrons carry electric charges, which explains why metals can conduct electricity. When an electric current passes through a metal, the metal will not decompose.

### Metallic Bonding - Melting and Boiling Points

Compounds which consist of metallic bonds have high melting and boiling points. There are strong electrostatic forces between the positive and negative ions holding the particles together. It requires much energy to separate the particles. When electricity is passed through a compound consisting of metallic bonds, the electrons will be disrupted and will return to their original positions.

### Chapter 11 - Acids and Bases

#### Types of Oxides

Most oxides can be grouped into four types: acidic oxides, basic oxides, amphoteric oxides and neutral oxides.

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|} \hline  & **Acidic oxides** & **Basic oxides** & **Amphoteric oxides** & **Neutral oxides** \\ \hline
**React with acid?** & No & Yes & Yes & No \\ \hline
**React with alkali?** & Yes & No & & \\ \hline
**Examples** & CO\({}_{2}\), SiO\({}_{2}\) & Na\({}_{2}\)O, K\({}_{2}\)O & Al\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{3}\), PbO & CO, H2O \\ \hline \end{tabular}

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:5]

To obtain a pure sample of sodium chloride, pipette 25.0cm\({}^{3}\) of sodium hydroxide solution into a conical flask. Dispense V\({}_{2}\) - V\({}_{1}\) cm\({}^{3}\)of hydrochloric acid from the burette. Do not add the indicator as it will make the salt impute. Heat the solution until it is saturated. Allow the saturated solution to cool so that the salt can crystallise. Filter to collect the crystals. Wash the crystals with a little cold water to remove any impurities. Dry the crystals between 2 sheets of filter paper.

The substances in the conical flask and the burette can be swapped (i.e. you can fill the burette with sodium hydroxide and the conical flask with hydrochloric acid).

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|} \hline
**Acidic** & **Neutral** & **Alkaline** \\ \hline Yellow & Orange & Red \\ \hline \end{tabular}

#### 3.1.2 Preparing Barium Sulfate

Pour barium nitrate solution into a small beaker. Add excess sodium sulfate solution and stir until no more precipitate forms. Filter to collect the precipitate. Wash the precipitate with distilled water to remove impurities. Allow the precipitate to dry on a piece of filter paper.

#### 3.1.3 Nitrate Salts

Nitrate salts cannot be used in a reaction to prepare another salt since all nitrates are soluble.

#### 3.1.4 Qualitative Analysis

Concepts are test for cations, test for anions and test for gases.

#### 3.1.5 Identifying Cations

The tests for lead and aluminium ions result in the same observations. We do not carry out tests for lead in the laboratory since lead is a toxic substance.

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|} \hline  & \multicolumn{2}{c|}{**Aq. sodium hydroxide**} & \multicolumn{2}{c|}{**Aq. ammonia**} \\ \cline{2-4}  & **Few drops** & **Excess** & **Few drops** & **Excess** \\ \hline Zinc & \begin{tabular}{c} \\ White ppt. \\ \end{tabular} & \begin{tabular}{c} Precipitate dissolves \\ in excess, forms \\ colourless solution \\ \end{tabular} & \begin{tabular}{c} Precipitate dissolves \\ in excess, forms \\ colourless solution \\ \end{tabular} \\ \hline Aluminium & \begin{tabular}{c} \\ White ppt. \\ Lead \\ \end{tabular} & \begin{tabular}{c} Insoluble in excess \\ \end{tabular} & \begin{tabular}{c} White ppt. \\ \end{tabular} & 
\begin{tabular}{c} Insoluble in excess \\ \end{tabular} \\ \hline \end{tabular}

#### 3.1.6 Identifying Anions

The solubility rules for salts are very important in the test for anions. When asked for the purpose of adding dilute nitric acid in the tests for sulfates, chlorides and iodides, the reason is to remove any carbonate in the solution to prevent false results.

As barium sulfate and silver halides are insoluble, it accounts for the reason that precipitates are formed in the test for sulfates, chlorides and iodides.

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|} \hline

### Chapter 13 - Oxidation and Reduction

_Redox Reactions and Disproportionation Reactions_

A redox reaction is a type of chemical reaction that involves a transfer of electrons between two substances. All neutralisation reactions are redox reactions.

When the same element is both oxidised and reduced, the reaction is known as a disproportionation reaction.

_Oxidising and Reducing Agents_

An oxidising agent is a substance that causes another substance to be oxidised. A reducing agent is a substance that causes another substance to be reduced. Potassium iodide is a reducing agent and KMnO\({}_{4}\) is an oxidising agent.

_Test for an Oxidising Agent_

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|} \hline
**Test** & **Observation** \\ \hline Add KI (aq.) & Brown solution formed. \\ \hline Dip a piece of starch-iodide paper & Sketch-iodide paper turns from white to white. \\ \hline \end{tabular}

**Test** & **Observation** \\ \hline Add acidified KMnO\({}_{4}\) & Colour of the KMnO\({}_{4}\) solution changes from purple to colourless. \\ \hline \end{tabular}

## Chapter 14 Metals

### 14.1 Pure Metals

Pure metals are not widely used in industries as they are soft. In a pure metal, the atoms are packed regularly in layers. The layers of atoms can slide over one another easily when a force is applied. Moreover, pure metals may react with air and water and wear away or corrode easily.

### 14.2 Alloys

An alloy is a mixture of a metal with one or a few other elements. Alloys are stronger and harder than their constituent metals because in an alloy, the atoms of the different metals or elements have different sizes. The regular arrangement of atoms in the pure metal is disrupted. The atoms of different sizes cannot slide over one another easily when a force is applied.

### 14.3 Malleability and Ductility

Metals are both malleable and ductile. This means that they can be hammered into different shapes (malleable) and drawn into wires without breaking (ductile). When a force is applied to a metal, the layers of metal atoms can slide over one another through the sea of electrons. The metallic bonding is undisrupted.

### 14.4 Reactivity Series

In the experiment shown above, steam is passed over a heated metal sample. Hydrogen gas is collected. Reactive metals react with cold water or steam to produce hydrogen gas. A possible option for the metal sample is zinc as it is moderately reactive. It reacts with steam to form zinc oxide and hydrogen.

To obtain the most vigorous reaction from a metal and metal oxide reaction, one must react a very reactive metal with an unreactive metal oxide.

## 0.9 Summary of Reactions

In this section, we will study the reactions of metals with cold water, steam, dilute hydrochloric acid and metallic oxides. Some metal oxides can also be reduced by carbon and hydrogen. Heat can decompose the metal carbonate as well.

### Cold Water and Steam

Zinc and iron cannot react with cold water. However, hot zinc reacts readily with steam to produce zinc oxide and hydrogen gas. Red-hot iron reacts slowly with steam to form iron oxide (Fe\({}_{3}\)O\({}_{4}\)) and hydrogen gas.

### Hydrochloric Acid

No reaction takes place for lead, copper and silver. Lead does not appear to react with hydrochloric acid since it forms an insoluble layer of lead(II) chloride.

### Carbon, Hydrogen and Carbonate

The more reactive a metal is, the more difficult it is to reduce its oxide to the metal by carbon/hydrogen/decompose its carbonate by heat.

The oxides of reactive metals are very thermally stable, they do not decompose easily.

### Extracting Metals

There are 3 main stages involved in obtaining metals from their ores:

* **Concentrating the metal ore:** Earth and rock are removed before the metal is extracted from the ore. This results in a metal ore that contains little waste materials.
* **Extracting crude metal from the ore:** Depending on the position of the metal in the reactivity series, the metal is extracted by reduction with carbon or using electricity.
* **Refining crude metal:** Generally, electrolysis is used.

## 0.10 The Blast Furnace - Extracting Iron from Haematite

Haematite contains iron(III) oxide mixed with impurities like sand and clay. Iron is extracted from haematite in a blast furnace. Haematite (iron(III) oxide), coke (carbon) and limestone (calcium carbonate) are added at the top of the blast furnace. Blasts of hot air are blown into the furnace near the bottom.

The following reactions take place in sequence:

Carbon dioxide is produced.The carbon in coke burns in a blast of hot air to produce carbon dioxide. This reaction is highly exothermic.Carbon + oxygen carbon dioxide

Carbon monoxide is produced.As the carbon dioxide rises up the furnace, it reacts with coke to produce carbon monoxide. This reaction is also highly exothermic.Carbon + carbon dioxide carbon monoxide

Heematite is reduced to iron.The carbon monoxide formed acts as a reducing agent as iron(III) oxide gets reduced to iron. The product iron is molten and it runs to the bottom of the furnace.Iron(III) oxide + carbon monoxide carbon dioxide + iron

Impurities are removed.Lmestone is decomposed by heat to produce carbon dioxide and quicklime. This process is known as thermal decomposition.Calcium carbonate carbon dioxide + calcium oxide

Some lime compounds are listed below.

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|} \hline
**Chemical name** & **Lime type** \\ \hline Calcium carbonate & Limestone, chalk \\ \hline Calcium hydroxide & Slaked lime \\ \hline Calcium oxide & Quicklime \\ \hline \end{tabular}

As calcium oxide is a basic oxide, it reacts with silicon dioxide which is acidic and other impurities in haematite to form molten slag. The molten slag runs to the bottom of the furnace. It floats on top of the molten iron. Silicon dioxide is also known as silica. Calcium oxide + silicon dioxide \(\xrightarrow{}\) calcium silicate

Hot waste gases like carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide and nitrogen escape through the top of the furnace. The only gases which react with the reactants in the blast furnace are carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide and oxygen. Nitrogen is not involved in any reaction.

#### Steel

Mild steel is hard, strong and malleable as its composition of carbon is little. However, when the composition of carbon increases, it becomes high-carbon steel. High-carbon steel is strong but brittle.

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|} \hline
**Chemical name** & **Alternative name** \\ \hline Iron(III) oxide & Haematite \\ \hline Silicon dioxide & Silica \\ \hline Calcium silicate & Slag \\ \hline \end{tabular}

#### Chapter 15 - Electrolysis

A useful acronym is **AOCR (anode oxidation, cathode reduction)**. Recall that oxidation is the loss of electrons and reduction is the gain of electrons. Inert electrodes consist of carbon/graphite and platinum whereas reactive electrodes consist of copper.

#### Electrolysis of Molten Compounds

A binary compound consists of only 2 elements, usually a metal cation and a non-metal anion. We will conduct a case study of the electrolysis of molten sodium chloride in the next section.

#### Electrolysis of Molten Sodium Chloride

In the electrolysis of molten sodium chloride, the only ions present are Na\({}^{+}\) and CI.

The state symbol is (\(l\)) since we are referring to molten sodium chloride.

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|} \hline
**Anode** & **Cathode** \\ \hline Chlorine gas & Molten sodium \\ \hline \end{tabular}

#### 0.1.2 Electrolysis of Aqueous Solutions of Compounds

We will investigate how the reactivity series affects the selective discharge of cations and anions, as well as how concentration affects the selective discharge of anions.

#### 0.1.3 Electrolysis of Dilute Sodium Chloride Solution

The ions present in this solution are sodium, chloride, hydrogen and hydroxide.

The ratio of the volume of hydrogen gas to oxygen gas collected is 2:1. They are gases so the molar volume is the same.

Since oxygen is soluble, some oxygen dissolves into the solution so less oxygen gas is collected. The ratio of hydrogen to oxygen gas collected increases. However, after the electrolysis has been running some time, the solution becomes saturated with dissolved oxygen. The oxygen gas can no longer dissolve in the solution and is collected as a gas.

This process is known as they electrolysis of water. Water is gradually removed from the solution and the concentration of sodium chloride solution gradually increases.

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|} \hline
**Anode** & **Cathode** \\ \hline Oxygen gas, water & Hydrogen gas \\ \hline \end{tabular}

#### 0.1.4 Electrolysis of Concentrated Sodium Chloride Solution

The ions present in this solution are sodium, chloride, hydrogen and hydroxide.

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|} \hline
**Anode** & **Cathode** & **Remaining solution** \\ \hline Chlorine gas & Hydrogen gas & Sodium hydroxide \\ \hline \end{tabular}

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:13]

## 0.14 Electrolating

Electroplating is an application of electrolysis. The following are some reasons why we electroplate:

* To make a metal object look more expensive/give a decorative finish
* To prevent rusting

At the cathode, we place the object which we want to

electroplate. The anode will be the pure metal electrode. Electrons travel from the negative to the positive terminal. The silver anode undergoes reduction and the silver ions are deposited into the electrolyte. The travel to the wire and silver metal is deposited onto the surface of the teapot.

### Simple Cells

A simple cell is a device which converts chemical energy to electrical energy. The further apart the 2 metals are in the reactivity series, the greater the voltage produced in the cell.

### Zinc-Copper Cell with Copper(II) Sulfate Solution

Zinc is more reactive than copper. Electrons will flow through the wire from the zinc electrode to the copper electrode. The direction of conventional current is in the opposite. At the zinc electrode, the zinc atoms give up electrons to form zinc ions. At the copper electrode, copper(II) ions receive electrons from the solution to form copper.

### Chapter 16 - The Periodic Table

### Group I Elements - Alkali Metals

Down the group, the:

* Melting and boiling points decrease
* Reactivity increases
* Densities increases

### Group VII Elements - Halogens

Down the group, the:

* Melting and boiling points increase
* Reactivity decreases
* Appearance of the elements becomes darker

### Displacement of Halogens from its Aqueous Solution

A more reactive halogen will displace a less reactive halogen from its halide solution. This only applies to aqueous compounds. It will not work on solids. For example, when aqueous chlorine is added to sodium bromide (aq.), sodium chloride (aq.) and aqueous bromine are formed.

## 0.15 Transition Metals

Transition metals have the following properties:

* High melting and boiling points and high densities
* Have variable oxidation states
* Form coloured compounds

For example, manganese, a transition metal, can have variable oxidation states. In manganese(IV) oxide, the oxidation state of it is +4 but in potassium permanganate, the oxidation of it is +7.

It is good to know the colours of some coloured compounds. As such, here's a table for reference.

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|} \hline
**Name** & **Colour** & **Remarks** \\ \hline Copper(II) oxide & **Black** & \\ \hline Copper(I) oxide & **Red** & \\ \hline Copper(II) hydroxide/sulfate/nitrate & Blue & \begin{tabular}{c} Copper(II) sulfate is white \\ when anhydrous. \\ \end{tabular} \\ \hline Copper(II) carbonate & & \\ \hline Iron(II) sulfate & Green & \\ \hline Iron(III) chloride & Yellow & \\ \hline Potassium dichromate(VI) & Orange & \\ \hline Potassium permanganate & Purple & \\ \hline Potassium dichromate & 
\begin{tabular}{c} Orange, green when \\ reduced \\ yellow when heated \\ \end{tabular} \\ \hline \end{tabular}

## Chapter 0.17 Energy Changes

_Summary of Endothermic and Exothermic Changes_

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|} \hline Endothermic changes & Exothermic changes \\ \hline Heat taken in from surroundings & Heat given out to surroundings \\ \hline Enthalpy change is positive & \begin{tabular}{c} Enthalpy change is negative \\ \end{tabular} \\ \hline Energy content of reactants is higher than & 
\begin{tabular}{c} Energy content of reactants is higher than \\ that of the products \\ \end{tabular} \\ \hline \end{tabular}

_Activation Energy_

Activation energy is the minimum amount of energy that reactant particles must possess in order for a chemical reaction to occur. Catalysts are used to lower the activation energy to speed up the reaction.

## 0.16 _Combustion of Fuels_

Most fuels contain carbon and hydrogen. When these fuels burn, carbon dioxide, water vapour and heat energy are produced. Combustion equations can be represented by hydrocarbon/fuel + oxygen - carbon dioxide + water vapour. The state symbol for the water vapour is (g).

If a limited supply of air is used, carbon particles (in the form of soot) and carbon monoxide are produced. This is known as incomplete combustion. As all combustion reactions give off heat energy, combustion is an exothermic process.

When Bunsen burners emit a yellowish-orange flame, it implies that the air hole is closed, limiting the oxygen supply for burning. As such, soot is produced. Opening the air hole allows more oxygen to enter, ensuring that complete combustion takes place.

### Fuel Cells

A chemical cell in which reactants are continuously supplied to produce electricity directly is called a fuel cell. There are advantages and disadvantages of using hydrogen as a fuel.

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|} \hline
**Advantages** & **Disadvantages** \\ \hline \(\bullet\) & Hydrogen does not cause pollution. In the combustion of hydrogen, only water is produced. & It is not cheap to obtain hydrogen. One can either obtain it by cracking of petroleum or electrolysis. \\ \(\bullet\) & Hydrogen is a renewable source of energy as it can be obtained by electrolysis through the decomposition of water. & Hydrogen cannot be stored and used as easily as liquid fuels since it has a low boiling point. \\ \hline \end{tabular}

### 0.17 _Factors affecting the Speed of Reaction_

There are different factors which affect the speed of a chemical reaction which are namely:

* Concentration of the reactants
* Pressure (for gaseous reactants)
* Surface area (for solid reactants)
* Temperature
* Presence of a catalyst

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:17]

## Chapter 19 - Ammonia

When ammonia is converted to nitrogen gas, it undergoes oxidation.

### Manufacturing Ammonia by the Haber process

Ammonia is manufactured industrially by the Haber process. The raw materials are nitrogen and hydrogen which are mixed in the ration of 1:3. This ratio is chosen since the percentages by volume match the ratio of the number of moles of gases in the balanced equation to manufacture ammonia from nitrogen and hydrogen. Nitrogen is obtained from the fractional distillation of liquid air and hydrogen is produced from the cracking of petroleum.

### Conditions required for the Haber process

Optimal conditions are a temperature of 450\({}^{\circ}\)C, a pressure of 250atm and the presence of an iron catalyst.

The higher the pressure, the higher the yield of ammonia. However, maintaining high pressure is costly as expensive equipment is required. The lower the temperature, the higher the yield of ammonia. However, a lower temperature results in a slower speed of reaction. An iron catalyst is used to speed up the reaction.

### Displacement of Ammonia from its Salts

The equation is ammonium salt + alkali - ammonia + water + salt. For example, when ammonium chloride reacts with sodium hydroxide, the products are ammonia, water and sodium chloride.

### Neutralising Acidity in Soils

Calcium hydroxide and quicklime are widely used to neutralise acidity in soil. However, both compounds will react with nitrogenous fertilisers to form ammonia which escapes into the atmosphere. This causes the loss of nitrogen from fertilisers already added to the soil by farmers. Nitrogenous fertilisers and lime should not be added to the soil at the same time.

### Chapter 20 - The Atmosphere and Environment

### Composition of Air

Air is a mixture of several gases. It contains nitrogen (78%), oxygen (21%) and other gases (1%) which include argon and carbon dioxide. To separate air into its constituent gases, the air is cooled and compressed until liquid air is obtained. The gases are distilled by fractional distillation.

### Air Pollution

There are a variety of air pollutants. It is important to understand the **sources** and **effects** of these air pollutants.

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:19]

#### Reducing Air Pollution

It is possible to reduce air pollution via 2 means. They are by using catalytic converters and flue gas desulfurisation.

Catalytic converters are made of ceramic-coated with rhodium and platinum catalysts to speed up the reaction. Carbon monoxide is oxidised to carbon dioxide, oxides of nitrogen are reduced to nitrogen and unburnt hydrocarbons are oxidised to carbon dioxide and water.

Flue gas desulfursation (FGD) minimises the effects of sulfur dioxide pollution. In FGD, calcium carbonate plays an important role in reducing the effect of acid rain.

#### Depletion of the Ozone Layer

Ozone is an allotrope of oxygen. It is a pale blue gas with a pungent odour. Ozone filters out some of the harmful UV radiation from the Sun. However, the ozone layer around the Earth is disappearing quickly mainly due to chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs).

Propellants in aerosols and coolants in refrigerators and air-conditioners release CFCs into the atmosphere. In the presence of UV radiation, CFCs decompose to form chlorine atoms. These chlorine atoms react with ozone molecules in the atmosphere to form chlorine oxide and oxygen, destroying the ozone layer. As a result, harmful UV radiation reaches the Earth via holes in the ozone layer.

In summary, here are the list of reactions and their respective conditions.

_Petroleum and Natural Gas_

Natural gas and petroleum are sources of energy. Petroleum is a naturally occurring mixture of hydrocarbons. Hydrocarbons consist of only carbon and hydrogen. Petroleum must be separated into fractions before it can be useful. It is separated by fractional distillation.

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:22]

The process is as follows:

* Heat petroleum -> vaporisation.
* Vapour passes through fractionating column.
* Vapour cools and condenses.
* Lighter fractions, which have lower BP are collected at the top as gases.
* Heavier fractions, which have higher BP are collected at the bottom.

As the molecular size of the hydrocarbon increases, the following changes take place:

* The flammability of the substance decreases.
* The viscosity of the substance increases.
* The melting and boiling points of the substance increases.

The uses of the different fractions are as follows:

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|} \hline
**Fraction** & **Use(s)** \\ \hline Petroleum gas & Fuel for cooking \\ \hline Petrol/gasoline & Fuel for motorcars \\ \hline Naptha & Feedstock for making petrochemicals (e.g. plastics) \\ \hline Kerosene/paraffin & Fuel for aircraft engines \\ \hline Diesel oil & Fuel for diesel engines in buses, lorries and trains \\ \hline Lubricating oil & Lubricating machines, making waxes and polishes \\ \hline Bitumen & Road surfaces, roofing \\ \hline \end{tabular}

#### Chapter 22 - Alkanes and Alkenes

#### 4.2.1 Alkanes

Alkanes are saturated hydrocarbons. As you go down the series, their melting and boiling points increase, they become more viscous and they become less flammable. Alkanes are generally unreactive.

#### 4.2.2 Melting and Boiling Points

As the molecular sizes increase, the melting and boiling points of the alkanes increase. This is because as the sizes of the alkane molecules increase, the forces of attraction between the molecules become stronger.

#### 4.2.3 Viscosity

Alkanes become more viscous as their molecular size increase. This is due to the stronger forces of attraction between the molecules.

#### 2.4.1 Alkanes - Flammability

Alkanes are flammable. As the sizes of the alkane molecules increase, the percentage of carbon in the alkane molecule also increases. They become less flammable.

#### 2.4.2 Alkenes

They go through combustion and addition reactions.

#### 2.4.3 Hydrogenation

At 200\({}^{\circ}\)C in the presence of a nickel catalyst, alkenes react with hydrogen to form alkanes. When alkenes undergo hydrogenation, the C=C bond is broken.

#### 2.4.4 Hydration

Alkenes react with steam to produce alcohols. The conditions required are a temperature of 300\({}^{\circ}\)C and a pressure of 60atm. The reaction also requires a phosphoric(V) acid catalyst.

#### 2.4.5 Bromination

Bromination is an irreversible reaction.

#### 2.4.6 Catalytic Cracking

We can produce alkenes by catalytic cracking. Cracking refers to the break-down of long-chain hydrocarbons into smaller molecules. During catalytic cracking, the long-chain alkanes produce a mixture of short-chain alkenes and a mixture of short-chain alkanes or hydrogen gas.

Cracking is important. Alkenes are used as starting materials for making ethanol and plastics. It is also used to produce hydrogen. It is an important starting material in the manufacture of ammonia in the Haber process. Cracking is used to produce petrol. Hydrocarbons of higher molecular mass are converted into smaller molecules which are ideal for petrol and refinery gas (high demand).

#### 2.4.7 Importances of cracking:

* Produce short-chain alkenes
* Produce hydrogen
* Produce petrol

#### 2.4.8 Fats and Oils

Some fats and oils are polyunsaturated. This is because their hydrocarbon chains contain more than 1 C=C double bond. Fats are solids at room temperature and pressure. They contain mainly saturated fat molecules. Oils are liquids at room temperature and pressure. They contain a higher percentage of unsaturated fat molecules.

### Production of Margarine

Hydrogen is added to vegetable oil. A temperature of 200\({}^{\circ}\)C and a nickel catalyst are used. The greater the amount of hydrogen used, the more solid the margarine becomes.

The difference between unsaturated and polyunsaturated is that saturated substances only have 1 C=C bond but polyunsaturated substances have many C=C bonds.

### _Alcohols_

As the molecular size of the alcohol increases, the solubility decreases. The boiling point increases as well. The boiling point increases as the size of the alcohol molecules increase and the forces of attraction between the molecules also increase.

### _Oxidation_

Alcohols can undergo oxidation when heated with an oxidising agent like potassium permanganate. A carboxylic acid and water are formed.

### _Case Study - Ethanol_

Ethanol can be prepared via 2 methods - from ethene or by fermentation.

### _Producing Ethanol from Ethene_

Ethene undergoes hydration and in doing so produces ethanol. Steam is added to ethene. The reaction is carried out at 300\({}^{\circ}\)C, 60atm with the addition of a phosphoric(V) acid catalyst.

Ethanol is used in alcoholic drinks, as a solvent in deodorants etc. and as a fuel in cars and in cooking.

### _Producing Ethanol by Fermentation_

The reaction in the fermentation process is as follows: glucose solution in the presence of yeast > ethanol + carbon dioxide. Glucose solution is mixed with yeast and the mixture is kept at a temperature of around 37\({}^{\circ}\)C. Its purpose is because enzymes in yeast work best at around 37\({}^{\circ}\)C. If the temperature is raised beyond 37\({}^{\circ}\)C, then the enzymes will be denatured and are unable to catalyse, stopping the reaction.

Think about it this way: ethanol is obtained from glucose which is widely available in sugary drinks. Through fermentation, ethanol is produced. The profit margin is very large as sugar is cheap but ethanol, an expensive liquor, is produced.

#### Carboxylic Acids

_Producing Carboxylic Acids_

To produce a carboxylic acid, an alcohol must be oxidised. It can be oxidised by either two methods - by acidified potassium manganate(VII) or atmospheric oxygen.

Special reaction to distinguish a normal acid from a carboxylic acid is that only carboxylic acids undergo esterification.

#### Reactive Metal

When a carboxylic acid reacts with a reactive metal, the reactive metal displaces the hydrogen from the O-H bond.

#### Esterification

When ethanoic acid is warmed with ethanol in the presence of a few drops of concentrated sulfuric acid, water and an ester called ethyl ethanoate are produced. Concentrated sulfuric acid acts as a catalyst for the reaction. Esters are colourless liquids which are insoluble in water. To separate a mixture of ethyl ethanoate (an ester) and water, a separating funnel must be used since they are immiscible liquids. Esterification is a reversible reaction.

During esterification, the ester produced will have a boiling point lower than its constituent alcohol and carboxylic acid.

Esters are used in the preparation of artificial food flavourings and solvents for perfumes etc.

#### Isomerism

Isomers are compounds with the same molecular formula but different structural formula. Now, suppose you have two compounds, **A** on the left and **B** on the right. Are **A** and **B** isomers of each other? No, they are not. The structural formulae are the same.

### Addition Polymerisation

Addition polymerisation occurs when unsaturated monomers join together without losing any molecules or atoms. The polymer formed is called an addition polymer.

### Formation of Polyethene

At high temperature and pressure and in the presence of a catalyst, the C=C double bonds of the ethene molecules break. Each monomer forms single bonds with 2 other monomers and eventually, they join to form polyethene.

### Condensation Polymerisation

Condensation polymerisation occurs when monomers combine to form a polymer with the removal of a small molecule such as water. There are 2 main groups of condensation polymers: the polyamides and polyesters.

### Differences between Addition Polymerisation and Condensation Polymerisation

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|} \hline
**Addition polymerisation** & **Condensation polymerisation** \\ \hline Does not involve the removal of small molecules & Involves the removal of small molecules \\ \hline Products are non-biodegradable & Products are biodegradable \\ \hline Monomers are unsaturated & Monomers are saturated \\ \hline Involves C=C bonds & Involves other bonds like -OH, -COOH \\  & and -NH2 \\ \hline Uses: plastic bags, toys, buckets, cling film & Uses: clothes, curtains, parachutes, fishing lines, plastic bags \\ \hline \end{tabular}

### Nylon - A Synthetic Polyamide

Nylon is made from a dicarboxylic acid and a diamine. Recall that the functional group for carboxylic acids is -COOH and for amines, it is -NH2.

Nylon is a polyamide as it contains many amide linkages. The amide linkage is as shown.

#### 4.1.1 Terylene - A Synthetic Polyester

Terylene is made from a dicarboxylic acid and a diol. Recall that the functional group for carboxylic acids is -COOH. Diol means an alcohol with 2 -OH functional groups.

Terylene is a polyester as it contains many ester linkages. The ester linkage is as shown.

On the combustion of Terylene, CO\({}_{2}\), CO and H\({}_{2}\)O are formed.
