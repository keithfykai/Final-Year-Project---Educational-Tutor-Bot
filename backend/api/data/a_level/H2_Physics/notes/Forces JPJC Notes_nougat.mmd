A force is any interaction between two objects.
* It must be acted by one object on another, and can either be a push or a pull.
* It is a vector; it has both magnitude and direction.
* The S.I. unit of force is the newton (N).
* A combination of multiple forces acting on a body can change its motion, cause it to rotate or change its shape and size by stretching, compressing or twisting.

In this topic, we will cover the common _types of forces_, the _turning effect of forces_ as well as _forces in equilibrium_. The next topic Dynamics will cover how forces affect the motion of objects in detail.

## 2 Types of Forces

At present, there are four known fundamental forces:

1. _gravitational force_ - acts between all particles, and is the dominant force for shaping the large scale structure of galaxies, stars, etc,
2. _electromagnetic force_ - acts between charged particles and accounts for the bonding energy of atoms and molecules,
3. _weak force_ - responsible for radioactive decay, and
4. _strong force_ - holds neutrons and protons together in a nucleus.

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:3]

Each pole of a magnet produces a **magnetic field** in which another magnetic pole will experience a **magnetic force**.

Two poles of the same polarity will repel each other, while those of unlike polarity will attract each other.

A current-carrying conductor or a moving charge in a magnetic field will also experience a **magnetic force** (refer to _Electromagnetism_). The direction of the force is perpendicular to the directions of both the current or moving charge and the magnetic field, as shown in Fig. 4.

## 2.4 Contact forces

When atoms of one object are too close to the atoms of another object, there will be a **contact force** between them.

All contact forces are _electromagnetic forces_ in nature.

Examples of contact forces are pull, push, tension, compression, frictional forces, normal contact forces, viscous forces.

This video from YouTube aims to address the question on when we touch an object, are we really in contact with that object?

#### 2.2.1 Tension and compression

Under the influence of applied forces, every material deforms to some extent. The shape or volume of a material changes when external forces act on it.

#### Hooke's Law

1. recall and apply Hooke's law (_F_ = _k_x, where \(k\) is the force constant) to new situations or to solve related problems.

_Hooke's Law states that the extension (or compression) of a material is directly proportional to the force required to extend (or compress) it, provided the limit of proportionality is not exceeded._

Mathematically, it is written as

\[F\propto X\qquad\text{or}\qquad\qquad F=k\alpha\]

where _F_: load or force applied to the material _x_: extension in material _k_: proportionality constant, or force constant (S.I. unit: N m\({}^{-1}\))

Figure 5: (a) A bar in tension, and (b) the bar under compression

Figure 6: A spring loaded vertically

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:6]

**Example 1**:

A spring is hung vertically, and an object of mass 0.550 kg is attached to the lower end of the spring. As a result, the spring is stretched by 2.0 cm.

Calculate the force constant.

**Solutions**

Using Hooke's law,

\(F=k\alpha\)

\(mg=k\alpha\)

\(k=\frac{mg}{x}=\frac{0.550\times 9.81}{0.020}\)

\(=270\) Nm\({}^{-1}\)

**Example 2**:

Two light identical springs, each of force constant 270 N m\({}^{-1}\), are connected in series. One end of the combination is secured to the ceiling and a load of mass 1.10 kg is attached to the lower end.

Assuming the limits of proportionality of the springs have not been exceeded, determine

(a) the total extension, and

(b) the force constant of the combination.

**Solutions**

(a) Consider one spring loaded with mass 1.10 kg,

using Hooke's law,

\(F=k\alpha\)

\(mg=k\alpha\)

\(x=\frac{mg}{k}=\frac{1.10\times 9.81}{270}\)

\(=0.0400\) m

For two identical springs connected in series,

\(x_{\text{total}}=0.0800\) m

(b) Let \(K\) be the force constant of the combination.

Using Hooke's law,

\(F=k\alpha_{\text{total}}\)

\(mg=k^{\prime}\alpha_{\text{total}}\)

\(k^{\prime}=\frac{mg}{x_{\text{total}}}=\frac{1.10\times 9.81}{0.0800}\)

\(=135\) N m\({}^{-1}\)

#### 2.2.2 Normal contact force

_(c)_: show a qualitative understanding of normal contact forces, frictional forces and viscous forces including air resistance (no treatment of the coefficients of friction and viscosity is required)._

The **normal contact force** is the perpendicular force exerted by the surface of one object on the surface of another when they are in physical contact and it prevents the objects from passing through each other (See Fig. 9).

* It only exists when an object is in contact with another object.
* It is always perpendicular to the contact surface, and its direction is through the object of interest.
* Its magnitude can change; it is not always equal to the weight of the object.

#### 2.2.3 Frictional and Viscous forces

**Frictional forces** are those that resist motion, and are dissipative (i.e. to cause to lose energy irreversibly) in nature.

* The friction for an object against a surface is proportional to the normal contact force exerted by the surface on the object.
* The direction of the friction is opposite to the actual motion (kinetic friction) or the impending motion (static friction) of the object relative to the surface.
* The magnitude of frictional force experienced is independent of the area of contact between the surfaces.

Frictional forces are essential in our everyday lives. Friction makes it possible to grip and hold things, drive a car, walk and run. However, frictional forces are also responsible for the wear and tear of many engines.

When an object moves in a **fluid (i.e. liquid or gas)**, it will experience resistance. This is called **viscous force or drag force**. The magnitude of this force depends on

* the speed of the object
* the shape and size of the object
* the viscosity of the fluid
* the density of the fluid

Figure 9: Normal contact forces

## 3 CENTRE OF GRAVITY

_(d) show an understanding that the weight of a body may be taken as acting at a single point known as its centre of gravity._

The **centre of gravity** of a body is the single point at which the entire weight of the body can be considered to act.

If a body is symmetrical and of uniform density, then the centre of mass is at the geometrical centre of the body.

An object will always balance if you support it at its centre of gravity.

For an irregularly shaped object, or one of non-uniform density, the centre of gravity can be found by using a plumbline.

Figure 10: Determining the centre of gravity of an irregularly shaped object

## 4 TURNing Effect of Forces

_(e)_ _define and apply the moment of a force and the torque of a couple._

### Moment of Force

Besides causing a change in the translational motion of a body, a force can also produce a turning effect or rotation of the body about a pivot. The turning effect of a force is called its _moment_.

The line of action of a force refers to the line along which the force is acting.

Length refers to the perpendicular distance between the pivot P and the line of action of the force. In Fig. 11,.

Thus, the anti-clockwise moment of force about P

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:11]

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:12]

## 5 Free Body Diagram

**Free-body diagrams** (FBD) of a body are diagrams used to show the points of action and the direction of all external forces acting on it in a given situation.

The direction of the arrow reveals the direction in which the force is acting. The arrow is usually drawn such that it is directed away from the body, with its tail starting from the point of action on the body.

These forces are usually labelled as "_(type of)_ force (acting on the _body_) by the _external agent_". For example, the (gravitational) force (acting on the body) by the Earth is also known as the weight of the body.

For each of the following cases, draw the FBD of the following object(s):

\begin{tabular}{|c|} \hline
1) & An egg is free-falling from a nest in \\  & a tree. Neglect air resistance. \\ \hline
2) & A book resting on a table-top. \\ \hline
3) A uniform ladder leaning against a smooth vertical wall and a rough horizontal ground. \\ \hline
4) & A suspended traffic light \\ \hline \end{tabular}

## 6 Equilibrium of Forces

1. apply the principle of moments to new situations or to solve related problems. 2. show an understanding that, when there is no resultant force and no resultant torque, a system is in equilibrium. 3. use a vector triangle to represent forces in equilibrium.

### Conditions for equilibrium

Forces cause objects to move in a linear direction and to rotate about an axis. For any object to be in equilibrium, the following two conditions must be fulfilled:

1. There must be **no resultant force** acting on the object, i.e. \(\sum F=0\). * The vector sum of all the forces acting on the object must be zero. * The object is in translational equilibrium - there is no linear acceleration.
2. There must be **no resultant torque** on the object about any point, i.e. \(\sum\tau=0\). * The vector sum of all torques on the object about any point must be zero. * **Principle of moments**: the sum of clockwise moments about any point equals the sum of the anticlockwise moments about the same point. * The object is in rotational equilibrium.

**Example 5**:
1. Determine if the following uniform rods are in equilibrium.

1. The vector sum of forces is equal to zero. The rod is in translational equilibrium. Taking moments about P, total clockwise moment = (4.0)(0.5) + (1.0)(3.0) = 5.0 N m total anti-clockwise moment = 0 The rod will rotate in a clockwise direction. The rod is not in rotational equilibrium.
2. Resultant force = \(6.0-2.0-2.0\) = 2.0 N (downward), It is not in translational equilibrium. Taking moments about its centre of gravity, total clockwise moment = (2.0)(1.0) = 2.0 N m total anti-clockwise moment = (2.0)(1.0) = 2.0 N m Resultant torque = 0 The rod will not rotate and they are in rotational equilibrium.

2. A uniform plank of mass 40 kg and length 2.0 m is held horizontally by two identical supports at points A and B. Point B is 0.5 m away from the end of the beam at point C as shown in the figure below.

(i) On the figure below, draw the forces acting on the plank.

**Solutions**

There is no resultant torque on the object about any point.

Taking moments about A,

clockwise moment = anti-clockwise moment

\(40\times 9.81\times 1.0=F_{B}\times 1.5\)

\(F_{B}=\dfrac{40\times 9.81\times 1.0}{1.5}=261.6\approx 262\) N

There is no resultant force on the object.

\(\sum F=0\)

\(F_{A}=(40\times 9.81)-261.6=130.8\approx 131\) N 

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:16]

**Example 6**: A 30 N block is suspended by a rope of negligible mass. A horizontal force \(F\) is applied until the rope makes an angle of \(30^{\circ}\) with the vertical.

Calculate

(i) the tension in the rope,

(ii) the magnitude of \(F\) required to hold the block in equilibrium in that position.

**Solutions**

**Method 1: Resolving forces into vertical and horizontal components**

Vertically,

\(W=T\cos 30^{\circ}\Rightarrow T=\frac{30}{\cos 30^{\circ}}=35\) N

Horizontally,

\(F=T\sin 30^{\circ}=\frac{30}{\cos 30^{\circ}}\times\sin 30^{\circ}=17\) N

**Method 2: Drawing a vector diagram**

- Since the block is in equilibrium, a vector triangle is drawn.

\(\cos 30^{\circ}=\frac{W}{T}\Rightarrow T=\frac{30}{\cos 30^{\circ}}=35\) N

\(F\)

\(\tan 30^{\circ}=\frac{F}{W}\)

\(\Rightarrow F=W\tan 30^{\circ}=30\times\tan 30^{\circ}=17\) N

**Example 7**: A uniform rod XY of weight 10.0 N is freely hinged to a wall at X. It is held horizontal by a force \(F\) acting from Y at an angle of 60.0\({}^{\circ}\) to the vertical as shown in the diagram below.

Determine

(a) the magnitude of \(F\).

(b) the magnitude and direction of the reaction force by the hinge on the rod at X.

Solutions

Let the length of the rod XY be \(L\).

Let the reaction force exerted by the hinge on the rod be \(R\).

(a) Taking moments about X,

Total anti-clockwise moments = total clockwise moments

\((F\cos 60.0^{\circ})(L)=(10.0)\biggl{(}\frac{L}{2}\biggr{)}\)

\(F\) = 10.0 N

(b) Let \(R\) be the reaction force by the hinge on the rod.

Let \(R_{x}\) be the horizontal component and \(R_{y}\) be the vertical component.

The rod is in translational equilibrium.

The weight does not have a horizontal component.

Force \(F\) has a rightward horizontal component.

Therefore the direction of \(R_{x}\) must be leftward.

Horizontally: \(\sum F_{x}=0\)

\(R_{x}=F\sin 60.0^{\circ}\)

\(R_{x}=8.66\) N

Vertically: \(\sum F_{y}=0\)

\(R_{y}+F\cos 60.0^{\circ}=10.0\)

\(R_{y}=5.00\) N

\(R=\sqrt{R_{x}^{2}+R_{y}^{2}}=\sqrt{8.66^{2}+5.00^{2}}\)

\(R=10.0\) N

\(\alpha=\frac{R_{y}}{R_{x}}\)

\(R_{x}=8.66\) N

Therefore, \(R\) has a magnitude of 10.0 N, directed at 30.0\({}^{\circ}\) above the horizontal, as shown in the diagram above.

When there are only three non-parallel forces acting on a body in static equilibrium, the line of actions of these forces must intersect at a single point spatially.

This can be proven by considering moments about the point of intersection; the perpendicular distance between any force and the pivot is zero.

Recall that these 3 forces must form a vector triangle.

**Example 8**

A uniform ladder of length 5.00 m and mass 2.00 kg leans against a smooth wall and is supported by a rough ground. Its upper end is at a height of 3.00 m above the ground.

Calculate the force exerted by the smooth wall on the ladder and the force exerted by the rough ground on the ladder.

**Solutions**

Let \(\theta\) be the angle between force \(R\) and the rough ground.

At equilibrium: \(W=R\sin\theta\) condition 1

Let \(\alpha\) be the angle between the ladder and the rough ground.

Taking moments about A, at equilibrium,

\(N\times 3.00=2.00\times 9.81\times 2.50\cos\alpha\) condition 2

\(N=13.08\) N \(\approx\)13.1 N

Consider forces acting vertically,

\(R\sin\theta=W=19.62\) N

Consider forces acting horizontally,

\(R\cos\theta=N=13.08\) N

Therefore \(\tan\theta=\frac{19.62}{13.08}\)

\(\theta=56.3^{\circ}\)

Magnitude of \(R=\sqrt{\left(R\cos\theta\right)^{2}+\left(R\sin\theta\right)^{2}}=\sqrt{13.0 8^{2}+19.62^{2}}\)

\(=23.6\) N

Force exerted by smooth wall on the ladder, \(N\) is 13.1 N to the left.

Force exerted by rough around on the ladder, \(R\) is 23.6 N. 56.3\({}^{\circ}\) above the horizontal, as shown in the diagram.

## 7 Hydrostatic pressure

1. _derive, from the definitions of pressure and density, the equation_ \(p=\rho gh\)_._
2. _solve problems using the equation_ \(p=\rho gh\)_._

A fluid is any substance which can flow. When a substance is said to be a fluid, it must therefore be in its liquid or gas phase. A solid will transmit a force from one place to another; a fluid transmits a pressure.

The density of a substance \(\rho\) is defined as the mass \(m\) per unit volume \(V\).

\[\rho=\frac{m}{V}\] The Sl unit for \(\rho\) is kg m\({}^{-3}\).

Pressure is defined as average force acting per unit area, where the force \(F\) acts perpendicularly to the area \(A\).

\[p=\frac{F}{A}\] The Sl unit for \(p\) is N m\({}^{-2}\) or Pa.

The link between density and pressure comes when we deal with fluids. Consider a point at a depth \(h\) below the surface of a fluid of density \(\rho_{fluid}\) in a container (see Fig. 16).

_What is the pressure due to the fluid?_

The pressure can be determined by finding the weight of the column of fluid acting above a very small area \(A\) at that depth.

The weight \(W\) of the column of fluid is

\[W=m_{fluid}g\] \[=\rho_{fluid}V_{fluid}g\] \[=\rho_{fluid}Ang\]

Therefore, the pressure \(p\) in a column of fluid is

\[p=\frac{W}{A}=\frac{\rho_{fluid}Ang}{A}=\rho_{fluid}gh\]

where \(\rho_{fluid}\): density of fluid

\(g\): acceleration due to gravity

\(h\): depth from the surface of the fluid

* The pressure due to a column of fluid is independent of its cross-section area.
* Hydrostatic pressure increases linearly with increasing depth.
* Additional pressure acting on the fluid surface (e.g. atmospheric pressure) will be added onto the hydrostatic pressure at depth \(h\), i.e.

**The total pressure at the base of the column of fluid is given by**

pressure = \(\rho gh\) + atmospheric pressure at the fluid surfaceExample 9: A long narrow tube is filled with water of density 1020 kg m\({}^{-3}\) to a depth of 1.00 m. The tube is then inclined at 40\({}^{\circ}\) to the horizontal as shown.

If the atmospheric pressure, \(p_{\mathrm{arm}}\) = 100 kPa, the density of water, \(\rho\) = 1020 kg m\({}^{-3}\), calculate the pressure at point X inside the tube.

Solutions: Pressure at point X inside tube

\(=\rho gh+p_{\mathrm{arm}}\)

\(=1020\times 9.81\times 1.00\sin 40^{\circ}+100\times 10^{3}\)

\(=106\) kPa

## 8 Uptrust

_(1) show an understanding of the origin of the force of upthrust acting on a body in a fluid._ _(2) state that upthrust is equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to the weight of the fluid displaced by a submerged or floating object._ _(3) calculate the upthrust in terms of the weight of the displaced fluid._ _(4) recall and apply the principle that, for an object floating in equilibrium, the upthrust is equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to the weight of the object to new situations or to solve related problems._

In this section, we will investigate the buoyant force exerted by a fluid. Archimedes came up with a principle that explains the force known as the **upthrust**.

* It is a net upward force acting on a body when it is immersed in a fluid.
* It is exerted by the fluid.
* It is due to the difference in pressure at the top and bottom of the immersed portion of the body, as shown in Fig. 17.

Consider a submarine submerged in water, as shown in Fig. 17.

The arrows represent the forces which act at right angles to the surface of the submarine.

Sideways forces cancel out.

Upward forces on the bottom surface are larger than the downward forces on the top surface due to higher hydrostatic pressure at greater depth.

The resultant of all of these forces is an upward force - the upthrust.

## 9 Archimedes principle

**Archimedes' principle states that**

_The upthrust acting on a body due to a fluid is equal to the weight of the fluid it has displaced._

**Note**: Do not use the mass and density of the immersed object to determine upthrust!

Figure 17: A submarine submerged in water

### 5.4 Derivation of Archimedean principle

Consider an object of uniform cross-sectional area \(A\) and length \(L\) fully immersed in a fluid of density \(\rho\). The upper surface of the object is at depth \(h\).

The atmospheric pressure is \(p_{\mathrm{turn}}\). This is shown in Fig. 19.

pressure on top surface, \(p_{1}=h\rho g+p_{\mathrm{turn}}\)

downward force on top surface = \(p_{1}\)\(A\)

pressure on bottom surface, \(p_{2}=(L+h)\rho g+p_{\mathrm{turn}}\)

upward force on bottom surface = \(p_{2}A\)

upthrust acting on the object

\(=p_{2}A-p_{3}A\)

\(=L\rho gA\)

\(=(LA)\rho g\)

\(=V_{\mathrm{displaced fluid}}\rho g\)

\(=m_{\mathrm{displaced fluid}}g\)

\(=W_{\mathrm{displaced fluid}}\)

**Example 10**: A submerged marker buoy is anchored to the sea floor by a rope as shown. The buoy has volume 6.50 \(\times\) 10\({}^{-2}\) m\({}^{3}\) and mass 6.00 kg. The mass of the rope may be neglected. The sea water may be assumed to be still and to have a density 1.03 \(\times\) 10\({}^{3}\) kg m\({}^{-3}\).

Determine the tension in the rope.

**Solutions**

Upthrust \(U\) = weight of the fluid displaced

\(=V\rho g\)

\(=(6.50\times 10^{-2})(1.03\times 10^{3})(9.81)\)

\(=657\) N

Since the buoy is stationary, the forces acting on the buoy are in equilibrium.

tension + weight = upthrust

tension = \(657-(6.00)(9.81)\)

\(=598\) N

tension

Figure 19: A cylinder submerged in a fluid

**Fig. 20 A piece of ice floating in water**

Only a portion of the ice is immersed in the water. Therefore, from Archimedes' principle, we can determine that the upthrust acting on the partially-immersed ice is equal to the weight of water displaced by the ice, as indicated by the dashed rectangle in Fig. 20.

In order for the ice to remain floating at the water surface (i.e. in equilibrium), the upthrust acting on the ice must be equal to the weight of the ice.

\(\bullet\) By extension, the weight of the fluid displaced equals the weight of the ice.

\(\bullet\) When a body is fully submerged in water, it floats upwards if the upthrust is greater than its weight. If the reverse is true, it sinks.

_Think about this..._

Most metals sink in water. You would think it is because metals are denser than water.

If that is the case, why do ships made out of heavy metals like steel float on water then?

**Example 11**

A solid has density 4.0 g cm\({}^{-3}\). Calculate the density of a liquid in which the solid would float with one-fifth of its total volume exposed above the liquid surface.

**Solutions**

Let \(V\) be the volume of the solid.

The solid is in equilibrium when it is floating.

weight of solid = upthrust

= weight of fluid displaced

\(\rho_{\rm s}Vg=\rho_{\rm s}\left(\frac{4V}{5}\right)g\)

\(\therefore\rho_{\rm i}=\frac{5}{4}\,\rho_{\rm s}=5.0\) g cm\({}^{-3}\)
