### Physical Properties

#### 1.2.1 Volatility

Comparison with compounds of other homologous series

Carboxylic acids have higher boiling points than the corresponding alkanes and alcohols of similar \(M_{r}\).

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|} \hline
**compound** & \(M_{r}\) & **b boiling points / \({}^{\circ}\)C** \\ \hline CH\({}_{5}\)CH\({}_{2}\)CH\({}_{2}\)CH\({}_{3}\) & 58 & \(-0.5\) \\ \hline CH\({}_{5}\)CH(OH)CH\({}_{3}\) & 60 & 97 \\ \hline CH\({}_{3}\)CO\({}_{2}\)H & 60 & 118 \\ \hline \end{tabular}

Reasons are:

\begin{tabular}{l} Carboxylic acids can form hydrogen bonds with each other. \\ \end{tabular}

\begin{tabular}{l} Carboxylic acids form stronger hydrogen bonds than alcohols because the **-OH group is more polarised** \\ due to the presence of the **electron-withdrawing** \\ **carbonyl group**. Hence, the H atom is more electron- \\ deficient, i.e. greater \(\delta\)+. \\ \end{tabular}

\begin{tabular}{l} Carboxylic acid molecules **dimerise** in the vapour state and in non-polar solvents, forming two hydrogen bonds between each pair of molecules. \\ \end{tabular}

However, in polar solvents such as water, the molecules exist as monomers or dissociate to some extent into H\({}^{+}\) and RCO\({}_{2}\)\({}^{-}\):

\[\text{RCO}_{2}\text{H}+\text{H}_{2}\text{O}\rightleftharpoons\text{RCO}_{2} ^{-}+\text{H}_{3}\text{O}^{+}\]

\begin{tabular}{l} Sahl Check 1A. \\ \end{tabular}

Explain, with the aid of a suitable diagram, why the relative molecular mass of ethanoic acid in benzene is approximately 120, but in water it is 60.

_Modified from J88/1/2(a)_Carboxylic Acids and Derivatives

Comparison within the homologous series

Boiling points **increase with** increasing relative molecular mass because this leads to an **increase in the number of electrons** the molecules have and thus lead to **stronger instantaneous dipole-induced dipole interactions between the molecules**.

#### 1.2.2 Solubility

The lower aliphatic acids are completely miscible with water because of:

the ability of the -CO\({}_{2}\)H group to form **hydrogen bonds** with water molecules.

However, as the hydrocarbon chain lengthens, the **permanent dipole-induced dipole** (pd-**pd**) **interactions** between the larger non-polar alkyl group and water molecules do not **release sufficient energy** to overcome the strong **hydrogen bonds** between the water molecules. In addition, the larger alkyl group also **hinders the formation of hydrogen bonds between the carboxylic acid functional group and water molecules**.

Benzoic acid dissolves readily in hot water but forms white needle crystals when cooled as it is only slightly soluble in cold water.

**At the end of sections 1.1 and 1.2, you should know that:**

1. The carbon atom in a COOH group is sp\({}^{2}\) hybridised and is trigonal planar.
2. The COOH group forms hydrogen bonds with water, making carboxylic acids soluble in water.
3. When the carbon chain lengthens, the energy released from the pd-pd interactions is insufficient to overcome the strong hydrogen bonds between water molecules. The larger alkyl group also hinders the formation of H-bonds between the COOH group and water molecules. Hence solubility decreases.
4. Carboxylic acids dimerise in the vapour state and in non-polar solvents.

#### 1.3.4 Hydrolysis of nitriles

Acidic hydrolysis Nitriles can be hydrolys to carboxylic acids by heating it with a strong acid.

(Is this reaction considered an oxidation reaction since the C in the CN gained two O atoms when forming the RCO\({}_{2}\)H? Why or why not?)

R-C\(\equiv\)N + 2H\({}_{2}\)O + H\({}^{+}\)

heat

RCO\({}_{2}\)H + NH\({}_{4}\)\({}^{+}\)

Reagents and conditions:HC\(l\)(aq) or H\({}_{2}\)SO\({}_{4}\)(aq), heat

Alkaline hydrolysis Nitriles are hydrolys to carboxylic acids by heating with aqueous alkali followed by acidification (to convert the carboxylate formed to carboxylic acid).

R-C\(\equiv\)N + H\({}_{2}\)O + OH\({}^{-}\)

heat

RCO\({}_{2}\)H + NH\({}_{4}\)\({}^{+}\)

Reagents and conditions: NaOH (aq), heat, followed by HC\(l\)(aq) or H\({}_{2}\)SO\({}_{4}\)(aq)

At the end of section 1.3, you should know that:

1. Carboxylic acids can be synthesised by oxidising primary alcohols and aldehydes with KMnO\({}_{4}\)(aq), H\({}_{2}\)SO\({}_{4}\)(aq), heat **OR** K\({}_{2}\)Cr\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{7}\)(aq), H\({}_{2}\)SO\({}_{4}\)(aq), heat.
2. Carboxylic acids can be synthesised by oxidative cleavage of alkenes with KMnO\({}_{4}\)(aq), H\({}_{2}\)SO\({}_{4}\)(aq), heat.
3. Benzoic acid can be synthesised by oxidation of an alkylbenzene with KMnO\({}_{4}\)(aq), H\({}_{2}\)SO\({}_{4}\)(aq), heat.
4. Carboxylic acids can be synthesised by hydrolysing nitriles with H\({}_{2}\)SO\({}_{4}\)(aq), heat **OR** NaOH(aq), heat, followed by H\({}_{2}\)SO\({}_{4}\)(aq) or HC(aq).

#### 1.4.2 Fission of the O-H bond

#### 1.4.2.1 Acidity

LO (c) explain the acidity of carboxylic acids and of chlorine-substituted ethanolic acids in terms of their structures

Carboxylic acids are weak acids as they dissociate only partially in water.

\begin{tabular}{c c c c c c} RCO\({}_{2}\)H & + & H\({}_{2}\)O & \(\rightleftharpoons\) & RCO\({}_{2}\) & + & H\({}_{3}\)O\({}^{+}\) \\ weak acid & & & & & carboxylate anion \\ \end{tabular}

Carboxylic acids are **stronger acids** than alcohols/phenols.

(I) **Comparison of the acid strengths of compounds containing -OH group**

\begin{tabular}{c c c c c c} Compound & CH\({}_{3}\)CH\({}_{2}\)OH & H\({}_{2}\)O & & CH\({}_{3}\)CO\({}_{2}\)H & & C\(\&\)CH\({}_{2}\)CO\({}_{2}\)H \\ \end{tabular}

\begin{tabular}{c c c c c c} _K\({}_{a}\) / mol dm\({}^{-3}\) & \(1.3\times 10^{-16}\) & \(1.6\times 10^{-16}\) & \(1.0\times 10^{-10}\) & \(1.7\times 10^{-5}\) & \(6.3\times 10^{-5}\) & \(1.4\times 10^{-3}\) \\ \end{tabular}

Generally, ** alcohols < water (reference) < phenols < carboxylic acids**

The relative acidities of organic compounds containing -OH groups may be explained in terms of the **stability of the conjugate base formed** upon dissociation of the acid in water.

_Important:_

The more stable the **conjugate base** formed from the dissociation of a proton from the molecule, the less likely it is to accept the proton (backward reaction), and hence the more likely is the forward dissociation reaction to proceed \(\Rightarrow\) stronger acid.

A **carboxylic acid** dissociates to give the **carboxylate** ion, RCO\({}_{2}\)\({}^{-}\) (conjugate base of RCO\({}_{2}\)H).

\begin{tabular}{c c c c c} RCO\({}_{2}\)H & + & H\({}_{2}\)O & \(\rightleftharpoons\) & RCO\({}_{2}\) & + & H\({}_{3}\)O\({}^{+}\) \\ weak acid & & & & carboxylate anion & \\ \end{tabular}

\begin{tabular}{c c c c} RCO\({}_{2}\)\({}^{-}\) forms **2 equivalent** & **resonance structures** with **delocalisation of the negative charge over 2 highly electronegative O atoms (resonance effect)**.

This results in the carboxylate anion being **greatly stabilised** compared to phenoxide and alkoxide ions and its formation is energetically favoured.

[MISSING_PAGE_POST]

\begin{tabular}{c

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:12]

\begin{tabular}{l|c} \hline
**carboxylic acid** & **pK\({}_{\text{a}}\)** \\ \hline CH\({}_{2}\)C/CO\({}_{2}\)H & 2.86 \\ CHC\({}_{2}\)CO\({}_{2}\)H & 1.29 \\ CC\({}_{b}\)CO\({}_{2}\)H & 0.65 \\ \hline \end{tabular}

The **greater** the number of **electron-withdrawing** substituent groups, the **greater** the **extent of negative charge dispersal on RCO\({}_{2}\)**. The conjugate base of the acid is **stabilised** and the acidity is **increased**.

The **greater** the number of **electron-donating** groups, the **more intensified the negative charge on RCO\({}_{2}\)**. The conjugate base of the acid is **destabilised** and the acidity is **decreased**.

Example: C\({}_{b}\)CCO\({}_{2}\)H (pK\({}_{\text{a}}\) = 0.65) is a stronger acid than C\({}_{b}\)CH\({}_{2}\)CO\({}_{2}\)H (pK\({}_{\text{a}}\) = 2.86).

Positions of substituents

\begin{tabular}{|l|c|} \hline
**carboxylic acid** & **pK\({}_{\text{a}}\)** \\ \hline CH\({}_{3}\)CH\({}_{2}\)CHC/CO\({}_{2}\)H & 2.86 \\ \hline CH\({}_{3}\)CHC/CH\({}_{2}\)CO\({}_{2}\)H & 4.05 \\ \hline CH\({}_{2}\)C/CH\({}_{2}\)CH\({}_{2}\)CO\({}_{2}\)H & 4.52 \\ \hline \end{tabular}

as the substituent is further from the CO\({}_{2}\)H group. The **closer** the electron-withdrawing substituents are to the \(-\)CO\({}_{2}\)H, the **more** acidic the carboxylic acid.

E.g. CH\({}_{3}\)CH\({}_{2}\)CHC/CO\({}_{2}\)H (pK\({}_{\text{a}}\) = 2.86) is a stronger acid than CH\({}_{2}\)C/CH\({}_{2}\)CH\({}_{2}\)CO\({}_{2}\)H (pK\({}_{\text{a}}\) = 4.52).

An increase in distance between the C\(l\) atom and carboxyl group disperses the negative charge on the anion to a smaller extent.

#### 1.4.2.2 Salt formation

Due to its ability to act as an acid, carboxylic acids react with **metals, alkalis, carbonates, hydrogen carbonates** and **aq NH3** to form salts.

#### Reduction to alcohols

Carboxylic acids can be **reduced to primary alcohols** by using lithium aluminium hydride (LiAHR\({}_{4}\)) in dry ether at room temperature.

Please refer to Appendix for a detailed experimental procedure.

#### Distinguishing test for carboxylic acids

* Add **aqueous** sodium carbonate, Na\({}_{2}\)CO\({}_{3}\)(aq) (or NaHCO\({}_{3}\)(aq)) at room temperature.
* Effervescence of CO\({}_{2}\) observed. Gas evolved forms white precipitate in Ca(OH)\({}_{2}\) solution.
* Phenols and aliphatic alcohols **DO NOT** react with Na\({}_{2}\)CO\({}_{3}\)(aq) and NaHCO\({}_{3}\)(aq) to give CO\({}_{2}\) gas.

## 6 At the end of section 1.4, you should know that:

1. Carboxylic acids are resistant to oxidation, except methanoic acid and ethanedoic acid.
2. Methanoic acid and ethanedoic acid can be further oxidised to carbon dioxide and water with KMnO\({}_{4}\)(aq), H\({}_{2}\)SO\({}_{4}\)(aq), heat.
3. Aliphatic carboxylic acids react with aliphatic alcohols in the presence of concentrated H\({}_{2}\)SO\({}_{4}\) and heat to form esters.
4. Carboxylic acids can be converted to acyl chlorides by heating them with PC\({}_{b}\)**OR** heating them with SOC\({}_{l}\)**OR** stirring them with PC\({}_{b}\) at room temperature.
5. The general trend in acidity when comparing aliphatic alcohols, phenols and carboxylic acids is **aliphatic alcohol < phenol < carboxylic acid**.
6. Na\({}_{2}\)CO\({}_{3}\)(aq) is a useful reagent as a chemical test for carboxylic acids as only carboxylic acids are acidic enough to react with Na\({}_{2}\)CO\({}_{3}\)(aq) to give CO\({}_{2}\)(g). Effervescence is observed and the gas evolved forms a white precipitate in Ca(OH)\({}_{2}\)(aq).
7. The greater the number of electron-withdrawing substituents and the closer these substituents are to the COOH group, the stronger the carboxylic acid will be.
8. Carboxylic acids can be reduced to primary alcohols by reacting them with LiA\({}_{4}\)H\({}_{4}\) in dry ether at room temperature.

Relative ease of hydrolysis of acyl chlorides, alkyl chlorides and aryl chlorides

The ease of hydrolysis is dependent on two factors:

Electronic factor:

 ease of cleavage of C-Cl

Steric factors can also facilitate or hinder nucleophilic attack at the carbonyl carbon.

#### 2.3.2 Reactions of esters

Figure 1: **Eunoa Junior College**

#### 2.3.2.1 Laboratory preparation of esters

Ethyl ethanoate can be prepared by the reaction between concentrated ethanoic acid and ethanol in the presence of concentrated H\({}_{2}\)SO\({}_{4}\) as a catalyst.

Please refer to the Appendix for a detailed procedure of this preparation.

\begin{tabular}{c c}  & conc. H\({}_{2}\)SO\({}_{4}\), heat \\ CH\({}_{3}\)CO\({}_{2}\)H + CH\({}_{3}\)CH\({}_{2}\)OH & CH\({}_{3}\)CO\({}_{2}\)CH\({}_{2}\)CH\({}_{3}\) + H\({}_{2}\)O \\ \end{tabular}

The reaction is **reversible**.

As the equilibrium constant is not very large (about 3.4), equilibrium is reached only after many days of heating.

Therefore, **concentrated sulfuric acid is used:**

It acts **as catalyst** to enhance nucleophilic attack on carbonyl carbon (See Appendix).

It also acts as a **dehydrating agent** to remove water, shifting position of equilibrium to the right.

The equilibrium position is driven to the right by using an excess of one of the reactants.

Phenyl benzoate can be prepared by the reaction between benzoyl chloride and phenol in the presence of sodium hydroxide.

\begin{tabular}{c c}  & **Note:** \\ \end{tabular}

To form phenolic esters, we can only use **RCOCI** and sodium phenoxide, or **RCOCI** and phenol. **RCOOH CANNOT** be used.

#### 2.3.2.2 Hydrolysis

LO (h) describe the acid and base hydrolys of esters.

The hydrolysis of esters by heating with water alone occurs very, very slowly. This hydrolysis can be sped up by **heating with acid or alkali**.

(l)Acidic hydrolysis

The hydrolysis of esters is nucleophilic in nature, where the nucleophile is H\({}_{2}\)O (for acidic hydrolysis). The reaction is **reversible**.

(l)Alkaline/Basic hydrolysis

Alkalis promote hydrolysis of esters by providing the strong nucleophile OH\({}^{-}\). Under alkaline conditions, the carboxylic acid is obtained in the form of the carboxylate salt. The reaction is essentially **irreversible**, since a resonance stabilised carboxylate anion shows little tendency to react with an alcohol. Alkaline hydrolysis is often referred to as _saponification_.

_Note:_

If the hydroxy compound formed is a phenol or substituted phenol, then the phenoxide salt is obtained.

Example:

## 4 Annex

### Preparation of ETHYL ETHANOATE

* Mix 50 cm\({}^{3}\) of ethanol and 50 cm\({}^{3}\) of _glacial_ ethanolic acid thoroughly in a 250 cm\({}^{3}\) round-bottomed flask.
* Add _slowly with cooling_ and shaking 10 cm\({}^{3}\) of _concentrated sulfuric acid_.
* **Explain the meaning of the term _glacial_ as applied to ethanoic acid.
* Glacial ethanolic acid is pure ethanolic acid CH\({}_{3}\)CO\({}_{2}\)H. It is called glacial because on cooling it forms glassy crystals.
* **Why is concentrated sulfuric acid used in this procedure?** Concentrated sulfuric acid is a _catalyst_ for the esterification reaction and to remove water. CH\({}_{3}\)CH\({}_{2}\)OH + CH\({}_{3}\)CO\({}_{2}\)H \(\rightleftharpoons\) CH\({}_{3}\)CO\({}_{2}\)CH\({}_{2}\)CH\({}_{3}\) + H\({}_{2}\)O
* **Why must the concentrated sulfuric acid be added slowly and with cooling?** The concentrated sulfuric acid on dilution gives out a lot of heat; the slow addition with cooling is necessary to avoid splashing if the mixture gets hot.
* **Why must the mixture be homogeneous?** Concentrated sulfuric acid is much denser than any of the other reagents. If not well mixed initially, the solution is liable to get too hot and boil uncontrollably when mixing occurs later in the reaction.
* **What is a reflux water-condenser?** A reflux water condenser is a Liebig condenser arranged vertically above the reaction flask; vapors are condensed and returned to the flask, the contents of which can therefore be boiled for long periods without any loss of material.
* **Why is the reaction comparatively slow?** Most organic reactions are slow since they involve the breaking of strong covalent bonds. The proportion of molecular collisions that have the necessary activation energy is usually fairly low.
* **What is the function of the sodium carbonate solution?** The distillate contains traces of ethanoic acid and perhaps some sulfuric acid. Sodium carbonate solution removes this.
* **Why do you need to open the tap from time to time?** The neutralisation with sodium carbonate produces carbon dioxide gas; opening the tap releases this and avoids a build-up of pressure that might blow the stopper out of the funnel.
* **Why is the reaction comparatively slow?** The distillate contains traces of ethanoic acid and perhaps some sulfuric acid. Sodium carbonate solution removes this.
* **Why do you need to open the tap from time to time?** The neutralisation with sodium carbonate produces carbon dioxide gas; opening the tap releases this and avoids a build-up of pressure that might blow the stopper out of the funnel.

* [30] Prepara a solution of 25 g of calcium chloride in 25 cm\({}^{3}\) of water, _add it to the crude ethyl ethanoate_ in the funnel, and shake vigorously. Allow the mixture to separate, and run off the lower aqueous layer as completely as possible.
* [31] Run the ethyl ethanoate into a small conical flask, add a few lumps of granular _anhydrorous calcium chloride_, and shake occasionally until the _liquid is clear_.
* [32] Then decant the liquid into a _clean, dry_ 100 cm\({}^{3}\) round-bottom flask, add some _anti-bumping granules_, and arrange for distillation including a 0-100 \({}^{\circ}\)C thermometer in the apparatus. The distilling flask should be placed in a cold water bath, which is gradually heated. _The ether that is always formed_ in this reaction will distil off at 35-40 \({}^{\circ}\)C, and may be discarded. Continue to heat, and collect the fraction that boils between 74 \({}^{\circ}\)C and 79 \({}^{\circ}\)C.
* [33] **What is the function of the calcium chloride at this stage of the preparation?** The crude ethyl ethanoate contains traces of ethanol; the calcium chloride solution removes this since it complexes with the ethanol
* **What is the function of the calcium chloride at this stage of the preparation?** The solid calcium chloride is a dehydrating agent, it removes any remaining traces of water from the product.
* [34] **What is the nature and purpose of anti-bumping granules?** Anti-bumping granules are small pieces of silica; broken unglazed pottery works as well. This provides a nucleus on which gas bubbles grow, therefore avoiding the sudden production of large gas bubbles which can lead to 'bumping'. This, properly called succession, causes liquid to splash over into the condenser and therefore produce an impure product. Severe bumping can even lead to loss of material through vents or can blow a distillation apparatus apart.
* **Why is an ether formed in this reaction?** An ether is formed because sulfuric acid can cause the elimination of a molecule of water between two alcohol molecules. The water causes the ionisation of the sulfuric acid: CH\({}_{3}\)CH\({}_{2}\)OH + HOCH\({}_{2}\)CH\({}_{3}\) + H\({}_{2}\)SO\({}_{4}\)\(\rightarrow\) CH\({}_{3}\)CH\({}_{2}\)OCH\({}_{2}\)CH\({}_{3}\) + H\({}_{2}\)O\({}^{+}\) + HSO\({}^{+}\)

### A Lithium Aluminum Hydride Reduction

The reaction concerned is the reduction of 2-hydroxybenzoic acid (salicylic acid) to give (2-hydroxyethyl)methanol (saligenin):

\begin{tabular}{p{142.3pt} p{142.3pt}}  & \(\bullet\) & **Why must the apparatus be thoroughly dry?** \\  & & Much of the preparation technique is concerned with preventing the dangerous reaction of lithium aluminium hydride with water - the reaction is exothermic and generates hydrogen, so the danger of explosion is evident. \\  & & **What is the function of calcium chloride guard tubes?** \\  & & Anhydrous calcium chloride is hygroscopic (has a high affinity for water), and the guard tubes prevent water vapour from entering from the atmosphere. Lithium aluminium hydride dust can even catch fire on a damp day. \\  & & **How is ethoxyethane dried?** \\  & & Sodium wire is used. \\  & & **What is the reason for adding a small portion of lithium aluminium hydride initially?** \\  & & This is to remove any traces of water which in spite of the precautions taken may be present in the reaction flask. \\  & & **What is the reason for this stirring?** \\  & & To ensure that the lithium aluminium hydride is dissolved. \\  & & **Why is the mixture cooled?** \\  & & The reduction is exothermic; the boiling temperature of ethoxyethane is 34.5 \({}^{o}\)C and the reaction must at this stage be kept cold to prevent thermal runaway and loss of the ethoxyethane. \\  & & **Why is the mixture heated for 15 minutes?** \\  & & This is to ensure completion of the reduction and the consumption of the lithium aluminium hydride. \\  & & \\ \end{tabular}

* [leftmargin=*]
* Thoroughly chill the mixture in ice-water, and hydrolyse any unused hydride by the _slow_ addition of 50 cm\({}^{3}\)of ordinary undried ethoxyethane, followed by the _slow_ addition of 75 cm\({}^{3}\)of dilute sulphuric acid.
* **Why does the mixture have to be chilled?** The reaction of lithium aluminium hydride with water is very exothermic.
* **Why is the addition of the undried ethoxyethane slow?** To ensure that the reaction with water is not violent.
* **Why is the addition of sulfuric acid slow?** This precautionary, in case any lithium aluminium hydride still remains.
* **What is the purpose of the sulfuric acid?** The hydrolysis of lithium aluminium hydride also gives lithium hydroxide, which is not very soluble in ethoxyethane and gives a white sludge. Sulfuric acid forms water-soluble lithium sulfate which passes into the aqueous layer.
* **Why is the aqueous layer shaken with ethoxyethane?** This extracts any of the organic product that remains in the aqueous layer.
* **Why is the organic product significantly soluble in the aqueous layer?** The two hydroxyl groups make it significantly soluble since they can hydrogen bond with water.
* **Why are two 25 cm\({}^{3}\) portions of ethoxyethane used, rather than one of 50 cm\({}^{3}\)?** The process of solvent extraction is more efficient if several extractions are made rather than just one.
* **How would you know when the solution is dry?** It would be clear rather than cloudy.
* **Why is the solution filtered?** This removes any particles of sodium sulfate.
* **Why should there not be flames anywhere in the laboratory?** The vapour of ethoxyethane is very dense, and can creep along bench surfaces or along the floor. It is possible to ignite it if there are flames on the other side of the room.
* **Why is the minimum amount of boiling water used?** The solution needs to be saturated at the boiling temperature of the solvent to minimise losses.
* **Why is a desicator used rather than drying the crystals in an oven?** The melting temperature of the product is low and it would melt; a desiccator is in any case much more efficient.
