## Introduction

* The propagation of light and sound are examples of wave phenomena.
* the disturbance travels from one region of space to another.
* A wave is a means by which energy may be transferred from one place to another as a result of oscillations. This takes place without the physical transfer of any material between the points.

## Appendix A Classification of Waves

Waves can be classified using:

* Medium through which the wave travels through: Mechanical or electromagnetic
* Motion of waves: Progressive or stationary
* Mode of transport: Transverse or longitudinal

### Medium through which the wave travels through - Mechanical waves and electromagnetic waves

Mechanical waves:

* Mechanical waves require a medium to propagate. Examples include:

* waves in a slinky coil or a rope
* water waves
* sound waves
* seismic waves which travel along the Earth's crust during an earthquake

Electromagnetic waves
* Electromagnetic waves are generally termed "light" but this term includes the entire electromagnetic spectrum (gamma rays, X-rays, ultraviolet rays, visible light, infrared rays, microwaves and radio waves).
* All these forms of light travel at a constant speed in a vacuum (\(c\) = 3.00 x 10\({}^{8}\) m s\({}^{-1}\)) but have different frequencies (different wavelengths).
* Electromagnetic waves do not require a medium to travel.

## Appendix A Appendix

### _Modeling of waves: Progressive waves vs Stationary waves_

Progressive waves (or travelling waves) are waves in which energy is carried from one point to another by means of vibrations or oscillations within the wave.

The profile (the wavefronts) of the wave appears to be moving although the particles in the medium do not get transported along with the wave (a wavefront is a line or surface which marks out all those points on a wave that have the same phase).

(refer to Appendix for more details on wavefront)

Stationary waves:

Stationary waves or standing waves are waves in which the vibrational energy (associated with the waves) is stored (i.e. the energy is not transferred).

The profile of the wave does not appear to move. Energy within the wave is said to be localised (the energy at a specific location maintains a constant value).

This will be covered in greater detail in the Topic "Superposition".

### _Mode of transport (Direction of Oscillation): Transverse vs Longitudinal Waves_

Transverse wave:

A transverse wave is a wave in which the oscillations of the particles in the wave are at right angles to the direction of transfer of energy of the wave.

Longitudinal wave:

A longitudinal wave is a wave in which the oscillations of the particles in the wave are along the direction of transfer of energy of the wave.

Within a longitudinal wave, there are regions of compression where the particles are closer to each other, and regions of rarefaction where the particles are further from each other.

* When the loudspeaker cone at A moves forward, it compresses the air in front of it. As the sound wave passes through air, air molecules vibrate left and right.
* Energy is transferred from A to B but there is no transfer of matter from A to B.

Check Your Understanding 1

1. Radiowave is a longitudinal wave. (True / False)
2. When sound travels from the vocal chords to the ears of a listener, the molecules at the vocal chords must have travelled to the listener's ear. (True / False)

## Appendix B Graphical Representation of Waves

There are two types of graphs associated with waves. They complement each other in representing a particular wave, as waves have both a spatial component as well as a time component.

### Displacement-Distance Graph

Displacement-distance (or displacement-position) graph

* A wave consists of not just one particle, but a series of particles all connected together (like a string of beads).
* Each particle oscillates about its own equilibrium position with the same frequency (i.e. same period).
* This collective string of particles form the wave profile or the shape of the wave.
* For each particle, we can define: \(\circ\) Displacement \(y\), its distance from its equilibrium position. Displacement is a vector quantity, so it can have a positive or negative value. \(\circ\) Amplitude \(y_{\circ}\): its maximum displacement. Amplitude is always positive (magnitude only). \(\circ\) Period of oscillation _T_: The time taken for the particle to complete one cycle.

* A displacement-distance graph shows the displacements of many particles at a given instant in time. (a snapshot of the wave)
* The wavelength \(\lambda\) is the shortest distance between any two successive points on a progressive wave which are vibrating in phase, or equivalently, the distance between two successive crests (or troughs). Displacement-position graph for longitudinal waves (e.g. sound waves)
* For longitudinal waves the displacement of the particles are in the same direction as the transfer of energy of the wave (e.g. for a sound wave travelling to the right, the particles oscillate left and right). As a result, the representation of the displacement-distance graph does not resemble the actual movement of the particles.
* For a longitudinal wave, the displacement-distance graph also allows the identification of points of compression and rarefaction, which are accompanied by the corresponding variations in air pressure.

At compression, the pressure is above normal pressure. At rarefaction, the pressure is below normal pressure

Particles

When a particle on the wave oscillates, its displacement from the equilibrium position varies sinusoidally with time.

The oscillation is one dimensional (restricted to along a single line) and is a function of time only.

This can be plotted on a displacement-time graph, to show how the displacement of a single particle on the wave varies with time.

One cycle on a displacement-time graph represents one period of oscillation - the time taken to generate one cycle of the wave.

The frequency \(f\) of the oscillation (and thus the wave) can be obtained using \(f=\dfrac{1}{T}\). Displacement

### Derivation of \(\nu=f\lambda\)

In one cycle, the crest of the wave travels one wavelength \(\lambda\), and the time taken is one period \(T\).

Wave speed \(\nu\), which is the distance travelled by the wave energy per unit time, is

\[\nu=\dfrac{\lambda}{T}\]

Since frequency \(f\) is the number of cycles per unit time, hence wave speed as

\[\nu=\dfrac{\lambda}{T}=f\lambda\]

Worked Example 1

The wave shown in the following graph is being sent out by a 60 Hz vibrator.

Determine the following for the wave: **(a)** amplitude, **(b)** frequency, **(c)** wavelength, **(d)** speed and **(e)** period.

**Solution**

\(\nu=60\times 0.020=1.2\) m s\({}^{-1}\)

Using \(T=1/f,\ T=1/60=0.017\) s

A wave is represented by the following displacement-position graph. The wave is moving to the right with a speed of 1 m s\({}^{-1}\).

### Example 2

A wave is represented by the following displacement-position graph. The wave is moving to the right with a speed of 1 m s\({}^{-1}\).

### Determination of Frequency of a Wave using a Calibrated Oscilloscope

A calibrated oscilloscope is widely used for displaying waveforms.

These waves are recorded from instruments that measure oscillations (e.g. microphone). The measured oscillations - converted to an oscillating voltage signal - are then displayed on the screen.

The voltage signal is represented on the y-axis. The scale (in volts per division) can be changed by adjusting the _sensitivity_ or _gain control_. An example of a possible setting is 5 V cm\({}^{-1}\).

The x-axis of the display is the time axis. The scale can be changed by adjusting the _time_ base. An example of a possible setting is 2 \(\mu\)s cm\({}^{-1}\).

The frequency of the signal can be thus be determined from the display along the time axis.

**Worked Example 2**

Given:

Sensitivity (y-plates) set at: 10 V cm\({}^{-1}\)

Time base (x-plates) set at: 0.5 ms cm\({}^{-1}\)

What is the frequency of the wave?

**Solution**

Period \(T\) = 4 x 0.5 x 10\({}^{-3}\) = 0.0020 s

Frequency \(f\) = 1 / \(T\) = 500 Hz* **Phase difference is a measure of how much one wave is out of step with another. A phase difference of one cycle corresponds to 360\({}^{\circ}\) or 2\(\pi\) rad.**
* **For a displacement-distance graph, we can calculate phase difference, \(\Delta\phi\) by looking at the distance between the two particles, \(\Delta x\).**
* **The phase difference between P and Q is \(\Delta\phi=\frac{\Delta X}{\lambda}\times 2\pi\)**
* **For a displacement-time graph, we can calculate phase difference, \(\Delta\phi\) by looking at the time lag, \(\Delta t\) between the two particles.**

**ANDERSON SERRANGOON JUNIOR COLLEGE**

**PHYSICS 9749**

Generally,

If the phase difference is 0 rad (or equivalently \(2\pi\) rad), the particles are in phase.

If the phase difference is \(\pi\) rad or \(180^{\circ}\), the particles are in anti-phase.

Phase difference is normally quoted such that \(0\leq\Delta\phi<2\pi\) rad.

## Appendix D Energy Associated with a Wave

* the intensity of a wave describes how much energy is transferred by the wave at a particular point. Intensity of a wave is the rate of energy flow per unit cross-sectional area perpendicular to the direction of wave propagation. Energy flow per unit time is also referred to Intensity = \(\frac{\text{Power}}{\text{Area}}\) as power.
* A uniform point source is one where energy is propagated away from the source uniformly in all directions.
* If the source provides energy at a rate (i.e. power) of P, then this energy must also flow through the surface of an (imaginary) sphere with the source at its centre and radius \(r\).
* So all the energy flows perpendicularly through a total surface area of \(4\pi r^{2}\).
* The expression for intensity at a distance \(r\) from the source is given by Note: This formula is applicable only if the point source radiates energy uniformly in all directions.
* When a receiver or detector is placed in the path of the wave, the energy passing through can be absorbed by the receiver.
* The power received by the **receiver** is proportional to the area of the **receiver** i.e. Power received by receiver = (Intensity at distance \(r\) from the source) \(\mathbf{x}\) (Area of receiver)

### Example 4

A point source emits waves uniformly in all directions. Initially, the intensity received by a detector placed at a certain distance is 80 W m\({}^{-2}\). The cross-sectional area of the detector is \(A\). The power of the source is then halved and a second detector of cross-sectional area _2A_ is placed twice the distance away from the source.

### Relationship between Intensity and Amplitude of a Wave

* As the wave moves away from the source, its intensity and thus its amplitude decreases.
* The amount of energy associated with a wave is proportional to the square of its amplitude \(A\). (Recall from SHM that energy of an oscillating particle \(E=2\ \pi^{2}\ m\ f\ A^{2}\), where \(f=\) frequency, and \(A=\) amplitude)
* Thus the intensity \(I\) of a wave is proportional to the square of its amplitude \(A\).

### Worked Example 3

A sound wave of amplitude 0.20 mm has an intensity of 3.0 W m\({}^{-2}\) at a point in space. Calculate the intensity of another sound wave of amplitude 0.40 mm but the same frequency at that point.

**Solution**

Use the relationship intensity \(\propto\) (amplitude)\({}^{2}\)

\({I_{2}=(\frac{A_{2}}{A_{1}})^{2}\Rightarrow\frac{I_{2}}{3.0}=(\frac{0.40}{0.20}) ^{2}}\)

\({I_{2}=12\ \text{W m}^{-2}}\)

**ANDERSON SERRANGOON JUNIOR COLLEGE**

**PHYSICS 9749**

**Example 5**

A point source radiates energy uniformly in all directions. The intensity of the wave at a point 20 m from the source is 0.2 W m\({}^{-2}\).

**(a)**: Calculate the power of the source.
**(b)**: Calculate the intensity of the wave 40 m from the source.
**(c)**: Calculate the energy received by a receiver of a cross-sectional area of 0.4 m\({}^{2}\) placed 40 m from the source, over a period of 2 s.
**(d)**: The amplitude of the wave at a point 20 m from the source is 1.5 mm. Calculate the amplitude of the wave at a point 60 m from the source.

**Solution*** **Only transverse waves can be polarised**; longitudinal waves cannot be polarised because its axis of vibration is parallel to its direction of energy transfer.

* **Relating Science and Society**

There are many uses of polarisation in real life such as in glare-reducing sunglasses due to light being polarised after reflection off some surfaces, and in polarised lenses to view 3D movies. Let's understand how polarisation work.

### Polarisation

* A wave is said to be polarised when the oscillations in a wave are confined to one direction only in a plane normal to the direction of transfer of energy of the wave.

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:17]

**Example 6**: As shown below, an unpolarised wave passes through polariser O such that the emerging wave is plane-polarised with an amplitude of A\({}_{\text{o}}\). A second polariser P is placed further such that the plane-polarised wave is incident normally on it. Polariser P is rotated clockwise by an angle of 20\({}^{\circ}\). A third Polariser Q is placed after Polariser P and it is rotated clockwise by an angle of 90\({}^{\circ}\).

**ANDERSON SEARANOON JUNIOR COLEGEG**

**PHYSICS 9749**

### Malus' Law

* As mentioned in page 17, when light passes through a second polariser which has its axis of polarisation at an angle of \(\theta\) different from the first polariser, the transmitted amplitude \(A=A_{0}\cos\,\theta\).
* Since \(I\propto A^{2}\), it is clear that the transmitted intensity \(I\propto\cos^{2}\theta\). This is known as Malus' Law.

**Example 7**

As shown below, an unpolarised wave passes through polariser O such that the emerging wave is plane-polarised with an intensity of 4.0 W m\({}^{2}\). A second polariser P is placed further such that the plane-polarised wave is incident normally on it. Polariser P is rotated clockwise by an angle of 20\({}^{\circ}\).

**Solution**

Note: When an unpolarised wave of intensity \(I_{0}\) passes through a polariser, the intensity \(I\) of the emerged wave is **half of the original intensity** (refer to Appendix 3 for more details).

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:20]

The waves are said to be **in phase** with each other. The **phase difference in this case is zero.** & **anti-phase** (or exactly out of phase). One wave is half a cycle behind the other.

## 3 Nature of Electromagnetic Waves & Polarisation

Electromagnetic (EM) waves are produced by oscillating electric charges. All EM waves consist of electric and magnetic fields oscillating at right angles to one another and to the direction of travel. The two fields oscillate sinusoidally, always in phase with one another. They carry no charge.

An ideal polarising filter (polariser/polaroid) passes 100% of the incident light that is polarised parallel to the filter's polarising axis but completely blocks all light that is polarised perpendicular to this axis.

In the above figure, unpolarised light is incident on a flat polarising filter. The electric-field vector, \(E\) of the incident wave can be represented in terms of components parallel and perpendicular to the polarising axis; only the component of \(E\) parallel to the polarising axis is transmitted. Hence the light emerging from the polariser is linearly polarised parallel to the polarising axis. For this ideal polariser, the intensity of the transmitted light is _exactly half_ that of the incident unpolarised light, no matter how the polarising axis is oriented.

_Qualitative Explanation:_ We can resolve \(E\) into a component parallel to the polarising axis and a component perpendicular to it. Because the incident light is a random mixture of all states of polarisation, these two components are, on average, equal. The ideal polariser transmits only the component that is parallel to the polarising axis, so half the incident intensity is transmitted.

_Mathematical Proof._

\(I=\frac{1}{2\pi}\int_{0}^{2\pi}I_{\rm o}\,\cos(\theta)^{2}\,d\theta=I_{\rm o}/2\)
