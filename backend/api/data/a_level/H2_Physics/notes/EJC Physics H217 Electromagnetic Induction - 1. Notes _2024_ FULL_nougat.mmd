### Introduction

Earlier in electromagnetism, we learnt that (i) an electric current can produce a magnetic field and (ii) a magnetic field can exert a force on moving charges or current-carrying conductors. As nature is often symmetric, it was later found that magnetic fields can in turn generate electric current.

### E.m.f. from Motion

In electromagnetism, we observe electrical energy converted into kinetic energy using an electric motor. In electromagnetism induction, we can observe, explain, and calculate the electrical energy that is converted from mechanical motion.

#### Electromagnetic induction of straight conductor

To explain why **relative motion** of a conductor and a magnetic field induces an e.m.f., consider a thin straight conductor of length \(L\) moving at a constant speed \(\nu\) in a region of uniform magnetic flux density \(B\) directed normally into the plane of paper as shown. By Fleming's left-hand rule, electrons initially experience a downward magnetic force.

Negative charges accumulate at the lower end, which results in a corresponding region of positive charge at the upper end.

_Inside_ the conductor, a potential difference is induced and results in an electric field down the length of the conductor.

_Outside_ the conductor, it can be regarded as an induced e.m.f. that can drive current around an external circuit.

Steady state is attained when the magnetic force and electric force are balanced. There will be no further charge separation and the induced e.m.f. (\(\varepsilon_{\text{induced}}\)) will remain constant:

\[\begin{split} F_{\text{B}}&=F_{\text{E}}\\ B\not{\psi}\,\widehat{\text{Sh}}&=\not{\varepsilon} \\ B\nu&=\frac{\Delta\nu}{d}=\frac{\varepsilon_{\text{induced} }}{L}\\ \varepsilon_{\text{induced}}&=BL\nu\end{split}\]

**Note**: The equation is true in general for a straight conductor of length \(L\) "cutting" magnetic flux lines but it is not one that we should recall and use. For most questions, we will need to start from basic principles and show how an equation is formed, before applying it.

From the equation, magnitude of \(\varepsilon_{\text{induced}}\) depends on the magnitude of the external magnetic flux density, the length of conductor that is inside the magnetic field, and the speed at which the wire is moving across the field.

**17.2 Magnetic Flux**

**magnetic flux is the**

**product of an area and**

**component of magnetic flux density perpendicular to that area**

**where** \(\varPhi\) **represents magnetic flux,**

**represents magnetic flux density,**

**represents area,**

**represents the angle between** \(B\) **and the normal of the area**

**We can visualise magnetic flux** \(\varPhi\) **as magnetic field lines piercing an identified area at 90**\({}^{\circ}\)**:**

**The unit for magnetic flux** \(\varPhi\) **is the Weber (Wb).**

**One Weber is the magnetic flux through an area of one squared metre when the magnetic flux density normal to the area is one tesla.**

**17.3 Magnetic Flux Linkage**

**Consider a solenoid of** \(N\) **number of turns.**

**Magnetic flux linkage through a loop is product of magnetic flux through the loop and number of turns of wire in the loop.**

**Magnetic flux is the product of an area and component of magnetic flux density perpendicular to that area.**

**The area for magnetic flux need not be a filled area e.g. flat circular sheet of metal; it can be an area of free space that is outlined by a wire loop.**

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:5]

**Example 3**: A square coil of side 5.0 cm lies initially at rest perpendicular to a magnetic field of flux density 4.0 T. The coil consists of 200 turns of wire.
**(a)**: What is the magnetic flux linkage through the coil?
**(b)**: The coil is rotated through an angle of 180\({}^{\circ}\)in 0.40 seconds. Calculate the magnitude of the average e.m.f. induced in the coil while it is being rotated.
**Note:** if (b) includes "constant angular velocity", we can find maximum instantaneous e.m.f.

\[\left|\frac{\Delta\left(N\Phi\right)}{\Delta t}\right|\] \[=\left|\frac{\left(1\right)\left(2.0\right)\left(3.5\right)\left( \cos 0^{\circ}\right)}{7.0}\right|=1.0\text{ V}\]

(b) Find the average induced current in the coil if the resistance of the coil is 5.0 \(\Omega\).

\[\text{I} =\frac{E_{\text{induced}}}{R}\] \[=\frac{1.0}{5.0}\] \[=0.20\text{ A}\]

(c) Explain if there will still be induced e.m.f. and current if there is a break in the coil.

induced e.m.f. still present as there is a rate of change of magnetic flux linkage no induced current because circuit is open 

**9749(2024) H2 Physics**

**Lenz's Law gives the direction of induced e.m.f., thereby also giving the direction of induced current if there is a closed circuit around the induced e.m.f.. It is a consequence of principle of conservation energy.**

**Consider a permanent magnet initially at rest. We apply an external force on the magnet to move it nearer a flat circular coil. By Lenz's Law, since the coil is a closed circuit, the direction of induced current produces an effect to opposing the incoming magnet. The induced current should produce a magnetic field with a North pole on the left of the coil.**

**The flow of the induced current around the coil results in electrical heating of the coil. Demonstrating the principle of conservation of energy:**

**If the coil is absent, all of the external work done is converted into kinetic energy of the magnet.**

**With coil, an opposing magnetic force acts on the magnet.** _Some_ **of the external work done is converted into kinetic energy of the magnet, and the remaining is converted into heat dissipated by the coil when induced current flows (**\(I\)_PR\({}_{\text{o}\text{f}\text{o}\text{f}}\)_).**

**The principle of conservation of energy is valid since the total amount of energy is constant, and the various forms of energy are accounted for.**

**Conversely, Principle of Conservation of Energy will be violated if we go against Lenz's Law:**

* suppose a South pole is induced on the left side of the coil
* incoming magnet is attracted and accelerates towards the coil, gaining kinetic energy
* there are increases in both the kinetic energy of the magnet and the thermal output of the coil with much lesser input of energy; the Principle of Conservation of Energy is violated.**

**Example 5**

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:9]

**Example 6**: A rectangular metallic loop of resistance \(R=1.6\)\(\Omega\), width \(L=4.0\) cm and length \(b=10\) cm is made to move at constant speed \(\nu=1.0\) cm s-1 through a region of uniform magnetic field of flux density \(B=2.0\) T. The magnetic field spans a length of \(d=15\) cm. Sketch

**(a)**: the variation of magnetic flux \(\varPhi\) of the loop with time, where \(t=0\) corresponds to the moment that the loop is just about to enter the magnetic field as shown,
**(b)**: the variation of induced e.m.f. \(E_{\text{induced}}\) with time,
**(c)**: the variation of the rate of heating in the loop with time \(t\).

**Solution:**

\[\begin{array}{l}\varPhi_{\text{max}}\\ =BA_{\text{max}}=B\big{(}Lb\big{)}\\ =\big{(}2.0\big{)}\big{(}4.0\times 10^{-2}\big{)}\big{(}10\times 10^{-2}\big{)}\\ =8.0\text{ mWb}\end{array}\]

\[\begin{array}{l}\big{|}E_{\text{induced}}\big{|}\\ =\frac{\text{d}\big{(}N\varPhi\big{)}}{\text{d}t}=\big{(}N\big{)} \frac{\text{d}}{\text{d}t}\big{(}BA\big{)}\\ =BL\nu\\ =\big{(}2.0\big{)}\big{(}4.0\times 10^{-2}\big{)}\big{(}1.0\times 10^{-2}\big{)}\\ =0.80\text{ mV}\end{array}\]

\[\begin{array}{l}P_{\text{max}}\\ =\frac{V^{2}}{R}=\frac{E_{\text{induced}}^{2}}{R}\\ =\frac{\big{(}0.8\times 10^{-3}\big{)}^{2}}{1.6}\\ =0.40\text{ }\mu\text{W}\end{array}\]

We reminded that an e.m.f. is induced by changing magnetic flux linkage even if the circuit is open, although there will be no induced current flowing.

When a bar magnet is dropped vertically downwards through a long solenoid, the variation of the induced e.m.f. with time as the magnet accelerates downwards can be traced on an oscilloscope.

The laws of electromagnetic induction can explain why

(a) there is an e.m.f. between A and B,

(b) there isn't an e.m.f. between B and C,

(c) the e.m.f. between C and D is

(i) opposite in polarity to A and B,

(ii) shorter in duration,

(iii) of larger peak value.

**(a)**: **E.m.f. between A and B**

as magnet approaches, magnetic flux linkage through wire coils increases

by Faraday's law, e.m.f. is induced in coil
**(b)**: **No e.m.f. between B and C**

as magnet falls through within length of solenoid, no net change in flux linkage through solenoid

so no e.mf. induced
**(c)**: **Opposite polarity of e.m.f. peaks**

as magnet enters solenoid, by Lenz's Law, induced current in coil flows in direction to produce a magnetic field that opposes the falling magnet so as to oppose the increase in magnetic flux linkage through coils

as magnet leaves solenoid, induced current in coil flows in direction to produce a magnetic field that opposes the _exiting_ magnet so as to oppose the decrease in magnetic flux linkage through coils

induced current flows in opposite direction compared to when magnet was entering solenoid
**(ii)/(iii)**: **Narrower but larger e.m.f. peak between C and D**

change in magnetic flux linkage through solenoid is same for both entry and exit of magnet evident from the same area under graph for both peaks

magnet accelerated downwards during the fall

has higher exit velocity

the same change in magnetic flux linkage takes place within a shorter time

by Faraday's Law, the higher rate of change of magnetic flux linkage results in larger peak 

#### Eddy Currents and Resistive Forces/Damping

Consider a metal disc at the end of a rod that can swing freely. Without the magnets, the disc oscillates for a long time due to light damping from air resistance. When the magnets are present, the oscillations are damped and the amplitude of oscillations decay quickly.

##### Explain why an e.m.f. is induced in the disc

As the disc enters the magnetic field, the disc cuts magnetic flux.

By Faraday's law, an e.m.f. is induced in the disc.

##### Explain why eddy currents are induced in the disc

linear speed along the length of the rod is not the same and varies with distance from pivot.

rate of cutting magnetic flux lines is not the same

so different magnitudes of e.m.f. are induced in different parts of the disc

disc is a conductor, eddy currents are induced in the disc

##### Explain why the disc comes to a rest after a few oscillations

eddy currents dissipate thermal energy in disc

energy derived from oscillation of disc

energy of disc depends on amplitude of oscillations

Eddy current damping is the principle behind electromagnetic braking. Electromagnets replace the permanent magnets (figure below, left) so that the spinning disc can be slowed down whenever current flows in the electromagnets.

The advantage over conventional brakes is that there is no physical contact with the spinning disc and therefore no wear and tear of brake pads. However, the disadvantage is that induced eddy currents are smaller with lower rotational speeds and so braking is less efficient. Such braking is usually deployed alongside conventional brakes on vehicles such as high speed trains.

Note: when answering questions involving eddy current heating / braking / damping / resistive forces, account for the conversion of energy that is removed from the system.

**9749(2023) H2 Physics**

**Example 10**

Three vertical tubes, made from copper, aluminium and rubber respectively, have identical dimensions. Identical, strong, cylindrical magnets P, Q and R, are released simultaneously from the same distance above each tube.

(a) Name the order in which the magnets will emerge from the tube.

R, Q and P

(b) Use energy considerations to explain the observations.

**(i) for all three tubes:**

as magnet falls through tube, tube cut magnetic flux

by Faraday's law, an e.mf. is induced in the tube

**(ii) for the metallic tubes:**

eddy currents causes heating of tube

so mechanical energy of falling magnet is reduced

magnets fall with acceleration less than that of freefall \(g\) = 9.81 m s-\({}^{2}\)

copper is a better conductor than aluminium

larger eddy currents induced for the same magnitude of induced e.m.f.

more heating effect (\(I^{2}R\))

more mechanical energy is removed from magnet P so P emerges last

**(iii) for rubber tube:**

no induced eddy current in rubber tube so magnet R emerge soonest

**Note:**: what if we conduct the same experiment comparing

(i) copper pipe of thick walls versus thin walls?

(ii) super-chilled copper pipe versus room-temperature same thickness?

### Applications

#### Generator

A wire coil spinning in a magnetic field generates electricity.

This is equivalent to using an electric motor backwards, which is how most electric vehicles perform regenerative braking.

The rate of change of magnetic flux linkage is maximum when the coil is moving through the horizontal position - one side is cutting flux lines rapidly downwards while the other is cutting rapidly upwards.

As the coil moves through the vertical position, the rate of change of magnetic flux linkage is zero as the sides of the coil are moving parallel to the flux lines and not cutting them.

#### Microphone

A wire coil attached to a diaphragm is placed near a stationary permanent magnet.

When sound wave strikes the microphone, pressure differences within the wave causes the diaphragm to oscillate. Wire coil moves at the same frequency to and fro from the magnet.

By Faraday's Law, e.m.f. is induced through coil as there is a rate of change of magnetic flux linkage through the coil. The induced e.m.f. signal can be transmitted and amplified to recreate the sound.

#### Guitar Pickup

An acoustic guitar depends on the acoustic resonance produced in the hollow body of the instrument by the oscillations of strings. An electric guitar is, on the other hand, a solid instrument, so there is no body resonance. Instead, the oscillations of the metal strings are sensed by electric "pickups" that send signals to an amplifier and a set of speakers.

For each pickup, wire is coiled around a small magnet and this wire is connected to an amplifier. The magnetic field of the permanent magnet induces a north and south pole in the section of the metal string above the magnet. This section of string is magnetized and has its own magnetic field.

When the magnetized string is plucked and made to oscillate, its motion relative to the coil causes a coil to cut the flux by the string. By Faraday's Law, e.m.f. is induced in the coil. Induced e.m.f. varies at the same frequency as the string's oscillations. Signal can be transmitted and amplified to recreate this frequency at the speakers.
An alternating current in the coil within the induction cooker produces a changing magnetic field. Results in changing magnetic flux linkage through the base of the cooking pot.

By Faraday's law, an e.m.f. is induced which produces eddy currents in the base of the pot. Since the pot is metallic and conducting, the flow of eddy currents causes Joule heating and the heat is used for cooking.

### Bicycle Dynamo

A bicycle dynamo is a mini generator which converts some of the tyre's kinetic energy into electricity, which is handy for powering the lights.

Instead of a coil rotating, most dynamos spin a permanent magnet around static wire coils instead to achieve the cutting of magnetic flux lines. By Faraday's law, an e.m.f. is induced.

### Ending Notes

Electromagnetic induction is widely applied throughout our daily lives and in fact is responsible for the generation of the electricity we use. In the next topic we will delve deeper into how electricity is generated and transported from the power stations to households and industries.
