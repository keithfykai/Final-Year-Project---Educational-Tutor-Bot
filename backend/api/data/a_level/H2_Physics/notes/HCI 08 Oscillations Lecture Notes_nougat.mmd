### Introduction

Oscillations are very common in everyday life such as the motion of a clock pendulum, the vibrations of strings in musical instruments, the vertical oscillations of a car after passing over a bump on the road or even the vibrations of atoms in a lattice.

Oscillations can occur when displacing an object that is in a state of stable equilibrium from its equilibrium position results in a restoring force acting on the object directed towards the equilibrium position. The motion is said to be _periodic_ if the displacement of a body in oscillatory motion repeats itself at equal intervals. The full range of its motion that is repeated is referred to as a cycle and the time taken for the body to go through a cycle is the period of the oscillation.

**Example 8.1: Periodic Motion**

Which of the following cases are periodic oscillations?

### Simple Harmonic Motion

The free oscillation of a mass attached to a spring is a very special example of a periodic oscillation that we call simple harmonic motion (SHM). It is special because the displacement of the mass about its equilibrium position varies sinusoidally. We will prove this analytically but first, let us look at an experiment that shows the sinusoidal variation of its displacement with time.

**Spring-Mass System**

\(T=2\pi\sqrt{\frac{m}{k}}\) (*)

where \(T=\) period of oscillation

\(m=\) mass of the oscillating object

\(k=\) spring constantWe can obtain a graph of the variation in the displacement of the mass hanging from a spring via the following experiment. We attach a pen to the mass such that its motion is traced onto a vertical sheet of graph paper that is pulled to the left at a constant rate.

#### 8.1.1 Terms used to describe SHM (with reference to Fig 8.1)

Terms**Definitions**

_Displacement, x_The displacement x is the linear distance of the mass from its equilibrium position (x = 0) in a specified direction.

It is a **vector**; the + / - sign tells the direction of displacement from equilibrium.

If you set the direction for displacement above equilibrium to be positive, then displacement below the equilibrium would be negative and _vice versa_.

_Equilibrium Position (x = 0)_When the oscillating mass is at equilibrium position, the **net force acting on the mass is zero**.

_Amplitude, x_oIt is the **magnitude** of the maximum displacement of the mass from the equilibrium position. It is a scalar.

_Period, T_It is the time taken for the mass to complete one cycle of oscillation. S.I. unit: second.

_Frequency, f_It is the number of cycles per unit time: \(f=\dfrac{1}{T}\cdot\) S.I. unit: hertz (Hz). 1 Hz = 1 s-1.

_Angular frequency, o_It is the rate of change of the _phase angle_ (introduced in Section 8.2) with respect to time: \(\omega=\dfrac{d\theta}{dt}\cdot\) S.I. unit: rad s-1.

A cycle of oscillation is associated with a phase angle of \(2\pi\) rad, \(\omega=\dfrac{2\pi}{T}=2\pi f\).

Figure 8.1: Tracking the oscillation of a vertical spring-mass system

#### 8.1.2 SHM - Displacement-time (x-\(\theta\)) relationship

From Fig. 8.1, we see that the time variation of the displacement of the mass obtained in the experiment is remarkably similar to a sine graph as shown in Fig 8.2.

The equation of such a graph can be written as follows,

\[x=x_{0}\sin\omega t\]

where \(\omega=\dfrac{2\pi}{T}\) is known as the _angular frequency_ and \(x_{0}\) is the _amplitude_ of the oscillation.

We can see from this graph that when we start timing, the displacement of the mass is zero, which means that the mass is at its equilibrium position at that instant. If the mass is not at the equilibrium position but at some other location at the instant when we start timing, we can adjust the equation easily to fit the graph obtained in the experiment.

\begin{tabular}{|p{113.8pt}|p{113.8pt}|} \hline
**Position of mass when timing starts (\(t=0\))** & **Displacement-time (x-\(\theta\)) Graph** & **Displacement-time Equation** \\ \hline Mass is _released from rest_ at _maximum displacement_ from equilibrium position. & **\(x_{0}\)** & **\(x=x_{0}\cos\omega t\)** \\ \hline Mass is moving with _initial velocity_\(\nu\) at _displacement_\(X\) & **\(x^{\prime}\)** & **\(x^{\prime}\)** \\ \hline \end{tabular}

1.3 SHM - Velocity-time (v-\(\theta\)) relationship and acceleration-time (a-\(\theta\)) relationship

From the topic of kinematics, we know that from the displacement-time relationship of an object, we can obtain its corresponding velocity-time and acceleration-time relationship by differentiating the equations or analysing the gradients of the tangents at the various points on the graphs accordingly (see Fig. 8.3).

We can similarly do so for SHM.

The table illustrates two examples.

Figure 8.2: Displacement-time graph of mass

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|} \hline \(t=0\) (initial conditions) & Example 1: \(x=0\), \(\nu\) is at maximum value & Example 2: \(x=x_{o}\), \(\nu=0\) \\ \hline \(x\)-\(t\) graph & \(x_{o}\) \\ \hline Equation & \(x=x_{0}\sin\omega t\) \\ \hline \(\nu\)-\(t\) graph & \(x_{o}\) \\ \hline Equation & \(x=x_{0}\cos\omega t\) \\ \hline Equation & \(x_{o}\) \\ \hline Equation & \(x_{o}\) \\ \hline Equation & \(x_{o}\) \\ \hline Equation & \(x_{o}\) \\ \hline Equation & \(x_{o}\) \\ \hline Equation & \(x_{o}\) \\ \hline Equation & \(x_{o}\) \\ \hline Equation & \(x_{o}\) \\ \hline Equation & \(x_{o}\) \\ \hline Equation & \(x_{o}\) \\ \hline Equation & \(x_{o}\) \\ \hline Equation & \(x_{o}\) \\ \hline Equation & \(x_{o}\) \\ \hline Equation & \(x_{o}\) \\ \hline \end{tabular} From the graphs and the equations above, together with the fact that \(-1\leq\sin\theta\leq 1\) and \(-1\leq\cos\theta\leq 1\), we can see that:

(1) Maximum value of velocity, \(\nu_{o}\):

(2) Maximum value of acceleration, \(a_{o}\):

\begin{tabular}{|c|} \hline \(v_{0}=\omega x_{0}\) \\ \hline \(a_{0}=\omega^{2}x_{0}\) \\ \hline \end{tabular} where \(\omega\) is the angular frequency and \(x_{o}\) is the amplitude of the oscillation.

**Example 8.2: Describing SHM in terms of time**

The pendulum bob in a particular clock oscillates so that its displacement from a fixed point is as shown.

(a) By taking the necessary readings from the graph, determine for this simple harmonic oscillator

(i) the amplitude \(x_{o}\)

(ii) the angular frequency, \(\omega\)

(iii) the maximum velocity \(\nu_{o}\) and

(iv) the maximum acceleration \(a_{o}\)

(b) Hence, write down the equation that describes the displacement-time relationship.

(c) Sketch labelled graphs, illustrating the corresponding time variation of the oscillator's

(i) velocity,

(ii) acceleration.

**Example 8.3: Displacement-time Relationship for SHM**

The displacement \(x\) (in m) of a body moving in SHM is given by the equation

\(x=3.5\) sin \(4.0t\)

a) What is the amplitude of the motion?

b) What is the angular frequency?

c) What will be the displacement \(0.20\) s after oscillation has begun?

d) Determine the velocity at time \(t=0.50\) s.

#### 8.1.4 Definition of SHM - relationship between acceleration and displacement

Comparing the \(x\)-\(t\) and \(a\)-\(t\) relationship for both the examples in the table in section 8.1.3, we see that \(a=-\omega^{2}\,x\). This is actually the defining equation for SHM!

**Definition of Simple Harmonic Motion**

_Simple harmonic motion_ is a periodic motion in which the **acceleration** of the body

* is **directly proportional** to the **displacement from its equilibrium point**, and
* is always in the **opposite direction to the displacement.**

\[a=-\omega^{2}\,x\]

where \(\omega\) is the angular frequency and \(x\) is the displacement from the equilibrium point.

**Notes:**

(1) The **negative sign** in the equation indicates that **the acceleration in SHM is always in the direction opposite to the displacement from the equilibrium point**; in other words, the acceleration is always directed towards the equilibrium point.

(2) Since \(a=\frac{d^{2}\,x}{dt^{2}}\), we can write \(\frac{d^{2}\,x}{dt^{2}}=-\omega^{2}\,x\).This is a \(2^{nd}\) order differential equation and

\(x=x_{0}\sin(\omega t+\phi)\)is a general solution where \(\phi\) depends on the position of the oscillator when observation starts.

You are not required to know how to solve differential equations for the A-level Physics syllabus. However, by differentiating the expression \(x=x_{0}\sin(\omega t+\phi)\) twice, you can verify that \(\frac{d^{2}\,x}{dt^{2}}=-\omega^{2}\,x\).

**Case Study: SHM of Horizontal Spring-Mass System Explained Using Dynamics**

Let us consider a mass oscillating at the end of a horizontal light spring. At the start of section 8.1, we said that the spring-mass system is an example of SHM. We shall now prove that indeed, the mass satisfies the defining equation of SHM. Ideally, the spring obeys Hooke's Law and the mass of the spring is negligible, the mass slides without friction on the horizontal surface. Point O is the equilibrium position of the mass, where the spring is unstretched.

Let us now look at how the restoring force \(F\) exerted by the spring on the mass varies with displacement \(x\): (a) when mass is displaced to the right \(\left(x>0\right)\), causing the spring to be stretched, \(F\) is towards the left. (b) when the mass is at its equilibrium position \(\left(x=0\right)\) (spring is unstretched), \(F\) is zero. (c) when the mass is displaced to the left \(\left(x<0\right)\), causing the spring to be compressed, \(F\) is towards the right. Hence, we see that

1. the **resultant restoring force is always towards the equilibrium position.**
2. the **direction of this resultant force is always opposite to that of the mass's displacement** at all points, except at equilibrium position, where \(a=x=0\).
3. According to Hooke's Law, \(F=-k\alpha\), where \(k\) is the spring constant. The restoring force, \(F\), is proportional to the displacement, \(x\), but directed opposite to it (as indicated by the negative sign). By Newton's \(2^{nd}\) Law, \(F_{net}=ma\) Since \(F_{net}\) is provided by the restoring force of the spring acting on the oscillating mass \(m\), \(m\alpha=-k\alpha\) \(a=-\dfrac{k}{m}\,x\) Hence, the **acceleration is** \(\circ\) **opposite in direction to the displacement** and \(\circ\) **proportional to the displacement, with proportionality constant -\(k\,l\,m\).** (d) When the spring is a **definition of SHM**!
4. Comparing the expression above with the SHM equation \(\dot{a}=-\omega^{2}x\) : \(\omega^{2}=\dfrac{k}{m}\to T=\dfrac{2\pi}{\omega}=2\pi\sqrt{\dfrac{m}{k}}\) This is the expression we quoted for the period of the spring-mass system earlier. Note that the period of the oscillation depends on the physical properties of the system.

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:11]

#### 8.1.5 Simple Harmonic Motion: velocity-displacement (v-x) relationship

The velocity-displacement (v-x) relationship for SHM is given by

\[\nu=\pm\omega\sqrt{\left(x_{0}^{2}-x^{2}\right)}\]

**Note:**

1. The equation is provided in the A-level Physics formulae list. It is applicable no matter where the body is when observation starts.
2. The "\(\pm\)" sign implies that the body in SHM always passes through each position back and forth with the same speed.
3. When the body is at maximum displacement \(\left(x=x_{0}\right)\), \(\nu=0\). At the equilibrium position \(\left(x=0\right)\), the speed is maximum, \(\nu_{0}=\omega x_{0}\).
4. The v-x graph is an **ellipse** as shown.

**Derivation of the relationship between velocity and displacement (not in syllabus)**

Consider \[x=x_{0}\sin(\omega t+\phi)........\text{(1)}\]

Differentiate (1) with respect to \(t:\nu=\frac{d\mathbf{x}}{dt}=\omega x_{0}\cos(\omega t+\phi)\)........ (2)

Given that \(\sin^{2}\theta+\cos^{2}\theta=1\), \(\cos\theta=\pm\sqrt{1-\sin^{2}\theta}\)

Substitute into equation (2): \[\nu=\omega x_{0}\left[\pm\sqrt{1-\sin^{2}\left(\omega t+\phi\right)}\right]\]

\[\Rightarrow\nu=\pm\omega\sqrt{x_{0}^{2}-x_{0}^{2}\sin^{2}\left(\omega t+\phi \right)}\]

\[\Rightarrow\nu=\pm\omega\sqrt{x_{0}^{2}-x^{2}}\]

**Example 8.6: Relationship between velocity and displacement for SHM**

**Example 8.7: Relationship between velocity and displacement for SHM**

An object moving with simple harmonic motion has an amplitude of 0.020 m and a frequency of 20 Hz. Calculate

(a) the period of oscillation.

(b) the velocities at the equilibrium point and the position of maximum negative displacement.

**Solution:**

### Relationship between Simple Harmonic Motion and Uniform Circular Motion

We have thus far established that for SHM, \(x=x_{0}\sin\omega t\) where \(\omega\) is a constant known as the angular frequency, it is also known as the rate of change in phase angle \(\theta\). Let us look at an experiment to gain a better understanding of the concept of phase angle.

Consider a peg on a turntable. Parallel light rays from a distant source are shone on the turntable. As the turntable rotates, the peg moves in uniform circular motion and the shadow of the peg against a vertical screen will move back and forth. As it turns out, we can prove that the motion of its shadow is SHM.

### Some observations

1. The motion is symmetrical about the fixed point, O' on the screen.
2. The time taken to complete one oscillation (period) is the same as the time taken to complete one cycle. Thus frequency of SHM = frequency of the circular motion.
3. The distance from the fixed point O' to the extremity (amplitude), is equal to the radius of the circle.
4. When the peg is shifted nearer to the centre of the turntable, the amplitude of the SHM decreases, but the period or frequency remains unchanged.
5. The shadow reaches maximum speed as it passes O' and is momentarily at rest at the extreme positions.

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:15]

3. Two oscillations are said to be _in anti-phase_ when they are completely out of step, i.e., one oscillation reaches maximum displacement in a given direction at the same instant as the other oscillation reaches maximum displacement in the opposite direction.  The phase difference \(\Delta\phi=\pi\) rad or any odd integral multiple of \(\pi\) rad. 4. Of course the two oscillations may not be in phase or in anti-phase but at some intermediate phase difference. In such a case, the phase difference can be calculated by the following: \(\Delta\phi=\frac{\Delta t}{T}\times 2\pi\).  You will learn more about phase difference in the next chapter on Waves. **Example 8.8: Phase and Phase Difference** The displacement-time graph of two objects A and B oscillating is shown below. By how much does A lead B in terms of phase angle? **Solution:**

### Damped Oscillations, Forced Oscillations and Resonance

#### 8.4.1 Damped oscillations

In an ideal oscillating system, there is no friction and the total energy associated with the oscillation is constant. The oscillation continues forever, with no decrease in amplitude.

In real-world systems, there is friction and the total energy associated with the oscillations decreases with time due to the work done against friction. The progressive decrease in amplitude of any oscillatory motion caused by dissipative forces is called _damping._ Such an oscillatory motion is known as a _damped oscillation._

Commonly used damping methods:

A) Attach a piece of cardboard of negligible mass but large surface area to the base of the mass. Air resistance dissipates energy.

B) Submerge the mass in a viscous fluid. Viscous forces dissipate energy.

C) Swing the copper plate in a magnetic field so that eddy currents are induced in the plate. Eddy currents dissipate energy (will be discussed in Electromagnetic Induction in year 2).

### Extent of damping

Damping changes the behaviour of SHM systems. Certain features of the oscillation (amplitude etc.) are dependent on the extent of damping.

### (1) _Light Damping (underdamped system)_

In a lightly damped system, the total energy of the system decreases with time as its energy is dissipated when the system oscillates against resistive forces.

The period/frequency remains constant, but the amplitude of the system decreases exponentially with time.

### (2) _Critical Damping (critically damped system)_

If we are able to gradually increase the resistive force acting on an oscillatory system, damping increases till a point such that when displaced, the system **returns to the equilibrium position in the shortest possible time without oscillating** at all. The system is said to be critically damped.

Critical damping is deliberately introduced into some systems to prevent continuous oscillations. For example, in analogue instruments such as balances, ammeters and voltmeters, the pointer is critically damped so that it stops in the shortest possible time to indicate the reading, instead of oscillating about the reading (underdamped) or taking an unnecessarily long time to crawl to the reading (overdamped).

Critical damping is also used in **car suspension systems** to ensure a smooth ride when the car moves on a bumpy road. The shock absorbers in the suspension system have hydraulic pistons to prevent the car from bouncing up and down excessively after hitting a bump.

### (3) _Heavy Damping (overdamped system)_

When the damping force is increased beyond the point of critical damping, we say that the system is **overdamped** or that it experiences heavy damping. Once displaced from its equilibrium, the oscillator takes a very long time to return to its equilibrium position.

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:21]

One example of forced oscillation is pushing a child on a swing at the playground; one needs to continually give the swing a push at the right moment to sustain its oscillation.

### Resonance

Consider the above example of a child on a swing. The child will need to be pushed to keep him swinging.

If the frequency of the driving force matches the natural frequency of the oscillatory motion of the child-swing system, an interesting phenomenon happens - the final amplitude of the oscillation would be the greatest compared to the amplitudes of oscillation for other frequencies of driving force. This phenomenon is known as _resonance_.

_Resonance_ is a phenomenon in which an oscillatory system responds with maximum amplitude to an external periodic driving force, when the frequency of the driving force (driver frequency) equals the natural frequency of the driven system.

### Note:

1. The frequency at which resonance occurs is known as the _resonant frequency_.
2. Under ideal conditions, i.e., if no resistive forces are present (there is no damping), the amplitude will build up to an infinitely large value.
3. However, in real cases, damping occurs. Whilst putting energy into the system in each cycle, energy is also taken away by damping and the amplitude will stop increasing when the rate of energy supplied is the same as the rate at which it is lost.
4. Resonance represents the point where (driving) energy is transferred most efficiently into the oscillatory system.

The above set-up may be used to investigate the phenomenon of resonance in the lab.

(1) The system under study is a spring-mass system that is driven to oscillate by a metre rule which is in turn driven to vibrate by a vibration generator. To vary the frequency of vibration, the vibration generator is connected to a signal generator. (2) To vary the amount of damping experienced by the spring-mass system, a light paper card is attached to the mass. By varying the area of the paper card attached, the damping is varied. The larger the paper card, the greater the damping. (3) To measure the amplitude of vibration, a motion sensor is placed directly below the paper card. (4) For each frequency of vibration, we can then measure and record the amplitude of vibration of the spring-mass system. We start off with a driving frequency that is much lower than the natural frequency of the spring-mass system and slowly increase this frequency till beyond the natural frequency. (5) The graph above shows the typical results obtained from the experiment for one area of card. (6) The experiment is then repeated for different areas of cards in order to produce different amounts of damping. (7) The data points for each different area of cards / different damping can then be plotted on the same pair of axes for comparison as shown below.

The figure below shows the amplitude vs. driving frequency graphs that will be obtained.

**Note:**

1. The amplitude of a lightly damped system is very large at resonance and the peak is sharp. The amplitude drops off rapidly when the driver frequency differs from the natural frequency of the system.
2. When the driver frequency approaches zero, the amplitude of the forced oscillations will be the same as the amplitude of the driver.
3. As the system experiences greater damping, \(\circ\) the amplitude of the oscillation **decreases**. \(\circ\) the resonance peak becomes **broader**. \(\circ\) the resonance peak shifts slightly to the **left** to a slightly lower value of frequency.

From the graphs, it is evident that damping is a useful way to reduce the effects of resonance. Another way to avoid resonance is to ensure that the frequency of the periodic external force differs from the natural frequency of the driven system.

**Example 8.12: Damped Oscillation (N10/1/16)**

A mass, suspended from a helical spring, is made to oscillate. The graph shows the variation with frequency \(f\) of the amplitude \(x_{0}\) of vibration of the mass.

A sheet of cardboard of negligible mass is now fixed to the mass on the spring to cause light damping of the oscillations. Which graph shows how \(x_{0}\) will vary with \(f\) over the same frequency range?

#### Examples of Destructive and Useful Resonance

Examples of destructive resonance

1. **Shattering glass with voice** When an opera singer projects a high-pitched note whose frequency matches the natural frequency of a wine glass, resonance may cause the glass to vibrate at a large amplitude that it breaks.
2. **Violent vibrations in vehicles and machines** If the panel in a bus rattles violently when the bus is travelling at a certain speed, it is likely that a resonant vibration is occurring. A washing machine with a load which has natural frequency matching the spinning frequency will vibrate violently as resonance occurs.
3. **Collapse of some buildings in earthquakes** An earthquake consists of many low-frequency vibrations ranging from 1 to 10 Hz. During an earthquake, when the frequencies of the vibration match the natural frequencies of buildings, resonance may occur and result in serious damage. That also explains why some buildings collapse while others stand almost unaffected. In regions of the world where earthquakes happen regularly, buildings may be built on foundations that absorb the energy of the shock waves. In this way, the vibrations are damped and the amplitude of the oscillations cannot reach a dangerous level.

Examples of useful resonance

1. **Radio receptions** Resonance not only occurs in mechanical oscillations but also in electric circuits. A radio receiver works on the principle of resonance. Our air is filled with radio waves of many different frequencies which the aerial picks up. The tuner can be adjusted so that the frequency of the electrical oscillations in the circuits is the same as that of the radio wave transmitted from a particular station we desire. The effect of resonance amplifies the signals contained in this wave while the radio waves of other frequencies are diminished.
2. **Magnetic Resonance Imaging** Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is increasingly used in medical diagnosis to produce images similar to those produced by X-rays. Strong, electromagnetic fields of varying radio frequencies are used to cause oscillations in atomic nuclei. When resonance occurs, energy is absorbed by the molecules. By analysing the pattern of energy absorption, a computer-generated image can be produced. The advantage of MRI scanners is that no ionising radiation (as in the process of producing X-ray images) is involved.
3. **Musical Instruments** Most vibrating objects have more than one resonant frequency. The lowest resonant frequency of a vibrating object is called its fundamental frequency. A harmonic is defined as an integer multiple of the fundamental frequency. (You will learn more about it in the topic Superposition, under Stationary Wave). Strings and air columns used in musical instruments typically vibrate at harmonics of the fundamental frequency. In an acoustic guitar, when you pluck a string, the string initially vibrates at all the frequencies. Those frequencies that are not one of the resonances are quickly filtered out-- or attenuated--and all that is left is the harmonic vibrations that are transmitted through air molecules as sound energy into the hollow wooden body of the guitar, making it (and the air inside) resonate and amplifying the musical note (making it considerably louder).

## Appendix 1 Case study: Oscillations of A Simple Pendulum

A simple pendulum is in its midst of motion, where its bob is at a horizontal displacement \(x\) from its equilibrium position. The string is attached to a bob of mass \(m\) and makes a small angle of \(\theta\) to the vertical as shown.

The restoring force (\(mg\ sin\ \theta\)) which is pointing towards equilibrium position and is approximately horizontal, is in the opposite direction to the positive direction of the horizontal displacement,

\(F_{net}=-mg\ sin\ \theta\)

When the angular displacement \(\theta\) is small,

the horizontal displacement of the bob is approximately equal to

the arc length

\(x\approx L\theta\)

\(\Rightarrow\)

\(\theta\approx\chi L\)

\(\Rightarrow\)

\(F_{net}=-mg\ sin\ \theta\ \approx-mg\frac{x}{L}\)

From Newton's 2nd law:

\(ma\approx-mg\frac{x}{L}\)

\(\Rightarrow\)

\(a\approx-\left(\frac{g}{L}\right)x\)

i.e., \(a=-\alpha^{2}x\)

where \(\alpha^{2}=\frac{g}{L}\)

Hence, motion of a simple pendulum bob attached to a light inextensible string oscillating with **a small angular displacement of \(\sim\) 10\({}^{o}\) or smaller** is, to a good approximation, a linear SHM with period, \(T\), given by

\(T=2\pi\sqrt{\frac{L}{g}}\)

**Note:**

1) Other assumptions made are that the string is massless, the radius of the bob is small compared with the length of the string and air resistance is negligible.

2) The period \(T\) is independent of the amplitude of the oscillation.

## Appendix 2 Case study: Oscillations of a Mass on Vertical Spring

A mass \(m\) attached to the end of a spiral spring exerts a downward force on it and stretches it by an amount \(e\) as shown in the diagram.

If the spring obeys Hooke's law, then the extension \(e\) is directly proportional to the extending tension, \(F_{\text{s}}\), i.e.,

\[F_{\text{s}} =-k\epsilon\text{\ \ where \ }k\text{\ is a constant.}\]

Since the mass is in equilibrium, the net force on it is zero (\(\sum F=0\)).

\[mg+(-k\epsilon) =0\] \[\Rightarrow mg =k\epsilon\]

Suppose the mass is now pulled down a further distance \(x\) below its equilibrium position, then the tension in the spring is increased to \(-k(\epsilon+x)\). Thus the resultant force on the mass is given by

\[F =mg-k(e+x)\] \[=k\epsilon-k(\epsilon+x)\] (since \[mg=k\epsilon\] ) \[=-k\alpha\]

i.e., the resultant force is acting upwards, with the direction opposite to that of the displacement.

By Newton's 2nd law,

\[ma =-k\alpha\] \[\Rightarrow a =-\frac{k}{m}x\]

Since \(k\) and \(m\) are fixed, the oscillation of a mass on spring is simple harmonic.

The angular frequency \(\omega\) is given by \(\omega^{2}=\frac{k}{m}\)

\[\Rightarrow T=\frac{2\pi}{\omega}=2\pi\sqrt{\frac{m}{k}}\]

## Appendix 3 Equations of motion for damped simple harmonic oscillations

In an oscillatory system, the decrease in amplitude caused by dissipative forces is called damping and the corresponding motion is called damped oscillation. The simplest case to analyse is a simple harmonic oscillator under damping, where its dissipative force is directly proportional to its _velocity_. This behaviour occurs in friction involving the flow of viscous fluid, such as in shock absorbers or sliding between oil-lubricated surfaces. The additional force on the body due to viscous drag is \(f=-bv\), where \(b\) is a constant.

With a viscous drag, the net force on the body is \((-kx-bv)\).

Applying Newton's \(2^{nd}\) second law,

\[m\frac{d^{2}x}{dt^{2}}=-kx-bv\] \[m\frac{d^{2}x}{dt^{2}}+b\frac{dx}{dt}+kx=0\]

This is a second order linear differential equation with constant coefficients.

If \(b<2\sqrt{km}\), the system is under light damping and the equation of motion is

Its amplitude \((x_{0}e^{\frac{-\left(\frac{b}{2m}\right)}{\left(\frac{b}{2m}\right)}})\) is not a constant, but decreases with time because of the decaying exponential factor. In addition, the larger the value of \(b\), the faster the decrease in the amplitude.

Its angular frequency\(\omega^{\prime}=\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}-\frac{b^{2}}{4m^{2}}}\), is smaller than that without damping, \(\omega=\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}\), and therefore the period is slightly larger.

If \(b=2\sqrt{km}\), then \(x=x_{0}e^{-\left(\frac{b}{2m}t\right)}\). The system is in critical damping, where it no longer oscillates but returns to its equilibrium position without overshooting the equilibrium position.

If \(b>2\sqrt{km}\), then the system is heavily damped. Again, there is no oscillation, but the return to its equilibrium takes longer than in the case of critical damping. Its solutions are in the form of \(x=C_{1}e^{-a_{1}t}+C_{2}e^{-a_{2}t}\), where \(C_{1}\) and \(C_{2}\) are constants determined by initial conditions and \(a_{1}\) and \(a_{2}\) are constants determined by \(m\), \(k\) and \(b\).

## Appendix 4 Demonstration of Forced Oscillation and Resonance - Barton's pendulums

Barton's pendulums consist of several pendulums of different lengths hung from a horizontal string. Each has its own natural frequency of oscillation. The 'driver' pendulum at the end has a large mass and its length is equal to that of pendulum R. When the driver is set swinging, its vibrations are transferred through the common support string to the other pendulums and start the forced oscillations.

Observations show that:

1. All the pendulums vibrate with the same frequency as the driver.
2. Pendulum R whose length matches that of the driver pendulum (therefore has the same natural frequency as the driver) has the largest amplitude. It is said to be resonating with the driver.

**Explanation:**

All the pendulums are coupled together by the suspension. As the driver swings, it moves the suspension, which in turn moves the other pendulums. The matching pendulum is being pushed slightly once each oscillation, and the amplitude gradually builds up to maximum. The other pendulums are being pushed at a frequency that does not match their natural frequency and they therefore oscillate with smaller amplitudes.
