### Representing an electric field:

An electric field can be represented and so visualised by electric field lines (lines of force).

Electric field lines are lines that show the direction of the force acting on a stationary positive point charge in the field.

The field line is imaginary but the field it represents is real.

Examples:

(a) Isolated point charge:

(b) Electric dipole:

(c) Uniform electric field:

The battery places equal charges of opposite sign on the two metal plates.

Although some "fringing" of the lines occurs near the edges, the field lines are mostly directed straight across the gap between the plates.

The electric field between the plates is uniform. This is indicated in the diagram by the _equal spacing_ of the field lines.

### Summary of the rules for drawing electric lines of force around electrically charge bodies:

\begin{tabular}{|c|l|c|} \hline  & Rule & Diagram \\ \hline
1 & Electric lines of force always leave +ve charges and end on -ve charges. & A.4 (b) \\ \hline
2 & Field lines always leave (or end on) conducting surfaces at right angles to the point of contact. & A.4 (e) \\ \hline
3 & A uniform electric field has equally spaced field lines. & A.4 (c) \\ \hline
4 & The stronger the electric field around a charged body, the & A.4 (d) \\  & closer the lines of force. & A.4 (a) to (e) \\ \hline
5 & Field lines never cross. & A.4 (a) to (e) \\ \hline \end{tabular}

**B Electric force between point charges:**

_Candidates should be able to:_

_recall and use Coulomb's law in the form_ \(F=\frac{1}{4\pi\varepsilon_{0}}\frac{Q_{1}Q_{2}}{r^{2}}\) _for the force between two point charges in free space or air._

### Coulomb's law:

The force between two point charges \(Q_{1}\) and \(Q_{2}\) is directly proportional to the product of the charges and inversely proportional to the square of the distance \(r\) between them.

\[F=k\frac{Q_{1}Q_{2}}{r^{2}}\quad\text{ where $k$ is a constant}\]

or

\[F=\frac{1}{4\pi\varepsilon_{0}}\frac{Q_{1}Q_{2}}{r^{2}}\]

where \(\varepsilon_{0}\) (epsilon naught): permittivity of free space (vacuum or air)=8.85\(\times 10^{-12}\) C\({}^{2}\) N\({}^{-1}\) m\({}^{-2}\)

### Direction of electrostatic force:

The **direction** of the electrostatic force is along the line joining the two charges.

(a) The force is **repulsive** if \(Q_{1}\) and \(Q_{2}\) are charges of the same signs.

The field due to an isolated point charge is thus non-uniform but it has the same values at equal distances from the charge and so has spherical symmetry.

Thus \(E_{\text{b}}=E_{\text{tb}}\) - \(E_{\text{2b}}=6.20\times 10^{4}\) N C\({}^{\text{-}1}\) towards the left.

Thus \(E_{\text{c}}=2E_{\text{tc}}\cos 60^{\circ}=1.08\times 10^{4}\) N C\({}^{\text{-}1}\) towards the right.

### Electric field strength of a conducting sphere:

A charge +Q on an isolated conducting sphere is uniformly distributed over its surface (due to the repulsion of like charges) and has a radial electric field pattern.

The electric field within conductor = 0

The field at any point outside the sphere is exactly the same as if the whole charge were concentrated at a point charge +Q at the centre of the sphere.

From outside the sphere, all the lines appear to be diverging from its centre, i.e. a radial field.

### Electric field inside a hollow charge conductor:

Zero charge on the inside surface of the sphere and hence zero field within the hollow space.

Hint:

Find the force on the electron in the electric field.

Recognize that the force causes the path of the electron to be parabolic in the uniform electric field.

Find the velocity using horizontal velocity and vertical velocity at the point of leaving.

**Candidates should be able to:**

1. _define potential at a point in terms of the work done in bringing unit positive charge from infinity to the point._
2. _use the equation_ \(V\)_= Q/4_\(\pi_{\text{EC}}\) _for the electric potential in the field of a point charge, in free space or air._

Information about the field may be given by stating the field strength at any point; alternatively the potential can be quoted.

### Electric potential

#### Meaning of potential

A charge in an electric field experiences a force and if it moves work will be done. If a positive charge is moved from A to B in a direction opposite to that of the field E, an external agent has to do work against the force of the field and energy has to be supplied. As a result, the system (of the charge in the field) gains an amount of electrical potential energy equal to the work done. When the charge is allowed to return from B to A, work is done by the forces of the field and the electrical potential energy previously gain by the system is lost. If, for example, the motion is in a vacuum, an equivalent amount of kinetic energy is transferred to the charge.

In general, the potential energy associated with a charge at a point in an electric field depends on the location of the point and the magnitude of the charge. Therefore if a unit positive charge is chosen and the change of potential energy which occurs when such a charge is moved from one point to another is called the change of the potential of the field itself.

Hence the potential at B exceeds that at A by the work which must be done against the electric force to take unit positive charge from A to B.

If we select the potential at an infinite distance from the any electric charges as zero of potential, then the potential at a point in a field can be defined as follow.

#### e.1.1 Definition of Electric potential:

The electric potential, V, at a point is defined as the work done per unit positive charge in moving a point charge from infinity to the point.

\[\text{V}\quad=\quad\quad\frac{\text{W}}{\text{q}}\]

Units: \(\text{J}\,\text{C}^{-1}\) or \(\text{V}\) (volt)

Electric potential is a scalar quantity.

Note:

(a) Potential at infinity is chosen as zero.

(b) Electric potential may be +ve or -ve depending on whether the potential is due to a positive or a negative charge. Work must be done on a positive charge in moving it from infinity towards a fixed positive charge and thus the potential is positive. Work is done by a positive charge in moving it towards a negative charge, resulting in a negative potential.

(c) Potential is a property of the field and not the individual charge placed there.

#### e.1.2 Electric potential difference:

Electric potential difference between 2 points B & A is defined as work done per unit positive charge when a very small charge moves from A to B.

\[\text{V}_{\text{ba}}=\text{V}_{\text{b}}\text{ - }\text{V}_{\text{a}}=\frac{\text{W}_{\text{ab}}}{\text{q}}\]

Units: \(\text{J}\,\text{C}^{-1}\) or \(\text{V}\) (volt)

If the p.d between 2 points in an electric field is 10 volts then 10 joules of work are done per coulomb of charge moving from one point to the other and an energy change of 10 joules per coulomb occurs.

#### e.1.3 Potential and field compared:

When describing a field, potential is usually a more useful quantity than field strength because, being a scalar, it can be added directly, when more than one field is concerned. Field strength is a vector and addition by the parallelogram law is more complex. Also, it is often more important to know what energy changes occur (rather than what forces act) when charges move in a field and these are readily calculated if potentials are known

#### 5.1.4 Equipotentials:

1. All points in a field which have the same potential can be imagined as lying on a surface (or plane) called an equipotential surface (or line in two dimensional diagram).
2. When a charge moves on such a surface (or line) no energy charge occurs and no work is done. The force due to field must therefore act at right angles to the equipotential surface at any point and so equipotential surfaces and fields line always intersect at right angles.
3. Equipotential surfaces for a point charge are concentric spheres (circles in two dimensions). There is spherical symmetry.

#### 5.1.5 Electric potential energy:

The **electric potential energy U** of a small test charge q at a point P a distance r from a point charge Q is defined as the work done on the charge q by some external system in moving the charge q from infinity to point P.

It can be shown that \(\mbox{U}=\frac{\mbox{Q}\,\mbox{q}}{4\,\pi\,\varepsilon_{\mbox{\tiny o}}\,\mbox {r}}\)

In a uniform field E is constant in magnitude and direction at all points,

\(\Rightarrow\)\(\frac{\mathrm{dV}}{\mathrm{dx}}\)\(=\) constant

i.e. the potential changes steadily with distance.

Hence the potential difference per unit distance is the electric field for a uniform field.

The electric field is in a direction in which the potential falls.

The electric field between 2 parallel charged metal plates is uniform. (not at the edges).

If V = 300 V and d = 6.0 m, then the field strength E at any point in the uniform region is:

Thus, in a uniform electric field:

E is constant in magnitude and direction at all points, hence \(\frac{\mathrm{dV}}{\mathrm{dx}}\) is constant, i.e. the potential changes steadily with distance. (See diagram).

The direction of the field is the same as the direction of decreasing potential.
