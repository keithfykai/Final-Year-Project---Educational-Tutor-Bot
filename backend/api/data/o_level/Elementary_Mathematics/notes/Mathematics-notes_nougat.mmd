## Mathematics - Important Notes and Formulas

### Numbers

\begin{tabular}{|p{113.8pt}|p{113.8pt}|} \hline
**Type** & **Definition** \\ \hline Natural numbers & All whole numbers except 0 \\  & eg: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5... \\ \hline Even numbers & 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10... \\ \hline Odd numbers & 1, 3, 5, 7, 9... \\ \hline Integers & whole numbers that can be positive, negative, or zero \\  & eg: -1, -2, -3, 1, 2, 3... \\ \hline Prime number & a natural number which has only 2 different factors \\  & eg: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13... \\ \hline Composite number & a natural number that has more than 2 different factors \\  & eg: 4, 6, 8, 9... \\ \hline Real number & Include rational and irrational numbers, fractions, and integers \\ \hline Rational number & a number that can be expressed as a fraction or as a ratio \\ \hline Irrational number & a number that cannot be expressed as a fraction or a ratio of 2 integers. \\  & eg: pi and roots \\ \hline \end{tabular}

### Test of Divisibility

\begin{tabular}{|p{113.8pt}|p{113.8pt}|} \hline
**Divisible by** & **Test** \\ \hline
2 & if the number is even \\ \hline
3 & if the sum of the digits is divisible by 3 \\ \hline
4 & if the number formed by the last 2 digits is divisible by 4 \\ \hline
5 & if the last digit is 0 or 5 \\ \hline
9 & if the sum of its digits is divisible by 9 \\ \hline
10 & if the last digit is 0 \\ \hline  & if the difference between the sum of the digits in the odd places and \\
11 & the sum of the digits in the even places is equal to 0 or is a multiple of \\  & 11 \\ \hline \end{tabular}

### Standard form

This is a convenient way to write very large or very small numbers, using the from a x 10\({}^{n}\), where n is a positive or negative integer, and a s between 1 to 10 inclusive.

More examples: 123 400 written as standard form is 1.234 x 10\({}^{5}\) 0.0000987 written as standard form is 9.87 x 10\({}^{5}\)

#### Multiplying numbers in standard form

\[(3.6\times 10^{7})\times(9\times 10^{-5})=(3.6\times 9)\times(10^{7} \times 10^{-5})\] \[=32.4\times 10^{2}\]

#### Dividing numbers in standard form

\[(5.8\times 10^{9})+(3.2\times 10^{-3})=(5.8+3.2)\times(10^{9}+10^{-3})\] \[=1.81\times 10^{12}\]

#### Adding and Subtracting numbers in standard form

- Make the index between the 2 numbers the same so that it is easier to factorise the numbers before adding

\[7.5\times 10^{8}+8\times 10^{3}=7.5\times 10^{8}+0.00008\times 10^{8}\] \[=10^{8}(7.5+0.00008)\] \[=7.50008\times 10^{8}\]

### Scales and Maps

Given that a map has a scale of 1:10 000, this means that 1cm on the map represents 10,000cm on the actual ground.

1cm : 200m = 1cm : 0.2km = 1cm\({}^{2}\) : 0.04km\({}^{2}\)

### Proportion

#### A. Direct Proportion

This means that when y increases, x increases, and vice versa.

Use this equation: y = kx

#### B. Indirect Proportion

This means that when y increases, x decreases, and vice versa.

Use this equation: y=k/x

## Percentage Change

% Change = \(\dfrac{\text{new value - original value}}{\text{original value}}\times 100\%\)

## Percentage Profit and Loss

% Profit=\(\dfrac{\text{selling price - cost price}}{\text{cost price}}\times 100\%\)

% loss=\(\dfrac{\text{cost price - selling price}}{\text{cost price}}\times 100\%\)

## Simple Interest and Compound Interest

### Simple Interest Formula

\(I=\dfrac{PRT}{100}\)

where I is the interest,

P is the principle sum,

R is the interest rate per annum,

T is the number of years,

\(A=P+\dfrac{PRT}{100}=P(1+\dfrac{RT}{100})\)

where A is the total amount of money earned plus interest

### Compound Interest Formula

\(A=P(1+\dfrac{R}{100})^{T}\)

\(I=A-P=P(1+\dfrac{R}{100})^{T}-P\)

### Compound interest compounded MONTHLY

#### Formula:

S = P(1 + r/k)\({}^{n}\)

S = final value

P = principal

r = interest rate (expressed as decimal eg 4% = 0.04)

k = number of compounding periods

## Algebraic Manipulation

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|} \hline x = y+z & y = x-z \\ \hline x = y-z & y = x+z \\ \hline x = yz & y = x/z ; z = x/y \\ \hline x = y/z & y = x2 ; z = y/x \\ \hline wx = yz & w = yz/x ; x=yz/w ; y = wx/z \\ \hline x = y\({}^{2}\) & y = +/-sqrt.x \\ \hline x = sqrt.y & y = x\({}^{2}\) \\ \hline x = y\({}^{3}\) & y = cuberoot.x \\ \hline x = cuberoot.y & y = x\({}^{3}\) \\ \hline ax + bx = x(a+b) & \\ ax + bx + kay + kby = x(a+b) + ky(a+b) = (a+b)(x+ky) \\ \hline (a+b)\({}^{2}\) = a\({}^{2}\) + 2ab + b\({}^{2}\) \\ (a-b)\({}^{2}\) = a\({}^{2}\) - 2ab + b\({}^{2}\) \\ \hline a\({}^{2}\) - b\({}^{2}\) = (a + b)(a - b) & \\ \hline \end{tabular}

## Solving algebraic fractional equations

Avoid these common mistakes!

\[\frac{a}{b}\neq\frac{a+c}{b+c}\] \[\frac{x+2}{x}\neq\frac{1+2}{1}\to\text{cannot cancel out the x!}\] \[\frac{a}{b}+\frac{c}{d}\neq\frac{a+c}{b+d}\to\text{must change to same denominator!}\]

## Solution of Quadratic Equations

The roots of \(\text{ax}^{2}+bx+c=0\) are given by

\[\frac{-6\pm\sqrt{b^{2}-4ac}}{2a}\]

### Completing the Square

Step 1: Take the number or coefficient before x and square it

Step 2: Divide the square of the number by 4

Eg. to make x\({}^{2}+5x\) into a perfect square, add \(\frac{5^{2}}{4}\)

Since \(\frac{5^{2}}{4}=\frac{25}{4}\), the result is x\({}^{2}+5x+\frac{25}{4}=(x+\frac{5}{2})^{2}\)

**Eg. y = x\({}^{2}\) + 6x - 11**

**y = x\({}^{2}\) + 2x(6/2) + (6/2)\({}^{2}\) - 11 - (6/2)\({}^{2}\)**

**y = (x + 3)\({}^{2}\) - 20**

### Sketching Graphs of Quadratic Equations

**A. eg. y= +/-(x - h)\({}^{2}\) + k Steps:**

1. Identify shape of curve

* h) to determine if it is "smiley face" or "sad face".

2. Find turning point

* (h, -k)

3. Find y-intercept

* sub x = 0 into the equation -> (0, y)

4. Line of symmetry reflect

* x = h, reflect to get (2x, y)

**B. eg. y = +/-(x - a)(x - b)**

### Steps:

1. Identify shape of curve

* look at the formula ax2 + bx + c.
* if a>1, it is positive; otherwise, it is negative

2. Find turning point

* (a + b)/2, sub answer into equation -> (a,b)3. Find y-intercept

* sub x = 0 into the equation -> (0, y)

4. Line of symmetry reflect

* x = a, reflect to get (2a, y)

## Inequalities

\(x\) < \(y\) means x is less than y

x \(\leq\) y means x is less than or equal to y

x \(>\) y means x is greater than y

x \(\geq\) y means x is greater than or equal to y

## Ways to solve equalities:

1. Add or subtract numbers from each side of the inequality

eg 10 - 3 < x - 3

2. Multiply or divide numbers from each side of the inequality by a constant

eg 10/3 < x/3

3. Multiply or divide by a negative number AND REVERSE THE INEQUALITY SIGNS

eg. 10 < x becomes 10/-3 > x/-3

## Example

Solve 3(x + 4) < 5x + 9

3(x + 4) < 5x + 9

3x + 12 < 5x + 9

-2x < -3

x \(>\dfrac{3}{2}\)

Statistics

Mean

\[Mean=\frac{-}{x}=\frac{x_{1}+x_{2}+...+x_{N}}{N}\]

N is the number of items

Mode

The mode is the most frequent value.

MedianThe median of a group of numbers is the number in the middle, when the numbers are in order of magnitude (in increasing order).

If you have n numbers in a group, the median in:

\[\frac{n+1}{2}th\text{ value}\]

### Types of Chart

1. Bar chart: the heights of the bars represent the frequency. The data is discrete.

3. Histogram: it is a vertical bar graph with no gaps between the bars. The area of each bar is proportional to the frequency it represents.

Stem-and-leaf diagram: a diagram that summarises while maintaining the individual data point. The stem is a column of the unique elements of data after removing the last digit. The final digits (leaves) of each column are then placed in a row next to the appropriate column and sorted in numerical order.

## 6. Quartiles

Interquartile range = \(Q_{3}-Q_{1}\)

Semi-interquartile range = \(\dfrac{1}{2}(Q_{3}-Q_{1})\)

**Probability**

Probability is the likelihood of an event happening

Probability = \(\dfrac{\text{the number of ways of achieving success}}{\text{the total number of possible outcomes}}\)

* The probability that a certain event happening is 1
* The probability that a certain event cannot happen is 0The probability that a certain event not happening is 1 minus he probability that it will happen

2 events are **independent** if the outcome of one of the events does not affect the outcome of another

2 events are **dependent** if the outcome of one of the events depends on the outcome of another

* If 2 events A and B are independent of each other, then the probability of both A and B occurring is found by P(A) x P(B)
* If it is impossible for both events A and B to occur, then the probability of A or B occurring is P(A) and P(B)
