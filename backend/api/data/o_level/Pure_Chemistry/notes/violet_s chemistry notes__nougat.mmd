## Chapter 1: Kinetic Particle Theory and the 3 States of Matter

**Kinetic Particle Theory**

All matter is made of small particles that are continually moving and hence possess kinetic energy.

Anything that has mass and takes up space is considered matter.

**Gases**

**Liquids**

**Solids**

**No fixed shape or volume:**

**particles can move freely at**

**high speeds**

**each other in translation**

**Wide spaces in between**

**particles:**

**can be compressed**

**Particles far apart / widely**

**spaced in a disorderly**

**arrangement:**

**low densities**

**Particles are held together by**

**weak forces of attraction**

**Changes in State**

**Melting and Boiling**

**When the substance is heated, the particles will move faster as they gain more kinetic energy.**

**When particles gain sufficient kinetic energy to overcome the forces of attraction, they will separate and move apart into**

**[liquid / gaseous state].**

**[Describe the new state of the particles.]**

**Condensing and Freezing**

**When the substance is heated, the particles will move slower as they lose kinetic energy.**

**When particles lose enough kinetic energy, they are no longer able to overcome the forces of attraction, so there are strong forces of attraction between them.**

**They will get closer in [solid / liquid state].**

**[Describe the new state of the particles.]**

**Volatile liquids** **are ones with boiling points close to room temperature. They evaporate easily.**

**Diffusion**

**Diffusion** is defined as the random movement of particles of a substance.

These particles have energy and unrestricted movement. They can move in any direction, though this occurs mainly in liquid and gaseous states. The net movement of the particles is from a region of higher to lower concentration. Eventually, particles are evenly distributed.

**Factors affecting the rate of diffusion**

molecule.

Liquid particles possess kinetic

energy and are able to slide

and roll over each other in

translation.

Solid particles possess the

least kinetic energy and are

unable to move freely.

**Chapters 2-3: Experimental Techniques, Separation and Purification**

**Separation Methods**

**NAME AND TYPE**

**KEY STEPS AND USES**

**Filtration:**

sold-liquid

Used for filtration in water purification

**Crystallisation / Evaporation**

**to Dryness:**

solute from solution

For crystallisation, let the solution cool and crystallise. Filter to

get crystals, wash with distilled water and dry between filter

paper.

For evaporation to dryness, heat the solution until dryness.

Used to separate salt from seawater.

**Simple Distillation:**

two miscible liquids with

different boiling points that are

far apart

The thermometer reads the temperature of the hot vapour

passing into the condenser.

Used for desalination and production of fermented liquor.

**Fractional Distillation:**

two miscible liquids with

different boiling points that are

close together

The additional fractionating column provides surface area for

higher boiling point gases to cool and condense into liquid, while

the gases that are boiling / of lower boiling point do not.

The vapour at top is only the gas with lowest bp and is pure.

Used for refining of crude oil.

Used in the production of liquified oxygen and liquified nitrogen

from liquified air.

**Separating Funnel:**

mxtures of immiscible liquids

Used to separate oil / chloroform and water.

**Sublimation:**

solid mixture of a substance

that sublimes and others that

are stable to heat

Used mostly for purification of iodine, ammonium chloride or

naphthalene.

**Paper Chromatography:**

determination of the identity

and purity of complex mixtures

The spots marked on the starting line should be above the

solvent level, to prevent them from dissolving.

Cover the boiling tube / beaker to prevent evaporation of the

volatile organic solvent.

Apply a locating agent to the paper.

The identity of substance can be found using rf value.

Used to separate pigments in flowers.

Used to test for chemicals in food.

Used to test athletes' urine samples.

rf value =

distance moved by substance

distance moved by solvent

_(affected by the type of solvent and temperature)_

**Testing for Purity**

Impurities cause melting /

boiling over a range

melting point and increase

boiling points.

## Chapter 13: Redox Reactions

**What is a redox reaction?**

It is a chemical reaction which involves the oxidation of a substance and reduction of another substance in the same reaction.

**Rules for Assigning Oxidation Numbers / States**

Oxidation states are hypothetical numbers assigned to an individual element by a set of rules.

1. The oxidation state of any element in the free / uncombined state is 0.

2. The oxidation state of any monoatomic ions is equal to the charge on the ion.

3. Combined oxygen: oxidation number is -2. (When oxygen is in a compound, its oxidation number is -2)

Exception: The oxidation number of oxygen in peroxides is -1.

4. Combined hydrogen: oxidation number is +1. (When hydrogen is in a compound, its oxidation number is +1)

Exception: The oxidation number of hydrogen in metal hydrides is -1.

5. In any neutral compound, the sum of all oxidation states must add up to 0.

6. In any polyatomic ion, the sum of all oxidation states must add up to the atom's net charge.

**Oxidation**

**Reduction**

Gain in oxygen, loss of hydrogen Loss in oxygen, gain in hydrogen

Gain in oxidation state Loss in oxidation state

**OIL RIG: Oxidation Is Loss of electrons, Reduction Is Gain of electrons**

**Oxidising agents**

Oxidizes another substance and gains

electrons, undergoing reduction

FeSO\({}_{4}\) : pale green Fe\({}^{2+}\) to yellow Fe\({}^{3+}\)

K\({}_{2}\)Cr\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{7}\) : orange Cr\({}^{6+}\) to green Cr\({}^{3+}\)

FeCl\({}_{3}\) : yellow Fe\({}^{3+}\) to pale green Fe\({}^{2+}\)

Halogens: Colour change depends on halogen.

Oxygen: Involved in combustion reactions.

Halides: Colour change depends on halogen.

Metals: lose electrons to form ions. The more

reactive, the stronger it is as a reducing agent.

Hydrogen: Oxidises to form H\({}_{2}\)O.

Carbon: Oxidises to form CO or CO\({}_{2}\).

Carbon monoxide: Oxidises to form CO\({}_{2}\).

Hydrogen peroxide can act as both an oxidising and reducing agent,

depending on the reactants it reacts with.

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:20]

**Types of Fuels**

Fuels are substances that are burnt to produce energy. They are exothermic reactions.

Heat (enthalpy) of combustion is the energy given out when a fuel burns completely and is measured in kiljoules per mole.

The energy density of a fuel is the amount of energy given out per gram of fuel burnt.

**HYDROCARBON / FOSIL FUELS**

-

The most commonly used fuels that are depleting at a fast rate.

-

Made from decayed plants and animals that lived millions of years ago.

Disadvantages:

-

During incomplete combustion due to a limited supply of air, soot (unburnt hydrocarbons)

and carbon monoxide are formed.

-

Carbon dioxide is formed in the burning of fossil fuels.

-

The burning of coal produces large amounts of ash and sulfur dioxide.

-

The depletion of natural resources.

HYDROGEN-OXGEN FUEL CELLS

**2H2 (g) + O2 (g) \(\to\) 2H2O (l)**

-

Hydrogen is the fuel with the highest energy density.

-

Hydrogen (from electrolysis of water or cracking of oils) and oxygen (from fractional distillation of liquid air) is passed through an electrolyte in a fuel cell.

-

A good alternative to the combustion of fossil fuels.

Applications:

-

Used in NASA's space shuttles to generate electricity.

-

Used to generate electricity in certain buses.

**ADVANTAGES**

**DISADVANTAGES**

Produces only water when burnt and thus

does not have any pollutant products.

Hydrogen is a gas at room temperature and

must be kept in a thick pressurised container

which is heavy, causing it to be harder to store

and transport compared to liquid fuels.

and transport compared to liquid fuels.

Little loss of energy.

A gram of hydrogen takes up a lot of space

compared to liquid fuels due to its low density.

Hydrogen is flammable and explosive.

Water is renewable.

**DISADVANTAGES**

**Figure 1**: The hydrogen obtained from electrolysis of water

requires a lot of energy and uses fossil fuels.

Deplete down by UV radiation to form

chlorine atoms, which break down

ozone to form chlorine oxide and

oxygen gas.

Since chlorine oxide is unstable,

another oxygen atom will steal the

oxygen atom the chlorine is bonded

with. The chlorine atom then attacks

another ozone molecule.

DEVELFURIZATION

Converts CO, NO and unburnt hydrocarbons

Removes SO\({}_{2}\) from the air

into less harmful substances.

2CO + O\({}_{2}\to 2\)CO\({}_{2}\)

2NO + CO \(\rightarrow\) N\({}_{2}\) + 2CO\({}_{2}\)

Unburnt hydrocarbons are converted by

combustion to carbon dioxide and water

SO\({}_{2}\) + CaCO\({}_{3}\to\) CaCO\({}_{3}\)

vapour.

Pass the sulfur dioxide through wet calcium

oxide / calcium carbonate. They will react to

form calcium sulfite.

catalyst is coated on ceramic tubes and exists

as a fine layer.

Vehicles with catalytic converters cannot use

leaded petrol as the lead coats the catalyst,

making it ineffective.

The Carbon Cycle

The mechanism that maintains the level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.

-

Comprises a sequence of events that maintains a constant amount of carbon dioxide.

-

The rate of removal of carbon from the air is equal to the rate of return of carbon to the air.

-

Three main processes that produce carbon dioxide: respiration, combustion and decay.

-

Two main processes that remove carbon dioxide: photosynthesis and ocean uptake.
