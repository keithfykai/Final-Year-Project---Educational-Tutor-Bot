**Take Note:**

The naming conventions of Congruency & Similarity Questions are important! Many students make mistake when defining the sides that they want to use in their arguments

**EX:** To show that \(\Delta ABC\equiv\Delta XYZ\)

To show that 2 sides are equal in length, the direction of how students define the length must stay consistent (Either all Clockwise or Anti-Clockwise)

\[AC=XZ\qquad\qquad OR\qquad CA=ZX\]

To show that 2 angles are equal in size, the direction of how students define the angles must stay consistent (Either all Clockwise or Anti-Clockwise)

\[\angle ABC=\angle XYZ\qquad OR\qquad\angle CBA=\angle ZYX\]

**Justifications for each argument**

Formal Justifications must be provided at each step, no matter how trivial

1. If the question states that the lengths/angles are equal, simply write the equal lengths/angles and state that it is "Given"

\[AC=XZ\quad\mbox{(given)}\]

* Note that you can only use "Given" if the question explicitly states that the lengths/angles are equal! If you require to perform some calculations to find the lengths, you are NOT allowed to write "Given"
2. If 2 triangles have a common side/angle (means that 2 triangles are stuck together and joined with a side/angle that both triangles have), simply write that the side/angle is common

\[AC\]

is a common side
3. If the question requires some calculations for the angles, reasons must be explicitly stated as to how you come about with said calculations. Use reasons from Topic 11: Angles, Triangles & Bypbops, and Topic 13: Properties of Circles to help justify all your arguments

\[\angle ABC=\angle XYZ\quad\mbox{(alternate angles)}\]

## 3. Tangent Theorem

The line perpendicular to the tangent at the point of contact passes through the centre of the circle

Tangents drawn from an external point to a circle are equal

**Take Note:** \\ \hline This is a highly tested theorem! Many students struggle to find and use this Theorem in their solutions. \\ \hline \end{tabular} \\ \end{tabular}

\begin{tabular}{l} \hline \hline Always look out for a triangle with all 3 points touching the circle with one of the points at a tangent to the circle \\ \hline \end{tabular} \\ \end{tabular}

**4. Alternate Segment Theorem** \\ \hline An angle between a tangent and a chord through the point \\ of contact is equal to the angle in the alternate segment \\ \hline \end{tabular}
