Gravimetric Analysis

Gravimetry involves the accurate measurement of mass as a means of quantifying a sample. The substance to be weighed may be formed from thermal decomposition or by precipitation.

## Thermal Decomposition

This method involves heating a compound until it decomposes to give a solid residue and a gaseous product.

General procedure:

* Record the mass of an empty boiling tube/crucible.
* Weigh accurately \(m\) g of the compound in the boiling tube. Record total mass.
* Heat the sample gently in the boiling tube using a Bunsen burner.
* Then heat strongly for at least 10 min.
* Cool and weigh the boiling tube and its contents.
* The process of heating, cooling and weighing is repeated until constant mass is achieved.

Points to take note:

* Apparatus used for heating: dry and clean boiling tube or crucible
* Heating should be gentle at first to prevent spattering of the sample. Strong heating is then carried out for about 10 min.
* The crucible and its contents should be cooled to room temperature. If the crucible and its contents are weighed when they are hot, the measured mass will be less than their true mass. Why? As hot air rises above the crucible, cold air is drawn in and as it heats up and rises, it lifts the crucible very slightly from the balance pan.
* Ideally, the crucible and its contents should be cooled in a desiccator (see below). The desiccator provides a dry atmosphere and allows the crucible and its contents to cool without absorbing moisture.
* The procedure of reheating, cooling and weighing of the solid until constant mass is important in gravimetric analysis because this ensures that the sample is completely decomposed.
* Possible source of error: Due to uneven heating, part of the sample may not have decomposed.

Basic safety considerations:

* Allow the crucible to cool sufficiently before handling and handle a hot crucible with crucible tongs. This is to ensure that your hands do not get burnt.
* While heating a sample using a boiling tube, move the boiling tube up and down, and do not heat it at one spot. This is to prevent the contents of the boiling tube from spurring due to intensive heating at one spot.
* Handle the boiling tube with a test tube holder at all times. This ensures that your hands do not get burnt.
* Point the boiling tube away from yourself and others. This ensures that no one gets hurt in case of spurting.

* Gas collection method is fast, but it is _not_ so accurate because
* some gases, e.g. CO\({}_{2}\), may dissolve in the water if the water displacement method is used.
* some gas may escape from the experimental set-up instead of being collected in the burette/measuring cylinder/gas syringe.
* swirling of the conical flask is variable, which will vary the volume of gas collected in the measuring cylinder;
* air and the gas evolved are both compressible, and heat of reaction may cause fluctuation in gas volumes due to thermal expansion;
* volume of gas collected in the gas syringe or by water displacement method is dependent on temperature and pressure.
* the ideal gas equation must be used to determine the amount of substance present from the volume of gas collected. However, this is not a good estimate, especially for gases which deviate greatly from the ideal gas behaviour.

* General Guideline

* **(a)** Pre-calculations
* Since a 100 cm\({}^{3}\) gas syringe is used, let the volume of O\({}_{2}\)(g) collected be 72.0 cm\({}^{3}\)
* As 1 mole of gas occupies a volume of 24 dm\({}^{3}\) under laboratory conditions,
* Amount of O\({}_{2}\) evolved = 72.0 \(\times\) 10\({}^{-3}\) + 24
* = 3.00 \(\times\) 10\({}^{-3}\) mol
* 2H\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{2}\)(aq) \(\longrightarrow\) 2H\({}_{2}\)O(l) + O\({}_{2}\)(g)

* = 6.00 \(\times\) 10\({}^{-3}\) mol
* Assume that the concentration of H\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{2}\)(aq) used is 0.150 mol dm\({}^{-3}\).
* Thus, volume of H\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{2}\) to be used = 6.00 \(\times\) 10\({}^{-3}\) + 0.150 \(\times\) 1000 = 40.0 cm\({}^{3}\)
* Experiment set-up

* Using a burette, add 40.00 cm\({}^{3}\) of H\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{2}\)(aq) into a clean and dry 250 cm\({}^{3}\) conical flask with a side arm.
* Weigh accurately about 1.00 g of MnO\({}_{2}\)(s) and place it in a small tube tied to a string.
* Set up the apparatus as shown above.
* Lower the filled tube into the conical flask taking care that the reagents do not mix. Stopper the conical flask.

* Repeat the experiment again to get consistent results of volume of O\({}_{2}\)(g) collected.

* Note: Both steps 8 and 10 help to ensure accuracy and reliability.
* Step 8 ensures that after the reaction has ceased, time is allowed for the pressure and/or temperature to stabilise before measurement of volume. Step 10 ensures that the experiment is repeated to obtain consistent values of O\({}_{2}\)(g) collected.
* Calculations

* volume of O\({}_{2}\)(g) evolved = **V*
* As 1 mole of gas occupies a volume of 24 dm\({}^{3}\) under laboratory conditions,

* 2H\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{2}\)(aq) \(\longrightarrow\) 2H\({}_{2}\)O(l) + O\({}_{2}\)(g)
* Amount of H\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{2}\) = \(\dfrac{2V}{24000}=\dfrac{V}{12000}\) mol
* Since volume of H\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{2}\) used = 40.00 cm\({}^{3}\), concentration of H\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{2}\) = \(\dfrac{V}{12000}\)\(\dfrac{1000}{40.00}=\dfrac{V}{480}\) mol dm\({}^{-3}\)
* The actual concentration of H\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{2}\) obtained via titration is more accurate than gas collection. In gas : collection, the volume of the gas collected fluctuates with temperature and pressure, which affects the accuracy of the amount and concentration of H\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{2}\) obtained. Also, some O\({}_{2}\)(g) may have escaped when the flask is being stoppered.

**Mass of FA1 to be used**

Assume that 50.0 cm\({}^{3}\) of CO\({}_{2}\) gas is collected.

As 1 mole of gas occupies a volume of 24 dm\({}^{3}\) under laboratory conditions,

Amount of CO\({}_{2}=\frac{50.0}{24000}=2.08\times 10^{-3}\) mol

Na\({}_{2}\)CO\({}_{3}\)(s) + 2HCI(aq) \(\rightarrow\) 2NaCl(aq) + CO\({}_{2}\)(g) + H\({}_{2}\)O(l)

Amount of Na\({}_{2}\)CO\({}_{3}\) = 2.08 x 10\({}^{-3}\) mol

Molar mass of Na\({}_{2}\)CO\({}_{3}\) = 106.0 g mol\({}^{-1}\)

Mass of Na\({}_{2}\)CO\({}_{3}\) = (2.08 x 10\({}^{-3}\))(106.0) = 0.220 g

Assume that **FA 1** contains 80% Na\({}_{2}\)CO\({}_{3}\). Hence mass of FA 1 to be used = 0.220 / 0.8 = 0.275 g

**Volume of HCI(aq) to be used**

Amount of HCI(aq) = (2)(2.08 x 10\({}^{-3}\)) = 4.16 x 10\({}^{-3}\) mol

Volume of HCI to be used = (4.16 x 10\({}^{-3}\))/0.200 = 2.08 x 10\({}^{-2}\) dm\({}^{3}\) = 20.8 cm\({}^{3}\)

Since HCI(aq) has to be in excess such that the Na\({}_{2}\)CO\({}_{3}\) used is completely reacted and for the experiment to be repeated, a suitable volume of HCI(aq) to be used is 30 cm\({}^{3}\).

Procedure

Using a burette, add 30.00 cm\({}^{3}\) of HCI(aq) into a clean and dry 250 cm\({}^{3}\) conical flask with a side arm.

Weigh accurately about 0.275 g of **FA 1** and place it in a small tube tied to a string.

Set up the apparatus as shown above.

Lower the filled tube into the conical flask taking care that the reagents do not mix. Stopper the conical flask.

Check that the initial reading of the 100.0 cm\({}^{3}\) graduated gas syringe is set at the zero mark.

At a suitable time, loosen the stopper slightly to release the string to allow mixing of **FA 1** and HCI(aq). Stopper the conical flask immediately.

Swift the conical flask to ensure that the reagents are well mixed.

Allow the reaction to progress until it has ceased as indicated by a constant reading of the syringe.

Record the final reading, **V** cm\({}^{3}\), on the graduated gas syringe.

Repeat the experiment again to get consistent results of volume of CO\({}_{2}\)(g) collected.

Calculations

Let the **average** volume of CO\({}_{2}\)(g) collected be **V** cm\({}^{3}\) and the mass of **FA1** used = **m** - **m** g

Amount of CO\({}_{2}\) formed = \(\frac{V}{24000}\) mol

Amount of Na\({}_{2}\)CO\({}_{3}\) = Amount of CO\({}_{2}\) = \(\frac{V}{24000}\) mol

Mass of Na\({}_{2}\)CO\({}_{3}\) = \(\frac{V}{24000}\) x106.0 g

Percentage composition by mass of Na\({}_{2}\)CO\({}_{3}\) in **FA 1** = \(\left(\frac{V}{24000}\times 106.0\right)\times 100\%\) = \(\frac{53V}{120(m_{1}-m_{2})}\%\)

Thermochemistry is the study of heat effects accompanying chemical reactions, the formation of solutions and changes in physical states of substances. The measurement of the heat of a reaction requires the careful determination of a measurable change in temperature, often with the use of a calorimeter.

Refer to your lecture notes on Chemical Energetics for the definitions of important terms. You must be able to construct energy cycles and calculate enthalpy changes of reactions using the experimental data obtained.

5. Repeat steps 1 to 3 using different volumes of **FA 1**, each time using the appropriate volume of **FA 2** so that the **total volume of the mixture is kept constant**.
6. Plot the graph of T/ "C against volume of **FA 2**/ cm\({}^{3}\). Draw best-fit lines for the points before and after the maximum/minimum temperature, T, has been reached and extend them until they intersect. The point at which the two best-fit lines meet corresponds to the volume of **FA 2** required for reaction and \(\Delta\)T.

## 5 Worked Example 6 \(\blacktriangle\)\(\blacklozenge\)

NH\({}_{4}\)C/ is commonly used in ice packs. With a solubility of 383 g dm\({}^{-3}\), it is one of the more soluble salts readily available.

NH\({}_{4}\)C/(s) + aq \(\rightarrow\) NH\({}_{4}\)C/(aq) \(\Delta H_{\text{soln}}\approx\) +15 kJ mol\({}^{-1}\)

You are to plan an experiment to determine the enthalpy change of solution, \(\Delta H_{\text{soln}}\), of ammonium chloride.

You may assume you are provided with the following:

* 20g of solid NH\({}_{4}\)C/ \(\blacklozenge\) other apparatus normally found
* a polystyrene cup in a school laboratory
* a thermometer

Your plan should include:

* the apparatus you would use,
* calculation of suitable quantities of ammonium chloride
* practical details of how you would

- ensure a known mass of NH\({}_{4}\)C/ is transferred to the water;

- determine the temperature change of the reaction mixture.

tabulation of recorded data;

brief but specific details of how the results would then be used to obtain \(\Delta H_{\text{soln}}\) of ammonium chloride.

#### Precalculation

Let the volume of water used = 50.0cm\({}^{3}\)

Since solubility of NH\({}_{4}C\)_I_ in water is 383 g dm\({}^{-3}\),

Max mass of NH\({}_{4}C\)_I_ that would dissolve in 50.0cm\({}^{3}\) of water = \(\frac{383}{1000}\times 50\) = 19.15 g

Let the temperature change be -7 \({}^{\circ}\)C.

Heat change = 50 x 4.18 x -7 = -1463 J

Since \(\Delta H_{\rm soh}\) (NH\({}_{4}C\)_I_) \(\approx\) +15 kJ mol\({}^{-1}\),

n(NH\({}_{4}C\)_I_) = \(-\frac{1463}{15\times 10^{3}}\)

mass of NH\({}_{4}C\)_I_ = 0.09753 x (14.0+4.0+35.5) = 5.218 g

#### Procedure

1. Using a 50.0 cm\({}^{3}\) burette (or measuring cylinder), transfer 50.0 cm\({}^{3}\) of deionised water into a clean and dry polystyrene cup supported in a 250 cm\({}^{3}\) beaker. Take the initial temperature of the water using the thermometer provided.
2. Using an analytical balance, weigh accurately about 5.22 g of NH\({}_{4}C\)_I_ in a clean and dry weighing bottle. Record the total mass of the weighing bottle and solid NH\({}_{4}C\)_I_.
3. Empty the solid NH\({}_{4}C\)_I_ into the polystyrene cup, cover the cup with a lid and stir gently using the thermometer to dissolve all the NH\({}_{4}C\)_I_. Record the lowest temperature reached.
4. Weigh the emptied weighing bottle and record its mass.
5. Repeat steps 1 to 4. Use the data obtained from each experiment to calculate a value for \(\Delta H\). Take the average of these two values.

#### Table of results

Mass of weighing bottle and solid NH\({}_{4}C\)_I_ / g

Mass of solid NH\({}_{4}C\)_I_ used / g

The change in temperature (\(\Delta\)T)

will be negative as temperature

Initial temperature / \({}^{\circ}\)C

decreases when NH\({}_{4}C\) dissolves

Change in temperature / \({}^{\circ}\)C

in water. \(\Delta\)T = T\({}_{mn}\) - T\({}_{i}\)

#### Calculations to determine \(\Delta H_{\rm soh}\)

Assume specific heat capacity of solution to be 4.18 J cm\({}^{-1}\) K\({}^{-1}\).

Assume no heat absorbed from surroundings.

Energy change for the reaction, q = (50.0)(4.18)(-T) = -209T J

Let mass of NH\({}_{4}C\)_I_ used be **mA** g.

Molar mass of NH\({}_{4}C\)_I_ = 53.5 g mol\({}^{-1}\)

Amount of NH\({}_{4}C\)_I_ used = \(\frac{m_{A}}{53.5}\) mol

Enthalpy change of reaction

\(=\) - \(\frac{q}{amount\) of NH\({}_{4}C\)_I_ = - \(\frac{(-2097)(53.5)}{m_{A}}=+\frac{11181.57}{m_{A}}\) J mol\({}^{-1}\)

Since the reaction is endothermic and temperature decreases, enthalpy change

of reaction must be positive.

\(\begin{array}{ll}\mbox{S${}_{2}$O${}_{8}${}^{2^{-}}$}+21^{-}&\mbox{l${}_{2}$ + $2SO${}_{4}${}^{2^{-}}$}&\mbox{reaction I}\\ \mbox{l${}_{2}$}+2S${}_{2}$O${}_{3}${}^{2^{-}}$}&\mbox{2$l${}^{-}$}+S${}_{4}$O${} ^{2^{-}}$&\mbox{reaction II}\end{array}\)

When a small but constant amount of S\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{3}\)\({}^{2^{-}}\) is added to a reaction mixture, the iodine being slowly produced by reaction I will immediately react in reaction II until all the S\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{3}\)\({}^{2^{-}}\) has been used up. At that point, any iodine which is further produced in reaction I will cause a sudden appearance of a deep blue colour in the presence of starch.

**You are to plan a series of experiments to determine the order of reaction with respect to S\({}_{2}\)O\({}^{2^{-}}\) by the "clock" method.**

You provided with the following:

* aqueous KI
* aqueous Na\({}_{2}\)S\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{8}\)
* aqueous Na\({}_{2}\)S\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{3}\)
* stopwatch
* while file
* 100 cm\({}^{3}\) beaker

The volumes of reagents for the experiment 1 have been predetermined.

\begin{tabular}{||c|c|c|c|c|} \hline Expt & Volume of & Volume of & Volume of & Volume of \\ No. & KI / cm\({}^{3}\) & Na\({}_{2}\)S\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{3}\) / cm\({}^{3}\) & H\({}_{2}\)O/ cm\({}^{3}\) & Na\({}_{2}\)S\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{8}\), V / cm\({}^{3}\) \\ \hline
1 & 5 & 5 & 40 & 10 \\
2 & & & & \\ \hline
3 & & & & \\ \hline
4 & & & & \\ \hline
5 & & & & \\ \end{tabular}

* Complete the table above with appropriate volumes of each reagent.
* Describe an experimental procedure that would allow you to determine the order of reaction with respect to S\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{3}\)\({}^{2^{-}}\) by the "clock" method.
* Explain briefly how the results of the experimental procedure can be used to determine the order of reaction with respect to S\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{8}\)\({}^{2^{-}}\).

**Note**:
* S\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{8}\)\({}^{2^{-}}\) will react with the added I\({}^{-}\) (from KI) to form I\({}_{2}\)
* But, the formed I\({}_{2}\) will react with S\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{3}\)\({}^{2^{-}}\) in the solution.
* A constant amt of S\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{3}\)\({}^{2^{-}}\) is used, resulting in a constant amt of I\({}_{2}\) being generated to use up the S\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{3}\)\({}^{2^{-}}\) before reacting with starch to give the blue black colour.
* The solution will turn blue black (indicating presence of I\({}_{2}\) reacting

* **Worked Example 111.4**

You are to investigate the order of reaction with respect to H\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{2}\) using a sampling method.

Hydrogen peroxide decomposes catalytically according to the following equation:

* 2H\({}_{2}\)O\((\)aq\()\)\(\xrightarrow{}\) 2H\({}_{2}\)O\((\)\) + O\({}_{2}\)(g)

You are provided with the following:

* Aqueous hydrogen peroxide
* Aqueous iron(III) chloride
* Dilute cold sulfuric acid
* 0.02 mol dm\({}^{-3}\) aqueous potassium manganate(VII)
* 50 cm\({}^{3}\) measuring cylinders
* 50 cm\({}^{3}\) buret
* 25 cm\({}^{3}\) pipettes
* 250 cm\({}^{3}\) beakers
* 250 cm\({}^{3}\) conical flasks
* Stopwatch
* Glass rod

Iron(III) chloride catalyses the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide

The amount of hydrogen peroxide remaining in the mixture at any time during the reaction may be determined by titration with aqueous acidified potassium manganate(VII).

* Write a balanced equation for the reaction between hydrogen peroxide and potassium manganate(VII).
* Suggest why cold dilute sulfuric acid needs to be used in this experiment.
* Plan an investigation to determine the order of reaction with respect to H\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{2}\) using a sampling, quenching and titration method.

You may assume that you are provided with:

* aqueous hydrogen peroxide
* aqueous iron(III) chloride
* cold dilute sulfuric acid
* 0.02 mol dm\({}^{-3}\) aqueous potassium manganate(VII)
* the equipment normally found in a school or college laboratory

In your plan you should include brief details of:

* the apparatus you would use,
* the quantities you would use,
* the procedure you would follow,
* the measurements that you would take and the tabulation of data,
* an outline of how the results would be used to determine the order with respect to hydrogen peroxide.

* Time (of quenching)
* Final buret reading
* Initial buret reading
* _V(MonO) \(\alpha\) + H\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{2}\)_
* Plot V(MonO) against time is equivalent to plotting [H\({}_{2}\)O] against time.
