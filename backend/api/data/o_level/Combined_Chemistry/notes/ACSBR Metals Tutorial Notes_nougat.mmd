2. **Structure & Physical Properties of Alloys** The term 'alloys' are used to refer to metals with other elements mixed into them. These other elements **may be either metals or non-metals** themselves. Since the chemical properties of the constituents remain the same, **alloys are mixtures**, not compounds. Some Common Alloys: Brass - mixture of _copper_ and zinc Bronze - mixture of _copper_ and tin Nichrome - mixture of _nickel_ and _chromium_. Steel - mixture of _iron_ and carbon Stainless Steel - mixture of _iron_, chromium, carbon and nickel

Unlike a pure metal, **alloys are far less malleable and ductile**, as it the presence of 'foreign atoms' prevent the metallic atoms from sliding past each other so easily. In daily life, we tend to use alloys more often than pure metals. Below lists several reason as to why, industrially, alloys are more useful.

\begin{tabular}{|p{142.3pt}|p{142.3pt}|} \hline
**Harder, Stronger Texture** & **More Resistant to Corrosion** \\ e.g. & steel & e.g. _stainless steel_ \\ \hline Unlike pure metals which are malleable and ductile, alloys tend to be stronger due to the presence of foreign atoms which disrupt the regular arrangement of the metal. This prevents the atoms from sliding past each other so easily. & Alloys can be more resistant to corrosion. For example, pure iron corrodes if exposed to air for a long period of time. In comparison, stainless steel (an alloy of iron) is able with withstand corrosion despite contact with air and water. \\ \hline \end{tabular}

Sometimes we may desire alloys with low melting points; e.g. solder, a mixture of tin and lead, is often melted to join other metals together. Conversely, we may also desire alloys which can withstand greater temperatures than their constituents.

3. **Review Questions** 1. In the table below, compare and contrast between alkali metals and transition metals. 2. Sodium, magnesium and aluminium are in the same period of the Periodic Table. Which of these three metals has the highest melting point? Explain your answer. 3. **Aluminium, as it has the most valence electrons (i.e. three). leading to a larger number of delocalised electrons to hold the positive ions together. 4. Explain why pure metals are malleable and ductile, while alloys have a harder texture. 4. **In a pure metal, the atoms are arranged in an orderly manner and hence layers of atoms are able to slide over each other easily. 5. In an alloy, the presence of foreign atoms disrupt the regular arrangement, and hence the atoms are no longer able to slide over each other easily. 6. 1. Are alloys able to conduct electricity? Explain why they are able or not able to do so. **Yes: this is because alloys contain delocalised electrons in their structure which are mobile and hence able to carry an electric current?** 2. State two reasons why steel, and not iron, is often used for making kitchen utensils. **Steel has a harder, stronger texture, i.e. less malleable and ductile. **Kitchen utensils often use stainless steel, which does not rust. 3. Name the only two pure metals which are not grey in appearance, and state their colours. 4. **S

5. **Metal Oxidation Reactions 3 & 4: Reactions with Dilute Acid and Oxygen** Apart from reactions with water and steam, the reactivity series can also predict other oxidation reactions of metals; namely with acid (as learnt in the chapter on acids and bases) and when heated in the presence of oxygen.

## 7 Relating Thermal Stability of Salts to the Reactivity Series

Some salts are able the decompose upon heating. Such salts are referred to as being **thermally unstable**. On the other hand, salts which do not decompose upon heating are referred to as being thermally stable.

The thermal stability of a salt can be predicted from the reactivity series:

The more reactive the metal, the more stable a compound it forms. Therefore, it is more difficult / requires more energy to thermally decompose.

This can be illustrated by observing the ease of thermal decomposition of metal carbonates, metal hydroxides, metal nitrates and metal sulfates. As you would observe, the lower the metal in the reactivity series, the easier to decompose its compound.

1. Solid samples of calcium carbonate and lead(II) carbonate are heated strongly over an open flame. Which compound would you expect to take a longer time to decompose? Explain how you arrived at your answer.

**Calcium carbonate. This is because calcium is a more reactive metal than lead, and hence will form more stable compounds. Thus calcium carbonate is more difficult to decompose than lead(II) carbonate.**
2. From the above table, what conclusion can you draw about Group I carbonates and their ease of thermal decomposition?

_Group I carbonates are unable to undergo thermal decomposition._

9. **Review Questions** 1. [label=()] 2. Zinc ore and iron ore can both be obtained reduced by heating with carbon. Which of these two ores will require a higher temperature for extraction? Explain your answer. [label=()] 3. Zinc ore, Zinc is a more reactive metal than iron, and hence zinc ore is more stable than iron ore and requires a greater amount of energy for reduction. 4. Small samples of three metal ores, X, Y and Z, are heated strongly with carbon until globules of liquid metal were formed. The time taken for the ore to be completely reduced is shown: [label=()] 4. **Cr** **Time Taken for Reduction (min)** 5. **X** **Completely reduced in 25 min** 6. **Y** **Completely reduced in 10 min** 7. **Z** **No reduction at all after an hour. 6. Arrange the three ores in decreasing order of stability. [label=()] 6. **Z**, X, y. 7. Suggest a possible identity for ore Z. [label=potassium/sodium/calcium/magnetism ore] 8. Calcium metal is industrially obtained from electrolysis of its molten ore, gypsum. 1. In terms of structure and bonding, explain why the ore needs to be molten, and not solid, in order to be extracted by electrolysis. [label=The minerals in gypsum are ionic compounds. When solid, the ions are held in fixed positions and hence unable to conduct an electric current. When molten, the ions are free to move and hence can conduct an electric current. 2. Zinc metal can also be obtained by electrolysis of its molten ore, sphalerite. However, industrially, this is done by reduction by carbon instead. Explain why this is so. [label=Electrelysis is a far more expensive process as a large amount of energy is required not only in terms of electricity, but also to keep the ore molten. 3.

* Under bright sunlight, silver chloride can decompose into its elements as shown: 2 AgCl (s) 2 Ag (s) + Cl2 (g) Do you expect sodium chloride to behave the same way under sunlight? Why or why not?

11. **Iron: Extraction in Blast Furnace** Iron metal is extracted industrially from its ore, **haematite**. This process is carried out in a large chimney-like structure known as a **blast furnace**. The blast furnace is made up of refractory brick in order to withstand high temperatures.

13. **Iron: Conditions for Rusting** The term 'rusting' is used to refer to the **corrosion of iron**. Rust, the reddish-brown deposits coating the corroded metal, is hydrated iron(III) oxide. Its striking colour and uneven texture gives the corroded iron a very unsightly appearance. Rusting may only occur when iron is exposed to both oxygen and water...: **2 Fe (s) + 3 O2 (g) + 2n H2O (I) \(\rightarrow\) 2 Fe2O3.nH2O (s) iron oxygen water crust** Do note that the term 'rusting' may **not** be used to describe the corrosion or oxidation of any other metals - it is used for iron and its alloys only. 1. One method to prevent an iron object from rusting is by painting it. 1. Explain how this method prevents an iron object from rusting. **It prevents the iron object from coming in contact with oxygen and water, which are the conditions necessary for rusting to occur**. 2. Suggest other similar ways in which an iron object can be protected against rusting. **Greasing, plastic-coating, tin-plating, gold-plating** 2. In an experiment, iron nails were placed in various conditions as shown below. For each of the diagrams, indicate whether they "will rust" or "will not rust".

14. **Recycling of Metals**

Besides mining for ores, another way to obtain metals for industrial use is by recycling scrap metal. This has both its advantages and its disadvantages.

**Recycling of metals** refers to the **collecting**, **sorting**, and **melting down**

of scrap metal and **putting** them to new uses.

The **most important reason** why we should recycle metals is because **metels** _are_ \(a\) _finite_

_resource_ and _recycling_ enables us to conserve this finite resource for future use_.

In the table below, discuss the various advantages and disadvantages of recycling, as compared to mining for new metals.

**Cots**

**Recycling saves costs and time required to mine for new metals.**

**Recycling requires costs and time to collect/sort scrap metal.**

**Usage of Fuels**

**& Air Pollution**

**Extraction of new metals from**

**their ores requires large amounts of fossil fuels, straining the availability of fossil fuels.**

**Extraction of new metals also produces air pollution, due to either intentional or unintentional combustion, e.g. blast furnace.**

**Land Use**

**Recycling reduces the land required for disposal of scrap metal by dumping, hence reducing land pollution.**

**Recycling also reduces the land required for mining, increasing availability of land for other uses such as agriculture.**
