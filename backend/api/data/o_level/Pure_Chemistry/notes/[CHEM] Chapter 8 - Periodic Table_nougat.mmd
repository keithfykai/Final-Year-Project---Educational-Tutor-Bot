## Physical Properties of Transition Metals

Transition metals has high melting points and high densities due to the strong metallic bonds.

They are good electrical and thermal conductors.

Transition metals also form **coloured compounds.**

### Chemical Properties of Transition Metals

Transition metals has the ability to exhibit **multiple oxidation states.**

Hence, they are frequently used as **catalysts.**

For example, **iron** is used in the Haber process to produce ammonia, and **mickel** is used in making margarine through the process of adding hydrogen to vegetable oil (hydrogenation).

HALOGENS

PHYSICAL PROPERTIES OF HALOGENS

- Low melting and boiling points that has an increasing trend

down the group

- Densities of the halogens increase down the group

- Dissobe sparingly in water (chlorine, bromine and iodine) generally, but soluble in organic solvents.

- Does not conduct electricity due to a lack of mobile charge carriers

**CHMICAL PROPERTIES OF HALOGENS**

**Reactivity decreases down the group. The ease of gaining a valence electron decreases as the valence shell is further away from the nucleus, making it more difficult to attract an electron.**

**DISPLEMENT REACTION**

A **more reactive halogen** is able to **displace a less reactive halogen** from an aqueous solution of its ions.

\(\text{Cl}_{2}\left(\text{aq}\right)+2\text{KBr}\left(\text{aq}\right)+2\text{ KCI}\left(\text{aq}\right)+\text{Br}_{2}\left(\text{aq}\right)\)

The solution will turn reddish brown due to the aqueous bromine produced.

* [19] The diagram shows part of the Periodic Table.

Which two elements would react together most vigorously? (N2020/P1/Q23)

[MISSING_PAGE_POST]

* [20] In the equation shown, X and Y represent elements in Group VII of the Periodic Table. \(\rm X_{2}+2KY\to Y_{2}+2KX\) Which pair of elements could be X and Y? (N2020/P1/Q24)

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|} \hline  & X & Y \\ \hline
1 & chlorine & iodine \\
2 & bromine & chlorine \\
3 & bromine & iodine \\
4 & iodine & fluorine \\ \hline A & 1 and 3 & B & 1 and 4 \\ C & 2 and 3 & D & 2 and 4 \\ \end{tabular} ( )

## Answer:

* [20] A In Group VII, a more reactive element is higher in position in the group. X must be more reactive than Y since a reaction happens between X and KY.
