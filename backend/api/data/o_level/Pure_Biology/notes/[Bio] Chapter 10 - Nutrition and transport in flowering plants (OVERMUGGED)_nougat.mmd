(a) Identify the cellular and tissue structure of a dicotyledonous leaf, as seen in transverse section using the light microscope and describe the significance of these features in terms of their functions, such as the

\(\bullet\) distribution of chloroplasts for photosynthesis

\(\bullet\) stomata and mesophyll( cells for gaseous exchange

\(\bullet\) vascular bundles for transport * Plants open their stomata during the day for carbon dioxide intake and close their stomata during the night to minimise water loss through transpiration.
* Guard cells photosynthesize and energy is used to pump potassium ions by active transport into the guard cells from neighbouring epidermal cells
* This lowers the water potential of guard cells
* Water from neighbouring cells enter guard cells via osmosis
* Guard cells swell and become turgid. Due to uneven thickness of cells walls, guard cells become curved and lead to the opening of stoma

In the night
* Potassium ions move out of the guard cells via diffusion
* Water potential is increased in guard cells
* Water moves out of the guard cells to the neighbouring cell
* Guard cells become flaccid and the stoma closes.

**Index of carbon dioxide**

\({}^{\bullet}\) In daylight when photosynthesis occurs, carbon dioxide in the leaf is rapidly used up.

\({}^{\bullet}\) The carbon dioxide concentration in the leaf becomes lower than that in the atmospheric air, so carbon dioxide diffuses from the surrounding air through the stomatal openings into the intercellular air spaces where they dissolve into the thin film of moisture before diffusing into the mesophyll( cells(h) Investigate and discuss the effects of varying light intensity, carbon dioxide concentration and temperature on the rate of photosynthesis (e.g. in submerged aquatic plant)

(i) Discuss light intensity, carbon dioxide concentration and temperature as limiting factors on the rate of photosynthesis * At a constant temperature and carbon dioxide concentration, the rate of photosynthesis increases with increasing light intensity until it reaches a plateau. Here, light intensity is the limiting factor as any increase in light intensity cause the rate of photosynthesis to increase
* When plateau is reached, rate of photosynthesis reach its maximum. Any increase in light intensity would not affect rate of photosynthesis. Light is no longer the limiting factor. This is also called the light saturation point.
* Light compensation point: rate of respiration = rate of photosynthesis, so while rate of photosynthesis is increasing, the net CO2 uptake or O2 release is zero * Photosynthesis is a process that is highly dependent on enzymes (thus a similar graph to enzyme activity against temperature)
* When temperature increases, kinetic energy increases which increases the frequency of effective collision between enzymes and substrates, increase the formation of enzyme substrate complex, thus increasing the rate of photosynthesis. Before optimum temperature is reached, temperature is the limiting factor until it rate of photosynthesis reaches its maximum.
* Rate of photosynthesis is at the maximum at optimum temperature
* When the temperature increases beyond the enzymes' optimum temperatures, the rate of photosynthesis begins to decrease until it stops as the enzymes are denatured. Temperature is no longer the limiting factor.

(k) Define the term transpiration and explain that transpiration is a consequence of gaseous exchange in plantsTranspiration is the **loss of water vapour** from the **stomata** of the leaves **through diffusion**

Transpiration is a consequence of gaseous exchange in plants for photosynthesis to occur

1. For photosynthesis to occur, the **stomata are open** for **carbon dioxide intake**.
2. Water continuously moves out of the mesophyll cells to form a **thin film of moisture**
3. **Water evaporates** from this thin film of moisture and **moves into the intercellular air **spaces**
4. This leads to the **loss of water vapour** from the intercellular air spaces in the leaves as the **air diffuse outside** that has a lower water vapour concentration via the stomata
5. As water evaporates from the mesophyll cells, the **water potential of the cell sap **decreases**, thus they **absorb water by osmosis from the xylem vessels**.
6. This results in **transpiration pull**, which is the main force that causes water to travel upwards in the xylem in the plants.

Transpiration pull is important as

- It **draws water and mineral salts from the roots** to the stems and leaves, which is needed for photosynthesis and to keep plants turigl

- **Cooling of the plants** as evaporation of water from the cells in the leaves removes latent heat of vaporisation.

(L) Explain the movement of water between plant cells, and between them and the environment in terms of water potential (calculations on water potential are not required)

(M) Outline the pathway by which water is transported into the roots and through the xylem vessels to the leaves by transpiration pull

Transpiration

Effects of variation of air movement, temperature, humidity and light intensity on transpiration rate

\begin{tabular}{|p{113.8pt}|p{113.8pt}|} \hline Variation of air movement & if wind is present, it removes the water vapor that accumulates outside the stomata due to transpiration. This leads to steep concentration gradient between intracellular air spaces and atmospheric air, thus increasing the rate of transpiration. \\ \hline Variation of temperature & Higher surrounding temperature increases the rate of evaporation of the thin film of moisture and also increases the movement of water molecules, thus increases the rate of transpiration \\ \hline Variation of humidity & Humidity refers to the concentration of water vapour present in the air. A lower humidity means a lower water vapour concentration, thus a steeper concentration gradient between the atmospheric air and intracellular air spaces. This increases the rate of water vapour diffusing out of the leaves thus the rate of transpiration \\ \hline Variation of light intensity & Higher light intensity leads to increased rate of photosynthesis in guard cells thus causes stomatal opening. When stomata is open, the rate of transpiration will increase \\ \hline \end{tabular}
