Solid (s) Liquid (f) Gaseous (g) Aqueous (aq) - exist as ions in a solution, water was added.

## 6 Balancing Equations

Check that the number of atoms for each element is equal on both sides of the equation (reactants & products).

To balance the chemical equation, you will need to add a **coefficient** in front of the compounds that are not balanced.

For example,

MgCl2(aq) + Na2CO3(aq) > MgCO3(s) + 2 NaCl (aq)

MgCO3(s) + 2 HCl(aq) > MgCl2(aq) + CO2(g) + H2O(l)

Fe2O3(s) + 3 CO (g) > 2 Fe (s) + 3 CO2(g)

## 6 Conclusion

An brute connection is a standard solution, which only changes from of the antenna components that occur in the channel location.

Any fault components that are in degrees of freedom are not in degrees of freedom.

**Step 1**

Write the balanced chemical equation for the reaction.

\[\text{G}\text{G}\text{G}_{1}\left(\text{aq}\right)+\text{G}\text{G}\text{G}_{2} \left(\text{aq}\right)\rightarrow\text{G}\text{G}\text{G}_{4}\left(\text{s} \right)+\text{G}\text{G}\text{G}_{2}\left(\text{aq}\right)\]

**Step 2**

**tonic compounds** that are in **aqueous state** should be written as **ions.**

\[\text{G}\text{G}^{2*}\left(\text{aq}\right)+2\text{G}\left(\text{aq}\right)+ \text{G}\text{G}^{2*}\left(\text{aq}\right)+\text{G}\text{G}_{2}\left(\text{aq} \right)+\text{G}\text{G}\text{G}_{4}\left(\text{s}\right)+\text{G}\text{G} _{2}\left(\text{aq}\right)\]

**Step 3**

Remove all the spectator ions.

\[\text{G}\text{G}\text{G}^{2*}\left(\text{aq}\right)+2\text{G}\text{G}\text{ }\text{G}^{2}\left(\text{aq}\right)+\text{G}\text{G}_{4}\left(\text{aq} \right)+\text{G}\text{G}_{2}\left(\text{aq}\right)+\text{G}\text{G}_{4}\left( \text{aq}\right)\]

**Step 4**

Obtain the final ionic equation.

\[\text{G}\text{G}\text{G}^{2*}\left(\text{aq}\right)+\text{G}\text{G}_{2} \left(\text{aq}\right)\rightarrow\text{G}\text{G}\text{G}\text{G}_{4}\left( \text{s}\right)\]

## 6 Conclusion

Concentration of a solution refers to the **amount of solute in a solution**.

There are two ways to measure concentration:

1) The mass (in grams) of solute in 1 dm\({}^{3}\) of a solution (**gdm\({}^{3}\)**).

2) The number of moles of solute in 1 dm\({}^{3}\) of solution (**moldm\({}^{3}\)**).

Example:

Calculate the mass of solute in 600 cm\({}^{3}\) of 0.4 molform\({}^{3}\) copper(ll) sulfate solution.

Volume of solution = 600 cm\({}^{3}\) = 0.60 dm\({}^{3}\)

**Number of moles of CuSO\({}_{4}\)**

= Concentration (molform\({}^{3}\)) * Volume of solution (dm\({}^{3}\))

= 0.4 \(\times\) 0.60

= 0.24 mol

**Mass of CuSO\({}_{4}\)**

= Number of moles (mol) * Molar mass (gmol\({}^{3}\))

= 0.24 \(\times\) [64 + 32 + 4(16)]

= 38.4 g

## Chapter 3 Implementing reactant

### 3.1 The reaction will stop when one reactant is fully used up

The reaction will stop when one reactant is fully used up, even if the other reactants are still available.

The **limiting reactant** is the reactant that is **completely used up** first. It **limits the amount of product** that can be formed.

The **excess reactant** is the reactant that would **still remain** in excess even when the limiting reactant has been completely reacted.

### 3.2 Example:

\[\text{Cu(NO}_{3}\text{)}_{2}(\text{eq})+2\text{ KCl(aq)}\times\text{CuCl}_{2}( \text{s})+2\text{ KNO}_{3}(\text{aq})\]

_Hypothetically, let's say there is 1 mole of Cu(NO)\({}_{2}\),& 5 moles of KCl._

3 There is only 1 mole of Cu(NO)\({}_{2}\), so even if there are 5 moles of KCl, only 2 moles of KCl will react.
