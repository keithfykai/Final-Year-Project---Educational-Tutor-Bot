## 1 Introduction

**Arenes** (also referred to as **aromatic hydrocarbons**) are hydrocarbons based on the **benzene ring** as **a structural unit**.

The term **'aromatic'** (fragment) was originally used because the first benzene-like compounds isolated have pleasant smells. However since the vapours are toxic, it is unwise to smell them.

The term **'aromatic'** has been retained to indicate certain chemical characteristics rather than odorous properties. An aromatic compound has **special stability**. For example, benzene is more stable than if it were to be formulated as a triene (_refer to Section 4.2_).

**Aromatic compounds** are benzene and those compounds possessing the ring structure of benzene or other molecular structures that resemble benzene in structure and chemical behaviour.

The chemistry of arenes will be exemplified by the reactions of **benzene** and **methylbenzene**.

## 2 Nomenclature of Benzene Derivatives

### Monosubstituted benzene derivatives

* For many of these derivatives, the name of the substituent group is added as a prefix to the word -_benzene_. Below are several examples.
* Other derivatives have special names which may show no resemblance to the name of the attached substituent group. Some examples are given below.

## 4 STRUCTURE OF BENZENE

Candidates should be able to explain, in terms of delocalisation of \(\pi\) electrons, the difference between benzene and alkene:

reactivity towards electrophiles

preference of benzene to undergo substitution rather than addition reaction

### Resonance Structure of Benzene

Each of the six carbon atoms in benzene is **sp\({}^{2}\)**hybridised. There are three **sp\({}^{2}\)**hybrid orbitals and one unhybridised **p** orbital for each carbon atom.

\begin{tabular}{|p{113.8pt}|p{113.8pt}|} \hline
**Three sp\({}^{2}\) hybrid orbitals** & **One unhybridised p orbital** \\ \hline \(\bullet\) Each C atom has **three sp\({}^{2}\) hybrid orbitals** that are arranged in a **trigonal planar** manner. & Each carbon atom also has an **unhybridised p orbital** occupied by a single electron. \\ \(\bullet\) Two sp\({}^{2}\) hybrid orbitals are used to overlap head-on with the sp\({}^{2}\) hybrid orbitals of two adjacent C atoms to form two C-C \(\sigma\) bonds. & Each singly-filled p orbital **overlaps sideways** (\(\pi\) bonding) with the adjacent p orbital on either side. \\ \(\bullet\) One sp\({}^{2}\) hybrid orbital is used to overlap head-on with the 1s orbital of the H atom to form the C-H \(\sigma\) bond. & This **continuous overlap of the p-orbitals** results in a **cloud of cyclic delocalised \(\pi\) electrons** above and below the plane of the ring, i.e. resonance is present in benzene. \\ \(\bullet\) The unique properties of benzene are a result of the resonance it possesses. & The unique properties of benzene are a result of the resonance it possesses. \\ \(\bullet\) & \(\bullet\) The unique properties of benzene are a result of the resonance it possesses. & The unique properties of benzene are a result of the resonance it possesses. \\ \(\bullet\) & \(\bullet\) The benzene are to have a **K**ekul\(\acute{e}\) structure (i.e. the cyclohexa-1,3,5-triene structure), there should be two kinds of carbon-carbon bonds in benzene: C-C bonds and C=C bonds. This is **not** the case. \\ \(\bullet\) & \(\bullet\) The **K**ekul\(\acute{e}\) benzene** & **K**ekul\(\acute{e}\)**, **K**ekul\(\acute* The Kekule structures, which contain localized \(\pi\) bonds, are not accurate representations of benzene.
* Instead, benzene has a structure in which the **six \(\pi\) electrons are delocalized**. It is the **delocalisation of the six \(\pi\) electrons** that confers **extra stability** on benzene and gives benzene its aromatic character.
* The extra stability of benzene is reflected by its **resonance energy** (or **delocalisation energy** or **stabilisation energy**), as shown in the diagram above.

**(c). Benzene undergoes substitution rather than addition reactions**

If benzene were cyclohexa-1,3,5-triene, it is expected to undergo addition reactions which are characteristic of the alkenes. However, under conditions that cause an alkene to undergo rapid addition, benzene either reacts not at all or very slowly.

If benzene undergoes addition reactions, its overallaromatic character (i.e. delocalisation of six \(\pi\) electrons) is destroyed, removing the extra stability associated with the delocalisation of the six \(\pi\) electrons.

Hence, the majority of reactions that benzene undergoes involve **substitution in the ring**, which takes place with **overall retention of aromatic character**, i.e. retaining the delocalization of the six \(\pi\) electrons in the continuously overlapping p-orbitals.

**SUMMARY**

The following properties are a result of the aromatic character of benzene:

All carbon-carbon bonds in benzene are equal and are intermediate in length between single and double bonds.

The enthalpy change of hydrogenation of benzene is less exothermic than expected.

Benzene undergoes substitution reactions rather than addition reactions.

**Representation of the Benzene ring**

The benzene is represented by a regular hexagon containing a circle. This representation is useful since it emphasizes the equivalence of the various carbon-carbon bonds.

* It is understood that a hydrogen atom is attached to each angle of the hexagon, i.e. each carbon atom, unless another atom or group is indicated.
* The straight lines represent the \(\sigma\) bonds joining the carbon atoms.
* The circle represents the cloud of six delocalised \(\pi\) electrons.

Electrophilic Substitution Reactions of Benzene

Candidates should be able to

understand mechanisms in terms of organic structure and bonding

recognise that the mechanisms of polar reactions involve the flow of electrons from electron-rich to electron-poor sites

describe the chemistry of the benzene ring (as exemplified by the following reactions of benzene and methylbenzene) as

involving electrophilic substitution reactions

describe the effect of the delocalisation of electrons in arenes in such reactions

The availability of six \(\pi\) electrons in benzene makes the benzene ring electron rich. The benzene ring thus serves as a source of electrons for electrophilic reagents.

The main reactions of benzene are characterised by electrophilic substitution in the benzene ring in which benzene reacts with an electrophile (E\({}^{*}\)) which replaces one or more hydrogen atoms in the ring.

Examples of electrophilic substitution reactions of benzene (and related aromatic compounds) are:

* Each electrophilic substitution reaction of benzene involves essentially the following steps:

* This step is the **slow step** i.e. the rate-determining step because it involves the destruction of the aromaticity of the benzene ring (i.e. it destroys the extra stability associated with the delocalisation of the six \(\pi\) electrons in the benzene ring).
* In this step, the electrophile attacks the electron-rich benzene ring and takes two electrons of the six-electron \(\pi\) system to form a \(\alpha\) bond to one carbon atom of the benzene ring.
* The aromatic character of the benzene ring is destroyed and a carbocation is formed. This carbocation is resonance-stabilised but not aromatic.

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|} \hline Loss of proton & **Step 2** \\ from the & \\ carbocation to & \\ form the product & \\ \hline \(\bullet\) & This step is a **fast step**. \\ \(\bullet\) & In this step, the carbocation intermediate loses a proton from the carbon atom that bears the electrophile. \\ \(\bullet\) & The two electrons that bonded this proton to carbon become a part of the delocalised \(\pi\)-electron system. \\ \(\bullet\) & The **aromatic character of the benzene ring is restored** and the substituted product is formed. \\ \hline \end{tabular}

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|l|l|} \hline Reaction & Reagent & Catalyst & Condition & Electrophile & Organic \\  & & & & & product \\ \hline Nitration & conc.

## 6 Reaction with Concentrated Nitric Acid

Candidates should be able to describe the chemistry of the benzene ring as exemplified by the following reactions of benzene and methylbenzene:

* nitration with concentrated nitric acid (recognise concentrated sulfuric acid as a Bronsted-Lowry acid catalyst)

### The overall equation

A nitrating mixture, containing **concentrated nitric(V) acid** and **concentrated sulfuric(VI) acid** carefully mixed together, is added to the benzene.

The mixture is then refluxed in a water bath maintained at **55-60 *C**. Keeping the temperature below 60 *C minimises the formation of a dinitrated product.

### The reaction mechanism: Electrophilic Substitution

#### 6.2.1 Bronsted-Lowry acid and base

In the nitration of benzene, the electrophile is generated from the reaction between a _Bronsted-Lowry acid_ and a _Bronsted-Lowry base_.

A Bronsted-Lowry acid is a _proto_ ( H*) _denary_.

A Bronsted-Lowry base is a _proto_ ( H*) _acceptor_.

#### 6.2.2 Reaction mechanism

The nitration of benzene involves the following stages:

* **Generation of the electrophile, NO2* (E*)** \[2\text{H}_{2}\text{SO}_{4}+\text{HNO}_{3}\rightleftharpoons\text{NO}_{2} {}^{*}+2\text{HSO}_{4}{}^{*}+\text{H}_{3}\text{O}{}^{*}\]

**Steps involved in generation of the electrophile NO2*:**

In the nitrating mixture, the HNO3 acid acts as a _Bronsted-Lowry base_ and accepts a proton from the _Bronsted-Lowry acid H3SO4_.

H3SO4+ HNO3=H3O3+H3O3-The reaction leads eventually to the formation of the **nitronium ion** (or nitryl ion).

H3NO3*=NO2*+H2O(2)H3SO4+H2O-H3SO4+H2O*(3)

Adding up (1) to (3) gives the overall equation for generation of electrophile

* **NO2*+H2SO4+H2O*+H2O** 2) A two-step electrophilic substitution reaction mechanism then follows:
* In this slow step, the NO\({}_{2}\)' ion acts as an electrophilic and attacks the electron-rich benzene ring.
* 2 of the 6 \(\pi\) electrons in the benzene ring are used to form the C-N bond. Hence the aromatic character of the ring is destroyed.
* \(\Rightarrow\) this is the slow step of the reaction mechanism
* A carbocation is formed. Note that the carbon atom bearing the -NO\({}_{2}\) group in the carbocation is sp\({}^{3}\) hybridised. The shape with respect to this carbon atom is tetrahedral. The rest of the carbon atoms on the benzene ring remain as sp\({}^{2}\) hybridised.
* Step 2: Loss of a proton from carbocation
* In this fast step, the unstable carbocation loses a proton to the HSO\({}_{4}\)-ion to form nitrobenzene, thus regaining the aromatic character.
* H\({}_{2}\)SO\({}_{4}\) (catalyst) is regenerated.
	* 6.3 Electrophilic Substitution of more than one nitro group During the nitration of benzene using the nitrating mixture, small quantities of white crystals of 1,3-dinitrobenzene (m.p. 90 \({}^{\circ}\)C) are almost invariably formed.
* 1,3-dinitrobenzene can also be prepared as shown below:
* Formation of 1,3,5-trinitrobenzene requires reacting benzene with fuming HNO\({}_{3}\) and conc. H\({}_{2}\)SO\({}_{4}\) for five days at 110 \({}^{\circ}\)C. Even under these conditions, the yield is only about 40 percent.

## 7 Reaction with Halogens

Candidates should be able to

describe the chemistry of the benzene ring as exemplified by the following reactions of benzene and methylbenzene: electrophilic substitution reactions with chlorine and with bromine (recognise the use of Lewis acid as catalysts)

describe the mechanism of electrophilic substitution in arenes, using the mono-bromination of benzene as an example

### Lewis acid and base

_bax and bax and bax but bax but bax and bax but bax and bax but bax and bax have bax and bax but bax and bax have bax and bax but bax and bax have bax and bax._

The halogenation of benzene requires the use of a _Lewis acid_ as a catalyst.

A Lewis acid is an _elabor - pair acceptor_

A Lewis base is an _elabor - pair donor_

### Halogenation: Generation of Electrophilic

Benzene does not react with chlorine or bromine in the dark.

**Note:**

The \(\pi\)-electron cloud in an alkene is easily broken when reacting with halogens. However, the same cannot be said for arenes.

The extra stability associated with the delocalization of the 6 \(\pi\)-electrons in benzene requires the use of a **stronger electrophilic** in order to disrupt the \(\pi\)-electron cloud.

In the presence of a suitable **Lewis acid catalyst** such as A/C/\({}_{3}\) or FeCl/\({}_{3}\), benzene undergoes electrophilic substitution reaction with chlorine at room temperature.

In a similar way, benzene reacts with bromine to form bromobenzene and hydrogen bromide in the presence of A/Br/\({}_{3}\) or FeBr/\({}_{3}\).

**Note:**

Analogous reactions with I\({}_{2}\) and F\({}_{2}\) are not synthetically useful because I\({}_{2}\) is too unreactive and F\({}_{2}\) reacts too violently.

## Appendix A ELECTPROPILIC SUBSTITION: FRIEDEL-CRAFTS ALKYLATION & ACYLATION

Candidates should be able to describe the chemistry of the benzene ring as exemplified by the following reactions of benzene and methylene.

\({}^{*}\) Friedel-Crafts alkylation with halogenalkanes (recognise the use of Lewis acid as catalysts)

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:15]

## 10 METHYLENZENE

Candidates should be able to

describe the chemistry of the alkyl side-chain of benzene ring as exemplified by the following reactions of methylbenzene:

free-radical substitution by chlorine and by bromine

complete oxidation to give benzoic acid

predict whether halogenation will occur in the side-chain or aromatic nucleus in arenes depending on reaction conditions

### Introduction

Methylbenzene (C\({}_{r}\)H\({}_{s}\)) is the simplest alkylbenzene. Its structural formula is shown below.

Like benzene, methylbenzene is a colourless liquid which is insoluble in water but soluble in organic solvents. It is itself a useful solvent.

It melts at -95 \({}^{\circ}\)C and boils at 111 \({}^{\circ}\)C.

When combusted, it burns with a sooty flame indicating that it has a relatively high C:H ratio.

Industrially, methylene is obtained both from coal and from petroleum in the same way as benzene.

### Reactions of methylbenzene and other alkylbenzenes

Methylbenzene has an **aromatic** portion (the benzene ring) and an **aliphatic** portion (the methyl group).

These two portions make different contributions to the chemical properties of methylbenzene and have a modifying effect on one another.

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:17]

#### Balancing equations using half equation method

For _stoichiometric calculations_, the following equations are required to derive the _stoichiometric ratios_ of the oxidising agent and reducing agent.

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|} \hline Oxidation & \\ half-equation: & \\ \hline Reduction & \\ half-equation: & \\ \hline Overall equation: & 5 \\ \hline \end{tabular}

#### Oxidation of longer alkyl chains

Ethytbenzene or any other benzene derivative with an alkyl side chain (however long) will produce the same product, **benzoic acid**.

The **rest of the alkyl side chain** is destroyed, usually forming **carbon dioxide and water**.

Example:

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|} \hline \hline \multicolumn{1}{|c|}{**Note:** Only a carboxylic acid group (i.

* The presence of the -CH3 group in methylbenzene affects both the reactivity and orientation of the electrophilic substitution reaction.

Using the nitration of methylbenzene as an example:

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|} \hline
**Effect on Reactivity** & **Effect on Orientation** \\ (i.e. the rate of the nitration reaction) & (i.e. the site of electrophilic attack) \\ \hline \end{tabular}

* A **lower temperature (30 \({}^{\circ}\)C)** is used for the nitration of methylbenzene (whereas nitration of benzene requires \(55-60\)\({}^{\circ}\)C).
* This shows that methylbenzene is more **reactive** than benzene towards **nitation**.
* In this case, the -CH3 group is said to be an **activating group**.
* This shows that substitution by the -NO2 group occurs **chieff at 2- and 4- positions** relative to the -CH3 group.
* As such the -CH3 group is described as **2.4-directing** (or ortho, para-directing).

_substitted shift and orthone ( site of electrophilic **stalk)_.

## 16 Effects of SUBSITITUENT GROUPS

Candidates should be able to apply the knowledge of positions of substitution in the electrophilic substitution reactions of monosubstituted arenes.

When an electrophilic reagent attacks an aromatic ring, it is the **group** already attached to the ring that determines

* **how** readily the attack occurs (i.e. the **reactivity** of the ring), and
* the **position** of substitution.

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:22]

* **Question: What makes a substituent on a benzene ring electron-donating or electron-withdrawing?**

Substituents on a benzene ring donate or withdraw electrons through **inductive** and **resonance** effects.

* **An inductive effect is the donation or withdrawal of electrons through \(\sigma\) bonds due to the electronegativity difference between atoms.**
* **A resonance effect is the donation or withdrawal of electrons through \(\pi\) bonds due to the electronegativity difference between atoms.**
* **A resonance effect is the donation or withdrawal of electrons through \(\pi\) bonds due to the continuous p-orbital overlap of the substituent and the benzene ring. This results in delocalisation of electrons, either towards or away from the benzene ring.**
* **Example: -CH3**
* **Akyf groups have a sp\({}^{3}\)carbon. Since sp\({}^{3}\) orbitals have less s-character, its electrons are less tightly held and more easily donated to the benzene ring.**
* **The substituent is said to be electron-donating by inductive effect.**
* **Example: -CH**
* **Akyf groups have a sp\({}^{3}\)carbon. Since sp\({}^{3}\) orbitals have less s-character, its electrons are less tightly held and more easily donated to the benzene ring.**
* **The substituent is said to be electron-donating by **inductive** effect.**
* **Example: -CH**
* **Ators such as O, N and C are more electronegative than C atom (on benzene ring). They pull electron density away from C through the \(\sigma\) bond.**
* **The substituent is said to be electron-withdrawing by **inductive** effect.**
* **Consider chlorobenzene and phenol where there is competition between electron-withdrawing inductive effect and the electron-donating resonance effect.**

* **The C/ atom is more electronegative than C.**
* **Hence the -CI group is electron-withdrawing by inductive effect.**

* **Note:**
* **In this case, the inductive effect is stronger than the resonance effect.**
* **This is because** CI **is in Period 3** \(\Rightarrow\) **its p-orbitals are more diffuse leading to a less effective side-on overlap with the p-orbitals of the benzene ring.**
* **Hence the overall effect of the -CI group in chlorobenzene is electron-withdrawing.**
* **The -CI group decreases the electron density in the benzene ring and makes the ring less susceptible to electrophilic attack. It is said to be a deactivating group.**

* **Laboratory preparation of Benzene (not in the syllabus but can be tested)** Owing to the abundance of benzene from industrial sources, it is rarely prepared in the laboratory, and the following reactions tend to be of academic interest only. (a) Decarboxylation of a sodium benzoate (b) Reduction of phenol Benzene undergoes addition reaction with hydrogen in the presence of nickel catalyst at considerably higher temperatures than for alkenes. The higher temperature is needed because extra energy must be supplied to break up the delocalised \(\pi\)-electron system. The catalyst, Raney nickel, is a form of nickel with an extremely high surface area for catalytic activity. The catalytic hydrogenation of benzene is important industrially in the manufacture of cyclohexane, from which nylon is made. Other catalyst that can be used: Pt or Pd
* **Reduction of methylbenzene** Methylbenzene reacts with hydrogen under the same conditions (i.e. catalyst + high temperature + high pressure) as benzene. Thus if a mixture of methylbenzene vapour and hydrogen is passed over finely divided nickel at 180 "C, methylcyclohexane is produced. (b) Other catalysts: Pt or Pd
* **Free radical addition of benzene**
