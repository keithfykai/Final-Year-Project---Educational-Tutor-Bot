### _Hooke's Law_

When we try to extend a spring by pulling it apart or compressing it with both hands, each of our hands will be subjected to an opposing force by the spring. We refer to this force as the tension or compression in the spring. For our purposes, we usually consider light springs of negligible mass. In 1676, Robert Hooke stated an empirical law that allows us to calculate the magnitude of this force.

Hooke's Law states that the **magnitude of force _F_**exerted by a spring* on a body attached to the spring is proportional to the **extension**\(x\) of the spring from its natural length provided the proportional limit of the spring is not exceeded.

\[F=k\mathbf{x}\]

\(k=\) constant of proportionality (also referred to as force constant or spring constant or stiffness of spring)

**Example 1 (N94/1/23)**

A spring, obeying Hooke's Law, has an unstretched length of 50 mm and a spring constant of 400 N m-1. What is the tension in the spring when its overall length is 70 mm?

* Note that, in general, all elastic materials obey Hooke's Law within their elastic limits. The law is not restricted to springs.

### _Upthrust or Buoyant Force_

#### 4.2.1 Pressure due to Fluid

If an object is immersed in a fluid, the fluid will press on the surface of the object. The normal force per unit area of the surface is referred to as the pressure due to the fluid. For a cylinder that is filled with water, the water pressure on the base of the cylinder will increase if more water is added and the water level rises. Similarly, if a small sheet of metal is dropped into the cylinder, the pressure on the surface of the metal sheet will increase as it sinks deeper.

Apart from water, we also experience atmospheric pressure due to the air above us. The atmospheric pressure we experience as we climb up a mountain will decrease as we ascend higher.

#### 4.2.2 Derivation of the equation \(p=pgh\)

Consider a column of fluid as shown in the diagram. This column of fluid is pressed inwards on all sides by the rest of the fluid in the beaker. Let

\(\rho\) (Greek letter _rho_) = density of the fluid,

\(A\) = surface area of the bottom of the column,

\(h\) = depth from the surface of the fluid,

\(V\) = volume of the fluid column,

\(m\) = mass of the fluid column.

The weight of the fluid is pressing down on the bottom surface \(A\). Since _pressure is force over area_, the pressure due to the weight of the fluid column is

\(p=\frac{mg}{A}\).

Recall that _density is mass divided by volume_, \(\rho=m/V\). Rearranging, we find that \(m=\rho\ V\), from which we get

\(p=\frac{\rho Vg}{A}\).

Note further that the volume of the fluid column is equal to the height of the column multiplied by the surface area, \(V=h\ A\). Thus, we find that \(V/A=h\), from which

\(p=\rho gh\).

Hence, the average pressure due to the weight of a fluid column is \(p=\rho gh\).

Note that we also have atmospheric pressure on top of the fluid column in the derivation above, pressing the fluid column down as it were. The total pressure at the surface area \(A\) is therefore equal to the atmospheric pressure added to the pressure due to the fluid:

\(p_{total}=p+p_{atm}\),

where \(p_{atm}\) is the atmospheric pressure at the surface of the fluid and \(p\) is the pressure at the bottom surface of the column due to the weight of the fluid alone.

Note that this expression for the pressure on the surface of the column is independent of the cross-sectional area of the column. Hence, if we consider a column where the cross-sectional area of the column approaches zero, we then obtain the same formula for the _pressure at a point_ in the fluid.

By considering an object that is very small, of negligible volume, we can say that the _pressure at a point in a fluid is the same in all directions_. A simple experiment can be conducted to illustrate this using a manometer. Since the height difference \(a\) remains the same as we change the direction that the opening of the tube is facing in the fluid, we can see that the pressure at the opening of the tube in the fluid is the same in all directions.

**Example 2**

The diagram on the right shows a mercury manometer connected to a gas container. The atmospheric pressure is 760 mm Hg and the point X is at the bottom of the U-tube.

a) What is the pressure of the point X in mm Hg?

b) What is the pressure of the gas in mm Hg?

c) If the manometer is disconnected from the gas container, what will be the vertical heights of the mercury levels from the point X in the left and right limbs of the manometer?

[Answers: 794 mm Hg; 776 mm Hg; 26 mm]

#### 4.2.3 Uphrust

For an object that is immersed in a fluid, the force that the fluid exerts on different parts of its surface differs according to the depth of immersion of that part of the surface. We will now consider the net force that acts on the object due to the fluid.

Uphrust \(U\) refers to the **net upward** force exerted **by a fluid** on a body **fully or partially** submerged in the fluid.

By considering the fluid forces acting on a cube fully immersed in a fluid as shown in the diagram, we can generalise the result to find the upthrust experienced by any body immersed in a fluid.

Let \(\rho\) = density of the fluid,

\(A\) = surface area of a face of the cube,

\(\Delta h\) = \(h_{1}\) - \(h_{2}\) = length of a side of the cube.

The fluid forces acting on the side faces of the cube are equal in magnitude and in opposite directions, thus resulting in **zero net horizontal force**.

The fluid force \(F_{1}\) acting on the **bottom** surface is \(F_{1}\) = \(\rho gh_{1}A\).

The fluid force \(F_{2}\) acting on the **top** surface is \(F_{2}\) = \(\rho gh_{2}A\).

Thus, the **net vertical force** is \(F_{1}\) - \(F_{2}\) = \(\rho gh_{1}A\) - \(\rho gh_{2}A\) = \((h_{1}-h_{2})\rho gA\) = \(\Delta h\rho gA\)

= \(\rho Vg\) (since the volume of the cube is _V = A A_H)

= (mass of fluid displaced) \(g\)

= weight of fluid displaced

_Reference: Why is upthrust always upwards (amphysics),_

**Archimedes' Principle**

For a body submerged or floating in a fluid, the upthrust acting on the body is equal in **magnitude and opposite in direction** to the **weight of fluid displaced by the body**.

\[U=\rho Vg,\]

where \(U\) = upthrust,

\(\rho\) = density of fluid,

\(V\) = volume of fluid displaced by the body,

\(g\) = gravitational acceleration.

In free-body diagrams, upthrust must be drawn from the centre of gravity of the fluid displaced.

**Example 3**

Icebergs are often a danger to ships since most of an ice-berg's volume lies beneath the surface of the water. One can only see the "tip of the iceberg." Find the percentage of the iceberg that is submerged.

(density of ice, \(\rho\) = 0.917 g cm\({}^{-3}\), density of sea-water, \(\rho_{w}\) = 1.025 g cm\({}^{-3}\))

### Translational Equilibrium

A large object can exhibit different kinds of motion. When we describe the object as rigid, different parts of the object cannot move relative to each other. However, the rigid object as a whole can still rotate about its centre of mass (rotational motion) while the centre of mass can have translational motion. Let us first consider the translational motion of the centre of mass of the object.

The object is said to be in translational equilibrium when it is stationary or moving at constant velocity. According to Newton's First Law, this happens when the net external force acting on the object is zero.

**Condition for Translational Equilibrium:**

The net external force acting on a body is zero, i.e. \(\Sigma F_{ext}=0\).

There are two common methods to determine whether an object is in equilibrium. The first method is resolving vectors and the second one is the use of a vector triangle.

In the first method, all the vectors acting on an object are resolved into horizontal and vertical components. If the sum of all the horizontal components and the sum of all the vertical components are zero, then the object is in translational equilibrium. For the horizontal and vertical component of a force \(F\), acting at an angle \(\theta\), we typically use the following equations to resolve the force vectors: \(F_{n}=F\cos\theta\), \(F_{v}=F\sin\theta\).

For the special case where three coplanar forces (i.e. forces acting on the same plane) are acting on an object and the object is in translational equilibrium, the forces can be represented in magnitude and direction by the adjacent sides of a triangle. In other words, three force vectors that form a triangle for which the directions of the forces are all either clockwise or anticlockwise around the centre of the triangle have **zero resultant**.

**Example 4 (Resolution of forces into component method)**

Four forces act on a particle such that it is in equilibrium. Three of the forces are shown in the diagram.

Find the magnitude and direction of the unknown force \(F\) that maintains the equilibrium.

[Answer: 2.73 N, at an angle of 67\({}^{\circ}\) anticlockwise from the force of 11.0 N]

### Moment of a Force

Besides translational motion, objects also exhibit rotational motion. Forces applied on a rigid body can also cause or change its rotational motion. The quantitative measure of the extent to which a force can cause or change the rotational motion of a rigid body is called the **moment of the force**, \(\tau\) (Greek letter _tau_). The **moment of a force** is also called the **torque**.

**Definition of Moment of a Force**

The **moment of a force \(\tau\)** about a point is the product of the (magnitude of the) force \(F\) and the perpendicular distance \(r_{\perp}\) from the line of action of the force to the point.

To illustrate the concept of perpendicular distance and line of action, let us consider the example of a spanner being used to loosen a bolt. A force \(F\) is applied at an acute angle \(\theta\) to the length of the spanner and at a distance \(r\) away from the point \(O\) as shown in the diagram below.

The line of action of a force is the line along which the force acts. The perpendicular distance \(d\) is the length of the line that joins the point \(O\) to the line of action perpendicularly. Using simple trigonometry, it can be deduced that \(d=r\sin\theta\). The torque of the force \(F\) about the point \(O\) can then be calculated as

\[\tau=(F)(r_{\perp})=(F)(r\sin\theta)=F\tau\sin\theta\,.\]

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:10]

### Static Equilibrium for Rigid Extended Bodies

Equilibrium is a concept to describe the state of a body that is either at rest or moving at a constant velocity. The conditions for equilibrium are the same, regardless whether the body is at rest or moving at a constant velocity. However, if the body is at rest, we say that the body is in _static_ equilibrium.

**Conditions for (Static) Equilibrium of a rigid extended body:**

**The net external force acting on the body is zero.** \(\Sigma F_{ext}=0\).

**The net moment on the body _about any point_ is zero.** \(\Sigma\tau=0\).

**Sloving Static Equilibrium problems**

1. **Isolate the body of interest.**

2. **Draw the free-body diagram and identify all forces acting on the body.**

3. **Set up the torque equation (condition for rotational equilibrium)**

**Choose a "good" reference point.**

**A "good" reference point is a point which lies on the lines of action of one or more of the unknown forces, thereby reducing the number of unknown terms in the equation.**

**Apply the condition** \(\Sigma\tau=0\)**,**

**sum of clockwise moments = sum of anti-clockwise moments.**

4. **Set up the two force equations (**\(x\) **and** \(y\) **components) (conditions for translational equilibrium)**

**Choose two perpendicular directions** \(x\) **and** \(y\)**.**

**Resolve all forces into** \(x\) **and** \(y\) **components.**

**Apply the condition** \(\Sigma F_{x}=0\)**,**

**sum of leftward forces = sum of rightward forces**

**Apply the condition** \(\Sigma F_{y}=0\)**,**

**sum of upward forces = sum of downward forces**

5. **Solve the equations to find the unknown forces.**

### Three-Force Systems

A solid body submitted to three forces whose lines of action are not parallel is in equilibrium, if the following three conditions apply:

1. The lines of action are coplanar (\(\Rightarrow\) all forces lie in one and the same plane)

2. The vector sum of the forces is equal to the zero vector (\(\Rightarrow\) they can form a closed vector triangle)

3. The lines of action are _convergent_ (\(\Rightarrow\) their lines of action cross through a single point).

_Reference: The 'Three forces must intersect at the same point' Rule, (xmphysics)_

_[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5bf80D0D2c_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5bf80D0D2c_)

A uniform beam balance of length \(L\) is hinged to a wall and is supported by a rope as shown. Show the direction of the force exerted by the hinge (attached to the wall) on the beam.

### Couple

**Definition of a Couple**

A pair of forces, which are equal in magnitude but opposite in direction, whose lines of action do not coincide.

Couples produce **only rotation** but no translation.

An example of a couple is shown in the figure below.

Taking moments about the centre of mass, the torque due to the couple \(=\)\(\left(\frac{1}{2}x\right)F+\left(\frac{1}{2}x\right)\)\(=\)\(xF\) (in the clockwise direction),

where \(F\) is the magnitude of the forces and \(x\) is the _perpendicular distance_ between the lines of action.

In fact, taking moments about **any point** would produce the same result.

**Torque of a couple** is the product of the perpendicular distance between the lines of action of the forces and the magnitude of one of the forces.

**Example 11**

The following diagrams show forces acting on uniform metre rules. The rulers are lying on a horizontal smooth table top and shown as seen from above.

Which of the diagrams do not show a couple?

For the other diagrams, what is the torque of the couple?

Assume that for each option, the two forces are parallel to each other.

## Appendix I Contact force and Frictional force

When two bodies are in contact such as a stone at rest on a road, the two rough surfaces actually make close contact only at relatively few places. Where contact is made, the road will exert a force on the stone as shown in Fig. (a). The vector sum of these forces is represented by the single force known as the contact force which the road exerts on the stone as shown in Fig. (b).

## Appendix II

### Viscous Force (air resistance and air drag)

A viscous force refers to the resistance force which a body experiences when it moves through a fluid (a gas or liquid). As the moving body exerts a force on the fluid to push it out of the way, the fluid would in turn exert an equal and opposite force on the body (by Newton's third law).

Two things to note on viscous forces:

1. The direction of the fluid resistance acting on a body is always opposite the direction of the body's velocity relative to the fluid.
2. Magnitude of the fluid resistance \(f\) increases with \(v\) the speed of the body through the fluid. 1. For small objects moving at very low speeds, the air resistance is proportional to \(v\), (_f_\(\propto\)_v_ ) 2. For larger objects (such as airplanes) moving at very fast speeds (through air), the fluid resistance also known as air drag is proportional to _v_\({}^{2}\), (_f_\(\propto\)_v_\({}^{2}\) )

refer to kinematics notes, section 2.6 Viscous Drag Force (pg 17-18) on other factors affecting the viscous force]

## Appendix III Buoyancy of a submarine

A submarine or a ship can float because the weight of the water it displaces is equal to the weight of the ship. This displacement of water creates an upward force called the buoyancy (upthrust). Unlike a ship, a submarine can control its weight, thus allowing it to sink and surface at will.

To control its weight, the submarine has ballast tanks and auxiliary, or trim tanks, that can be filled with water or air. A supply of compressed air is maintained aboard the submarine in air flasks for life support and for use with the ballast tanks.

When the submarine is on the surface, the ballast tanks are filled with air and the submarine's overall density is less than that of the surrounding water. As the submarine dives, the ballast tanks are flooded with water and the air in the ballast tanks is vented from the submarine until its overall density is greater than that of the surrounding water and the submarine begins to sink. To keep the submarine level at any set depth, the submarine maintains a balance of air and water in the trim tanks so that its overall density is equal to the surrounding water.
