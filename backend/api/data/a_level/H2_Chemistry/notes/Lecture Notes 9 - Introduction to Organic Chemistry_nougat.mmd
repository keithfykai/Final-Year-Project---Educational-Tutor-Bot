**Organic Chemistry and the Carbon Atom**

**1.1 Introduction**

**CARBON.**

**Electronic configuration: 1s^2s^2p^2**

Organic chemistry is the chemistry of the compounds of carbon and hydrogen (with the exception of CO, CO\({}_{2}\), CS\({}_{2}\) and various bicarbonates, carbonates, and cyanides which are considered to be inorganic). Many such compounds are found in living plants and animals, and that is the origin of the term "organic".

There are three important properties of carbon that enable it to form so many stable compounds.

Carbon has a fully shared octet of electrons in its compounds.

Carbon can form strong single, double and triple bonds with itself, or any other groups of atoms.

Each carbon can form 4 covalent bonds, and thus a chain of carbon atoms can have many different groups attached to it and this leads to a wide diversity of compounds.

Organic compounds are relatively stable due to the:

_carbon had only 2 growthm_

* lack of lone pairs of electrons in the skeletal chains; _ships_
* inability of carbon to expand its valence shell to accommodate more than 8 electrons;
* presence of strong C-C and C-H bonds.

**1.2 Oxidation number of C in compounds**

_Recall_

* Oxidation number of atoms in an element = 0.
* In a compound, the more electronegative atom is given a negative oxidation number
* Sum of all oxidation numbers in a molecule = 0

In candidates' answers, an acceptable response to a request for a structural formula will be to give the minimal detail, using conventional groups, for an unambiguous structure.

e.g. CH\({}_{3}\)CH\({}_{2}\)CH\({}_{2}\)OH for propan-1-o, not C\({}_{3}\)H\({}_{2}\)OH.

## 5 IUPAC Nomenclature for Organic Compounds

_(This will be covered in greater detail in future lectures on each functional group.)_

Learning outcome: Candidates should be able to:

interpert and use the nomenclature of the following classes of compound: alkanes, alkenes and arenes, halogenakanes and halogenarenes, alcohols and phenols, aldehydes and ketones, carboxylic acids, acyl chlorides and esters, amines, amides, aming acids and nitriles.

The most common way to name organic compounds is to use the systematic naming developed by IUPAC (International Union of Pure & Applied Chemistry).

P_w_n_t_b_t_c_s_in

Every name consists of a root, a suffix and one or more prefixes.

In an **alicyclic** system, the word **cyclo** is added to the front of the root corresponding to the same number of C atoms.

e.g. cyclopentane cyclohexene

\begin{tabular}{|p{113.8pt}|p{113.8pt}|p{113.8pt}|p{113.8pt}|} \hline
**Formula of Functional Group** & **Functional Group** & **Suffix** & **Example** \\ \hline  & carboxylic acid & \(-\)oic acid & CH\({}_{3}\)COOH ethanoic acid \\ \hline  & ester & alkyl\(\dots\)oate & CH\({}_{3}\)COOCH\({}_{2}\)CH\({}_{3}\) ethyl ethanoate \\ \hline  & acid halide & \(-\)oyl halide ethanoyll chloride \\ \hline  & amide & \(-\)amide eth3 CH\({}_{2}\)CH\({}_{2}\)CONH\({}_{2}\) butanamide \\ \hline  & \(-\)C=N & nitrile & \(-\)nitrile CH\({}_{3}\)CH\({}_{2}\)CN propanentirile \\ \hline  & aldehyde & \(-\)al eth3CHO ethanal \\ \hline  & ketone & \(-\)one eth3 CH\({}_{2}\)CO CH\({}_{3}\) butanone \\ \hline  & \(-\)OH & alcohol & \(-\)ol CH\({}_{3}\)CH\({}_{2}\)CH\({}_{2}\)OH propanol \\ \hline  & \(-\)NH\({}_{2}\) & amine & \(-\)amine eth3 CH\({}_{2}\)CH\({}_{2}\)NH\({}_{2}\) propanamine \\ \hline \end{tabular}

When there is more than one functional group in the compound, the **functional group placed higher in the table** is listed as a **suffix** with everything else being a prefix, e.g.:

\begin{tabular}{|p{113.8pt}|p{113.8pt}|p{113.8pt}|} \hline
**Compound** & **Name** & **Remarks** \\ \hline  & \(3\)-aminobutanal & \(-\)CHO is found higher in the table than \(-\)NH\({}_{2}\) so the suffix is \(-\)al and \(-\)NH\({}_{2}\) is named as the prefix ‘amino’ \\ \hline  & \(4\)-oxobutanoic acid & \(-\)COOH is found higher in the table than \(-\)CHO so the suffix is \(-\)oic acid and \(-\)CHO is named as the prefix ‘oxo’ \\ \hline \end{tabular}

\begin{tabular}{c c c c c} \multicolumn{5}{c}{**Steps to take in naming compounds**} \\ \multicolumn{5}{c}{_e.g._} \\ \multicolumn{5}{c}{_Compound A_} \\ \multicolumn{5}{c}{_Comp

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:15]

### Mechanisms

* Organic reactions involve breaking and forming covalent bonds.
* Every reaction involves the flow of electron density from electron-rich to electron-poor sites. Electrons move to break bonds and form new bonds.
* **Mechanisms** illustrate how the electrons move during a reaction.
* Curved arrows are used to show the actual movement of electrons.
* Tail: shows **where the electrons are coming from (bond pair or lone pair)**
* **Head**: shows **where the electrons are going**.
* **Mechanisms are proposed to be consistent with the reaction stoichiometry, the rate equation and with all other available experimental data.

### Types of Bond Fission (Bond cleavage)

There are 2 ways in which a covalent bond can break.

* **Hondytic Fission**
* The breaking of a covalent bond such that one electron goes to each of the atoms, forming **free radicals**.
* The breaking of a covalent bond such that both the electrons go to the same atom, forming **positive and negative ions**.
* There are 2 ways how this can occur:
* Both electrons go to the leaving group. This occurs when carbon is **less electronegative** than \(X\). The positively charged carbon ion formed is called **carbonation**.
* Both electrons go to carbon. This occurs when carbon is **more electronegative** than \(X\). The negatively charged carbon ion formed is called **carbonation**.

### Degree of substitution

The degree of substitution of an atom in an organic compound is determined by the number of alkyl or aryl groups bonded to it.

Organic compounds with different degrees of substitution may undergo different reactions.

## 6 Terminology Associated with Organic Reactivities

Learning outcome: Candidates should be able to interpret, and use the following terminology associated with organic reactivities: delocalisation, electronic effect (electron-donating and electron withdrawing effect) and steric effect (steric hindrance).

### 6.1 Delocalisation (Mumme \(\neq\)hybrid(phonon))

* Just as two p orbitals can overlap sideways to form a \(\pi\) bond, two or more \(\pi\) bonds can overlap with each other to produce a more extensive \(\pi\) bond.
* For example, benzene, C\({}_{6}\)H\({}_{6}\), is a planar, six-membered ring of sp\({}^{2}\)-hybridised carbon atoms. The unhybridised p orbitals of the carbon atoms could overlap as shown to produce three C=C bonds between atoms 1 and 2, 3 and 4, and 5 and 6 of the ring. Overlap to produce double bonds between atoms 2 and 3, 4 and 5, and 6 and 1 of the ring are just as likely to occur.
* Thus, all six p orbitals overlap with one another to produce a set of six **delocalised \(\pi\) electrons**:

* These six electrons are said to participate in **resonance**. All six C-C bonds have the **same bond energy** and **same length**.

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|} \hline Bond & Bond energy / kJ mol\({}^{-1}\) & Bond length / nm \\ \hline C - C & 350 & 0.154 \\ \hline C = C & 610 & 0.134 \\ \hline C - C & & \\ (benzene) & 520 & 0.139 \\ \hline \end{tabular}

### Electronic Effect

* An atom or a group of atoms is said to be an **electron-withdrawing**substituent if it **decreases the electron density** in the compound. It is said to be an **electron-donating**substituent if it **increases the electron density** in the compound. **pc-**
* Such electronic effect is either due to the:
* donation or withdrawal of electrons through \(\sigma\)**bonds** due to the **electronegativity difference** between atoms;
* delocalisation of lone pair of electrons on the atom adjacent to the benzene ring into the \(\pi\)**electron cloud** of benzene;
* delocalisation of \(\pi\)**electron cloud** of benzene onto the substituent.
* Some examples of such substituents in benzene are shown:

### Steric Effect (Steric Hindrance) \(\psi\) over **neutron** reaction
* **Steric hindrance** occurs when the **presence of a substituent** hinders the approach of an attacking reactant and either **prevents** a reaction from taking place or **lowers the reactivity** of a particular site within a molecule.

For example, CH3Cl and (CH3)3Cl undergo different mechanisms when reacting with OH-

The three methyl groups in (CH3)3CC/ hinder the approach of a nucleophile towards the electron deficient carbon. Steric hindrance causes the reaction to proceed by a different mechanism.

## 7 Isomerism in Organic Compounds

Learning outcome: Candidates should be able to:

describe constitutional (structural) isomerism

deduce the possible isomers for an organic molecule of known molecular formula

Isomerism refers to the existence of two or more compounds with the same molecular formula but different arrangement of the atoms in their molecules. These compounds are known as isomers.

Constitutional (Structural) isomers have the same molecular formula but different structural formula i.e. different arrangement of atoms.

Three main types of constitutional isomers:

Isomers
Examples

(1) Chain isomers

differ in the arrangement of carbon atoms in the chain. Carbon atoms may be arranged in straight chain or branched chain.

Same functional groups, thus similar chemical properties but different physical properties.

(2) Positional isomers

same homologous series with the functional group located at different positions on the same carbon skeleton

(3) Functional Group Isomers

See examples on next page.

different functional groups.

thus different chemical and physical properties.

### Stereoisomerism

Learning outcome: Candidates should be able to:

 describe _cis-trans_ isomerism in alkenes, and explain its origin in terms of restricted rotation due to the presence of \(\pi\) bonds

 explain what is meant by a chiral centre

 deduce whether a given molecule is chiral based on the presence or absence of chiral centres and / or a plane of symmetry

 recognise that an optically active sample rotates plane-polarised light and contains chiral molecules recognise that enantiomers have identical physical properties except in the direction in which they rotate plane-polarised light

 recognise that enantiomers have identical chemical properties except in their interaction with another chiral molecule

 recognise that different stereoisomers exhibit different biological properties, for example in drug action

 identify chiral centres and/ or _cis-trans_ isomerism in a molecule of a given structural formula

### Examples of the importance of enantiomerism in biological systems

The small difference in the arrangement of atoms between the (+) and the (-)-isomers may seem unimportant to you but to the cells of a living organism the difference is critical. Cells can recognise the difference and often can use only one of the enantiomer.

E.g.

* (+)-lactic acid is found in living muscle and (-)-lactic acid, in sour milk.
* The proteins in our bodies are built up from only one enantiomer of each amino acid. These are the (-)-enantiomers.
* Enantiomers can interact differently with the chiral taste buds on your tongue. (+)-amino acids all taste sweet; (-)-amino acids are often tasteless or bitter.
* Enantiomers can smell different. E.g. one enantiomer of limonene smells of oranges, the other of lemons.
* Yeast can ferment (+)-glucose to produce alcohol but not (-)-glucose.

Different stereoisomers have different biological properties, e.g. in drug action. Very often, only one enantiomer of the drug works as a medicine, while the other form is useless or less effective or may even cause serious side effect.

E.g.

* (+)-thaldomide has sedative properties while (-)-thaldomide is a potent mutagen (it causes gene mutation which leads to deformed offspring).
* One enantiomer of ethambutol fights tuberculosis, the other causes blindness.
* Penicillin works by breaking peptide links which involve (+)-alanine. These occur in the cell walls of bacteria but not in humans. When its cell wall is broken, the bacteria is killed. So penicillin is very effective in killing bacteria but cannot have the same effect on us because we do not use (+)-alanine.
* (-)-ibuprofen is potent as a painkiller while (+)-ibuprofen is ineffective (and also harmless).
* (-)-dopa is widely used for its potent activity against Parkinson's disease while (+)-dopa has no biological effect.

Hence, research is carried out to synthesise 'chiral drugs' which contains only one enantiomeric form- both for efficiency and for protection against possible side effects of its mirror image form.

**Thalidomide disaster: Why stereochemical considerations are so important in drug design**

Thalidomide first appeared in Germany on 1st October 1957. It was marketed as a sedative with apparently remarkably few side effects. The Drug Company who developed it believed it was so safe it was suitable for prescribing to pregnant women to help combat morning sickness.

It was quickly being prescribed to thousands of women and spread to most corners of the globe. Nobody had any idea of what was to follow. Drug testing procedures were far more relaxed at that time, and although tests had taken place on thalidomide, they didn't reveal any of its tetragenic (roughly meaning causing malformations) properties. In most countries, drug companies were not required to submit testing results to the appropriate government agencies. The tests on thalidomide were conducted on rodents which metabolise the drug in a different way to humans. Later tests on rabbits and monkeys produced the same horrific side effects as in humans.

Towards the end of the fifties, children began to be born with shocking disabilities. It was not immediately obvious what the cause of this was. Probably the most renowned is _Pharcomelia_, the name given to the flipper-like limbs which appeared on the children of women who took thalidomide. Babies affected by this tragedy were given the name _Thalidomide Babies'_.

Pictured right are some of babies born with the flipper-like limbs. Remarkably, many of the children involved have gone on to lead successful and fulfilling lives.

Thalidomide has just one chiral atom and so exists as two enantiomers. The diagram to the right shows the molecule without hydrogens. Notice that two of the groups attached to the chiral centre are part of the same ring structure. They are classified as two different groups since moving around from the chiral centre, the order of atoms is different each way. It is said the chiral atom has two different views around the ring.

**The Reality of Enantiomerism in Thalidomide**

Laboratory tests after the thalidomide disaster showed that in some animals the 'S' enantiomer was tetragenic but the 'R' isomer was an effective sedative. It is now known that even when a stereoselective sample of thalidomide (only one of the enantiomers) is administered at the pH in the body, it can cause racemising. Both enantiomers are formed in a roughly equal mix in the blood. So, even if a drug of only the 'R' isomer had been created and administered, the disaster would not have been averted.
