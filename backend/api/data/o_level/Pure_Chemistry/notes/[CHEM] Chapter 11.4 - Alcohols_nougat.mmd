## PHYSICAL PROPERTIES

**Abstract**

**The number of carbon atoms in the alcohols increases, the melting and boiling points of alcohols increases as well.**

**As the number of carbon atoms in an alcohol increases, the size of the molecules are bigger and have stronger intermolecular forces of attraction between each other. As such, more heat energy is needed to overcome the intermolecular forces of attraction between the alcohol molecules. Hence, larger alcohol containing more carbon atoms will have higher melting and boiling points.**

**As the number of carbon atoms in the alcohol increases, the volatility of alcohol decreases. (similar to m.p. & b.p.)**

**Volatility**

**With a higher relative molecular mass, there would be stronger intermolecular forces of attraction between the alcohol molecules. As such, more energy is needed to overcome the intermolecular forces of attraction between the alcohol molecules.**

**Hence, larger alcohol molecules are less likely to evaporate in room temperature.**

**Density**

**As the number of carbon atoms in the alcohols increases, the density of alcohols increases.**

**Viscosity**

**Alcohols with longer hydrocarbon chains flow less easily as they tend to get stuck together.**

**As the number of carbon atoms in the alcohols increases, the flammability of alcohols decreases. (more difficult to burn)**

**Solubility**

**Acohols are soluble in water, but as the number of carbon atoms increases, solubility in water decreases.**

## Chapter 11 Conclusion

In the presence of excess oxygen, an alcohol would undergo **complete combustion**, producing carbon dioxide and water.

If there is insufficient oxygen present for complete combustion, the alkene undergoes **incomplete combustion** to produce water and carbon monoxide instead.

Soot (carbon) could also be produced as a by-product during incomplete combustion.

## 12 Validation

Alcohols will be oxidised to form carboxylic acids in the presence of a strong oxidizing agent.

### Oxidising agents:

**KMnO\({}_{4}\)**(purple to colourless)

**K\({}_{2}\)Cr\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{3}\)**(orange to green)

For example, ethanol can be oxidised to ethanolic acid:* 46. Which statements about ethanol are correct? Ethanol can be used: (N2019/P1/Q37)

1 as the source of energy in car engines

2 to dissolve the active ingredients in perfumes

3 to manufacture polyesters. A 1 only **B** 1 and 2

C 2 only **D** 2 and 3 ( )

Answer:

* 46. **B** Ethanol can be used as a source of energy in cars and as a solvent. In the manufacture of polyesters, it is a diol that is used.

* 48. Which alcohol and acid can be reacted together to make the ester CH\({}_{3}\)CH\({}_{3}\)CH\({}_{3}\)CO\({}_{3}\)CH\({}_{3}\)? (N2019/P1/Q39)
* 4. C\({}_{4}\)H\({}_{3}\)OH and HCO\({}_{3}\)H
* 4. C\({}_{4}\)H\({}_{3}\)OH and CH\({}_{3}\)CO\({}_{3}\)H
* 4. C\({}_{4}\)H\({}_{3}\)OH and C\({}_{4}\)H\({}_{3}\)CO\({}_{3}\)H
* 4. D CH\({}_{3}\)OH and C\({}_{4}\)H\({}_{3}\)CO\({}_{3}\)H
