## 1 Introduction

Electrochemistry, is the study of the inter-conversion of chemical and electrical energy. This interconversion occurs in cells in which **redox reactions** either generate or consume electrical energy.

There are **two** types of cells.

In general, when a chemical species loses electrons we say that it is **oxidised (increase in oxidation number)**, and when a chemical species **gains electrons** we say that it is **reduced (decrease in oxidation number)**.

**Aredox reaction** is an electron transfer process: electrons are transferred from one species (the one being oxidised) to another species (the one being reduced). Consider the following experiment, where a strip of copper was placed in a solution of silver nitrate. The following images were taken of the beaker at different timings.

**a)**: Describe what is observed when a piece of copper metal is placed in a solution of silver nitrate.
**b)**: Explain, in terms of changes in oxidation numbers of the reactants, the reactions that have occurred.
**c)**: Write relevant half-equations to describe the reactions undergone by Cu and Ag.
**d)**: Hence, construct the overall redox equation for the reaction taking place in the beaker.
**e)**: What would you expect to observe if you place a piece of Ag metal in a solution of Cu\({}^{2+}\) instead?

## 2 The ELECTROCHICAL CELI

In the previous set-up, Cu(s) and Ag(aq) are in direct physical contact, such that the electrons are transferred **directly** from Cu to Ag\({}^{*}\). The energy released from the reaction is given off as heat, and no usable energy is harnessed from this spontaneous redox reaction. We can capture this energy in the form of electrical energy by setting up an **electrochemical cell** (galvanic cell or voltaic cell) to separate the two half-reactions. The electrochemical cell typically consists of two half-cells, Each half-cell consists of an electrode and its electrolyte, where either-reduction or oxidation occurs. The diagram below shows an example of a Cu-Ag electrochemical cell:

\(\bullet\)\(\bulletThe overall reaction occurring in the electrochemical cell is the same as when Cu(s) and Ag(aq) were mixed together in a beaker (refer to diagram in page 45):

However, by separating the two half-reactions into two different half-cells, _the electrons must travel through the wire and the energy can be harnessed_, e.g. to power a light bulb.

### Does the voltage last infinitely?

When we first set up this electrochemical cell and connect the external circuit only to a voltmeter, a voltage could be measured. Assuming a high-resistance voltmeter is used, very little current (i.e. electrons) flows through the circuit and this voltage remains relatively constant.

However, if the electrochemical cell is connected to e.g. a lamp to harness its electrical energy, and current (i.e. electrons) is allowed to flow through the circuit, after some time, the Cu strip in the Cu2+ / Cu half-cell will decrease in mass due to loss of Cu into the solution as Cu2+ ions. The intensity of blue colour of the Cu2+ solution will increase. In the Ag+ / Ag half-cell, the Ag strip will increase in mass due to Ag deposit formed. As the overall cell reaction proceeds, the system will approach equilibrium and the voltage of the electrochemical cell would eventually decrease to zero.

This is how an electrochemical cell can work as a **battery**, which converts chemical energy to electrical energy. The reactants in batteries are at non-equilibrium concentrations. As you use the battery, the reactants form products and the system approaches equilibrium. The voltage drops until the battery is no longer usable.

A commonly used reference electrode is the standard hydrogen electrode, whose electrode potential is assigned to be **0.00 V**.

The standard hydrogen electrode comprises:

A platinum wire and a piece of platinum foil covered with finely divided platinum (platinised platinum) that serves as an inert surface for redox reaction to take place.

A solution of 1 mol dm-H(aq) ions, in which the platinum electrode, encased in a glass tube, is immersed.

Hydrogen gas at a pressure of 1 bar and 25 \({}^{o}\)C bubbling over the electrode.

Diagram of a Standard Hydrogen Electrode

On the surface of the platinum, equilibrium is established between hydrogen gas and hydrogen ions.

A potential develops on the surface of the platinum and it is assigned a value of 0.00 V by international agreement.

### 6.4 Standard Cell Potential and Gibbs' Free Energy

(_LO12(i): state and apply the relationship_, \(\Delta G=-n\)FE to electrochemical cells, including the calculation of \(E\) for combined half reactions

Electrochemical cells generate electricity by making use of a spontaneous redox reaction that takes place within the cell. The Gibbs' free energy change is converted into electrical energy. The following equation shows the relationship between Gibbs' free energy change and the cell potential:

\[\Delta G^{0}=-n\)FE\({}^{0}_{\text{cell}}\]

where: \(\Delta G^{0}\) is the standard Gibbs free energy change in joules per mole, \(n\) is the number of moles of electrons transferred per mole of the cell reaction, and \(F\) is the Faraday's constant (96500 C mol\({}^{-1}\)).

A spontaneous redox reaction (\(\Delta G<0\)) would mean that \(E_{\text{cell}}>0\).

Consider the following three redox equations where their values are taken from the _Data Booklet_.

### 7.3 Rusting (Application Example)

Paint protects iron and steel from corrosion as it prevents them from contacting directly with air. However, in many instances, part of the paint could be removed due to various reasons and it led to the bare metal being exposed. This result in the metal directly below the paint to rust as illustrated in the diagram below.

The relevant equations involved in the cathodic and anodic sites are shown below: \(\mathrm{T\,T\,T\,U\,T}\)

\(\mathrm{C_{2}+4H^{+}+4e^{-}}\)\(\mathrm{E^{0}+1.23\,V}\)

\(\mathrm{Fe^{2+}+2e^{-}}\)\(\mathrm{Fe}\)\(\mathrm{Fe}\)\(\mathrm{E^{0}=-0.44\,V}\)

The resultant \(\mathrm{Fe}\) is greater than 0 V, indicating a spontaneous reaction. The \(\mathrm{Fe^{2+}}\) produced will be further oxidised by oxygen to produce \(\mathrm{Fe_{2}O_{3}}\), a form of rust.

## 9 Electrophysics of pure molten salts

_1012(m)port: predict the identity of the substance liberated during electrolysis from the state of electrolyte (molten)_

In the electrolysis of molten salts, the electrolyte is the molten salt itself, and the ions move through the cell because they are attracted by the oppositely charged electrodes. If the molten salt is pure (i.e. no other substances present), then _the cation will be reduced_ at the cathode, and _the anion will be oxidised_ at the anode.

## 10 Electronics of Aqueous Solutions

_L012(m)port; predict the identity of the substance liberated during electrolysis from the state of electrolyte (mnten or aqueous), position in the redox series (electrode potential) and concentration_

An aqueous electrolyte may contain several cations/anions which can undergo reduction/oxidation at the cathode/anode respectively in an electrolytic cell.

In addition, water molecules can also be reduced or oxidised:

reduction of water, 2H\({}_{2}\)O(\(I\)) + 2e\({}^{-}\) \(\rightarrow\) H\({}_{2}\)(g) + 2OH\({}^{-}\)(aq) oxidation of water, 2H\({}_{2}\)O(\(I\)) \(\rightarrow\) O\({}_{2}\)(g) + 4H\({}^{-}\)(aq) + 4e\({}^{-}\)

At O-level, it is usually conveyed that the electrolysis of water involves the discharge of H\({}^{+}\) and OH\({}^{-}\) ions at the cathode and anode respectively. However, the concentrations of the two ions in pure water are very low (10\({}^{-7}\) mol dm\({}^{-3}\) each at 25 \({}^{\circ}\)C). Hence, at A-level, it is the water molecules that are discharged at the electrodes. H\({}^{+}\) and OH\({}^{-}\) ions are discharged only when the electrolyte contains aqueous acid or alkali respectively.

The ion or substance that is discharged at each electrode during electrolysis of an aqueous electrolyte is the one that requires the least energy, This is called selective discharge.

The factors affecting selective discharge are:

* position of the ion or substance in the electrochemical series or redox series, i.e., \(\epsilon^{0}\) values
* concentration of the ion (which affects the electrode potential)
* nature of the electrode

### Position of ion in the electrochemical series, i.e., \(F^{0}\) values

Recall that \(F^{0}\) values indicate the relative tendency for a species to undergo oxidation or reduction. The more positive the \(F^{0}\) value, the more favourable the forward reduction half-reaction. The more negative the \(F^{0}\) value, the more favourable the backward oxidation half-reaction. In this section we shall see how \(F^{0}\) values can be used to predict the products formed at the electrodes in an electrolysis.

The set-up below shows the electrolysis of aqueous copper(II) bromide using platinum electrodes. What are the products formed at each electrode?

The cation Cu\({}^{2+}\) is present in this aq, electrolyte. It moves to the cathode & may get reduced there. For aq, electrolyte, the possibility of reduction of H\({}_{2}\)O at the cathode is considered as well.

Search the \(F^{0}\) list to identify separate half-eqs. where Cu\({}^{2+}\) & H\({}_{2}\)O are reduced.

The anion Br\({}^{-}\) is present in this aq, electrolyte. It moves to the anode & may get oxidised there. For aq, electrolyte, the possibility of oxidation of H\({}_{2}\)O at the anode is considered as well.

Search the \(F^{0}\) list to identify separate half-eqs. where Br & H\({}_{2}\)O are oxidised.

Compare the \(F^{0}\) values to decide whether Br & H\({}_{2}\)O is preferentially oxidised at the anode.

Let's use single direction arrow (\(\rightarrow\)) for the electrode reactions. The non-spontaneous reaction is driven to occur by electricity.

Figure 10.1: The electrolysis of aqueous sodium sulfate containing litmus indicator was carried out in the apparatus illustrated. Inert electrodes were used. After some time, the volumes of gas liberated were as shown in the diagram. The litmus in both electrode compartments had changed colour.

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:37]

### Summary: predicting products of electrolysis of aq, electrolytes

1. In general, work from first principles: List out the relevant \(E^{0}\) data and compare the \(F^{0}\) values. Hence decide which substance is preferentially reduced at the cathode, which is preferentially oxidised at the anode.
2. For aqueous electrolytes, the product at the cathode may be * H2(g) from reduction of H2O(l) or if an acid is electrved, H2(g) from reduction of H^(aq), or * a less reactive metal e.g. Cu and Ag from the reduction of Cu2+ and Ag+ respectively.
3. Cations of reactive metals e.g. K, Ba2+, Ca2+ and Na+ are never reduced; H2O(l) is always reduced preferentially since \(E^{0}\)(H2O/H2) is more positive than \(E^{0}\)(metal cation/metal) for these reactive metals.
4. For aqueous electrolytes, the product at the anode may be * O2(g) from oxidation of H2O(l) or if an alkali is electrved, O2(g) from oxidation of OH(aq) or another non-metal e.g. Br2(aq) from oxidation of Br(aq), Cl2(g) from oxidation of Cl2 in concentrated NaCl solution.
5. NO3- and SO4-2 are usually not oxidised, even at high concentrations.
6. Platinum and graphite are inert electrodes. There are electrodes which can undergo oxidation themselves if they are used as the anode e.g. Cu.
7. If O2(g) is produced at a graphite anode, CO(g) and CO(g) may be formed from a reaction between carbon and O2, especially at high temperatures.

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:39]

Faraday's law of electrolysis: The number of moles of a substance that undergoes oxidation or reduction at each electrode during electrolysis is directly proportional to the quantity of charge that passes through the cell.

#### Points to note:

* The values of \(F\), \(L\) and \(e\) are given at page 1 of the _Data Booklet_.
* The formula, \(F=Le\), is used only if the question involves determination of the value of \(L\) or \(e\).
* It can be shown that the _mass or volume of a substance liberated_ during electrolysis depends only on

(1) \(Q\) (which depends on \(J\) and \(t\)), and

(2) _charge on the ion or no. of moles of electrons needed to liberate one-mol of that product._

This is in fact, Faraday's law of electrolysis. Therefore, as long as the current and time taken for electrolysis are unchanged, any changes in the concentration of the electrolyte does not affect the amount of product formed at each electrode.

### 12.1 Electrolytic purification of copper

_L012(0)(ii): explain, in terms of the electrode reactions, the industrial process of: (ii) the electrolytic purification of copper_

Copper is a good conductor of electricity, and is used extensively to make electrical wiring and components. The extraction of copper from copper ore is done by reduction with carbon. However, the copper produced is not pure enough for use as a conductor, so it is purified using electrolysis.

Electricity is then passed through the cell. The voltage used is such that copper at the anode will be oxidised into Cu\({}^{2+}\) ions which go into the electrolyte.

At the anode:

\(\mathrm{Cu(s)}\)\(\mathrm{Cu^{2+}(aq)}\) + 2e\({}^{-}\)

Metal impurities that have \(E^{0}\) values _less positive_ than \(E^{0}\)(Cu\({}^{2+}\)/Cu) will also be _oxidised_ at the anode since they are more readily oxidised than copper. Hence these metal impurities will _enter the electrolyte as the metal ions_.

Metal impurities that have \(E^{0}\) values _more positive_ than \(E^{0}\)(Cu\({}^{2+}\)/Cu) will _not be oxidised_ at the anode. These metals will stay as solid metal and eventually drop off as _anode sludge_.

At the cathode:

\(\mathrm{Cu^{2+}(aq)}\) + 2e\({}^{-}\)\(\mathrm{Cu(s)}\)

The Cu\({}^{2+}\) ions in the electrolyte are reduced at the cathode to form copper. Hence more pure copper deposits onto the pure copper cathode:

* The metal ions that came from the metal impurities which dissolved at the anode will not be reduced at the cathode since their \(E^{0}\) values are _less positive_ than \(E^{0}\)(Cu\({}^{2+}\)/Cu), meaning these ions are less easily reduced than Cu\({}^{2+}\) ions. Hence they will remain in the electrolyte.

The overall effect of this process is a net transfer of copper from the impure copper anode to the cathode. The anode decreases in mass and the cathode increases in mass. Also important to note is that, metal impurities that are above copper in the electrochemical series (e.g. Zn, Fe) will remain in the electrolyte as ions while those below copper in the series (e.g. Ag, Au) will form the anode sludge.

### 2.2 Anodising of \(Al\)

_1012(0)(1): explain, in terms of the electrode reactions, the industrial process of: (1) the anodizing of aluminium_

Aluminium is a reactive metal that oxidises easily. However, aluminium objects are usually resistant to corrosion because when exposed to air, aluminium forms a layer of \(Al_{2}O_{3}\) (about 10\({}^{-6}\) cm thickness) on its surface. This oxide layer is resistant to corrosion and it acts as a protective layer which seals off the aluminium beneath it from further reaction.

**Anodising of aluminium** is a surface treatment to **increase the thickness of the corrosion resistant Al\({}_{2}O_{3}\)(s) layer on the surface of an aluminium object by electrolysis.**

During anodising, the electrolyte is dilute \(H_{2}SO_{4}\). The \(Al\) object to be anodised is made the anode. The cathode can be Pt or graphite.

The reactions occurring at each electrode are:

_Reactions at anode_: 2A(s) 3H\({}_{2}\)(0) + 6H\({}_{2}\)(g) + 6e- 2A\({}_{2}\)(g)

_Reaction at cathode_: 2H\({}^{+}\)(gq) + 2E\({}_{2}\)(g)

The \(Al_{2}O_{3}\) layer formed this way is porous. The pores are then sealed by dipping the aluminium object in hot water. Because of the way it is formed, the oxide coating is porous enough to accept and hold dyes that would not otherwise stick to aluminium. Since the thickness of the deposit of aluminium oxide increases with electrolysis time, the amount of dye deposited and the intensity of colour developed also increase with electrolysis time. Anodised objects can therefore be decorative. Anodised aluminium can be used to make window frames, drink cans and iPods covers.
