## Periodic Table

The Periodic Table is an arrangement and classification of the elements.

If can be used to predict the properties of elements from trends that are observed.

## GROUP (Vertical Column)

* Vertical columns of elements in the Periodic Table
* The Group number indicates the number of valence electrons in an atom of an element.
* Element in the same group have the same number of valence electrons, hence they form ions of the same charges and have similar chemical properties (reaction)

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|} \hline
**Element** & **Electronic** & **Valence** & **Group** & **Ions** \\  & **Configuration** & **electrons** & & \\ \hline Lithium & 2.1 & 1 & 1 & Li\({}^{+}\) \\ \hline Sodium & 2.8.1 & 1 & 1 & No\({}^{+}\) \\ \hline Potassium & 2.8.8.1 & 1 & 1 & K\({}^{+}\) \\ \hline Oxygen & 2.6 & 6 & VI & O\({}^{2-}\) \\ \hline Sulphur & 2.8.6 & 6 & VI & S\({}^{2-}\) \\ \hline Beryllium & 2 & 2 & Ill & Be\({}^{2+}\) \\ \hline Magnesium & 2.8.2 & 2 & Ill & Mg\({}^{2+}\) \\ \hline \end{tabular}

## Exception

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|} \hline
**Element** & **Electronic** & **Valence** & **Group** \\  & **Configuration** & **electrons** & \\ \hline Helium & 2 & 2 & 0 \\ \hline \end{tabular}

Helium is not located in Group II, as its 1st shell is completely full and it has a stable noble gas configuration.

## Trends down a Group

The following trends are observed when down a Group:

* The proton number becomes bigger. The number of energy levels increases as you move down a group as the number of electrons increases. Each subsequent energy level is further from the nucleus than the last. Therefore, the atomic radius increases as the group and energy levels increase.
* The properties of the elements become more metallic. This is because on going down the group, the elements lose electrons more easily, as the valence electrons become spaced further away from the positive nucleus.

## PERIOD (Horizontal row)

* Horizontal rows of elements in the Periodic Table.
* The Periodic Table is a list of elements arranged in order of their increasing atomic or proton number
* The Period number indicates the number of occupied electron shells in an atom of an element.

#### Trends across a Period

* Across the period, elements changes from Metals to Non-metals
* A decrease in metallic properties
* An increase in non-metallic properties
* This results in the different types of oxides formed.

\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|} \hline Group & **I** & **II** & **III** & **IV** & **V** & **VI** & **VII** & **0** \\ \hline Symbol & Na & Mg & Al & Si & P & S & Cl & Ar \\ \hline Properties & \multicolumn{3}{c|}{Metallic} & Metalloid & \multicolumn{3}{c|}{Non-metallic} \\  & & & \multicolumn{3}{c|}{(Elements} & & & \\  & & & & & & & \\  & & & & & & & \\  & & & & & & & \\  & & & & & & & \\  & & & & & & & \\  & & & & & & & \\  & & & & & & & \\  & & & & & & & \\  & & & & & & & \\ \hline Nature of & Basic oxide & Amphoteric & & & Acidic oxide & \\ oxide & & & oxide & & & & \\ \hline \end{tabular}

Decreasing metallic properties

* The atomic radius decreases. As you go across a period, electrons are added to the same energy level. At the same time, protons are being added to the nucleus. The concentration of more protons in the nucleus creates a "**higher effective nuclear charge**." In other words, there is a stronger force of 'positive attraction' pulling the electrons closer to the nucleus resulting in a smaller atomic radius.
* The electronegativity increases (electronegativity is a measure of the ability of an atom or molecule to attract pairs of electrons in a chemical bond.)
* The tendency for an element to gain electrons to form negative ions, increases across the period.

**Difference in Chemical properties between**

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|} \hline
**Metals** & **Non Metals** \\ \hline Good conductor of heat and & Poor conductor of heat and electricity \\ electricity & \\ \hline Generally malleable, ductile & Generally brittle if solid \\ \hline Solid at room temperature (except & Generally liquid or gas at room \\ Mercury) & temperature, they can exist as solids \\ too. \\ \hline \end{tabular}

The metallic elements between Gp II and III are known as the **Transition Metals**

Transition metals have:

High electrical conductivity due to delocalized/free flowing electrons

Variied oxidation states eg. Fe\({}^{2+}\), Fe\({}^{3+}\), Cu\({}^{+}\), Cu\({}^{2+}\)

Formed compounds that are coloured.

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|} \hline
**Compound** & **Colour** & **Compound** & **Colour** \\ \hline Iron (II) hydroxide & Green & Copper (II) oxide & Black \\ \hline Iron (III) hydroxide & Brown & Copper (II) & Green \\  & & carbonate & \\ \hline Iron (III) chloride & Yellow/Orange & Copper (II) sulfate & Blue \\ \hline Potassium & Purple & Manganese (IV) & Black \\ Manganate (VII) & & oxide & \\ \hline \end{tabular}

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:8]

* Alkoli metals are powerful reducing agents as it loses it valence electrons easily to attain a stable noble gas structure.

\begin{tabular}{c c c} Li - e & \(\rightarrow\) Li+ \\ No - e & \(\rightarrow\) Na+ \\ K - e & \(\rightarrow\) K+ \\ \end{tabular}

### Trend in Chemical Properties of Group I

Down Group I, the reactivity and reducing power of the metals increases.

Reason: As size of atom increases, ease of losing electrons from bigger atoms increases. In the larger atoms, the valence electron is further away from the nucleus. The nuclear charge holding the valence electron to the atom is weak. Hence it is more easily lost.

### Compounds of Group I

* Lattice structure
* Alkoli (Universal indicator will turn purple)
* Similar chemical formula 

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:10]

\(\text{Br}z(\text{g})+2\text{KCl}(\alpha\text{q})\to\text{no}\,\text{recction}\) (No displacement)
* Bromine is less reactive than chlorine. It cannot displace chlorine from potassium chloride solution. A less reactive halogen cannot displace a more reactive halogen from its halide solution.

### More examples of displacement reaction

Example 1: Chlorine water is added to three solutions

\begin{tabular}{l l l} \hline \hline Chemical Equations & Observation \\ \hline Cl\({}_{2}\) (aq) + KCl (aq) & no reaction & KCl solution remains colourless. \\ \hline Cl\({}_{2}\) (aq) + 2KBr (aq) & 2KCl (aq) + Br\({}_{2}\) (aq) & Colouless KBr solution turns brown due to Br\({}_{2}\) \\ \hline Cl\({}_{2}\) (aq) + 2Kl (aq) & 2KCl (aq) + l\({}_{2}\) (aq) & Colouless Kl solution turns brown due to l\({}_{2}\).lodine when dissolved is brown. \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}

Additional Notes (Redox Reaction)

Displacement reaction are redox reaction

\[Cl_{2}(g)+2\text{NoBr}(\alpha q)\to 2\text{NoCl}(\alpha q)+\text{Br}_{2}(\alpha q)\]

Ionic equation:

Redox is explained in terms of electron gain and loss.

The equation above can be separated into two parts:

\[Cl_{2}(g)+2\text{e}\to 2Cl^{-}(g)\] (gain of electrons) \[\quad\text{Reduction}\] \[2\text{Br}^{-}(\alpha q)-2\text{e}\to\text{Br}_{2}(\alpha q)\] (loss of electrons) \[\quad\text{Oxidation}\]

Trends in Chemical Properties in Group VII

Down the group,

Reactivity decreases;

Oxidising power decreases.

As size of atom increases, it becomes more difficult for the nucleus to draw an additional electron into its valence shell.

## GROUP 0 - NOBLE Gases

### Physical Properties

Group 0 elements are known as noble gases

* Colourless and odourless gases at room temperature
* Very low melting points and boiling points
* Are insoluble in water

### Chemical Properties

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|} \hline
**Element** & **Electronic Configuration** \\ \hline Helium & 2 & [Duplet configuration] \\ \hline Neon & 2.8 & (Oclet configuration) \\ \hline Argon & 2.8.8 & (Oclet configuration) \\ \hline \end{tabular}

Noble gases have stable electronic structures. Hence, they

* are chemically unreactive;
* do not gain, lose or share electrons;
* do not form compounds;
* exist as monatomic gases.

### Uses of Noble gases

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|} \hline
**Element** & **Uses** \\ \hline He & Use to fill weather or advertisement balloons and airships \\  & Use by divers in breathing tanks in preference to Nitrogen \\ \hline Ne & Use in making colourful light boards and signages. \\ \hline Ar & Use to fill up light bulb to prevent filament from oxidation \\  & Use for welding of stainless steel \\ \hline \end{tabular}

## 6 Transition Metals

### Properties of transition metals

Metals located in the block between Gp II and Gp III

Have high melting and boiling point

Have high densities

These metals have more than one oxidation state (charge) for the different compounds formed eg

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|} \hline
**Metal** & **Compound** & **Oxidation state of metal** \\ \hline Copper & CuCO\({}_{3}\) & Charge of Cu is +2 (Cu\({}^{2+}\)) \\ \cline{2-3}  & Cu2O & Charge of Cu is +1 (Cu\({}^{+}\)) \\ \cline{2-3}  & CuO & Charge of Cu is +2 (Cu\({}^{2+}\)) \\ \hline Iron & FeSO\({}_{4}\) & Charge of Fe is +2 (Fe\({}^{2+}\)) \\ \cline{2-3}  & Fe(OH)\({}_{3}\) & Charge of Fe is +3 (Fe\({}^{3+}\)) \\ \hline Manganese & KMnO\({}_{4}\) & Charge of Mn is +7 (Mn\({}^{7+}\)) \\ \cline{2-3}  & MnO\({}_{2}\) & Charge of Mn is +4 (Mn\({}^{4+}\)) \\ \hline \end{tabular}

### Formed coloured compounds -

Colours of the compounds of a transition metal are different at different oxidation states.

Colour of hydrated compounds may differ from anhydrous compound.

Compounds of transition metals are used in dyes, pigments and paints to produce different colours

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|} \hline
**Compound** & **Colour of compound** & **Compound** & **Colour of compound** \\ \hline CuCO\({}_{3}\) & Green & FeSO\({}_{4}\) & Green \\ \hline CuO & Black & Fe(OH)\({}_{3}\) & Brown \\ \hline CuSO\({}_{4}\) & Blue & KMnO\({}_{4}\) & Purple \\ \hline \end{tabular}

## Role of Reaction

What is the Rate of reaction?

* The **speed** of a reaction is called the **rate** of the reaction.
* Rate of reaction is the rate at which a **chemical reaction takes place**.

PART I: MEASUURING SPEED OF REACTION

The speed of the reaction or rate can be measured by:

* Volume of gas produced per unit time
* Mass of reactant used up per unit time
* Rate of effervescence / bubbling (Not accurate)

### (\(\alpha\)) Measuring speed of reaction through volume of gas produced.

The speed of a reaction can be found by measuring the volume of gas produced measured at regular time intervals.

## Experiment 1:

The setup is shown below. A **fixed mass** of magnesium metal was added to an excess of dilute hydrochloric acid. The magnesium metal was entirely dissolved and volume of hydrogen gas evolved was measured at regular time interval during the reaction.

Figure 1: **The gradient of the gradient at X\({}_{1}\)** is steeper than X\({}_{2}\). At X\({}_{3}\), the gradient is zero. The rate of reaction has stopped at X\({}_{3}\).

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:21]

## Appendix A

## Part II: Collision theory to explain rate of reaction

The rate of reaction can be explained based on the movement, energy and frequency of effective collisions of reactant particles to form products.

This form of explanation based on particles is called Collision Theory

**Facto:**Safe:**Critical:** The rate of reaction

The speed of a reaction depends on the following factors:

**(a)** the **Concentration** of the reactants
**(b)** the **Pressure** of the reactants (for gaseous reactants only)
**(c)** the **Particle size** or total **Surface area** of the reactants
**(d)** the **Temperature** at which the reaction is occuring.
**(e) **Catalyst** present

**For a reaction to occur between two particles:**

* the reccting particle must collide with each other
* they must collide with a certain minimum amount of energy known as activation energy

The reactant particles must have enough energy (equal to or higher than the activation energy) in order to collide **effectively** with each other to form the products.

To form a product, the collisions of reactants must be effective.

Ineffective collisions will not form products. This happens when the particles do not have enough energy (activation energy)

## Appendix A

## Explanation

Increasing pressure in gaseous reactants, results in smaller volume for the same amount of reacting gas molecules. The reactant gas molecules are closer to each other, thus there will be higher frequency of effective collisions. Rate of reaction will increase.

Hence if the pressure for gaseous reactants is increased, the rate of reaction will be faster.

## 6 Evaluation

Decreasing the size of the particles results in higher total surface area of the reactants exposed for effective collisions. This results in a higher frequency of effective collisions. Hence increased surface area of reactants results in a faster rate of reaction.

## Explanation

Increasing the temperature of a reaction results in reactant particles having more energy and the particles will move faster. More particles now have energy greater than the activation energy to form products. The frequency of effective collisions increases. The rate of reaction increases.

[MISSING_PAGE_POST]

## (e) Catalyst

### Definition of a Catalyst:

A catalyst is a substance which _increases the speed_ of a chemical reaction and _remains chemically unchanged_ at the end of the reaction. They provide alternative pathways that requires lower activation energy to form products.

Not all reaction can have a catalytic reaction. Catalyst are also specific in nature, they are specific in their reaction and cannot react the same for other reaction.

### Explanation

Presence of catalyst, decreases the activation energy required to form products. More reactants can now reach the lowered activation energy at a shorter time. Lesser amount of energy (lower temperature needed) is also required for effective collisions. The rate of reaction increases.

## Part VI: Graph interpretation and application

In a chemical reaction,

Mg (s) + 2HCl (aq) MgCl2 (aq) + H2 (g)

Assuming that Mg is the excess reactant and HCl is the limiting reactant, the number of moles of HCl used will determine the moles of H2 gas produced.

Hence from the table

### Application:

Assume HCl is the limiting reagent, the concentration and volume of the acid used will affect the number of HCl used and consequently the moles of H2 evolved.

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|} \hline Con of HCl & Vol of HCl & Mol of HCl & Mol of H2 \\ (mol/dm3) & (cm3) & & \\ \hline
1.0 & 25 & 0.025 & 0.0125 \\ \hline
2.0 & 25 & 0.05 & 0.025 \\ \hline

### Oxidation and Reduction in Terms of Changes in Oxidation State

Oxidation occurs when the oxidation state of a substance increases.

Reduction occurs when the oxidation state of a substance decreases.

Example 1: Displacement reaction between metals

The oxidation state of zinc has increased from 0 (in Zn) to +2 (in Zn\({}^{2+}\)).

Zn has been oxidised to Zn\({}^{2+}\).

The oxidation state of copper has decreased from +2 (in Cu\({}^{2+}\)) to 0 (in Cu).

Cu\({}^{2+}\) has been reduced to Cu.

Example 2: Displacement reaction between halogens

The oxidation state of bromine has increased from -1 (in KBr) to 0 (in Br\({}_{2}\)).

KBr has been oxidised to Br\({}_{2}\).

The oxidation state of chlorine has decreased from 0 (in Cl\({}_{2}\)) to -1 (in KCl).

Cl\({}_{2}\) has been reduced to KCl.

### Head changes in Reaction

The amount of energy involved in a reaction is known as the **heat change** or **enthalpy change** of the reaction.

* measured in **kilojules (kJ)**
* represented by the symbol \(\Delta H\)

The **difference** between the energy levels of the products and the reactants is equal to the amount of energy given out or taken in (\(\Delta H\)) by the reaction.

\(\Delta H\) = total energy of Products - total energy of reactants

For an **exothermic** reaction, \(\Delta H\) **is negative (<0)** because the chemicals have **lost energy** to the surroundings.

For an **endothermic** reaction, \(\Delta H\) **is positive (>0)** because the chemicals have **gained energy** from the surroundings.

### Energy Level Diagrams

An **energy level diagram** shows the energy change in a reaction.

What Causes Energy Changes in Chemical Reactions?

Reactions involve the **breaking of bonds** and **forming of new bonds.** Thus, energy changes are caused by the breaking and making of chemical bonds.

### Bond Breaking

Bonds in reactant molecules must be broken first before new bonds can be formed in the products.

Energy is required to break bonds.

Bond breaking is endothermic

### Bond Making/Forming

Energy is released when bonds are formed.

Bond making is exothermic.

Energy is given out

Example

Bond breaking (in reactants) and bond making (to form products) occurs during chemical reactions.

H\({}_{2}\) + \(\mathrm{l}_{2}\)\(\rightarrow\) 2HI

H\(-\)H and I\(-\)I bonds are broken.

HI bonds are formed.

A chemical reaction is exothermic when:

energy absorbed for bond breaking is

energy absorbed for bond breaking is

less than energy released in bond

making

\(\Delta\)H bond breaking < \(\Delta\)H bond making

\(\Delta\)H bond breaking > \(\Delta\)H bond making

**Calculation using Bond Energy**

**Is the reaction 2Hz(g) + Oz(g) >2HzO(g) exothermic or endothermic?**

**Bond Breaking**

**Energy absorbed to break 1 mol of H--H**

**Bond molecule of HzO is made up of 2 O--H bonds = 436 kJ (Bond energy of H-H bond)**

**Energy absorbed to break 2 mol of H--H bonds = 463 kJ (Bond energy of O-H bond)**

**Energy absorbed to break 1 mol of O--O bonds = 496 kJ (Bond energy of O=O bond)**

**Energy absorbed to break 2 mol of H--H bonds = 2 \(\times\) 436 kJ = 872 kJ Energy developed to forming 4 mol of O--H bonds = 4 \(\times\) 463 kJ = 1852 kJ**

**Energy absorbed to break 1 mol of O--O bonds = 496 kJ (Bond energy of O=O bond)**

**Total energy absorbed for bond breaking**

**= 872 + 496 = **1368 kJ**

**\(\Delta\)H\({}_{\text{reaction}}\)**= Heat involved in bond breaking + Heat involved in bond making**

\[=1368+(-1852)=-484 kJ (<0)\]

**This reaction is exothermic. More energy is** _given out to form the O-H bonds_ **in water (product) than taken in to** _break the H-H and O=O_ **bonds in hydrogen and oxygen gas (reactants).**

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:53]

### Activation Energy

All reactions need energy in order to get started.

Many reactions that do not occur at room temperature will proceed rapidly when the reactants are heated.

Heat provides the energy to change less energetic particles into more energetic particles and thus start a reaction

Activation energy, \(E_{\alpha}\), is the minimum amount of energy that reactant particles must possess in order for a chemical reaction to occur.

A reaction will only occur when reactant particles possess energy equal to or more than the activation energy \(E_{\alpha}\).

### When does a reaction occur?

## Appendix

### Definition of Electrolysis

The decomposition of a compound by the passage of electricity through it.

Definition of:

Electrolyte: A **chemical** compound that conducts electricity by changing into ions when melted or dissolved into a solution.

Electrode: A solid electric conductor that carries electric current.

* Cathode: A type of electrode that delivers electrons to cations (positive ions)
* Anode: A type of electrode that receives electrons from anions (negative ions)

### PROCESS OF ELECTROLYSIS

Electrons transfer from the negative terminal of the battery and enter the cathode.

### At the cathode,

The positive cations (+) are discharged by gaining electrons.

The positive cations become neutral (meta) atoms

### At the anode

The anions discharged (-) are discharged by loosing electrons.

They become neutral atoms of non-metals.

## 6 Applications using active electrodes

* **Purification of Metal** *

To purify a metal eg. Copper, the impure copper is made the anode. A piece of pure copper is used as the cathode. Pure copper from the anode dissolves into the electrolyte. Pure copper is then deposited at the cathode. The impurities left on the anode, fall off and can be collected below the anode.

* **Electro-plating** A metallic object can be coated with another metal by electrolysis. This process is known as electroplating.

The electrolyte used must have the same positive ions as the metal to be coated. To electroplate an object with copper, copper (II) sulfate solution is used as the electrolyte. The object is made the cathode and pure copper is used as the anode.

**At the anode**, the copper metal dissolves.

Cu (s) Cu\({}^{2+}\) (aq) + 2e

The Cu\({}^{2+}\) ions migrates towards the cathode

**At the cathode**, the Cu\({}^{2+}\) ions are discharged.

Cu\({}^{2+}\) (aq) + 2e \(\rightarrow\) Cu (s)

Copper metal is deposited on the object. The object eventually get electroplated or covered with copper metal.

Steel objects are electroplated to protect the steel from corrosion and to give the object an attractive shiny appearance. The metals used to electroplate are usually corrosion resistant, shiny and low in the reactivity series. Below are some examples of electroplating.

\begin{tabular}{|c|l|} \hline
**Electroplating** & **Uses** \\
**metal** & \\ \hline Chromium & Water taps, motorcar and bicycle parts \\ \hline Tin & Tin cans \\ \hline Silver & Silver-plated sports trophies, plaques, ornaments, knives and forks (silverwares) \\ \hline Nickel & Corrosion resistant layer before electroplating with another metal on top. \\ \hline \end{tabular}

* Metals can be extracted from their ones by electrolysis. However this process is very energy consuming and expensive. This method of extraction is only used to extract very reactive metal such as sodium, calcium and aluminium.
* These metals cannot be extracted from their ones by reduction with carbon.
* The pure metal can only be obtained by electrolysis a molten ionic compound of the metal.

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:68]

## Simple cells

A simple cell is a device that converts chemical energy into electrical energy. It is also known as an electric cell.

A simple cell is made by **placing two different metals in contact with an electrolyte**. The **metals** act as **electrodes** for the simple cell.

When a zinc plate and a copper plate are placed in dilute sulfuric acid and connected by wires, a potential difference is set up between the metal plates.

The potential difference can be registered by a voltmeter.

Site of REDUCTION: CATHODE RC Site of OXIDATION: ANODE OA
**Overall cell reaction:**\(Zn(s)+2H^{+}(\alpha q)\to Zn^{2+}(\alpha q)+H_{2}(g)\)

Oxidation and reduction occur to cause the flow of electrons.

Hence, electrical energy is produced by redox reactions in \(\alpha\) simple cell.

In \(\alpha\) simple cell, the flow of electrons is always from the more reactive metal to the less reactive metal.

The **more reactive metal** becomes the **negative electrode** and the less reactive metal the positive electrode.

**Overall ionic equation:**\(\mathrm{Zn(s)+Cu^{2+}(\alpha q)\to Zn^{2+}(\alpha q)+Cu(s)}\)
## 4 Simple cell and the reactivity series

The amount of **electrical energy** produced in a simple cell is determined by **how far apart the metals** (electrodes) are in the reactivity series.

The further apart the two metals are in the reactivity series, the greater the voltage produced.

No current will flow if both electrodes are made of the same metal.

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:73]

To prevent this, a salt bridge is used to supply ions. A salt bridge like NaCl contains Na+ and Cl ions. A cotton plug is placed at both end to prevent NaCl solution from flowing directly into the half cells.

**Difference between Fuel and Ordinary Cell**

The reactants are not contained within the cell but instead are continuously supplied from an external reservoir.

**Advantages of using Hydrogen as a Fuel**

It is a renewable energy resource.

It is also pollution-free because only water is produced when hydrogen reacts with oxygen.

Hydrogen is an efficient source of energy.

which provides twice the amount of energy compared to many other fuels.

**Disadvantages of Using Hydrogen As a Fuel**

It is difficult to find a cheap source of hydrogen. Obtaining hydrogen from electrolysis is an expensive process.

Hydrogen is extremely flammable and explosive. Special precautions must be taken in the storage and transport of the gas.

Hydrogen is very light, and thus requires larger storage volumes compared to other fuels.

## Appendix A* The oxygen will react with the hot copper and the overall volume of gas in the syringes will drop. \(\mathbf{Cu_{(s)}+O_{2(g)}\to 2CuO_{(s)}}\)
* Volume of air in the gas syringe will decrease by 21% as copper has been oxidized to copper (II) oxide by reacting with the oxygen in the gas syringe. 21% of air contains oxygen gas.
* Volume of gas is read after apparatus cooled to room temperature.
* The experiment is repeated until a constant volume is obtained (to ensure that all the oxygen has been removed.)

### Observations

* The **copper** starts off a **reddish-brown colour** and after the reaction is complete it is **black**, the colour of **copper (II) oxide**, CuO.

### Application Gns:

200 cm\({}^{3}\) of air in syringe (left) was made to pass over heated copper until the reaction was complete. The gas in syringe (right) was then allowed to cool to its original temperature. What is the volume of gas collected in syringe (right)?

Answer:

Copper reacted with oxygen in the air to form copper (II) oxide.

2Cu (s) + O\({}_{2}\) (g) \(\rightarrow\) 2CuO (s)

Since oxygen makes up approximately 20% of air, maximum volume of oxygen that will react = 200cm\({}^{3}\) x 20% = 40 cm\({}^{3}\)

Hence, volume of gas collected in syringe B = 200cm\({}^{3}\) - 40 cm\({}^{3}\) = 160 cm

### Observation:

The water level would have risen by 21% indicating that 21% of air contains oxygen and oxygen is used in the rusting of iron.

Leave the setup for another 1-2 days and read the water level again. The same reading will ensure that all the oxygen is removed.

### Fractional distillation of air

Figure 3: At -200oC carbon dioxide and water are solids so can be easily taken out.

**Note:** CO\({}_{2}\) is not a pollutant as it is a gas release by human when we exhale and taken in by plants for photosynthesis. It is the increasing concentration of CO\({}_{2}\) that we are concern about as it causes global warming.

Definition of pollutant: A substance that causes harm to the environment or pollutes the quality of air, water or land. Eg. Toxic waste dump in water.

### Flue Gas Desulfurisation

Two ways to minimise the effects of sulfur dioxide pollution:

* Remove sulfur from fossil fuels before burning.
* However, this method is too expensive and difficult.
* Remove sulfur dioxide from the waste gases formed when the fossil fuels undergo combustion (cheaper).
* The waste gases are called flue gases.
* The process of removing sulfur dioxide from flue gases is called **desulfurisation**
Catalytic Converters

A catalytic converter helps to remove acidic gases in vehicle exhaust gases.

When the hot exhaust gases pass over the platinum and rhodium catalysts, the harmful pollutants undergo redox reactions and are converted into harmless substances.

Carbon monoxide is oxidised to carbon dioxide while nitric oxide is reduced to nitrogen:

CO is removed: 2CO(g) + O2(g) \(\rightarrow\) 2CO2(g) NO is removed: 2NO(g) + 2CO(g) \(\rightarrow\) N2(g) + 2CO2(g) Unburnt hydrocarbons are oxidised to carbon dioxide and water:

2CsHis(l) + 25O2(g) \(\rightarrow\) 16CO2(g) + 18H2O(g)

**What happens to the catalytic converter after li no longer functions?**

_Plotinum is expensive, used converters are collected and the platinum are recycled._

**Other Measures to Reduce Air Pollution Caused by Motor Vehicles**

* Burn less fossil fuels.
* Use lightweight alloys to make car bodies to improve fuel efficiency.
* Switch to electric or hybrid electric vehicles to reduce exhaust gas emissions.
* Use alternative fuels such as hydrogen fuel, where products of combustion are harmless; solar and wind energy.

### Ozone (O3)

Pale blue gas found in the upper layer of the atmosphere called stratosphere (20-50 km above sea level)

Acts as a shield to filter out harmful ultraviolet radiation from the Sun.

### Ozone Depletion Problem

* In recent years, the ozone layer is depleting.
* This allows some harmful UV rays to reach the Earth's surface. This can lead to cataract and skin cancer in humans.
* Caused by a group of compounds called chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs)

### Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs)

Contain the elements **carbon**,

fluorine and **chlorine**

Were widely used as

propellants for aerosols and as

coolants in refrigerators and

air conditioners

Were also used in the

manufacture of packing foam

Chlorine atoms in CFCs **break**

down ozone

Fluorine gives stability to CFCs,

making them persistent in the

atmosphere (difficult to

remove)

* CFCs reach the stratosphere and

the uv rays decomposes the CFC to

produce Cl atoms.

CFC molecules

cur rays

Cl atoms react with ozone to form

chlorine oxide and oxygen.

The reaction between Cl atoms

and O\({}_{3}\) molecules destroys the

ozone layer.

The Endon Cycle

### Greenhouse Effect and Global warming

Certain gases in our atmosphere allow visible radiation from the Sun to reach the Earth's surface. However, they trap some of the infrared radiation emitted by the Earth.

This process is called the greenhouse effect.

Goses which trap the energy are called greenhouse gases.

They are mainly carbon dioxide, methane (CH\({}_{4}\)) and water vapour.

Without these gases, Earth's surface would have a temperature of about \(-40^{\rm o}\)C.

### Global Warming

Activities like the burning of fossil fuels and large-scale cutting down of forests are causing some greenhouse gases, especially carbon dioxide, to build up rapidly in the atmosphere.

This means that carbon dioxide is being added to the atmosphere at a higher rate than photosynthesis can remove the excess gas.

The effect of carbon dioxide build-up leads to an increase in the Earth's average temperature. This is global warming.

**Consequences of Global Warming**

* Melting of large quantities of ice in the North Pole and South Pole, which may lead to floods
* More occurrences of unusual weather conditions; dry places get drier while wet places get wetter
* Decrease in crop yields world-wide

### 0.a.1 Introduction

The main text of this thesis is the following.

**Introduction - What are Organic compounds?**

* All organic compounds contain carbon.
* Most organic compounds also contain hydrogen.
* Hydrocarbons are organic compounds that contain only hydrogen and carbon.
* Some organic compounds may also contain oxygen, chlorine and nitrogen.

### 0.a.2 Homologous Series

* To study the different organic compounds, related organic compounds are grouped into families called homologous series.
* A **homologous series** is a family of organic compounds with the same functional group and similar chemical properties.
* Examples of homologous series:
* alkanes
* alkenes
* alcohols
* carboxylic acids

### 0.a.3 Functional Group

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|} \hline
**Homologous Series** & **Functional group** & **Structural representation** \\ \hline
**Alkanes** & No functional group & \\ \hline

Organic compounds in the same homologous series

have the same functional group;

have similar chemical properties;

show a gradual change in their physical properties down the series.

### Naming Organic Compounds

The name of an organic compound is divided into two parts:

1. **Prefix** -- shows the number of carbon atoms in each molecule.

2. **Suffix** -- shows the homologous series that the compound belongs to.

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|} \hline
**No. of carbon atoms per molecule** & **Prefix** & **No. of carbon atoms per molecule** & **Prefix** \\ \hline
1 & Meth \(\sim\) & 5 & Pent \(\sim\) \\ \hline

**Petroleum and Natural Gas**

**Petroleum and natural gas** are used as sources of energy.

**Petroleum** is a naturally occuming mixture of hydrocarbons (mainly alkanes).

**Petroleum** is also called crude oil.

**Natural gas** is mostly made up of

methane (about 70-90%):

other short-chain alkanes such as ethane (about 0-20%), propane and

butane.

**How are Petroleum and Natural gas formed?**

See creatures and plants sink to the seabed when they die.

Over millions of years, these organisms are subjected to heat from the Earth and

pressure.

**Petroleum and natural gas formation**

**Petrableum and natural gas are formed.**

**Deep wells are drilled to get them out.**

**Fractional Distillation of Petroleum**

Petroleum can be separated into useful fractions by fractional distillation.**

* **Each fraction is a mixture of hydrocarbons which boils over a certain**

temperature range.
* **A lighter fraction contains fewer carbon atoms and has a lower boiling point**
* **range than a heavier fraction.**

#### Issues Related to the Competing Uses of Petroleum

Petroleum is a non-renewable resource. This means that supply of petroleum is limited or finite

To meet the two competing uses (chemical feedstock for plastics etc and fuel) of petroleum, there is a growing need for its conservation.

#### Ways to Conserve Petroleum

Reduce the number of motor vehicles on the road.

Take public transport such as buses and the MRT

Drive cars that consume less petrol

Improve the design of power stations and vehicles for more efficient use of petroleum.

Use alternative energy sources such as solar energy and nuclear energy.

Use alternative fuels.

#### Alternative Fuels

Biofuel

biogas (produced when dead plants or animals decay in the absence of air)

biodiesel (made from plant oils like palm oil)

Gasohol

mixture of ethanol and petrol

What is Gasohol?

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:101]

Physical Properties of Alkanes
* Low melting and boiling points
* Insoluble in water
* Soluble in organic solvents
* Going down the alkane homologous series, molecular size of alkanes increases; intermolecular forces of attraction between alkane molecules increase; more energy is required to overcome the intermolecular forces between the molecules.

Thus,

the melting and boiling points of alkanes increase down the homologous series; (Larger molecules have increased intermolecular forces of attraction)

alkanes become more viscous i.e. flow less easily;

their flammability decreases.

Chemical Properties of Alkanes

1. **Complete Combustion** * Alkames burn in excess air (oxygen) to produce carbon dioxide and water vapour. * CH4(g) + 2O2(g) \(\rightarrow\) CO2(g) + 2H2O(g) * This reaction is highly exothermic (produces a lot of heat), hence alkanes are used as fuels.
2. **Incomplete Combustion** When air (oxygen) is limited, alkanes will burn to produce carbon monoxide (toxic), soot and water.
3. **Substitution reactions** Alkanes react with halogens (e.g. Cl2, Br2) in the presence of ultraviolet (UV) light. Reaction of methane with chlorine 

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:104]

#### Isomerism in Alkenes

For example, butene and methylpropene are isomers.

They have the same molecular formula C\(\mathrm{{}_{4}}\)H\(\mathrm{{}_{8}}\) but different structural formulae.

They have different physical properties such as melting and boiling points.

#### Physical Properties of Alkenes

As molecular size of alkenes increase down the homologous series, the boiling points of alkenes increase. Alkenes are covalent compounds and therefore have weak intermolecular forces between molecules.

However, as the size of the alkene molecules increases, the intermolecular forces increase. Hence, more energy is required to overcome these forces and the boiling points increase.

#### Chemical Properties of Alkenes

1. **Complete Combustion** * Alkenes burn in excess air (oxygen) to produce carbon dioxide and water vqpour. * C2H4(g) + 3O2(g) \(\rightarrow\) 2CO2(g) + 2H2O(g) * Alkenes contain a relatively higher percentage of carbon than the corresponding alkanes. Hence, they burn with a sootier flame.
2. **Incomplete Combustion** * When air (oxygen) is limited, alkanes will burn to produce carbon monoxide (toxic), soot and water.

## 3 Addition Reactions

Carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C) in alkenes are very reactivity

Thus, alkenes readily undergo addition reactions.

In an **addition** reaction, an unsaturated organic compound combines

with another substance to form a single new compound.

### Test for Saturated and Unsaturated hydrocarbons

#### Bromination

Used to test for the presence of unsaturated hydrocarbons

Can be used to distinguish between an alkane and an alkene

#### Production of Alkenes by Cracking

Cracking is the breaking down of long-chain hydrocarbons into smaller hydrocarbons or hydrogen.

Alkenes are obtained by cracking petroleum.

Example:

Hexane - Butane + Ethene

C\({}_{6}\)H\({}_{14}\) - C\({}_{4}\)H\({}_{10}\) + C\({}_{2}\)H\({}_{4}\)

In catalytic cracking, a catalyst is used to speed up the process of cracking.

#### Industrial Catalytic Cracking

For example, the naptha fraction in petroleum undergoes cracking to produce short-chain alkanes such as ethene and propene, which are used to produce petrochemicals.

#### Conditions:

* High temperature, e.g. 600\({}^{o}\)C
* Aluminium oxide (Al\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{3}\)) and silicon dioxide (SiO\({}_{2}\)) catalysts* **Modem cracking uses zeolites as catalysts. These are complex aluminiosilicates.**

### Cracking of Hydrocarbons in the School Laboratory

#### Example: Cracking of liquid petroleum

The set-up below shows how catalytic cracking of liquid petroleum can be carried out in the school laboratory.

* **Importance of Cracking**

* **No Examples**
* **1** Cracking produces short-chain alkenes.**
* **Example** C18H38 C6H14 + 6C2H4
* **Short-chain alkenes such as ethene and propene are used to make ethanol and plastics.**
* **2** Cracking produces hydrogen.**
* **Example** C18H38 C6H16 + C10H20 + H2
* **Hydrogen is used in the manufacture of ammonia which is used to make fertilisers**
* **3** Cracking converts hydrocarbons of higher molecular mass into smaller molecules which are in higher demand.**
* **For example, there is a higher demand for petrol than lubricating oil or diesel oil.**
* **Petrol can be obtained through catalytic cracking of diesel and lubricating oils.**

### Physical Properties

* Alcohols are volatile liquids at room temperature and pressure.
* **Alcohol** **State** **Solubility in water** **Boiling point /oC**

Methanol Liquid Very soluble 65

Ethanol Liquid Very soluble 78

Propanol Liquid Soluble 97

Butanol Liquid Slightly soluble 118

Additional Notes
* Due to the highly polar nature of the -OH group in alcohols, stronger hydrogen bonding occurs between alcohol molecules in addition to the weak intermolecular forces (van der Waal forces). More energy is thus required to separate the alcohol molecules, resulting in higher boiling points. Since the boiling points of alcohols are above room temperature, they exist in the liquid state at room temperature.

Students are not required by the syllabus to understand polarity of molecules nor hydrogen bonding.
* As the molecular size of alcohols increases,
* solubility of alcohols decreases; Short-chain alcohols dissolve easily in water due to the presence of the -OH group. However, as the hydrocarbon chain becomes longer, the alcohols become more non-polar and become less soluble in water. Thus solubility of alcohols decreases down the series.
* boiling point of alcohols increases. This is because the forces of attraction between the alcohol molecules increase.

### Chemical Properties

1. **Complete Combustion** * Alcohols burn in excess air (oxygen) to produce carbon dioxide and water vapour. * C2H3OH (aq) + 3O2(g) \(\rightarrow\) 2CO2(g) + 2H2O(g) * This reaction is highly exothermic (produces a lot of heat), hence alcohols are used as fuels.

## 2 Incomplete Combustion

When air (oxygen) is limited, alcohol will burn to produce carbon monoxide (toxic), soot and water.
3. **Oxidation** Alcohols are oxidised to carboxylic acids when heated with oxidising agents such as acidified potassium mangonate(VII). alcohol + oxygen from oxidising agent \(\underline{\text{heat}}\) carboxylic acid + water CH3CH2OH(\(\alpha\)q) + 2[O] \(\underline{\text{heat}}\) CH3COOH(\(\alpha\)q) + H2O(\(l\))

### Producing Ethanol by Fermentation

Ethanol can be produced from the fermentation of carbohydrates in fruits, vegetables or grain.

**Alcohol fermentation** is a process in which micro-organisms such as yeast act on carbohydrates such as glucose in the absence of oxygen to produce ethanol and carbon dioxide.

* Glucose solution is mixed with yeast and kept at 37oC and oxygen must not be present
* Carbon dioxide is produced during fermentation. A white precipitate is thus formed in the limewater.
* A dilute solution of ethanol (15% alcohol) is produced. A higher alcohol content is not produced as it causes the yeast to die and fermentation to stop.
* Ethanol can be extracted by fractional distillation. This allows for higher concentrations of alcoholic beverages or pure ethanol to be produced.
* If the temperature is raised beyond 37oC, the enzymes will be denatured and fermentation will stop.

**Oxidation by air**

* Wine or beer turns sour when left exposed to air in the open for a few days.
* CzHsOH(\(\alpha\)q) + O\({}_{2}\)(g)
* This is why fermentation of carbohydrates takes place only in the absence of oxygen.

### Uses of Ethanol

* In alcoholic drinks like wine, beer or liquor.
* As a solvent in paints, varnishes, deodorants, perfumes, colognes
* As a fuel in cars (often mixed with petrol). Ethanol is a better alternative fuel to petrol because it does not produce noxious gases. In Brazil, about 50% of the cars run on ethanol fuel, a biofuel which replaces petrol as a renewable source of energy.
* As a fuel for cooking

Physical Properties

Carboxylic acids are very soluble in water.

Their boiling points increase down the series as molecular size increases.

Chemical Properties

Carboxylic acids are weak acids as they ionise partially in water, i.e. the concentration of H+ ions is low (pH 5-6).

ethanoic acid \(\rightleftharpoons\) ethanoate ion + hydrogen ion

CH3COOH(\(\alpha\)q) \(\rightleftharpoons\) CH3COO-[\(\alpha\)q] + H+(\(\alpha\)q)

Producing Ethanoic Acid

1. **Oxidation with acidified potassium manganate(VII)**

Potassium manganate(VII) acts as an oxidising agent and is reduced. Its colour changes from purple to colourless. Ethanol acts as a reducing agent. It is oxidised to ethanoic acid. CHsCHzOH(aq) + 2[O] \(\frac{\text{heat}}{\text{CHsCOOH(aq)}}\) + HzO(I)
2. **Oxidation by atmospheric oxygen**

Certain bacteria in the air oxidise ethanol to ethanoic acid.

CHsCHzOH(aq) + O2(g) \(\frac{\text{bacteria}}{\text{CHsCOOH(aq)}}\) + HzO(I)

Thus, alcoholic drinks turn sour when left exposed to air for a few days.

## Chapter 4 Conclusion Polymers

Some polymers are made by reacting two different types of monomers.

Each of the monomers involved has a functional group at each end of the molecule.

When these monomers react, a polymer is produced.

A small molecule, such as water, is also produced as a by-product of the reaction.

**Condensation polymerisation** occurs when monomers combine to form a polymer, with the removal of a small molecule such as water.

### Nylon -- A Synthetic Polyamide

Nylon is the first synthetic fibre made by condensation polymerisation.

Its monomers are a dicarboxylic acid and a diamine.

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:133]

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:134]

### Uses of Man-made Fibres

Synthetic or man-made fibres are usually plastics which have been spun into threads.

Terylene and nylon are the best known examples of synthetic fibres.

Clothes made from these fibres are shrink-proof and creaseproof. They are also easier to wash and dry.

Examples of items made from nylon and Teylene are curtains, parachutes, fishing lines and sleeping bags.

### Plastics and Pollution Advantages of Using Plastics

Plastics are increasingly being used in place of natural materials such as wood, metal, cotton and leather.

Reasons:

Relatively cheap

Easily moulded into various shapes

Light, tough and waterproof

Durable

### Pollution Problems Caused by Plastics

\begin{tabular}{|p{142.3pt}|p{142.3pt}|} \hline Land Pollution & Plastics are non-biodegradable and are not decomposed by bacteria in the soil. \\ \cline{2-3}  & This leads to a build up of waste. \\ \hline Air Pollution & Plastics are flammable. \\ \cline{2-3}  & When plastics burn, fires can spread very quickly and poisonous gases are produced. \\ \hline Water pollution & Plastics thrown into the sea endanger marine animals. These animals mistaken plastics for food and choke on them. \\ \cline{2-3}  & Plastics can clog up rivers and drains, which may become breeding grounds for mosquitoes. \\ \hline \end{tabular}

### How Can We Properly Dispose of Plastics?

Many plastics produce poisonous gases upon incineration.

For example, PVC produces hydrogen chloride gas on burning.

Burning plastics will therefore cause air pollution.

The best way to deal with plastic objects is to reuse or recycle them.
