## Chapter 3: Forces

Forces - S.I. Unit = Newton (N)

Vector Diagrams: Parallelogram and tip-to-tail methods

\(A\)\(B\)\(A+B\)\(A+B\)\(B\)\(A+B\)

When asked to calculate a of arrow, given force F\({}_{1}\) on arrow and mass m, resultant force is not F\({}_{1}\) but F\({}_{1}\) -10m (See AHS Prelim 2017)

NEWTON's LAWS OF MOTION

First Law: every object will continue in its state of _rest or uniform motion in a straight line_

unless a resultant force acts on it.

Second Law: when a resultant force acts on an object of constant mass, the object will

accelerate in the direction of the resultant force. The product of the mass and acceleration of

the object gives the resultant force.

TL; DR

\(F=ma\)

Where F = resultant force (N), m = mass (kg), a = acceleration (m/s\({}^{2}\))

opposite force F\({}_{BA}\) on body A.

Friction: the contact force that _opposes or tends to oppose_ motion between surfaces in

contact.

Chapter 4: Mass, Weight and Density

Mass (kg): the amount of matter in a body.

Weight (N): the gravitational force, or gravity, acting on an object.

Gravitational field: a region in which a mass experiences a force due to gravitational attraction.

Gravitational field strength: the gravitational force acting per unit mass.

Relation between mass and weight:

\(W=mg\)

where W = weight (N),

M = mass (kg),

g = gravitational field strength (N/kg)

Chapter 5: Turning effect of Forces

Moments

Moment of a force (torque, Nm): the product of the force F and the perpendicular distance

from the pivot to the line of action of the force.

\(Moment\) of \(a\) force = \(F\)\(\times d\)

where F = force (N)

d = perpendicular distance from the pivot (m)

Moments are vector quantities, thus must specify both magnitude and direction.

Principle of Moments: when a body is in equilibrium, the sum of clockwise moments about a pivot is equal to the sum of anticlockwise moments about the same pivot.

Centre of Gravity: the point through which its whole weight seems to act.

Stability: the measure of an object's ability to return to its original position after it is slightly displaced.

Equilibrium: stable, unstable, neutral

Tightrope walking question: the long pole helps to lower the C.G. of the tightrope walker

below the rope

**Stuff to note**

1. **Moment of a force is always calculated by the force multiplied by the**

**perpendicular distance from the line of action of the force to the pivot**

Chapter 6: Energy, Work and Power

Energy (J): Energy is the capacity to do work.

Principle of Conservation of Energy: energy cannot be created or destroyed, but can be converted from one form to another. The total amount of energy in an isolated system is constant.

\begin{tabular}{c} Efficiency: \\ _useful energy output_ \\ _total energy input_ \\ \end{tabular} \(\times 100\%\)

Work done by a constant force on an object is the product of the force and the _distance moved_ by the object _in the direction of the force._

i.e.

\(W=F\times s\)

where W = work done by a constant force F (J)

F = constant force (N)

s = distance moved by the object in the direction of the force.

Work Done = Energy Transformed

\[\text{Kinetic Energy E}_{\text{k}}(\text{KE})\]

\[E_{k}=\text{ }\frac{1}{2}mv^{2}\]

where E\({}_{\text{k}}\) = kinetic energy (J)

m = mass of the body (kg)

v = speed of the body (m/s)\[E_{p}=mgh\]

where E\({}_{p}\) = gravitational potential energy (J)

m = mass of the body (kg)

g = gravitational field strength (m/s\({}^{2}\))

h = height (m)

Power: the rate of work done / energy conversion

\[P=\frac{W}{t}=\frac{E}{t}\]

where P = power (W)

W= work done (J)

E = energy converted (J)

t = time taken (s)

**Chapter 7: Pressure**

Pressure (N/m\({}^{2}\) or Pa): Pressure is defined as the force acting per unit area.

\[p=\frac{E}{A}\]

(_solids_)

where p = pressure (Pa)

F = force (N)

A = area (m\({}^{2}\))

\[p=hpg\]

(_liquids_)

where h = height (m)

p = density (kg/m\({}^{3}\))

g = gravitational field strength (N/kg)

\[F_{1}\times d_{1}=F_{2}\times d_{2}\]

**Stuff to note:**

1. **Test for vacuum in a simple mercury barometer: Tilt the tube until the closed end is below xx cm Hg. Absence of space will indicate that there is a vacuum**

## Chapter 8: Temperature

Temperature (K) refers to how hot or cold an object is.

Heat (J) refers to the amount of thermal energy that is being transferred from a hotter to a colder region.

Qualities of a Quality Thermometer

1. An easy-to-read-scale
2. Responsive to temperature changes
3. Sensitive to small temperature changes
4. Can measure a wide range of temperatures

Thermometric substances: have _physical properties_ that vary _continuously and linearly_ with temperature for the range of temperatures measured

Physical Property

Example of thermometer

The volume of a fixed mass of liquid

Mercury-in-glass thermometer, Alcohol thermometer

Electromotive force or electrical voltage

Thermocouple thermometer

Electrical resistance of a piece of metal

Resistance thermometer

Constructing a Thermometer

1. Choose an appropriate thermometric substance to be used in the thermometer
2. Choose two fixed points which are easily obtainable and reproducible. Usually, the temperature of pure melting ice at one atmosphere and the temperature of steam from boiling water at one atmosphere are used as fixed points
3. Record the values of the substance level in the thermometer stem at these fixed points
4. Divide the interval between these two fixed points in 100 equal parts
5. Each of these equal parts on the scale represents a measure of 1 \({}^{\circ}\)C

Ice point: The temperature of pure melting ice at one atmospheric pressure, 0\({}^{\circ}\)C

Steam point: The temperature of steam from boiling water at one atmospheric pressure, 100\({}^{\circ}\)C

Calibrating thermometers - Precautions

1. Ice point: Use crushed ice to ensure good contact between the bulb and ice, use afunnel to allow melted ice to flow away so that the thermometer only measures the temperature of the melting ice.
2. Steam point: Use a manometer to check if the pressure inside the apparatus is the same as the atmospheric pressure outside.
3. If the pressure is not equal, adjust the flame accordingly

Calculating temperature (Celsius scale) GENERAL EQUATION =

\[\theta=\frac{X_{\theta}{}^{-}X_{\delta}}{X_{N}{}^{-}X_{\delta}}\times(T_{N}-T_{ \delta})+T_{\delta}\]

Where:

Theta = Unknown Temperature

X theta = Value of thermometric property at unknown temperature

X delta = Smaller value of thermometric property at given temperature

X N = Larger value of thermometric property at given temperature

T N = Higher temperature relating to X n

T delta = Lower Temperature relating to X delta

Essentially,

\[\theta=\frac{Change\text{ {in}}\text{ {TP}}\text{ {due}}\text{ {to}}\text{ {unknown}}}{Change\text{ {in}}\text{ {TP}}\text{ {due}}\text{ {to}}\text{ {known}}}\times(\text{{Difference of {2}}\text{ {known}}\text{ {temp}}})+\text{{Lower}}\text{ {known}}\text{ {Temp}}\]

e.g. if melting point resistance = 700, boiling point resistance = 850, unknown resistance = 750,

\[\theta=\frac{750-700}{850-700}\times(100)+0\]

* Only applicable when given temperatures are 0\({}^{\text{o}}\)C and 100\({}^{\text{o}}\)C
* Change (100) according to range of temperatures measured

Stuff to note

1. **Bubbles only appear at the source of heating and rise to the top during boiling**

## Chapter 9: Kinetic Model of Matter

Kinetic model of matter states that the tiny particles that make up matter are always in continuous random motion.

Brownian Motion: a phenomenon that provides evidence for the continuous and random motion of tiny particles.

1. Examples: The random motion of pollen grains in water and smoke particles in air.
2. Smoke cells: 1. Light: To allow smoke particles to reflect light and be seen as bright specks 2. Choice of smoke particles: Smoke particles are large enough to be visible, yet light enough to be affected by air particles
3. Drawing of Brownian Motion 1. Alter the length and direction of the lines 2. Must have at least 5 lines 3. Add arrows

Gas Pressure question: How is pressure produced by gases in containers?

Gas pressure in a container is produced by the collision of gas particles with _the walls of the container_. When a gas particle hits a container wall, it _exerts a force_ on the wall. Since pressure is the force per unit area, pressure is produced. Gas pressure is defined as the _average_ force per collision between gas particles and the container's walls.

Relationship between pressure, volume and temperature

\[V\propto T\text{ at constant pressure}\]

At higher temperatures, gas particles have higher _kinetic_ energies. If volume is constant, the **frequency of collisions**, and hence, pressure will increase. In order for the pressure to remain constant, the **distance between the walls of the container** must _increase_ so that the **average time between each collision** is increased. Therefore, at constant pressure, the volume of a gas increases with increasing temperature.

\[p\propto\frac{1}{P}\text{ at constant temperature}\]

When volume is increased, the distance between the walls of the container is _increased_.

This causes the average time between each collision of the gas particles to _increase_, and the frequency of collisions to _decrease_. Therefore, at constant temperature, the pressure of a gas _decreases_ with increasing volume.

\[p\propto T\text{ at constant volume}\]When temperature increases, the gas particles have greater _kinetic_ energies and move faster. They collide with the walls of the container more frequently and with _greater_ average force. This causes the pressure in the container to _increase_. Therefore, at constant volume, the pressure of a gas _increases_ with increasing temperature.

Ideal Gas Law

\(P_{1}v_{1}=p_{2}v_{2}\)

* Where \(p_{1}\) and \(p_{2}\) are the initial and final pressures respectively, and \(v_{1}\) and \(v_{2}\) are the initial and final volumes respectively
* Derived from the relationship between pressure and volume

Chapter 10: Transfer of Thermal Energy

Thermal energy always flows from a region of higher temperature to a region of lower temperature. Net flow of thermal energy occurs only when there is a difference in temperature.

Conduction: the transfer of thermal energy by molecular vibration through a medium _without any flow of the medium_, i.e. solids

1. Particles, when heated, **gain kinetic energy** and **vibrate vigorously about their fixed positions**. They **collide with neighbouring particles, making them vibrate more vigorously**. The neighbouring regions of the object (rod) becomes hot. Eventually, the **particles at the other end of the rod** are also set into vigorous vibration.
2. Free electron diffusion (metals only): The free electrons at the heated end **absorb thermal energy**, and hence gain **kinetic energy**. The free electrons that gain kinetic energy **move at greater speeds**, and move to the **cooler regions of the rod**. As these electrons move, they **collide with the atoms in the cooler parts of the rod**, making them **vibrate more vigorously**. Thermal energy is transferred via the **motion of the free electrons**. The cooler end of the rod becomes hot.
3. Speed: Solid > Liquid > Gas
4. Distance between particles is inversely proportionate with the frequency of collisions

Convection: the transfer of thermal energy by means of _convection currents_ in a fluid, due to a difference in density, i.e. liquids and gases.

1. Involves the bulk movement of the fluid that carries the thermal energy.
2. When the flask is heated, the water molecules at the bottom of the flask gain **thermal energy through conduction**, and thus **speed up and expand**, hence **decreasing in density**. As these molecules are _less dense than the surrounding water above_,they **rise**. As the upper region of the water is **more dense, it sinks to displace the hot water molecules**. Hence a convection current is set up, and thermal energy is transferred throughout the water.
* Hence heating elements should be placed at the bottom of containers

Radiation: the transfer of thermal energy in the form of electromagnetic waves such as infrared radiation without the aid of a medium, i.e. in vacuum.

Thermal energy from infrared radiation is called radiant heat. All objects emit radiant heat.

Factors affecting radiation:

Colour and texture of the surface: Dull and black better emitters/absorbers of radiant heat

Surface temperature: The higher the surface temperature in comparison with the surroundings, the higher the rate of emission.

Surface area: Objects with larger surface area emit/absorb at a higher rate than objects with smaller surface areas

**Stuff to note**

1. **Conduction occurs in air as well. Conduction only does not occur in vacuum.**
2. **Design of a vacuum flask:**

- Plastic stopper: Conduction, Convection, evaporation

- Trapped air: Conduction

- Vacuum: Conduction and Convection

- Silvered surfaces: Radiation

- Cork: Conduction

## Chapter 11: Thermal Properties of Matter

Internal Energy: The sum of molecular kinetic and potential energies of the particles of a substance

Heat capacity (C): the amount of thermal energy required to raise the temperature of a substance by 1K or 1\({}^{\circ}\)C

\[C=\ \frac{Q}{\Delta\theta}\ or\ Q=C\Delta\theta\ or\ C=mc\]

where Q = thermal energy (J)

\[\Delta\theta\] = change in temperature (K / \({}^{\circ}\)C)

S.I. unit = J/K or J \({}^{\circ}\)C

Specific Heat capacity (c): the amount of thermal energy required to raise the temperature of 1 kg of a substance by 1K or 1\({}^{\circ}\)C\[c=\frac{C}{m}\text{ and }Q=mc(\Delta\theta)=C(\Delta\theta)\]

where C = heat capacity (J/K or J/ \({}^{\circ}\)C)

Q = thermal energy required (J)

\(\Delta\theta\)= change in temperature (K / \({}^{\circ}\)C)

m = mass of substance (kg)

S.I. unit = J/kg/K or J/kg/ \({}^{\circ}\)C

Melting: Temperature remains constant as the thermal energy is absorbed to overcome the strong bonds between particles

1. Opposite: Solidification, temperature remains constant as there is no change in the kinetic energy of the molecules, as intermolecular bonds are formed during freezing and only the potential energy of the substance's molecules decreases.
2. Note this when drawing a melting curve

Boiling: Temperature remains constant as thermal energy is absorbed to break the intermolecular bonds between particles, provide energy for particles to push back on the surrounding atmosphere and increase the average spacing between particles

Latent Heat: Latent heat is the energy released or absorbed by a substance during a change of state, without a change in its temperature.

Latent Heat of fusion/vaporisation (L/L): the amount of thermal energy required to change a substance from solid state to liquid state/from liquid state to gaseous state without a change in temperature.

Specific Latent Heat of fusion/vaporisation (\(\left|l\right\rangle\)): the amount of thermal energy required to change 1 kg of a substance from solid state to liquid state/from liquid state to gaseous state without a change in temperature.

*For vaporization the change in state is liquid \(\approx\) gas

\[L_{f}=l_{f}\times m\text{ or }L_{v}=l_{v}\times m\]

where m = mass of substance (kg)

S.I. unit = J/kg

Boiling: Accuracy at particular temperature

Occurs at any temperature

Relatively fast

Relatively slow

Takes place throughout the liquid

Takes place only at liquid surface

Temperature remains constant

Temperature usually decreases

Bubbles are formed in the liquid

NaCl Ne bubbles formed in the liquid

External thermal energy source needed

External energy source not neededTEST PB (Test the prefectorial board; put them in hot water xD): Temperature for occurrence, Energy, Speed, Temperature Variation, Place, Bubbles

Process of evaporation:

Molecules of a liquid have different kinetic energies. When they constantly bombard each other, energy is being transferred. At the surface of the liquid, the most energetic molecules can overcome the downward attractive forces of other liquid molecules and the atmospheric pressure to escape from the surface of the liquid, hence evaporation occurs.

1. Cooling: (continued from above) As the less energetic molecules are left behind, the average kinetic energy of the molecules in the liquid decreases, hence the temperature of the liquid decreases.

Factors affecting rate of evaporation:

Surrounding temperature

Humidity

Pressure

Surface area

Heat capacity of liquid

Movement of surrounding air

**Stuff to note:**

1. During heating / cooling, only the kinetic energy of the molecules change.

2. During evaporation / solidification, only the potential energy of the molecules change.

## Chapter 12: Light

Normal: the perpendicular to the reflecting surface at the point of incidence

Laws of Reflection:

First Law: the incident ray, reflected ray and the normal at the point of incidence all lie in the same place.

Second law: the angle of incidence \(i\) is equal to the angle of reflection \(r\) (i.e. _i = r_)

Plane mirror images are:

Same size as object & laterally inverted & upright & virtual

Distance from the mirror = Distance of object from mirror

Refraction: the bending of light as light passes from one optical medium to another.

Laws of refraction:

Law 1: the incident ray, the normal and the refracted ray all lie in the same plane.

Law 2: for 2 given media, the ratio of sine of \(i\) to sine of \(r\) is a constant. (Snell's Law)

\[\frac{sin\,i}{sin\,r}=constant\]

Refractive index (n): the ratio of the speed of light in vacuum to the speed of light in medium

\[n=\frac{c}{v}\ =\ \frac{sin\,i}{sin\,r}\]

where c = speed of light in vacuum (3.0\(\times 10^{8}ms^{-1}\))

v = speed of light in the medium

Critical Angle (c): the angle of incidence in an optically denser medium for which the angle of refraction in the optically less dense medium is 90\({}^{\circ}\).

\[sin\ c=\ \frac{1}{n}\]

Total Internal Reflection: the complete reflection of a light ray inside an optically denser medium at its boundary with an optically less dense medium.

2 conditions for total internal reflection:

1. The light ray in an optically denser medium strikes its boundary with an optically less dense medium
2. The angle of incidence is greater than the critical angle of the optically denser medium

Converging lenses

Focal Length (f): the distance between the optical centre and the focal point F.

Focal point F: the point at which all rays parallel to the principal axis converge after refraction.

Principal axis: the horizontal line perpendicular to the vertical plane of the lines passing through the optical centre.

Cases for images and lenses: If object distance (u) is...

\begin{tabular}{|c|l|c|l|} \hline Object Distance (u) & Type of Image & Image & Uses \\  & & distance (v) & \\ \hline \(\infty\) & Inverted, real, diminished & \(v=f\) & Object lens of a \\  & & & telescope \\ \hline \(u>2f\) & Inverted, real, diminished & \(f<v<2f\) & Camera \\ \hline \(u=2f\) & Inverted, real, same size & \(v=2f\) & Photocopier \\ \hline \(f<u<2f\) & Inverted, real, magnified & \(v>2f\) & Projector \\ \hline \(u=f\) & Upright, virtual, magnified & \(\infty\) & Spotlights \\ \hline \(u<f\) & Upright, virtual, magnified & Behind obj & Magnifying glass \\ \hline \end{tabular}

Tips and things to remember for light:

Refraction and reflection both occur below the critical angle.

Focal point \(\neq\) focal length

Ray diagrams: Virtual images / rays drawn must always be dotted

For \(\frac{sin\,i}{sin\,r}=n,\ sin\ i\) must always be bigger than \(sin\ r\)

**Stuff to note:**

1. Light entering or leaving a medium that has a different optical density with an

angle of incidence of \(0^{\circ}\) will continue in a straight line
2. The angle of incidence / reflection / refraction is always measured from the

normal of the medium to the ray
3. Blocking part of a convex lens which is forming an image will only decrease

the intensity of the image formed. This is because light rays travel in all directions.
4. For converging lenses, all virtual images are magnified

## Chapter 13: Waves

Wave: Made up of periodic motion.

\[v=f\lambda\]

where \(\lambda\): wavelength (m)

S.I. unit: \(ms^{-1}\)

The wavefront is always \(90^{\circ}\) to the direction the wave moves (wave's propagation)

### 1 The study of static electric charges

Charging by Friction

1. Before rubbing, the glass rod and the piece of silk are **electrically neutral**. As different materials have different **affinities** (extent of attraction) for electrons, _when_ the glass rod and the piece of silk are rubbed together, the atoms at their surfaces are **disturbed** and some _electrons_ from the atoms at the surface of the glass rod are _transferred_ to the piece of silk. As the glass rod **loses electrons**, it becomes **positively charged**. As the piece of silk **gains electrons**, it becomes **negatively charged**.
2. Prelim Points: Some **free electrons are transferred** from the rod to the cloth. Thereare now more positive charges than negative charges on the rod.

Induction

1. The process of charging a conductor without contact between the _conductor_ and the _charging body_
2. Charging 2 metal spheres 1. Place the **2 conductors side by side** such that they are **touching each other** 2. Bring a negatively charged rod **near but not touching** sphere A. This causes the **electrons** in both metal spheres to be repelled to the _far end of sphere B_. Now, **sphere A has excess positive charges** which **sphere B has excess negative charges**. 3. While holding the **charged rod in place**, pull _sphere B away from sphere A_ 4. Remove the charged rod - Spheres A and B have an _equal number of opposite charges_ - Note the inverse case if a positively charged rod is use
3. Charging a single Conductor

- Bring a **positively charged glass rod** near a metal conductor. The **free electrons** in the metal are **drawn towards** the positively charged glass rod. **Without removing** the glass rod, **earth the positively-charged end** of the metal conductor by **touching** it to **neutralise** the positive charges. With the glass rod still in place, **remove your hand** to stop the earthing and remove the **glass rod**. The negative charges will **redistribute** throughout the conductor to make it negatively charged

Discharging an Insulator

* Heat: Intense heat from flame ionises air particles which neutralise the excess charges on the insulator to discharge it
* Humidity: Water molecules in the air are conductors hence excess charges will be transferred to the water molecules on the surface of the insulator

Discharging a conductor: Earthing

1. Providing a path for excess electrons to flow
2. Providing a path for electrons to flow to the conductor

Electric Field

1. An electric field is a region in which an electric charge experiences an electric force - An electric force is attractive or repulsive force that electric charges exert on one another
2. The direction of an electric field is the direction of that force that would act on a small positive charge - Lines always go from the positive to the negative - Lines are curved due to the resultant force exerted by the attraction and repulsion of both charges
3. Strength of the field is indicated by how close the field lines are to one another 4. Drawing: - Repulsion: 7 x 2 lines - 2 Plates: Top line must be curved - Single Charge: 8 lines - See pg 312 and 313

Hazards of electrostatics

1. Lightning: Friction between water molecules and air particles charges the thundercloud. The negative charges which tend to gather at the bottom of the cloud repels electrons on the Earth's surfaces and renders it positively charged by induction. With enough charges the air particles near the cloud will be ionised, forming a conducting path for electrons in the cloud to reach Earth, which will form lightning. - Tends to strike tall or isolated structures, therefore lightning rods are needed to provide a conducting path for the electrons to flow from the air to the earth to protect tall buildings - A current of 0.1 A is sufficient to kill a person 2. Electrostatic discharge: Charges accumulated due to friction between roads and vehicles' wheels may cause sparks and ignite flammable items when suddenly discharged - Older trucks have a metal chain at the rear that hangs close to the ground to provide an earthing path for excess charges - Antistatic packaging for electronics

Applications of electrostatics

1. Photocopiers
2. Electrostatic precipitators
3. Spray painting: Charges paint by friction, paint **spreads out** due to repulsion, attracted to earth object, hence forming a **uniform coat of paint**

**Stuff to note**

1. **Positive charges can never move**

**Important Qns**

* Workbook: 7, 8, 11c
* TYS: P1 7, 10, P2 3b,

## Chapter 17: Current Electricity

Ampere: One ampere is the current produced when one coulomb of charge passes a point in the circuit in 1 second.

Electron flow is from the negative terminal of the battery to the positive terminal.

Conventional current is from the positive terminal of the battery to the negative terminal.

Electric Current: The rate of flow of electric charge

\[I=\frac{Q}{t}\]

* Where I is the current in amperes (A), Q is the charge in coulombs (C) and t is the time taken (s)

Ammeter: Measure the strength of a current

* Should be connected in series

Note the circuit symbols (p324 or below in chapter 18)

* May be tasked to draw circuit diagrams
* List of Tricky Symbols
* D.C./A.C. Power Supply
* Rheostat
* Fuse
* Transformer
* Thermistor

Short Circuit

Electromotive force: The electromotive force of an electrical energy source is the _work done by the source in driving a unit charge around a complete circuit_.

Potential difference (V): The potential difference across a component in an electric circuit is the _work done to drive a unit charge through the component._

\[V=\frac{W}{Q}\]

* Where V is the electromotive force of the source (V), W is the work done by the source (J) and Q is the amount of charge (C)
* Measured by a Voltmeter
* Connected in parallel

Resistance (\(\Omega\)): The resistance of a component is the ratio of the _potential difference V_ across it to the current \(I\) flowing through it.

\[R=\frac{V}{I}\]

* Where R = Resistance (\(\Omega\)), V = Potential Difference and I = Current (A)
* Therefore, R is directly proportional to V (p.d.) and inversely proportional to I

Ohm's Law: Ohm's law states that the current passing through a metallic conductor is _directly proportional_ to the potential difference across it, provided that physical conditions (such as temperature) remains constant.

I/V graph: The conductor obeys Ohm's law IF and only IF

1. The gradient of the graph is constant

- Inverse of the resistance: As gradient increases, R decreases

2. The graph has an origin of 0 NOT LEGAL \(\rightarrow\)

Non-ohmic Conductors

* As the current increases, devices generate more heat and thus their temperatures and the resistance of the device increases.
* Example: Filament lamp
* Diode: Allows current to flow in the forward direction only

Ammeter: Connected in series (negligible resistance)

Voltmeter: Connected in parallel (infinite resistance)

Why?

- Ammeter is connected in series to measure the amount of current flowing in the circuit. It has a negligible resistance so as to not increase the total amount of resistance in the circuit and cause the current reading to be inaccurate.

- Voltmeter is connected in parallel to measure the potential difference across a component. It has infinite resistance such that it does not draw any current, which may otherwise affect the value of the voltage.

Resistance of a wire: \(R=\frac{\rho l}{A}\) where \(\rho\) is the resistivity (=/= resistance in \(\Omega\)m) of the wire,

in \(\Omega\)m, \(l\) is the length of the wire (m), and A is the cross-sectional area of the wire (m\({}^{2}\)).

Rewriting, we get:

\(\rho=\frac{RA}{l}\)

* Note that A is usually m\({}^{2}\) therefore resistance increases at an increasing rate as the radius of the wire increases
* Low Resistivity = Good conductor

- Can be used for wires

- High Resistivity = Poor Conductor

- Heating Coils in electric kettles (Nichrome): Produces a lot of thermal energy when a current passes through

- Light Bulbs (Tungsten)

For constant current, \(R\propto V\)

For constant voltage, \(R\propto\frac{1}{l}\)Stuff to note

1. Filament lamp is a non-ohmic conductor
2. LEDs produce more light than filament lamps

Chapter 18: D.C. Circuits

Series circuits

1. Current at every point is the same
2. Sum of the potential difference across each component is equal to the p.d. across the whole circuit and the electromotive force of the battery

- Resistors of larger resistance will have a higher p.d. than resistors of smaller resistance
3. The effective resistance \(R\) is the sum of all the resistances

Parallel circuits

1. Sum of current in individual branches is equal to to the main current flowing in or out of the parallel branches

- Note WE18.2: Always check which currents contribute to the armeter reading

- Branch with the least resistance has the largest current flowing through it

2. Potential difference across separate parallel branches and the total potential difference is the same

- Potential Difference = e.m.f of electrical energy source

3. Reciprocal of the effective resistances of resistors in parallel 1/R = the sum of the reciprocal of the individual resistors

- Use \(x^{-1}=1/x\) to aid in calculations

- Adding additional resistors to a circuit decreases the effective resistance due to the increased current.

- This increases the energy requirement on the energy source (see water flow model)

Advantages of parallel circuits:

1. The **current flowing through each bulb** in a parallel circuit is larger than the current flowing through each bulb in a series circuit, hence bulbs connected in parallel **glow more brightly** than bulbs connected in series
2. When a bulb in a parallel circuit **blows**, the other bulbs in the circuit will **still work** as each **parallel branch forms a complete circuit.**

Disadvantage of parallel circuits

* The **current flowing through the electrical energy source** in a parallel circuit is higher than the current flowing through that of a series circuit. Hence the electrical energy source of a parallel circuit **provides more power** and is thus **depleted more quickly** than in a series circuit.

Dangerous Conditions for Electricity

* Insulating materials can become worn with time, and expose the conducting wires inside
- The exposed conducting wires can cause electric shocks if touched * Overheating of Cables: May cause fires
- Overloaded power sockets: With many appliances in a power socket in parallel, an unusually large current flows
- Inappropriate wires: Wires which are thin have a higher resistance and produce more heat. Hence when used with appliances which require a lot of power, the wires may overheat * Damp environments
- Water provides a conducting path with a small resistance for the current to flow
- Leads to burns, uncoordinated contraction of heart muscles and death
- Human body can only withstand an alternating current of 0.05 A Circuit Breakers: Switch off energy supply when large current flows

* Can be reset
* Fault can be located easily without having to inspect each plug

Fuses: Prevents excessive current flow

* Must be reset after tripping
* Thin short wire in a casing (\(\cdot\cdot\) low resistance) blows when a large current passes through to open the circuit
* Considerations for fuses to avoid confusion - Slightly higher rated value than normal current - Connected to live wire - Mains should be switched off before replacing
* Common fuse ratings: 1A, 3A, 5A, 7A, 10A, 13A Switches
* Should be fitted to live wire - If on Neutral: Live wire causes metal casing to have high voltage as it is still connected to the metal casing, hence a person will get an electric shock if he touches the casing and a large current flows through him to the earth - If on Live: Casing will be disconnected from live wire, no current flows through person Common Household Plug ( Britain type only because British occupation! )

* Interesting video on plugs: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEFP1OKKz](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEFP1OKKz) Q

Earthing

1. Earth wire is usually connected to the casing of appliances
2. Without earthing, 1. Electrical fault results in live wire touching metal casing 2. Metal casing is at high potential (open circuit) 3. When a person touches the casing, circuit is complete and a large current flows through the person - person gets an electric shock
3. With earthing, 1. Electrical fault results in live wire touching metal casing 2. Large current **flows to the ground** through earth wire which has _much lower resistance than the person_, hence person does not suffer electric shock 3. Large current exceeds rated value of fuse, hence fuse blows
* Fuse protects the circuit from overheating while Earthing protects users from electric shocks

When an electrical fault results in the _live wire touching the metal casing_, the large current _flows to the ground through the earth wire_ which has a _lower resistance_ than the person. The large current causes a _short circuit_ and _exceeds the rated value of the fuse_, causing it to _blow_, hence _opening the circuit and cutting off the electricity supply to the appliance_.

Double Insulation: Two-Pin Plugs

* No Earth wire
* Two Levels of Insulation

- Electric Cables _insulated from_ internal components of appliance

- Internal Components _insulated from_ external casing (e.g. plastic casing)

## Chapter 21: Electromagnetism

Electromagnetic Effects of a Current

1. A current-carrying conductor produces a magnetic field around it

2. **Right hand grip rule**

1. Grip the wire such that your thumb points in the direction which the current is flowing in
2. Direction in which fingers curl indicate whether the magnetic field is clockwise or anticlockwise
3. Note: A cross indicates current flowing away, a dot indicates current flowing to you (Think of an arrow from a bow)
4. Not to be confused with the RHG rule for solenoids where the thumb points to the north pole and the other fingers indicate the flow of the current
5. Strength of magnetic field increases when the current increases
6. The direction of the magnetic field of a current-carrying wire is reversed when the direction of the current is reversed
7. Drawing: Magnetic Field lines should be further apart with increasing distance from the wire These will come in handy:

1. Right-hand grip rule (Chapter 20): Fingers = current, Thumb = North a. To find out the poles of the solenoid: Acts like a bar magnet - Can be strengthened with a soft iron core, increased current/number of turns per unit length - Used in circuit breakers: Large Current \(\rightarrow\) Strong Electromagnet \(\rightarrow\) Attracts - Latch \(\rightarrow\) Releases Spring \(\rightarrow\) Breaks Circuit
2. Right-hand grip rule #2: Fingers = Magnetic Field, Thumb = Direction of Current a. To find out the direction of a magnetic field around a wire - Conventional Current is used: Positive to Negative
3. Fleming's Left hand rule a. To find out the force when a wire is held between 2 poles of a magnet Forces on a current-carrying conductor

1. When a current-carrying conductor is placed in a magnetic field, the conductor experiences a force. This effect on the conductor is called the _motor effect_.

**Fleming's left-hand rule**

1. Finding out the direction of the force acting on a current-carrying conductor 1. Thumb \(\rightarrow\) force 2. Index finger \(\rightarrow\) direction of magnetic field (From North to South 3. Second finger \(\rightarrow\) direction of current - Can deduce the direction of one given the other 2 - Due to the combination of magnetic fields of current-carrying conductor and two magnetic poles that pushes it with a force from the stronger magnetic field to the weaker magnetic field (p413)

Forces between 2 parallel current-carrying conductors

1. Conductors carrying currents in opposite direction repel
2. Conductors carrying currents in the same direction attract

Forces acting on a beam of charged particles in a magnetic field (protons or electrons)

1. Direction of current flow is the direction of conventional current, i.e. direction of positive particle flow / opposite to direction of negative particle flow

- Point index finger in direction of magnetic field, point middle finger in the direction where the particle would move if undisturbed, resultant movement is between the thumb and middle finger 2. Reversing the direction of the current flow changes the direction of the force acting on the particle
3. Reversing the direction of the magnetic field also changes the direction of the force acting on the particle
4. Opposite Charge = reversed direction
5. Direction of movement of the particle is the resultant of the directions of the force, the current and the magnetic field

Current-Carrying Coil Conundrums

* Increasing Turning Effect

- Increasing number of turns per unit length

- Increasing current in coil

D.C. Motor

* Two Carbon Brushes at XY: Low friction + Path for current
* Addition of split-ring commutator: Hole cuts off the current when coil is vertical, momentum carries coil forward and allows for another cycle

- Reverses the direction of the current every half a revolution to allow it to continue spinning in one direction

- Force is greatest when horizontal

* Rheostat: Set at maximum R before switch is closed and decreased over time to prevent overheating due to large current through small R wire.

* Increasing Turning Effect

- Increasing number of turns per unit length

- Increasing current in coil

- Adding a soft iron core

Stuff to note

1. If a particle is stationary, there are no forces acting on it at all. Hence, the particle will not move

Chapter 22: Electromagnetic Induction

Electromagnetic induction

1. The process through which an induced e.m.f. is produced in a conductor due to a changing magnetic field.

- Note: It is e.m.f. which is induced which hence drives a current.

- E.m.f: Work done by the source in driving a unit charge around a closed circuit

Faraday's law 1. Faraday's law of electromagnetic induction states that the **magnitude** of the **induced e.m.f.** in a circuit in **directly proportional** to the **rate of change of magnetic flux** (quantity of magnetic field) in the circuit.
2. Deals with magnitude, or strength, of the induced current

Ways to increase the magnitude of the induced e.m.f.

1. Increase number of turns per unit length of coil - Increases the number of magnetic field lines linked to the coil (magnetic flux linkage)
2. Increase the speed at which the magnet moves in / out of the coil.
3. Increase the strength of the magnet

Lenz's law

1. Lenz's law states that the **direction of the induced e.m.f.**, and hence the **induced current** in a closed circuit, is always such that its **magnetic effect opposes the motion** or change producing it. - If magnet enters solenoid south-first, south pole produced by current at end of entry to push away - If magnet leaves solenoid south-first, north pole produced by current at end of entry to pull back - Current acts in opposite direction of movement of magnet - Galvanometer needle will be deflected in the direction of current
2. Deals with the direction of the induced current

Key terms: Magnetic flux; rate of change of magnetic flux; magnetic flux linkage, Number of turns per unit length of coil

\(\bullet\) IMPT: P429

Alternating Current generator (a.c.)

1. Transforms mechanical energy into electrical energy
2. Works on principle of electromagnetic induction
3. Current reverses direction, hence "alternating current"
4. Parallel Axel = Rate of Change of magnetic flux is maximum
5. When the coil **rotates**, it **cuts across** the **magnetic field lines** and there is a **change in magnetic flux** in the coil. By **Faraday's Law**, this change **induces an e.m.f.** in the coil 

### Slip rings

1. Ensure that the induced current in the coil is transferred to the external circuit

Ways to increase the magnitude of induced e.m.f

1. Increase number of turns per unit length of the coil
2. Increasing the strength of the permanent magnets
3. Increasing the frequency of rotations of the coil (results in (c))
4. Winding the coil around a soft iron core to strengthen the magnetic flux linking the coil

Effects of doing the above

1. Induced e.m.f is increased

- Double number of turns per unit length of coil \(\rightarrow\)

Double the e.m.f

- Twice the strength \(\rightarrow\) double the e.m.f

2. Induced e.m.f is increased, period is decreased

- Twice the speed \(\rightarrow\) double the e.m.f (rate of change of magnetic flux)

- Twice the speed \(\rightarrow\) half the period (less time to make one full rotation)

Fixed coil generator

1. An a.c. generator where magnets rotate instead of coils rotate
2. Bike dynamo

Practically, fixed coil generators are favoured because

1. Does not require **carbon brushes**, which **wear out** easily and need to be **replaced**

**frequently**
2. Less likely to **break down from overheating** - Does not use slip rings and carbon brushes, eroded connection increases resistance which may cause overheating
3. More **compact**

Key terms: Slip rings, carbon brushes

Transformers

1. Symbol \(\rightarrow\)
2. A device that can change a high alternating voltage (at low current) to a low alternating voltage (at high current), or vice versa

- Used in electrical power transmission from power stations to households

- Used to regulate voltages for the proper operation of electrical appliances.

- A transformer is based on electromagnetic induction. An a.c. in the primary coil induces a varying magnetic field in the iron core which creates an alternating induced e.m.f in the secondary coil which generates an induced current

Features of a transformer

1. Laminated soft iron core

- Comprises of thin sheets of soft iron

- Insulated by sheets of lacquer

- Soft iron is used because it is easily magnetised

- Ensure better magnetic flux linkage

- Lamination reduces heat loss

Equation of power transmission \(\rightarrow\)

Types of transformers

\[\frac{V_{S}}{V_{p}}=\frac{N_{S}}{N_{p}}=\frac{I_{p}}{I_{S}}\]

1. Step up

- Increases voltage, decreases current

- Number of turns in the secondary coil is greater than that of the primary coil

2. Step down

- Decreases voltage, increases current

- Number of turns in the primary coil is greater than that of the secondary coil

\(V_{S}=\frac{N_{S}}{N_{p}}\times V_{P}\)

\(I_{P}=\frac{N_{S}}{N_{p}}\times I_{S}\)

Power transmission \(\rightarrow\)\(V_{p}I_{p}=V_{S}I_{S}\)1. Ideal transformer \(\rightarrow\) no power loss Equation to calculate efficiency - (outputpower / inputpower ) x 100% - \(\frac{V_{S}I_{S}}{V_{P}I_{P}}\) - However IRL: Resistance of Coils, Leakage of Magnetic Flux in Transformers, hysteresis (?)

Why are transformers used to transmit electricity over distances?

1. Loss of power due to **Joule Heating** (P = I\({}^{2}\)R)

To reduce loss of power, decrease current through step-up

Cannot increase diameter of cables due to increased construction costs

Stepped-down at homes for suitable voltages

Calculating loss of power: Find current, use I\({}^{2}\)R where R is of cables to find P
