## 6.2. **Polarisation**

When polymerisation occurs, small molecules known as **monomers** are linked together to form a **long-chain**

**macromolecule known as a polymer**.

**Polymerisation** is defined as the process where **small molecules (monomers) chemically combined together to form one large chainlike molecule (polymer).

## ADDITION POLYMERISATION

### ADDITION POLYMERISATION

Addition polymerisation is the process where **small molecules** (**monomers**) are linked together to form a polymer without any other by-products.

### APPLICATION

Poly(ethene) is the most **widely used plastic** because of its resistance to many different chemicals, and that it is not soluble in water at room temperature.

It is present in plastic products such as plastic bags, plastic bottles and used as water pipes.

### POLYETHENE

Poly(ethene) is an example of a polymer that is formed using addition polymerisation of ethene monomers.

During addition polymerisation, the **C=C double bond is broken**.

The equation for the addition polymerisation of ethene monomers to form poly(ethene) is:

The **repeating unit** of poly(ethene) is:

## Conclusion

POLYMERISATION

### Condensation polymerisation

Condensation polymerisation is the process where two different monomers are chemically combined to form a polymer. The process produces by-products such as water.

The repeat unit of nylon contains the **-CONH- amide linkage**. The polymer is made up of monomers linked by the amide linkages, hence it's called **polyamide**.
