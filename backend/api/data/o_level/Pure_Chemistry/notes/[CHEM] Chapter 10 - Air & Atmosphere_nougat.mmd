## Composition of Air

Air is a mixture of gases that largely made up of nitrogen and oxygen.

The other gases are noble gases (like argon), carbon dioxide and water vapour.

### Percentage:

Nitrogen - 78%

Oxygen - 21%

Carbon Dioxide - 0.03%

## 6 Common Air Pollutants

## 5 SULEUR DIOXIDE

Sulfur is a **type of impurity present in fossil fuels.** When fossil fuels undergo combustion, sulfur would react with the oxygen in air to form sulfur dioxide.

Large volumes of sulfur dioxide can also produced during **volcano eruptions.**

**Harmful.Effects:**

- Causes respiratory difficulties

- Causes formation of acid rain, which results in erosion of buildings and environmental damages.

Under very high temperatures, nitrogen and oxygen in air reacts to form nitrogen monoxide (NO).

Nitrogen monoxide can continue reacting with oxygen in air to form nitrogen dioxide (NO).

NO is usually produced in **vehicle engines**, power stations, factories and incinerators which are high temperature environments.

NO is can also be produced during **thunderstorms and forest fires** as well.

**Harmaful Effects:**

- Causes irritation to our lungs

- Causes the formation of acid rain, which results in erosion of buildings and environmental damages

- NO may react to produce harmful ozone in the presence of sunlight

## 11 **Methane**

Methane is a type of **greenhouse gas** that traps heat on Earth.

Produced due to activities such as **cattle farming** (rearing of cows, sheeps etc...).

These livestock produce methane in their digestive systems and release it in their farts and burps.

Methane is also produced **from bacteria decay process**.

The increase in the amount of methane produced causes

**enhanced greenhouse effect** which in turn traps more heat

on Earth, resulting in **global warming**.

**Harmful Effects:**

- Huge and increasing amounts of methane produced leads to

**enhanced greenhouse effect** which causes **global warming**UNBUUNT HYDROCARBONS

Due to **incomplete combustion of fuels** when there is a lack of oxygen, unburt hydrocarbons are formed.

UNBUUNT HYDROCARBONS

Due to **incomplete combustion of fuels** when there is a lack of oxygen, unburt hydrocarbons are formed.

Harmful Effects:

- Can be cancerous

- Reacts in the presence of sunlight and other pollutants to form harmful ozone 
Ozone (Ozone) exists as a colourless gas.

Ozone, in the presence **UV radiation or sunlight**, is formed from **photochemical smoke**, which contains a mixture of gases such as **nitrogen dioxide**, **carbon monoxide and volatile organic compounds (VOCs).

Ozone that is present at ground level would irritate the eyes, nose, throat and is an air pollutant.

Harmful Effects:

- irritation to the eyes, nose and throat

- Causes respiratory problems such as asthma 

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:13]

**Acid rain** is formed when acidic oxides (e.g. **sulfur dioxide and nitrogen dioxide**) react with oxygen and water in the atmosphere to form acid.

25O2 (g) + O2 (g) + 2H,O (l) + 2H,SO2 (aq) 4NO2 (g) + O2 (g) + 2H,O (l) + 4iNO3 (aq)

**Harmful Effects:**

Add rain causes **corrosion to buildings** and **status** that are built using materials containing limestone, cement or **metallic structures** as acids react with metal.

Add rain disrupts the pH balance of the soil, making it **acidic**, making it less optimal for the growth of plants and trees.

Add rain decreases the **pH of lake water**, causing it to be unsuitable for aquatic organisms to survive.

**Ways to reduce harmful effects of acid rain:**

**Refrain from using fuels containing sulfur**, like coal or oil.

**Cleansing the air** that contains pollutants like **sulfur dioxide and nitrogen dioxide** before releasing it.

Neutralise the high acidity in soils by using **slaked lime** (calcium hydroxide) or **m limestone** (calcium carbonate).

## 6 Global Warming

Global warming refers to the Earth heating up and experiencing an increase in temperature.

**Methane, carbon dioxide** and other greenhouse gases **trap heat** from the Sun, resulting in the increase in temperature on Earth, which leads to global warming.

### 6.1 Harmful Effects:

**Melting of polar ice caps** causes rising sea levels which causes flooding of low-lying lands.

**Higher rainfall in equatorial climates,** while countries in the Northern hemisphere (United States and Europe) are likely to experience more **roughs.**

**Food shortages will happen as certain crops will struggle to grow in such bad conditions.

### 6.2 How to reduce the effect of global warming:

**Switch from using non-renewable sources of energy (e.g. fossil fuels) to using renewable sources of energy (e.g. wind and solar energy)**

**Switch to electric or hydrogen powered vehicles**

## Reducing Hardware

Through the use of **catalytic converters**, pollutants are converted into non-polluting gases.

Hot exhaust gases from vehicle engines that contains **carbon monoxide, oxides of nitrogen and unburnt hydrocarbons** are passed through the platinum catalyst in a catalytic converter.

Carbon monoxide would be exitised to form carbon dioxide:

\[\textbf{2}\textbf{CO}\textbf{(g)}+\textbf{O}_{2}\textbf{(g)}\textbf{-}\textbf{2} \textbf{CO}_{2}\textbf{(g)}\]

Oxides of nitrogen would be reduced to nitrogen gas:

\[\textbf{2}\textbf{NO}\textbf{(g)}+\textbf{2}\textbf{CO}\textbf{(g)}-\textbf{N}_{ \textbf{n}}\textbf{(g)}+\textbf{2}\textbf{CO}_{2}\textbf{(g)}\]

(_relax reaction_)

Unburnt hydrocarbons like hexane would be oxidised to form carbon dioxide and water:

\[\textbf{2}\textbf{c}_{\textbf{H}_{1}\textbf{(g)}}+\textbf{19}\textbf{O}_{2} \textbf{(g)}\textbf{-}\textbf{12}\textbf{CO}_{2}\textbf{(g)}+\textbf{14}\textbf{ H}_{2}\textbf{O}\textbf{(g)}\]
