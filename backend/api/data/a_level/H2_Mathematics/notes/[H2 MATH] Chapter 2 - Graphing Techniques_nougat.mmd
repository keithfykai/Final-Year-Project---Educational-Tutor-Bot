### Modulus Functions

To obtain graph of \(\mathbf{y}=|f(\mathbf{x})|\) from \(y=f(x):\)

1. Keep part of graph above the x-axis
2. Flip up (or reflect in the x-axis) the part of the graph below the x-axis

To obtain graph of \(\mathbf{y}=\mathbf{f}(|\mathbf{x}|)\) from \(y=f(x):\)

1. Keep part of the graph where \(x\geq 0\)
2. Reflect part from (1) in the y-axis so the graph is symmetrical about the y-axis
