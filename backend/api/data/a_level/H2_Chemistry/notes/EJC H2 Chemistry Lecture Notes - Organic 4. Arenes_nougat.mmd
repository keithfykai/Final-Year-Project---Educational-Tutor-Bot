## 3 Nomenclature of Benzene Derivatives

### Monosubstituted benzene derivatives

In many simple compounds, _benzene_ is the parent name and the substituent is simply indicated by a prefix added to the word _-benzene_. _E.g._

For other simple and common compounds, the substituent and the benzene ring taken together may form a commonly accepted parent name. _E.g._

### Polysubstituted benzene derivatives

When two substituents are present, their relative positions are indicated by the use of numbers (UUPAC) or historically, by the prefixes _ortho_-, _meta_-, and _para_- (abbreviated _o_-, _m_-, and _p_-).

For the dibromobenzenes we have

### **Phenyl group**

When the C\({}_{6}\)H\({}_{6}\)-- group is named as a substituent, it is called **a phenyl** group. The phenyl group is often abbreviated as C\({}_{6}\)H\({}_{6}\)-- or Ph--.

\begin{tabular}{c c}  & **phenylamine\({}^{*}\)** & **phenylethene** \\ (aminobenzene, aniline) & (ethehenylbenzene, styrene) \\ \end{tabular}

## 4 Physical Properties of Arenes

Arenes are **liquids or low melting point solids** with characteristic 'aromatic' odours. Their vapours are toxic and one should avoid inhaling them. Benzene is a colourless liquid (boiling point 80 \({}^{\circ}\)C) and continued inhalation of its vapour can induce anaemia and even leukaemia (_carcinogenic_). Methylbenzene is also a colourless liquid (higher boiling point 111 \({}^{\circ}\)C). Arenes are **insoluble in polar solvents** such as water, but **soluble in non-polar organic solvents** such as CC\(\lambda\). Both benzene and methylbenzene are useful solvents. Since the fumes of methylbenzene are considerably less toxic than those of benzene, it is preferable whenever possible, to use methylbenzene. Arenes are **immiscible** and **less dense** than (floats on) water. Generally organic compounds are less dense than water, except for halogenated organic compounds. Boiling points of arenes increase with increase in relative molecular mass due to increase in number of electrons and hence the polarizability of the electron cloud, thereby possessing stronger **instantaneous dipole-induced dipole forces of attraction** between molecules. (However, their melting point trend is _irregular_ as it depends on molecular _symmetry_, which affects the packing of the molecules in the lattice.) Arenes burn with a **smoky** and **luminous orange flame**, owing to their relatively high carbon content (_i.e._ high C:H ratio).

#### 5.2.4 Friedel-Crafts Acylation

Analogous to Friedel-Crafts Alkylation, in which the alkyl halide, RX, replaced by an acyl halide, RCOX.

Leads to the substitution of an aromatic H by an acyl group, \(-\)COR, resulting in an aromatic carbonyl compound.

The first step involves generation of the strong electrophile, in this case, the resonance-stabilised acylium ion:

### Catalytic Hydrogenation of Benzene

Alkenes add on H\({}_{2}\) over a Ni, Pd or Pt catalyst readily at room temperature. Benzene requires an _elevated_ temperature as the activation energy for destruction of the aromatic ring upon addition of H\({}_{2}\) is very high.

## 6 Effect of Substituents on Electrophilic Substitution

LO (m)apply the knowledge of positions of substitution in the electrophilic substitution reactions of mono-substituted arenes

A substituent, **G**, already present on the benzene ring determines

the **reactivity** (_i.e._ **how readily** the ring reacts compare to benzene), and

the **orientation** (_i.e._ the **position** in which the new group is introduced, relative to that substituent on the benzene ring)

toward electrophilic substitution reaction.

### Reactivity of Benzene Rings: Activating and Deactivating Substituents

Relative rates of nitration of substituted benzene compared to benzene:

Substituents that increases the _rate_ of electrophilic substitution, relative to a hydrogen atom (_i.e._ compared to benzene), are known as **activating groups**. _E.g._ -CH3 group.

Activating groups **donate** electron density to the benzene ring,

increasing the availability of the \(\pi\) electron cloud, and

stabilising the arenium intermediate by _dispersing_ the positive charge,

hence _lowering the activation energy_, rendering the benzene ring more susceptible toward electrophilic attack.

Substituents that _decreases the _rate_ of electrophilic substitution, relative to a hydrogen atom (_i.e._ compared to benzene), are known as **deactivating groups**. _E.g._ -CI_ and -CO2CH3.

Decactivating groups **withdraw** electron density away from the benzene ring,

decreasing the availability of the \(\pi\) electron cloud, and

destabilising the arenium intermediate by _intensifying_ the positive charge

hence _raising the activation energy_, rendering the benzene ring less susceptible toward electrophilic attack.

### Orientation of Incoming Electrophile

Electrophilic substitution can occur at the _ortho_- (2-/6-), _meta_- (3-/5-) or _para_-(4-) positions of the benzene ring. The inductive and/or mesomeric effects of the _existing substituent_ (G) determine which position the new substituent (E) is introduced on the ring.

Substituents are classified as

1. 2-/4-directing activators;
2. 2-/4-directing deactivators; or
3. 3-directing deactivators.

(Available in SS8, pg 17, of the _Data Booklet_)

Electron-donating +_I_ and/or +_M_ groups (**EDG**), which make the ring more nucleophilic than benzene, will stabilise the intermediate arenium ion most effectively when new substituents are introduced at the 2- or 4- positions. For the 3-isomer, the positive charge in the arenium intermediate does not reside adjacent to the EDG in any of the resonance structures.

**Halogen groups** are unique in that they direct 2-/4- and yet they deactivate the benzene ring. The _+M_ effect of _C,_ Br and I is weak because these atoms are all larger than carbon, hence the orbital containing the lone pairs do not overlap well with the 2p orbital of carbon. Nonetheless, the weak _+M_ effect does ensure that the halogens are 2-/4- directing but the strong _-I_ effect (which deactivates the ring) is more significant in terms of the reactivity of halogenoarenes.

**Electron-withdrawing _-I_-_M_ groups (**EWG**), which make the ring less nucleophilic than benzene, will deactivate the 3- position less than the 2-/4- positions. The arenium ion produced from attack at the 3- position will be the most stable because this does not reside adjacent to the EWG in any of the resonance structures.

**With activating groups, we would expect the ratio of attack at the 2- and 4- positions to be 2:1 (as there are two 2- positions to one 4- position on the ring). However, attack at the 2- position is often less than this because of **steric hindrance**. The size of the group on the benzene ring strongly influences the substitution at the adjacent 2- position. In general, the larger the size of the group on the ring, the greater the proportion of 4- substitution.

## 7 Reactions of Methylbenzene (Alkylbenzenes)

### _Introduction_

* Methylbenzene (or other alkylbenzene) can be prepared by Friedel-Crafts Alkylation of benzene.

* Methylbenzene has two portions: an _aromatic_ portion (benzene ring), and an _aliphatic_ portion (the alkyl group), which gives methylbenzene its chemical properties. The two portions also changes the properties of the other portion.

#### 7.3.2 Side-Chain Oxidation

While both alkanes and benzene themselves do not react with oxidising agents such as KMnO\({}_{4}\), the alkyl chain on a benzene ring is susceptible to oxidation.

Side-chain oxidation of methylbenzene produces benzoic acid (a white solid).

### A Little Bit of History......

In ordinary conversation, the word "aromatic" conjures pleasant associations--the odour of freshly prepared coffee, a warm cinnamon bun, a freshly cut pine tree. Similar associations occurred in the early history of organic chemistry when pleasantly aromatic compounds were isolated from natural oils produced by plants. Once the structures of these materials were elucidated, many were found to possess a unique, highly unsaturated, six-carbon structural unit also found in benzene.

This special ring became known as the benzene ring. Aromatic compounds that contain a benzene ring are now part of a much larger family of compounds classified as aromatic, not because of their smell (since many of the molecules that contain them have no odour - for example, aspirin), but because they have special electronic features.

The following are a few examples of aromatic compounds, including benzene itself.

The study of the class of compounds that organic chemists call aromatic compounds began with the discovery in 1825 of a new hydrocarbon by the English chemist Michael Faraday (Royal Institution). Faraday called this new hydrocarbon "bicarburet of hydrogen"; we now call it benzene. Faraday isolated benzene from a compressed illuminating gas that had been made by pyrolsing whale oil. In 1834 the German chemist Ellhardt Mitscherlich (University of Berlin) synthesised benzene by heating benzoic acid with calcium oxide. Using vapour density measurements, Mitscherlich further showed that benzene has the molecular formula C6H6.

The molecular formula itself was surprising. Benzene has only as many hydrogen atoms as it has carbon atoms. Most compounds that were known then had a far greater proportion of hydrogen atoms, usually twice as many. Benzene, having the formula of C6H6, should be a highly unsaturated compound because it has a degree of unsaturation equal to 4. Eventually, chemists began to recognise that benzene was a member of a new class of organic compounds with unusual and interesting properties as it does not show the behaviour expected of a highly unsaturated compound.
During the latter part of the nineteenth century the Kekule-Couper-Butlerov theory of valence was systematically applied to all known organic compounds. One result of this effort was the placing of organic compounds in either of two broad categories; compounds were classified as being either **aliphatic** or **aromatic**. To be classified as aliphatic meant then that the chemical behaviour of a compound was "fatlike." (Now it means that the compound reacts like an alkane, an alkene, an alkyne, or one of their derivatives.) To be classified as aromatic meant then that the compound had a low hydrogen-to-carbon ratio and that it was "fragrant." Most of the early aromatic compounds were obtained from balsams, resins, or essential oils.

Friedrich August Kekule, a German chemist, was the first to recognise that these early aromatic compounds all contain a six-carbon unit and that they retain this six-carbon unit through most chemical transformations and degradations. Benzene was eventually recognised as being the parent compound of this new series. It was not until the development of quantum mechanics in the 1920s, however, that a reasonably clear understanding of its structure emerged.

In 1890, at the 25th anniversary of the benzene structure discovery, Kekule reminisced about his major accomplishments and told of two dreams that he had at key moments of his work. In his first dream, in 1865, he saw atoms dance around and link to one another. He awakened and immediately began to sketch what he saw in his dream.

Later, Kekule had another dream, in which he saw atoms dance around, then form themselves into strings, moving about in a snake-like fashion. This vision continued until the snake of atoms formed itself into an image of a snake eating its own tail. This dream gave Kekule the idea of the cyclic structure of benzene.

**Kekule Structure**

In 1865, Friedrich August Kelule proposed the first definite structure for benzene, a structure that is still used today (although it's given a meaning different from the meaning Kekule gave it).

A problem soon arose with the Kekule structure, however. The Kekule structure predicts that there should be two different 1,2-dibromobenzenes, but only one has ever been found.

Kekule proposed that the two forms of benzene (and of benzene derivatives) are in a state of rapid equilibrium that prevents isolation of the separate compounds:

We now know that this proposal was **incorrect** and that _no such equilibrium exists!_
