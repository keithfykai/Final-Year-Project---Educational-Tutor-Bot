## 3 Physical Properties

### Melting and Boiling points

* **Most halogenalkanes are polar** and thus have intermolecular **permanent dipole-permanent dipole attractions**, which are stronger than the intermolecular instantaneous dipole-induced dipole attractions for alkanes. Hence, we expect the melting/boiling point of halogenalkanes to be higher than that of alkanes with similar number of electrons.
* For halogenalkanes with the same halogen atom, both the melting point and boiling point: > increase with increasing chain length due to the **increasing number of electrons, which makes the electron cloud is more polarisable** and hence **stronger instantaneous dipole-induced dipole attractions between molecules.** > decrease with increasing degree of branching due to the **decreasing surface area of contact between the molecule** and hence **weaker instantaneous dipole-induced dipole attractions between molecules.**
* For halogenalkanes of the same chain length but with different halogen atoms, the **melting and boiling point was found to increase with increasing number of electrons, which makes the electron cloud is more polarisable** (see table below), thus leading to **stronger instantaneous dipole-induced dipole attractions between molecules**. This implies that the different strength of the intermolecular instantaneous dipole-induced dipole attractions is the more significant factor than differences in polarity of the molecule, if any.

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|} \hline compound & fluoroethane & chloroethane & bromoethane & iodoethane \\ \hline structural formula & H & C & H & H \\ \hline boiling point (\({}^{\circ}\)C) & -37.1 & 12.3 & 38.3 & 71.0 \\ \hline \end{tabular}

### Solubility

Halogenoalkanes/halogenoarenes although polar, have **poor solubility in water**, especially for molecules with higher molecular weight. This is due to **energetic considerations**.

The halogenoalkane forms permanent dipole-permanent dipole interactions with water molecules. The energy that is released from this interaction is insufficient to overcome the strong hydrogen bonding between water molecules.

However, halogenoalkanes/halogenoarenes are **soluble in non-polar solvents**. This is due to the presence of **non-polar alkyl groups or benzene rings** of the respective compounds and thus can form **instantaneous dipole-induced dipole attractions of similar strength with the non-polar solvent molecules**.

### Density

**Halogenoalkanes/halogenoarenes are generally denser than both water and the alkane/arene which they are derived from. This is due to the presence of the halogen atom, which increases the molecular mass.**

**Self Check 6A**

**The boiling points of some organic compounds are as shown.**

**A** **CH3CH2CH2CH3** **butane** **-1**

**B** **CH3CH2CH2CH2CH2_I **-chlorobutane** **78**

**C** **CH3CH2CH2CH2Br** **1-bromobutane** **101**

**D** **CH3CH2CH2CH2I **1-iodobutane** **130**

**Explain each of the following.**

**(a)** **The boiling point of compound B is higher than that of A.**

**(b)** **The boiling point increases in the order of B < C < D.**

**At the end of this section, you should know that:**

1. Halogenoalkanes and halogenoarenes are polar compounds, with intermolecular permanent dipole-permanent dipole interactions between molecules.**

2. Halogenoalkanes and halogenoarenes are insoluble in water but are soluble in organic solvents.

3. Halogenoalkanes and halogenoarenes are generally denser than water and the hydrocarbon that they were derived from.

## 4 Preparation of Halogenoalkanes and Halogenoarenes

### Free Radical Substitution of Alkanes

[0.5cm] **Reagents and conditions:**\(\text{C}\text{L}_{\text{2}}\)(g) or \(\text{Br}_{\text{2}}\)(_l_); uv light

**Observations:**\(\text{*}\)Greenish yellow \(\text{C}\text{L}_{\text{2}}\)(g) or reddish-brown \(\text{Br}_{\text{2}}\)(_l_) decolourises

Free radical substitution of alkanes is **seldom used** due to the formation of a **mixture of products** (_e.g._ if we use propane and \(\text{Br}_{\text{2}}\)(_l_), we may get 1-bromopropane, 2-bromopropane, 1,1-dibromopropane, _etc._ due to **random and/or multiple substitution of H atoms**)

### Electrophilic Addition of Alkenes

#### 4.2.1 Electrophilic Addition of hydrogen halides

[0.5cm] **Reagents and conditions:**\(\text{HC}\text{l}\text{(g)}\), \(\text{H}\text{Br}\)(g) or \(\text{H}\text{(g)}\); room temperature

Recall from 'Alkenes' topic that **Markovnikov's rule** can be used to predict the major product in the addition of HX to an asymmetrical alkene.

#### 4.2.2 Electrophilic Addition of halogen

[0.5cm] **Reagents and conditions:**\(\text{C}\text{L}_{\text{2}}\) in \(\text{CC}\text{L}_{\text{4}}\) or \(\text{Br}_{\text{2}}\) in \(\text{CC}\text{L}_{\text{4}}\); room temperature, in the dark

**Observation:**\(\text{*}\)Pale yellow \(\text{C}\text{L}_{\text{2}}\) or orange-red \(\text{Br}_{\text{2}}\) decolourises

[0.5cm] \(\text{*}\)The decolourisation of greenish yellow \(\text{C}\text{L}_{\text{2}}\) gas or pale yellow \(\text{C}\text{L}_{\text{2}}\) in \(\text{CC}\text{L}_{\text{4}}\) may be difficult to observe depending on the intensity of the colour. The use of \(\text{C}\text{L}_{\text{2}}\) for distinguishing tests is thus not advisable.

### Nucleophilic Substitution of Alcohols (not in H1 syllabus)

(will revisit in Hydroxy Compounds)

**Reagents and Conditions:**

**Observations:** For reaction with PC_b_ and SOC_l_, white fumes of HC_l_ are produced, which turn damp blue litmus paper red.

This is useful as a **chemical test for alcohols**.

However, carboxylic acids give the same observations.

1. HBr(g) may be prepared by reacting solid NaBr with concentrated H\({}_{2}\)SO\({}_{4}\) and heat, while HI(g) may be prepared by reacting solid NaI with concentrated H\({}_{3}\)PO\({}_{4}\) and heat.
2. PBf\({}_{3}\) or PI\({}_{3}\), is prepared _in situ_ by heating red phosphorus with liquid bromine or solid iodine respectively. 2P + 3X\({}_{2}\) \(\rightarrow\) 2PX\({}_{3}\) X = Br, I
3. **When using PC_b_, PC_b_ and SOC_l_, ensure that there is absence of water. These compounds hydrolyse in water. PC_b_(_l_) + 3H\({}_{2}\)O(_l_) + 3HC_l_(aq) PC_b_(s) + 4H\({}_{2}\)O(_l_) + 7H\({}_{3}\)PO\({}_{4}\)(aq) + 5HC_l_(aq) SOC_l_(_l_) + H\({}_{2}\)O(_l_) \(\rightarrow\) SO\({}_{2}\)(g) + 2HC_l_(g)
4. The **advantage of using SOC_l_** is that the two by-products are both gases (SO\({}_{2}\) and HC_l_), so they separate themselves from the RC_l_ product easily.

## 5 Nucleophilic Substitution Reactions of Halogenoalkanes

* Halogenoalkanes are often polar molecules with the C atom of the C-X bond having a partial positive charge. This imparts **electrophilic** character to this C atom.
* **Nucleophilic substitution reactions** occur when a **nucleophile (electron pair donor, Lewis Base)** is attracted to the **electron-deficient C atom (Lewis Acid)**, which is susceptible to attack** by these nucleophiles, where **the nucleophile substitutes the halogen atom**.
* The overall reaction for nucleophilic substitution can be represented as:
* Nucleophilic substitution reactions can proceed by either a **one-step mechanism (S\({}_{\text{n}}\)2)*
* or a **two-step mechanism (S\({}_{\text{n}}\)1)**.
* Primary halogenoalkanes **generally*
* undergo the **S\({}_{\text{n}}\)2 mechanism**.
* Tertiary halogenoalkanes **generally*
* undergo the **S\({}_{\text{n}}\)1 mechanism**.
* Secondary halogenoalkanes may proceed via **both mechanisms**.

### Mechanism of S\({}_{\text{N}}\)2 reactions (not in H1 syllabus)

* The OH-\({}^{\prime}\)nucleophile, attacks the \({}^{\text{s+}}\)C atom (\(\alpha\)-carbon) from the side opposite to that of the C-Br bond in what is known as the **rear-side attack**.
* The OH-\({}^{\prime}\) donates one of its lone pair to the carbon atom, **a bond begins to form between O of OH-\({}^{\prime}\) and the C of the halogenoalkane**.
* Simultaneously, the **C-Br bond is weakened and begins to break (heterolytic cleavage)**. Both the bonding electrons in the C-Br bond are gradually transferred to the Br atom to form Br-, the leaving group.
* The reaction takes place in a single step _via_ a transition state.
* If **other anionic nucleophiles** are used (_e.g._**CN-, X-, etc.**), the **mechanism will be similar to what is shown above**.
* If the halogenoalkane has a **chiral \(\alpha\)-carbon**, due to the **rear-side attack**, there will be an **inversion of configuration** at the \(\alpha\)-carbon.
* The rate equation for this mechanism is **rate = \(K\)[RX][nucleophile]**, where the rate is dependent on the concentration of both RX and the nucleophile. The mechanism is known as **S\({}_{\text{N}}\)2** (substitution, nucleophilic, bimolecular), because **two species are involved in the rate-determining step**.

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:13]

### Mechanism of S\({}_{n}\)1 reactions (not in H1 syllabus)

Step 1: C-X bond breaks to form the carbocation and halide ion

**curly arrow from lone pair of nucleophilic to C atom of carbocation**

**The first step**, which is the **slow step**, involves the **heterolytic cleavage** of the **C-Br bond** in the halogenoalkane to form a **carbocation intermediate** and \(\mathrm{Br}^{-}\) ion.

**The electron-donating alkyl groups** help to **stabilise the carbocation**.

**The second step**, which is the **fast step**, involves **bond formation between nucleophile (OH\({}^{+}\)) and cationic carbon of the highly reactive carbocation to form the product.

**As the **carbonocation intermediate** is **trigonal planar with respect to the cationic carbon**, the **nucleophile can attack from either face (top and bottom) with equal probability**.

**If nucleophilic attack of the electron-deficient carbon gives rise to a chiral carbon, a racemic mixture** is formed as both enantiomers would be formed in equimolar amounts.

**The derived rate equation for this mechanism is rate = _k[RX]_, where the rate is dependent on the concentration of RX only.

The mechanism is known as S\({}_{n}\)1 (Substitution, Nucleophilic, unimolecular), because only one species is involved in the rate-determining step.

* The energy profile diagram for the S\({}_{N}\)1 mechanism is as shown.
* If **neutral nucleotides** such as NH\({}_{3}\) and amines (_e.g._ RNH\({}_{2}\), R\({}_{2}\)NH, R\({}_{3}\)N) are used, the mechanism (for NH\({}_{3}\)) will be as shown (amines behave similarly). The protonated amine product formed undergoes deprotonation by a base such as X\({}^{-}\).
* **Stability of carbocation increases as additional electron-donating alkyl groups are bonded to the positively charged carbon. Hence, generally tertiary halogenoalkanes undergo S\({}_{N}\)1 reactions more readily and primary halogenoalkanes do not and the rate of the nucleophilic substitution reaction decreases from 3\({}^{\circ}\) > 2\({}^{\circ}\) > 1\({}^{\circ}\) > methyl halogenoalkane.**

## Chapter 2 Example 2A

The rate equation for the alkaline hydrolysis of the halogenalkane RBr is

rate = \(k\) [RBr] [OH-]

Which of the following statements is inconsistent with this observation?

* The reaction is first order with respect to RBr.
* The reaction is second order overall.
* The final step in the reaction is the attack of OH- on R\({}^{*}\).
* The rate-determining step is bimolecular.
* OH- attacks RBr before the R-Br bond is broken.

## 3 Self Check 2A

Bromoethane, CH\({}_{3}\)CH\({}_{2}\)Br, reacts with methanol under suitable conditions to form CH\({}_{3}\)CH\({}_{2}\)OCH\({}_{3}\). Name and describe the mechanism for the reaction, given that the attacking nucleophilic is CH\({}_{3}\)O-. [This reaction produces an organic compound containing an ether functional group.]

### Reactivity of Halogenoalkanes by Nucleophilic Substitution Reactions

The reactivity of halogenoalkanes by nucleophilic substitution reactions depends on the **ease of cleavage of the C-X bond**. The stronger the bond, the harder it is for the bond to break.

\begin{tabular}{c c} \hline \hline bond & bond energy / kJ mol\({}^{-1}\) \\ \hline C-F & 485 \\ C-Cl & 340 \\ C-Br & 280 \\ C-I & 240 \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular} As the **size of the halogens become larger from F to I**, the **valence orbital used for bonding** becomes larger and more diffuse**. Thus, the **orbital overlap** between the halogen and carbon atoms **becomes less effective**.

**Bond strength: C-I < C-Br < C-Cl < C-F** and thus, the **reactivity of halogenoalkanes: iodoalkanes > promoalkanes > chloroalkanes > fluoroalkanes**.

Due to the **very strong C-F bond**, **fluoroalkanes are generally unreactive** and do not undergo nucleophilic substitution.

\begin{tabular}{c c} \hline \hline LO (a) & recall the chemistry of halogenoalkanes as exemplified by: \\ (iii) the following nucleophilic substitution reactions of bromoethane: hydrolysis; formation of nitriles; formation of primary amines by reaction with ammonia \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}

### Formation of Alcohols

\begin{tabular}{c c} \hline \hline H & OH \\ H-C-C-H + OH & heat \\ H & H \\ H & H \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}
**Reagents and conditions: NaOH(aq) or KOH(aq); heat**

This reaction is also known as **alkaline hydrolysis**, which is carried out in an aqueous medium.

### Formation of Nitriles (not in H1 syllabus)

**Reagents and conditions:** KCN or NaCN, ethanol; heat

* Nitriles are a class of useful reagents in organic synthesis. Through the formation of a nitrile, the **carbon chain length is extended by one C atom** (step-up reaction). Formation of carbon-carbon bonds is an important part of organic synthesis.
* The nitrile product can be hydrolys to form carboxylic acids or carboxylate salts or be **reduced to form amines**.

#### 5.6.1 Hydrolysis and Reduction of Nitriles (not in H1 syllabus)

**Acidic Hydrolysis:** R-**C=N** + 2H2O + H+ \(\rightarrow\) R-**CO2H** + NH4*

**Reagents and Conditions:** HC(aq) or H2SO4(aq), heat

_Basic Hydrolysis:_ R-**C=N** + H2O + OH- \(\rightarrow\) R-**CO2+ NH3

### Formation of Amines (not in H1 syllabus)

* A primary amine (RNH\({}_{2}\)) is formed when a halogenoalkane reacts with ammonia. Excess ammonia is used to ensure high yield of the primary amine.
* If equivalent amounts of the halogenoalkane and ammonia are used, the yield of the amine will be lowered. This is because the hydrogen halide formed in this reaction will undergo an acid-base reaction with the ammonia and prevent it from reacting with the halogenoalkane. i.e. HX + NH\({}_{3}\rightarrow\) NH\({}_{4}\)X (ammonium salt)
* If excess halogenoalkane is used, secondary and tertiary amines (R\({}_{2}\)NH and R\({}_{3}\)N respectively), or even quaternary ammonium salts (R\({}_{4}\)N\({}^{+}\)X) may be obtained as the primary amine formed are stronger nucleophiles than ammonia and further nucleophilic substitution reaction may occur.
* Equations for their formation are as shown. 

_E.g._ Reaction between **excess CH\({}_{3}\)Br** and NH\({}_{3}\) (favours further nucleophilic substitution):

## Chapter 4 At the end of this section, you should know that:

1. The C-X bond is polar, with the carbon atom having a partial positive charge and the halogen atom having a partial negative charge, due to the halogen having a higher electronegativity than carbon.
2. The rate equation for an Sn2 nucleophilic substitution is **rate = K[RX][Nu]** and usually occurs for primary halogenalkanes.
3. For an Sn2 nucleophilic substitution, if the \(\alpha\)-carbon is a chiral carbon, then it will undergo a chirality inversion when it undergoes an Sn2 nucleophilic substitution.
4. The rate equation for an Sn1 nucleophilic substitution is **rate = K[RX]** and usually occurs for tertiary halogenalkanes.
5. For an Sn1 nucleophilic substitution, if the \(\alpha\)-carbon is a chiral carbon, then a racemic mixture will be formed.
6. Halogenoalkanes react with NaOH(aq) when heated to form alcohols.
7. Halogenoalkanes react with ethanolic KCN when heated to form nitriles.
8. Halogenoalkanes react with excess ethanolic NH3 when heated in a sealed tube to form primary amines.

## 6 Elimination Reaction of Halogenoalkanes

Halogenoalkanes take part in elimination reactions, producing alkenes.

* In an ethanolic solution, **OH- acts as a base and deprotonates the H atom on the C atom adjacent to the C-X bond**. The C-X bond breaks simultaneously, and the alkene is formed.
* More than one alkene product can be formed when the carbon bonded to the halogen has **more than one adjacent carbon with hydrogen atom(s) bonded to it**, resulting in **constitutional (structural) and/or _cis-trans_ isomers**.

* Using **alcoholic solvents favours elimination**, but it is **possible to have nucleophilic substitution occurring as well**. This is because the oxygen atom in alcohols is also nucleophilic in nature. **(why7)** e.g.** (ch2Br ) **CH2Br **heat (ch2OH + )**CH2OCH2CH3
* Like the reactivity of halogenoalkanes in nucleophilic substitution reactions, the **ease of elimination reaction is dependent on the strength of the C-X bond**.

### 4.1 At the end of this section, you should know that:

1. Halogenoalkanes react with KOH in ethanol, when heated, to produce alkenes.
2. The weaker the C-X bond, the faster the rate of elimination.

## 7 Reactions of Halogenoarenes (not in H1 syllabus)

\begin{tabular}{|p{346.9pt} p{346.9pt}|} LO (e) & explain the unreactivity of chlorobenzene compared to halogenoalkanes towards nucleophilic substitution, in terms of the delocalisation of the lone pair of electrons on the halogen and steric hindrance \\ \end{tabular}

In general, **halogenoarenes do not undergo nucleophilic substitution**.

The lack of reactivity towards nucleophilic attack is due to the following reasons.

1) _The C-X bond is strengthened and not easily cleaved._ (Main reason)

\begin{tabular}{|p{346.9pt}|} \hline \hline
**Note:** \\ (1) For halogenoarenes, **the halogen atom is bonded to the benzene ring**. Hence, compounds such as (\(\begin{array}{c}\\ \end{array}\)) \\ CH\({}_{2}\)Br & are NOT considered as halogenoarenes. \\ (2) Similarly, **halogenoalkenes (_e.g._ CH\({}_{2}\)=CHC_I_) generally do not undergo nucleophilic substitution as the _p orbital of the halogen atom can overlap sideway with the \(\pi\) bond of the alkene_. As a result, the **lone pair of electrons on the halogen atom can delocalise into the C=C bond, thereby imparting partial double bond characteristic to the C-X bond**. \\ (2) _Steric hindrance (w.r.t._ S\({}_{N}\)2 mechanism)_ \\ \(\bullet\) The benzene ring sterically hinders S\({}_{N}\)2 reactions. The C in the C-X bond is not accessible to nucleophilic attack via rear side attack._ \\ \end{tabular}

### Electrophilic Substitution of the Benzene Ring of Halogenoarenes

Halogenoarenes undergo electrophilic substitution of benzene ring just like any other arenes.

\begin{tabular}{|p{346.9pt}|} \hline \hline
**\(\bullet\) Electrophilic substitution of halogenoarenes happens at a lower rate because the halogen atoms are very electronegative, thus decreasing electron density of the \(\pi\) electron cloud of the benzene ring (halogen deactivates the benzene ring).** \\ \end{tabular}

* Electrophilic attacks are 2-, 4-directed as this leads to the formation of a more stable arenium intermediate.

## 8 Distinguishing Test for Halogen Derivatives

\begin{tabular}{|l l l|} \hline LO (f) & suggest characteristic reactions to differentiate between: \\  & (i) & different halogenalkanes \\  & (ii) & halogenalkanes and halogenarenes \\  & e.g. hydrolysis, followed by testing of the halide ions \\ \hline \end{tabular}

To determine if an organic compound is a halogenalkane (or has a halide functional group), the following chemical tests can be done:

\begin{tabular}{|l l|} \hline
**Reagents and conditions:** & \\ Step 1: & **NaOH(aq) and heat** & \\  & [Nucleophilic substitution reaction occurs] & \\  & RX + OH\({}^{-}\)\(\rightarrow\) ROH + X\({}^{-}\) & \\ Step 2: & **Excess dilute HNO3** after cooling (Cannot use HC_I_ and H\({}_{2}\)SO\({}_{4}\)) (WHY?) & \\  & [Removal of excess OH\({}^{-}\)(aq) to prevent the formation of Ag\({}_{2}\)O] & \\ Step 3: & **AgNO3**(aq) and observe for **any precipitation** that may occur \\  & [Detect the presence of X\({}^{-}\)] & \\  & Ag\({}^{+}\)(aq) + X\({}^{-}\)(aq) \(\rightarrow\) AgX(s) & \\ \hline \end{tabular}

### OR

**Reagents and conditions:** AgNO\({}_{3}\) in ethanol, heat

The expected observations are given in the table below.

\begin{tabular}{|l l l l|} \hline \hline halogenalkane & R-C_I_ & R-Br & R-I \\ \hline observations & white precipitate & cream precipitate & yellow precipitate \\  & AgCl(s) formed & AgBr(s) formed & AgI(s) formed \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}

This chemical test can also be used to **distinguish between halogenalkanes and halogenoarenes**. Since **halogenoarenes do not undergo nucleophilic substitution in general, there will be no formation of precipitate**.

_Note:_

\begin{tabular}{|l l l|} \hline \hline \multicolumn{1}{|c|}{The **rate** at which the silver halide precipitate is formed is determined by the **strength**} \\ \multicolumn{1}{|c|}{of the C-X bond**}. & \\ \multicolumn{1}{|c|}{Precipitate is **not** formed when **halogenoarenes and fluoroalkanes** undergo the \\ \multicolumn{1}{|c|}{chemical test described above due to the **strong C-X bond**}. & \\ \hline \end{tabular}

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:27]

As shown by equations (1) and (2), the **formation of C**_I_**- is detrimental as it destroys** \(\mathbf{Q}_{3}\) **as well as removes O, one of the re actants for O**\({}_{3}\) **formation. Notice that C**_I_**- is regenerated and thus plays the role of catalyst.**

Ozone in the stratosphere is constantly regenerated through natural processes, such as lightning strikes. However, for many decades, the rate of destruction of stratospheric ozone has outpaced the rate at which it is regenerated.

#### Measures to reduce ozone depletion

* Reduce use of CFCs in industrial and household applications. Since 1987, at the Montreal Protocol, the use of CFCs has been increasingly banned many countries.
* **Substitutes such as hydrocarbons, hydrofluorocarbons or fluorocarbons have been used in place of CFCs. For example, most aerosols use propane or butane as propellant instead of CFCs. However, alkanes are highly flammable and pose a fire hazard.**

### Use of Fluoroalkanes in Daily Life and their Associated Problems

Fluoroalkanes also play significant roles in today's society. One of the most common uses of fluoroalkanes is in the use of the polymer polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) in non-stick frying pans.

**polytetrafluoroethylene**

This polymer is made from tetrafluoroethene and is commonly used in non-stick frying pans because the strength of the C**-F **bonds prevent reaction with the other substances that are placed on it when cooking. This makes these pans easy to clean after cooking with them.**

**However, while PTFE is generally considered safe for use in cooking as long as the pan is not overheated, there exists a class of compounds known as polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) that pose severe health hazards to mankind. One such PFAS is perfluorooctanesulfonic acid.**

**Due to the strength of the C**-F **bonds, PFAS are extremely difficult to break down. Indeed, PFAS have been dubbed as 'forever chemicals' in certain countries. Due to leaching of these compounds from industries that use them, as well as workers being directly exposed to them, PFAS enter the ecosystem and eventually accumulate in our bodies. High levels of PFAS in the human body have been known to cause thyroid disease and certain types of cancer.**

**3A:**

**(a) More energy is required to overcome the stronger permanent dipole-permanent dipole interactions between polar 1-chlorobutane molecules of B as compared to the weaker instantaneous dipole-induced dipole interactions between the non-polar butane molecules of A.**

**(b) From B to D, the number of electrons increases, electron cloud is more polarisable and results in the increasing strength of the instantaneous dipole-induced dipole interactions between molecules. Thus, there is an increase in energy needed to overcome the increasingly stronger intermolecular forces of attractions. Hence, boiling point increases from B to D.**
