**INTRODUCTION**

**In this Chapter, we shall see how the equation of a straight line can be expressed in three forms, namely vector, parametric and cartesian. We will then use the equation to solve problems involving distances, intersections and angles.**

**1.1 Vector Equation of a Straight Line**

**Recall that to find the equation of a straight line in the** \(x-y\) **plane, we need a point which lies on the line and the gradient of the line.**

**Similarly, to obtain a vector equation of a line, we need**

**(i)**: **then equation vector of a point on the line and**

**(ii)**: **Vector parallel to the line (known as the direction vector).**

**A straight line** \(I\) **which passes through a fixed point** \(A\) **with position vector** \(a\) **and is parallel to**

**a vector** \(b\) **has vector equation given by**

**where** \(r\) **represents the position vector of any point on the line** \(I\)**.**

**Each real value of** \(\lambda\) **gives the position vector of a point on the line** \(I\)**.**
