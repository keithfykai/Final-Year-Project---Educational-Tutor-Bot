## Physical Properties of Metal

1) Metals are **ductile** (able to be stretched into wires without losing toughness).

2) Metals are **malleable** (able to be bent into different shapes without breaking).

3) Metals are **good conductors of electricity and heat**.

4) Metals have **high melting and boiling points** and generally are solids at room temperature.

5) Metals have **high density**.

6) Metals are generally **strong and shiny**.

_Exceptions:_

- Mercury has a low melting point (-39 "C) and exists as a liquid at room temperature.

- Group I metals such as lithium, sodium and potassium have low densities and float on water.

## 5 Future Metal

Pure metals are soft and as the **layers of metal atoms** would **slide over one another easily** when an external force is applied to them.

## 6 Alloys are **a mixtures of metals with other elements**.

In alloys, since the **atoms have different size**, the **orderly arrangement** of the metal atoms would be **disrupted**, making it tougher to slide over as easily. Hence, alloys are much **stronger and harder**.

## 7 Examples

**Steel:** Iron, carbon (bodies of cars)

**Stainless Steel:** Iron, carbon, chromium, nickel (medical instruments)

**Brass:** Copper, zinc (electrical plugs)

**Bronze:** Copper, tin (trophies)

## Displacement Reaction

When a **more reactive metal displaces a less reactive metal** from its solution or oxide, it is known as displacement reaction.

This is because the more reactive metal is able to **lose its electrons more readily** to form cations.

We can use the result from displacement reaction to deduce the relative reactivity of two metals.

If a metal precipitates when another metal is added to the solution, then the metal that was added would be more reactive one.

If no change is observed (i.e. no reaction), it means that the metal added is less reactive as it wasn able to displace the metal in the solution.

**EXTRACTION OF METALS**

**ELECTROLVSIS, REDUCTION,**

**HYDROGEN**

**BLAST FURNACE**

## 6 Extraction of the METALS

The trained dataset is created in given model from the end of the datasets in the following sections.

In general, very accurate models can only be extracted using networks, while the focus works mostly evaluate the extracted by extraction with randomly independent data.

Electrophysical is the most powerful extraction method. Due to the high usage of electricity, it is a highly expensive process.

Hence, electrolysis would only be utilised for the **most reactive metals** like potassium, sodium, calcium, magnesium and aluminium.

## 7 Reduction by Carbon

Metals that can be extracted by this method are **zinc, iron, tin and lead**.

Lead(II) oxide is reduced by carbon to become pure lead metal,

**PDO (s) + C (s) + Pb (s) + CO (g)**

**REODUCTION BY HYDROGEN**

Metals that can be extracted by this method from their oxides are **iron**,

**copper and lead**.

CuO (s) + H\({}_{2}\) (s) + Cu (s) + H\({}_{2}\)(s)**

* 29. Some of the reactions of three metals, W, X and Y, or compounds of these metals, are described. The oxide of W is reduced both by heating with carbon and by heating with hydrogen. The oxide of X is **not** reduced by heating with carbon or by heating with hydrogen. W displaces Y from an aqueous solution of the sulfate of Y. What is the order of reactivity of metals W, X and Y? (N2019/P1/Q28)

It occurs naturally as an element and sometimes in ores containing its oxide. X can be used to make a chloride of formula XC/ but no other chloride of X exists. A student made some statements about metal X.

* 1 It can be displaced from solutions containing its ions according to the equation below. \[3\text{X'(aq)}+\text{Fe(s)}\rightarrow\text{Fe'-(aq)}+3\text{X(s)}\]
* 2 It can be extracted from its ore by electrolysis.
* 3 It can be extracted from its ore by reduction with carbon.
* 4 It is likely to be found as an ore containing the compound \(\text{X}_{2}\text{O}_{3}\).

Which statements are correct? (N2020/P1/Q26)

* 1, 2 and 3 B 1 and 3 only
* 2 and 3 only
* 3 and 4

### 30. B

X is relatively unreactive as it can occur naturally as an element and must be below iron in the reactivity series and will be displaced by iron. It is not necessary to extract X using electrolysis when reduction with carbon can be used to extract X from its ore. Since no other chloride of X exists, besides XC, X is most likely to exist as X' and will not form X,
