## Chapter Analysis

**DNA, gene, chromosome**

**DNA**

**nucleotide**

* Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is a molecule that **carries genetic code** which is used to synthesise specific polypeptides
* DNA is a double stranded molecules that are twisted around each other to form **double helix structure** of DNA.
* The **basic units** of DNA is called **nucleotides.**

Each nucleotide consists of:

- A deoxyribose sugar

- A phosphate group

- A base containing nitrogen

There are **four types of nitrogenous bases**:

- Adenine (A)

- Guanine (G)

- Cytosine (C)

- Thymine (T)

## DNA

**polynucleotide**

The nucleotides polymerise to form a polynucleotide when the deoxyribose sugars of the nucleotides are joined together by phosphate groups, forming the **sugar-phosphate backbone** of the DNA molecule.

Double helix DNA strands are held together by **hydrogen bonds** between the **nitrogenous bases** by **complementary base pairing**

**Adenine** forms 2 hydrogen bonds with **Thymine Cytosine** forms 3 hydrogen bonds to **Guanine**

# transcription & translation

Transcription:

Transcription is the process by which the DNA template is used to make a single-stranded molecule called messenger RNA (mRNA) by complementary base pairing

There is no thymine in RNA, instead Adenine pairs with Uracil Thymine pairs with Adenine

Guanine pairs with Cytosine, vice versa

Translation:

Translation is the process by which the sequence of mRNA codons is used to make a polypeptide, which will fold into a protein

Ribosome is needed for the process

#### Phenotype:

the protein formed from the gene are responsible for every aspect of a living organism

* protein that affect the pigment colour of iris
* gene is faulty and doesn't produce insulin which causes Type 1 diabetes
