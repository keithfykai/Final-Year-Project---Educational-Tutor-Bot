## Chapter 1 Concept of an Electric Field

* When a charge particle is placed in the presence of another charged particle, one charge particle experiences an electric force due to the electric field setup by the other charged particle. This force may be attractive or repulsive, depending on the nature of the charges involved. French physicist Charles Coulomb (1736-1806) deduced dependence of this electric force on various physical quantities. The relationship is now commonly known as Coulomb's Law.
* 1867) uses the field concept to explain this phenomenon. An electric field is a region of space where an electric charge experiences a force (due to other charged bodies).
* Like the concept of a gravitational field existing in the region around a mass, in the region around an electric charge, there exists an **electric field**; an electric field extends outwards from every charge and permeates all of space. The electric field is a vector field; it consists of a distribution of vectors, one for each point in the region around a charged object. When another charged particle is placed within the region of the electric field, it interacts directly with field, experiencing a force.

## Chapter Coulomb's Law

* states that the force between two point charges is proportional to the product of the charges and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them. Mathematically, it is written as \(F\propto\frac{Qq}{r^{2}}\)

where \(Q,q=\) charges in coulombs [C]

\(r=\) distance between the charges

\(\epsilon_{0}=\) permittivity of free space = \(8.85\times 10^{-12}\)\(s^{4}A^{2}/m^{3}kg\)* both Coulomb's law and Newton's law of gravitation are sometimes referred to as _inverse-square law._
* Electric force can be attractive or repulsive, but gravitational force is always attractive.

**Practice Example 1**

Two charges \(Q\) (\(+3.0\mu C\)) and \(q\) (\(-4.0\mu C\)) are 2.0 m away from each other.

(a)What is the magnitude and direction of the force acting on \(Q\) by \(q\)?

(b)If \(Q\) is replaced with a negative charge (same magnitude as \(Q\)), what would be the magnitude and direction of the force on \(Q\) by \(q\)?Electric Field Strength

Syl unit: Newton per Coulomb [N/C] or Volt per meter [V/m] Vector quantity

* is a region of space in which a charge placed in that region experiences an electric force.
* \(E\) at a point is defined as the electric force exerted per unit positive charge placed at that point where \(F=\) is the electric force on the charge \(q\).

\(E\)-_field_ direction is that of the force acting on a positive charge. It points from a region of higher electric potential to a region of lower electric potential.

Some references refer electric field strength as electric field.

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:10]

* _E-field_ exists around any charged object and its field strength does not require the presence of another charge as \(q,\) which can be viewed as a **test charge.**
* _E-field_ **due to multiple charges:** \[E=E_{1}+E_{2}+E_{3}+\cdots\]
* Add them vectorially For a total charge Q,

* \(E=0\) for \(r<R\)
* \(E=\frac{Q}{4\pi\epsilon_{0}r^{2}}\) for \(r\geq R\)

For \(r\geq R\) (i.e. points outside the spherical conductor), the electric field setup by the spherical conductor is the same as if its entire charge were concentrated at the center of the sphere.

Electric Field Lines

are used to visualize electric fields.

Properties of Electric Field Lines

1. E-field lines originate from a positive charge and terminate in a negative charge.

2. Closer the lines, the strong the electric field in that region.

3. No two field lines can cross.

The density of electric field lines around these three objects reveals that the quantity of charge on C is greater than that on B which is greater than that on A.

* As seen in the figure above, A has a weak field and will exert only a small force on charges in the field.
* B has a stronger field and will exert more force on the charges in the field.
* C has the strongest field, and will exert the most force on charges in its field 

## Appendix A Electric Field Lines

When placed side by side, the field lines will interact with one another to create new field patterns as follows:

\begin{tabular}{c c c} Two oppositely charged particles & Two positive charges & Two negative charges \\ \end{tabular}

* towards the ends of the plates, the electric field gets **weaker** as field lines are **curved.** This is because the field gets further the center of the plate and field strength is no longer constant.

**Practice Example 3**

Draw the electric field lines of a negative point charge \(-Q\) and a positively charged plate shown on the left.

**Practice Example 4**

Two charges \(Q_{1}=-1.0\;\mu C\), \(Q_{2}=-2.0\;\mu C\) are positioned at the corners of a right triangle as shown below.

Determine the magnitude and direction of electric field strength at the corner X.

**Practice Example 5**

Consider three points A, B, and C located near two positively-charged particles of the same charge. List down the positions in from the highest to lowest magnitude of electric field strength. Explain

**Practice Example 6**

Two parallel plates are charged with a potential difference of 120 V. If the plates are 2.50 cm apart,

(a)what is the electric field between the plates?

(b)what is the electric force on a Ca\({}^{2+}\) ion at a point between the plates?Electric Potential

Symbol: \(V\)

Sl unit: Volts [V] or Joules per Coulomb [J/C]

Scalar

at a point in an electric field is defined as the work done per unit positive charge to bring a test charge from infinity to the point (without any change in kinetic energy).

\(V=\frac{U}{q}\)

where \(U=\) electric potential energy per unit positive charge at the point in the field 

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:24]

## Chapter 1 Introduction

The electron-volt is the energy gained by an electron when it is accelerated through a p.d. of one volt

\[1\;eV=1.60\times 10^{-19}J\]

## Chapter 1 Potential due to a Point Charge

* If Q is positive, then the **electric potential** at point A is **positive.** The direction of work done by the external agent is the same as that of displacement when bringing the test charge from infinity to the point in the electric field due to the **repulsive** field
* If Q is negative, then the **electric potential** at point A is **negative**.
* The direction of work done by the external agent is opposite to that of displacement when bringing the test charge from infinity to the point in the electric field due to the **attractive** field

## Appendix D Potential Difference

**Note:** The positive or negative sign of the potential must be substituted into \(V_{final}\) and \(V_{initial}\)

## Appendix E Work Done

Work done \(W\) by an external force (or the change in potential energy of the system) in moving the charge \(q\) is

**Note:** The positive or negative sign of the charge and p.d. must be substituted into \(q\) and \(\Delta V\).

**Practice Example 7**

Determine the potential at points **A** and **B**, due to small charges \(Q_{1}\) and \(Q_{2}\). The charges carry \(Q_{1}=+3.0\;nC\) and \(Q_{2}=-3.0\;nC\) and are 1.50 m apart.

**Practice Example 8**

Calculate the potential energy of the point charges in _Practice Example 7_

## Chapter 1 Equipotential Lines

Are like contour lines on a map which trace lines of equal electric potential.

In 3D space, they are called **equipotential surfaces**

They are perpendicular to electric field lines.

Movement along an equipotential line or surface requires no work.

This is because there is no component of electric force along such path (which is always perpendicular to the electric field lines.

Usually, they are drawn using dashed lines (Sold lines for E-field).

The surface of a charged conductor of any shape is an equipotential surface.

The spacing between the equipotential surfaces will be closer where the field is stronger

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:33]

Electric Potential Gradient

The electric field strength at a point is numerically equal to the potential gradient at that point.

\[E=-\frac{dV}{dr}\]

* \(\frac{dV}{dr}\) is a vector and has units _V/m_ or _N/C_.
* The negative sign shows that the potential decreases along the direction of the _E-field_

## Appendix 1 Electric Potential Gradient

### Derivation

From the definition of potential,

\[V=\frac{W}{q}=\frac{1}{q}\int_{\infty}^{r}\!\!F_{ext}\;dr=\frac{1}{q}\int_{ \infty}^{r}(-F)\;dr\]

Since the electric field strength \(E=\frac{F}{q}\), the expansion becomes

\[V=\int_{\infty}^{r}(-E)\;dr\]

This implies that electric field strength \(E\) can be obtained from the derivative of electric potential \(V\) with respect to \(r\).

\[\Longrightarrow E=-\frac{dV}{dr}\]

## Appendix A Force and Electric Potential Energy

Similarly,

\(F=-\frac{dU}{dr}\)

### Derivation

From the definition of potential,

\[U=\int_{\infty}^{r}\!F_{ext}\;dr=\frac{1}{q}\int_{\infty}^{r}(-F)\;dr\]

or

\[qE=-q\,\frac{dV}{dr}\]

We have \(\;F=-\frac{dU}{dr}\)

## Appendix A Graphs of E due to Two Charges

When plotting the graph of electric field strength, \(E\) against distance between the two charges, \(\underline{t}\), we can first sketch the \(E\) graphs due to the two charges independently. The resultant \(E\) graph is the vector sum of the two graphs.

## Appendix A Graphs of E due to Two Charges

Two equal charges with different polarity

## Appendix A Graphs of V due to Two Charges

When plotting the plotting the graph of electric potential at a point, V against distance between the two charges, r, we can first sketch the V graphs due to the two charges independently. The resultant V graph is the scalar sum of the two graphs.

**Practice Example 9**

An object with a positive charge is placed at P and a similar object with a negative charge is placed at Q. The diagram shows a number of lines along which the potential has a constant value

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:41]

## Appendix A Electric Field Parallel to Motion

* To determine the acceleration \(a\) of the electron, \[\begin{array}{c}F_{e}=F_{net}\\ qE=m_{e}a\end{array}\] (in the direction of the positive charge plate)
* To determine the time \(t\) for the electrons to hit the far plate, \[\begin{array}{c}s_{x}=u_{x}t+\frac{1}{2}\,a_{x}t^{2}\\ d=0+\frac{1}{2}\biggl{(}\frac{qE}{m_{e}}\biggr{)}t^{2}\\ t=\sqrt{\frac{2m_{e}d}{qE}}\end{array}\]

## Appendix A Electric Field Parallel to Motion

* To determine the velocity \(\nu\) of the electrons just before they hit the far plate:
* via Conservation of Energy:
* \(E_{P(\mathit{lost}\ \mathit{by}\ \mathit{electrons})}=E_{K}(\mathit{gained\ by\ \mathit{electron})}\Rightarrow q \Delta V=\frac{1}{2}m_{e}v^{2}-0\)
* To determine the acceleration \(a\) of the electron \(F_{e}=F_{net}\) \(qE=m_{e}a\) (in the direction of the positive charge plate)

## Appendix E Eedit Field Perpendicular to Initial Motion

Considering horizontal motion,

\[s_{x}=u_{xt}+\frac{1}{2}a_{x}t^{2}\]

Since there is no acceleration in the horizontal direction, \(a_{x}\)=0,

\[s_{x}=u_{x}t+0\]

\[\to t=\frac{s_{x}}{u_{x}}\]

Considering vertical motion,

\[s_{y}=u_{y}t+\frac{1}{2}a_{y}t^{2}\]

\[s_{y}=0+\frac{1}{2}\bigg{(}\frac{qE}{m_{e}}\bigg{)}t^{2}\]

Eliminating \(t\) from the equations above (equations for \(t\) and \(s_{y}\)),

\[s_{y}=\frac{1}{2}\bigg{(}\frac{qE}{m_{e}}\bigg{)}\bigg{(}\frac{s_{x}}{u_{x}} \bigg{)}^{2}\]* For the case when the electron has a sufficiently high initial velocity relative to the uniform electric field strength, the electron beam would be able to leave the region between the plates without hitting any of the plates. The electron's path upon leaving the plates would be a straight line since there will be no resultant force acting on it.
* However, if the electron's initial velocity is insufficiently fast relative to the electric field strength, the electron beam would hit one of the plates and not be able to leave the region between the plates

## Appendix

## Appendix

**Practice Example 10**

An electron is projected horizontally with a speed of \(2.0\,\times\,10^{7}\,m/s\) into the uniform electric field set up between the two parallel charged plates spaced 35 cm apart as shown. It is deflected through a vertical distance of 10 cm in \(1.0\,\times\,10^{-7}\,s\) before emerging from the electric field.

**Calculate the vertical component of the velocity \(v\) and the angle of the electron from the horizontal direction just before it emerges from the field.**

**Practice Example 1**

Two charges \(Q\) (\(+3.0\mu C\)) and \(q\) (\(-4.0\mu C\)) are 2.0 m away from each other.

(a) What is the magnitude and direction of the force acting on \(Q\) by \(q\)?

(b) If \(Q\) is replaced with a negative charge (same magnitude as \(Q\)), what would be the magnitude and direction of the force on \(Q\) by \(q\)?

**Solution:**

(a) Magnitude of the force,

\[F=\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_{0}}\frac{Qq}{r^{2}}=\frac{1}{4\pi(8.85\times 10^{-12})} \frac{(3\times 10^{-6})(4\times 10^{-6})}{2^{2}}\]

\(F=27\times 10^{-3}N\)

Direction: to the right since the force is attractive.

(b) The magnitude would be the same,

\(F=27\times 10^{-3}\).

However, the direction would be to the left because the force between two negative charges is repulsive.

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:52]

**Practice Example 3**

Draw the electric field lines of a negative point charge \(-Q\) and a positively charged plate shown on the left.

**Practice Example 4**

Two charges \(Q_{1}=-1.0\;\mu C\), \(Q_{2}=-2.0\;\mu C\) are positioned at the corners of a right triangle as shown below.

Determine the magnitude and direction of electric field strength at the corner X.

**Solution:**

Magnitude

\[E_{1}=\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_{0}}\frac{Q_{1}}{r_{1X}^{2}}=\frac{1}{4\pi(8.85\times 1 0^{-12})}\frac{1\times 10^{-6}}{4^{2}}=562\;N/C\]

\[E_{2}=\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_{0}}\frac{Q_{2}}{r_{2X}^{2}}=\frac{1}{4\pi(8.85 \times 10^{-12})}\frac{2\times 10^{-6}}{3^{2}}=1998\;N/C\]

Magnitude of force on \(Q_{3}\):

\[F=\sqrt{E_{1}^{2}+E_{2}^{2}}=\sqrt{(562)^{2}+(1998)^{2}}=2045\;N/C\]

Direction:

\[\theta=\tan^{-1}\frac{E_{2}}{E_{1}}=\tan^{-1}\frac{1998}{652}=74.3^{\circ}\]

**Practice Example 5**

Consider three points A, B, and C located near two positively-charged particles of the same charge. List down the positions in from the highest to lowest magnitude of electric field strength. Explain

**Answer:**

(strongest field) **A\(\rightarrow\)B\(\rightarrow\)C** (weakest field)

At point **C,** there is zero field strength. Position **A** has the strongest field strength because field lines are closer to each other compared to field lines around position **B.**

**Practice Example 6**

Two parallel plates are charged with a potential difference of 120 V. If the plates are 2.50 cm apart,

(a) what is the electric field between the plates?

(b) what is the electric force on a Ca\({}^{2+}\) ion at a point between the plates?

**Solutions:**

(a) E-field

\[E=\frac{\Delta V}{d}=\frac{120\ V}{2.5\times 10^{-2}}\]

\[E=4.8\times\mathbb{10^{3}\ V/m}\]

(b) Ca\({}^{2+}\) ion has \(2e\) charge where \(e=1.602\times 10^{-19}\) C

\[F=EQ_{Ca}\]

\[F=(4.8\times 10^{3}\ )2(1.602\times 10^{-19})\]

\[F=1.54\times\mathbb{10^{-15}N}\]

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:57]

**Practice Example 8**

Calculate the potential energy of the point charges in _Practice Example 7_

**Solution:**

\[U=\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_{0}}\frac{Q_{1}Q_{2}}{r}\]

\[V_{A}=\frac{1}{4\pi(8.85\times 10^{-12})}\bigg{[}\frac{(3\times 10^{-9})(-3 \times 10^{-9})}{1.50}\bigg{]}\]

\[V_{A}=5.4\times 10^{-8}\,I\]

## Practice Example 9

An object with a positive charge is placed at P and a similar object with a negative charge is placed at Q. The diagram shows a number of lines along which the potential has a constant value. Draw a rough estimation of the variation of electric field strength \(E\) with distance \(x\) along the line PQ. Explain your answer.
