## 1 Introduction

Hydrocarbons are compounds containing only hydrogen and carbon, and are obtained from crude oil, a fossil fuel.

It is a major energy source.

Alkanes constitute the major part of crude oil. Alkanes are transformed into feedstock for the chemical industry and fuels in internal combustion engines, jet engines and power stations (See Section 8). Huge fractions of energy we use come from combustion of alkanes.

## 2 Nomenclature using the IUPAC system

### Nomenclature for Straight-Chain Alkanes

The IUPAC system is the most common method used for naming most organic compounds. Straight-chain alkanes have IUPAC names as shown below. Each member has a suffix '**ane**'.

\begin{tabular}{|c|l|l|l|l|} \hline \multicolumn{5}{|c|}{**IUPAC Names of Straight-Chain Alkanes**} \\ \hline \begin{tabular}{c} **Number** \\ **of carbon** \\ **atoms** \\ \end{tabular} & \begin{tabular}{c} **Name** \\ **of carbon** \\ **atoms** \\ \end{tabular} & \begin{tabular}{c} **Number** \\ **of carbon** \\ **atoms** \\ \end{tabular} & \begin{tabular}{c} **Name** \\ **atoms** \\ \end{tabular} &

* Spelled *eicosane" prior to 1979 version of IUPAC rules

### Nomenclature for Branched-Chain Alkanes

In the IUPAC nomenclature, every name consists of:

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|} \hline
**Step** & & **Example** \\ \hline
1 & Identify the **parent** chain [**longest continuous** & \(\text{CH}_{2}\text{-CH}_{2}\text{-CH}_{3}\) \\  & **carbon chain**] and use it with the **suffix**. & \\  & & \\  & & \\  & & \\  & & \\  & & \\  & & \\  & & \\ \hline
2 & Identify the substituent/side chain, if any (prefix). & 1 ethyl group \\ \hline
3 & Number the carbon chain. Assign **lowest** possible & \\  & numbers to the group(s) cited as **prefix**. & \\  & & \\  & & \\  & & \\  & & \\  & & \\  & & \\  & & \\  & & \\  & & \\  & & \\  & & \\ \hline
4 & Use **commas** to separate numbers. & **3**-**ethylhexane** \\  & Use **hyphens** to separate numbers and words. & [prefix]-parent-suffix \\ \hline \end{tabular}

**Note: (For multiple, different types of substituents)**

1. For compounds with different multiple substituents, we number the carbon chain to give the substituents the lowest number at the first point of difference.
2. If two or more alkyl groups are attached to the parent chain, they are named in **alphabetical** order. E.g. (1) **butyl** (2) ethyl (3) methyl (4) propyl

## 3 Physical properties

Alkanes contain C-C and C-H bonds. As the difference in electronegativity between C and H atoms is negligible (refer to the Pauling Electronegativity Values), the C-H bond is essentially non-polar and alkanes are **essentially non-polar** with the following physical properties.

### Boiling point / volatility

Alkanes have relatively low boiling points (or high volatility).

Table below shows some physical properties of straight-chain alkanes:

\begin{tabular}{c|c|c|c|c|c|c} \hline name & formula & \begin{tabular}{c} melting \\ point / \({}^{\circ}\)C \\ \end{tabular} & \begin{tabular}{c} boiling \\ point / \({}^{\circ}\)C \\ \end{tabular} & \begin{tabular}{c} density / \\ g cm\({}^{-3}\) (20 \({}^{\circ}\)C) \\ \end{tabular} & \begin{tabular}{c} state at \\ r.t.p. \\ \end{tabular} & remarks \\ \hline methane & CH\({}_{4}\) & -182 & -162 & gas & gas & The C\({}_{1}\) to C\({}_{4}\) straight-chain alkanes are colourless gases at room temperature. \\ \hline pentane & CH\({}_{3}\)CH\({}_{2}\)\({}_{3}\)CH\({}_{3}\) & -183 & -89 & gas & gas & The C\({}_{5}\) to C\({}_{17}\) alkanes are colourless liquids of increasing viscosity. \\ \hline heptane & CH\({}_{3}\)(CH\({}_{2}\))\({}_{5}\)CH\({}_{3}\) & -91 & 98 & 0.684 & liquid & The remaining alkanes containing 18 carbon atoms or more are solids at room temperature. \\ \hline octane & CH\({}_{3}\)(CH\({}_{2}\))\({}_{7}\)CH\({}_{3}\) & -53 & 151 & 0.718 & liquid & \begin{tabular}{c} the remaining alkanes containing 18 carbon atoms or more are solids at room temperature. \\ \end{tabular} \\ \hline decane & CH\({}_{3}\)(CH\({}_{2}\))\({}_{8}\)CH\({}_{3}\) & -30 & 174 & 0.730 & liquid & 
\begin{tabular}{c} the remaining alkanes containing 18 carbon atoms or more are solids at room temperature. \\ \end{tabular} \\ \hline incosane & CH\({}_{3}\)(CH\({}_{2}\))\({}_{8}\)CH\({}_{3}\) & 37 & 343 & 0.789 & solid & \\ \hline \end{tabular}

For straight chain alkanes, the boiling point increases (and volatility decreases) steadily as the number of carbon atoms increases.

**Reason:**

Larger alkanes have more electrons and therefore stronger instantaneous dipole-induced dipole attractions exist between the alkane molecules. More energy is needed to overcome these attractions between the molecules, resulting in a higher boiling point (and lower volatility) as the number of carbon atoms in alkanes increases.

* Branched chain alkanes have lower boiling point (and higher volatility) than their corresponding straight chain alkane. The greater the degree of branching in the isomer, the lower is its boiling point. E.g. C\({}_{5}\)H\({}_{12}\)
* CH\({}_{3}\)CH\({}_{2}\)CH\({}_{2}\)CH\({}_{3}\)
* pentane boiling point: 36\({}^{\circ}\)C
* **Reason:** Branched molecules are more compact with a smaller surface area for instantaneous dipole-induced dipole (id-id) forces of attraction between molecules and hence less energy is needed to overcome the weaker intermolecular forces, resulting in a lower boiling point.

## 4Exercise 2

Predict, with reasons, which compound has a lower boiling point.

* **A** B
* Compound has a lower boiling point.

Since both molecules have the same electron cloud size, compound with shorter carbon chain length will be more compact, resulting in smaller surface area for instantaneous dipole -induced dipole forces of attraction between the molecules. Lesser energy is needed to overcome the weaker intermolecular forces of attraction, resulting in a lower boiling point.

### Solubility

Alkanes are soluble in non-polar solvents such as benzene. Big idea: polar solute tends to dissolve in polar solvents while non-polar solute tends to dissolve in non-polar solvent. The instantaneous dipole-induced dipole interaction between alkane molecules and the non-polar solvent molecules releases sufficient energy to overcome the instantaneous dipole-induced dipole attractions between the alkane molecules as well as that between the solvent molecules. Alkanes are insoluble in water and other highly- polar solvents such as ethanol. The instantaneous dipole-induced dipole interaction between alkane molecules and the water molecules does not release sufficient energy to overcome the stronger hydrogen bonds between the water molecules and the instantaneous dipole-induced dipole attractions between the alkane_

_Note: If solute is soluble in solvent \(\Rightarrow\)'Energy released during formation of solute-solvent interaction > Energy taken in to overcome solute-solute and solvent-solvent interaction'_

**Exercise 3**

Do fatty acids with long carbon chains usually dissolve in water? Why or why not?

1. No. because fatty acid is organic and water is not.
2. No, because fatty acid is non-polar and water is polar.
3. Yes, because the oxygen on the fatty acid is attracted to the hydrogen of water.
4. Yes, because the oxygen on the fatty acid is more electronegative than the carbon, making it having a partial positive charge.

### Density

Alkanes are less dense than water.

The density of alkanes increases with increasing molecular size.

For larger molecules, the strength of instantaneous dipole-induced dipole attractions between molecules increases, which causes the alkanes to be more closely-packed per unit volume.

## 4 Isomerism in alkanes (Recap from Introduction to Organic Chemistry)

### Constitutional (or structural) isomerism

**Constitutional (or structural) isomerism** occurs when compounds have the same molecular formula but different structural formulae.

From butane onwards, alkanes have constitutional isomers due to the branching of the hydrocarbon chains.

### Stereoisomerism

**Stereoisomerism** occurs when compounds have the same molecular formula and structural formula but differ in the way in which their atoms are arranged in 3D space relative to one another.

**(a)**: **Enantiomerism (a.k.a optical isomerism in the previous A-level syllabus)**

Some branched-chain alkanes display **enantiomerism**. This is because they contain a chiral carbon centre and hence can exist as a pair of enantiomers, which are non-superimposable mirror images of each other.

E.g.: 3-methylhexane displays enantiomerism.

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:11]

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:12]

### Combustion (SDL)

Alkanes react with excess oxygen to form carbon dioxide and water only. The complete combustion is a highly exothermic process.

General equation:

\[\mathrm{C_{n}H_{2n+2}\ +\ \frac{3n+1}{2}\,O_{2}\ \rightarrow\ nCO_{2}\ +\ (n+1)H_{2}O}\]

Example: Complete combustion of ethane gas

\[\mathrm{C_{2}H_{6}(g)\ +\ \frac{7}{2}\,O_{2}(g)\ \rightarrow\ 2CO_{2}(g)\ +\ 3H_{2}O(l)}\]

In a limited supply of oxygen, C, CO and H\({}_{2}\)O are formed.

Example: Incomplete combustion of methane gas

\[\mathrm{CH_{4}(g)\ +\ \frac{3}{2}\,O_{2}(g)\ \rightarrow\ CO(g)\ +\ 2H_{2}O(l)}\]

\[\mathrm{CH_{4}(g)\ +\ O_{2}(g)\ \rightarrow\ C(s)\ +\ 2H_{2}O(l)}\]

### Free-radical substitution (Halogenation)

Alkanes react with halogens such as C\(l_{2}\)(g) or Br\({}_{2}\)(l) to give halogenoalkanes.

The hydrogen atom(s) in the alkane is substituted by the halogen atom(s) during the reaction.

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|} \hline R-H + X\({}_{2}\) & UV light & R-X + H-X & R denotes the rest of the molecule \\ \hline \end{tabular}

\(\Box\) **Reagents and conditions**: limiting C\(l_{2}\)(g) or Br\({}_{2}\)(l), in the presence of ultraviolet (UV) light

## 7 Chemical reactions of alkanes

### Understanding the Basics

(a) Free radical

A free radical is an atom or group of atoms that has an unpaired electron in its outer shell. (i.e. has an odd number of electrons).

Radicals are highly reactive and they readily form bonds with other atoms or molecules to regain their full octet of electrons.

They are formed as intermediates in the halogenation of alkanes.

Radicals have the same number of protons as electrons, so they are electrically neutral.

e.g.

Methyl radical and ethyl radical are examples of alkyl radicals.

(b) Homolytic fission (applicable in FRS of alkanes / alkylbenzenes)

**Homolytic fission (or hemolysis)** is a type of bond breaking process where each of the atom involved in forming the bond acquires one of the two bonding electrons, thus forming free radicals.

We use the 'half arrow' notation [ ] to illustrate the movement of a single electron in the bond during homolytic fission. The 'tail' of the arrow shows where the single electron comes from and the arrow 'head' shows where the electron ends up.

e.g.

radicals are formed

1 electron of the C-H bond moves towards the C atom and the other towards the H atom

the dot * beside each atom represents the unpaired electron that the atom has gained from the shared pair in the bond

### Heterolytic fission (applicable in other mechanisms from alkenes onwards)

**Heterolytic fission (or heterolysis)** is another type of bond breaking process where the splitting of a bond gives an unequal share of bonding electrons to each particle.

We use the **'full arrow'** notation [ ] to illustrate the movement of the **bonded pair of electrons** from the position at the 'tail' of the arrow to the position at the 'head'.

e.g.

* ions are formed
* the 2 electrons in the C-C/ bond move towards the C/ atom and become a lone pair on it
* C now has 1 less e' than proton, hence charge +1
* C/ now has 1 more e' than proton, hence charge -1

* The 'full arrow' and 'half arrow' notations are used to show the movement of a pair of electrons and a single electron respectively. The arrows illustrate the movement of electrons as bonds between atoms are broken and formed. You are expected to be able to interpret and use these curly arrow notations to represent the movement of electrons in organic reaction mechanisms.

### Exercise 5

Which of the following bonds is most likely to be first broken down heterolytically during a chemical reaction?

1. C-H bond
2. C-C bond
3. C-C/ bond
4. C=C bond

**Reason:** Since C-C/ is a polar bond, it will tend to cleave heterolytically. (Non-polar bonds like C-C and C-H bonds tend to cleave homolytically.)

### Classification of hydrogen and carbon atoms

* If a hydrogen atom is removed from an alkane, the partial structure that remains is called an alkyl group (_usually denoted as **R**, **R**\({}^{\prime}\) etc.).
* Each removal of a hydrogen atom leads to a greater degree of alkyl substitution. There are four possible degrees of alkyl substitution for carbon and it is denoted primary (1\({}^{\circ}\)), secondary (2\({}^{\circ}\)), tertiary (3\({}^{\circ}\)) and quaternary (4\({}^{\circ}\)).
* Hydrogen atoms are also classified as primary (1\({}^{\circ}\)), secondary (2\({}^{\circ}\)) or tertiary (3\({}^{\circ}\)) depending on the type of carbon atom to which they are bonded.
* e.g. 2-methylbutane
* : primary (1\({}^{\circ}\)) hydrogen as it is bonded to a 1\({}^{\circ}\) carbon atom
* : secondary (2\({}^{\circ}\)) hydrogen as it is bonded to a 2\({}^{\circ}\) carbon atom
* : tertiary (3\({}^{\circ}\)) hydrogen as it is bonded to a 3\({}^{\circ}\) carbon atom

### Exercise 6

How many tertiary hydrogens are there in C\(i\)CH\({}_{2}\)C(CH\({}_{3}\))\({}_{2}\)CH(CH\({}_{3}\))C(CH\({}_{3}\))\({}_{3}\)?

Draw out the partial displayed formula to aid in your visualisation.

**Stage 2: Propagation**

\(\Box\) The highly reactive chlorine free radical, on colliding with alkanes such as methane, abstracts a hydrogen atom to produce HC_l_ and a methyl radical, \(\bullet\)CH\({}_{3}\).

\(\Box\) The methyl radical reacts further with another chlorine molecule.

\(\Box\) The product, chloromethane is produced and a chlorine free radical is regenerated.

\(\Box\) This step leads to a chain reaction since the chlorine free radical formed can react as in the first propagation step.

Note:

* The reaction only requires a flash of ultraviolet light rather than prolonged radiation.
* Since the C_l_* radical is regenerated in the propagation step, the generation of C_l_* radical is only required initially to start a chain reaction.

**Stage 3: Termination**

\(\Box\) When any two free radicals collide, the unpaired electrons pair up to form a stable product. This terminates the chain reaction.

\(\Box\) Possible termination equations:

\(\Box\)Note:

* Termination reactions are highly exothermic as they involve bond formation only.
* As the concentration of free radicals at any one time in the reaction is very small, the likelihood of two radicals colliding is small.
* Trace amounts of ethane are formed as by-products in this case.

### Free-radical substitution in organic synthesis

This is not a good method to prepare halogenalkanes, as it is very hard to control the reaction resulting in a mixture containing other by-products such as different halogen-substituted alkanes.

Formation of multi-substituted by-products

A free radical is highly reactive and can react with almost any molecule in the reaction mixture.

The chloromethane formed can undergo further substitution via the same mechanism to yield multi-substituted halogenalkanes in the propagation stage.

Note:

* Further substitution can be minimised by using a large excess of CH\({}_{4}\) to yield chloromethane as the major product. This reduces the probability of the chlorine radical from colliding with a monochromated methane which will lead to multi-substituted product.
* Alternatively, controlling the proportion of the reactants (alkane and halogen) and the time allowed for the reaction will also improve the purity of the reaction mixture.

### Reactivity of halogens with alkanes

(* Why is there a trend in reactivity of halogens with alkanes? Hint: try calculating the \(\Delta H_{t}\) for the halogenation reactions for each type of halogen used)

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:21]

Halogenation of higher alkanes (using CH\({}_{3}\)CH\({}_{2}\)CH\({}_{3}\) and \(\boldsymbol{Cl_{2}}\) as example)

When propane reacts with chlorine, a mixture of two monochlorinated propane is produced i.e. 1-chloropropane and 2-chloropropane.

This is because the chlorine atom can abstract either one of the _primary_ hydrogen atoms or _secondary_ hydrogen atoms in the propagation step, before forming 1-chloropropane and 2-chloropropane respectively.

\[\begin{array}{ll}\text{Abstraction of}\\ \text{1${}^{\circ}$ hydrogen:}&\text{C}l\bullet\text{ + CH}_{3}\text{--CH}_{2}\text{--CH}_{3}&\text{CH}_{3}\text{--CH}_{2} \text{ + HC}l\\ \text{2${}^{\circ}$ hydrogen:}&\text{C}l\bullet\text{ + CH}_{3}\text{--CH}_{2}\text{--CH}_{3}&\text{CH}_{3}\text{--CH} \text{--CH}_{3}\text{ + HC}l\\ \end{array}\]

Assuming that the abstraction of a 1\({}^{\circ}\) hydrogen and of a 2\({}^{\circ}\) hydrogen are both equally likely, the ratio of 1-chloropropane : 2-chloropropane in the product mixture should also be \(3:1\), because the ratio of 1\({}^{\circ}\) hydrogen atoms : 2\({}^{\circ}\) hydrogen atoms is \(6:2=3:1\).

### Exercise 10

Pentane was reacted with limited chlorine in the presence of \(\nu\nu\) light.

Assuming that only mono-chlorination takes place and the reaction occurs at the same rate at all carbon atoms, predict the ratio of the products obtained.

\[\begin{array}{|c|cccc|}\hline&\text{1$-chloropentane}&:&2\text{--chloropentane}&:&3 \text{--chloropentane}\\ \hline\text{\bf A}&3&:&2&:&1\\ \hline\text{\bf B}&1&:&2&:&3\\ \hline\text{\bf C}&1&:&3&:&2\\ \hline\text{\bf D}&3&:&1&:&2\\ \hline\end{array}\]

### Relative rate of substitution

In the bromination of CH\({}_{3}\)CH\({}_{2}\)CH\({}_{3}\), the expected ratio of the product mixture of CH\({}_{3}\)CH\({}_{2}\)CH\({}_{2}\)Br and CH\({}_{3}\)CH(Br)CH\({}_{3}\) are expected to be 3 : 1. However, it was found that CH\({}_{3}\)CH(Br)CH\({}_{3}\) is present in much greater amounts than expected. Why is that so?

Reason:

* The abstraction of hydrogen atoms on different carbon atoms is not equally likely due to electron-donating effect of the alkyl groups on the carbon with the unpaired electron.
* CH\({}_{3}\)-CH-CH\({}_{3}\) radical has two electron donating alkyl groups on the carbon with the unpaired electron, which reduces its electron deficiency. It is therefore more stable than the CH\({}_{3}\)-CH\({}_{2}\)-CH\({}_{2}\) radical (which has only one alkyl group on the carbon with the unpaired electron).
* Since the secondary (2\({}^{\rm o}\)) prop-2-yl radical is more stable, the 2\({}^{\rm o}\) hydrogen atoms in propane are more likely to be abstracted, hence forming more CH\({}_{3}\)CH(Br)CH\({}_{3}\) in the product mixture.

### Relative Stability of radicals

The stability of alkyl radicals depends on the number of alkyl groups (\(R\)) attached to the carbon atom with the unpaired electron.

The carbon with the unpaired electron is electron-deficient. As alkyl groups exerts an electron-donating effect, the stability of an alkyl radical is enhanced by more alkyl groups attached to the carbon with the unpaired electron as its deficiency is reduced to a greater extent.

The following shows the relative stability of alkyl radicals.

In summary, you may use the following expression to determine the ratio of the products expected based on the information provided in the question.

To find the number of products expected for each type of H atom, you always use this expression.

\begin{tabular}{c c c c}
**no. of products** & & number of & & \\
**formed** & = & equivalent H atom & **x** & **relative rate of** \\ \end{tabular}

For questions where it was assumed to be equal rates, you can simplify the expression to

\begin{tabular}{c c c}
**no. of products** & & number of \\
**formed** & = & equivalent H atom \\ \end{tabular}

(because relative rate of substitution = 1 for all types of H atom)

### (FYI) Further reading

Why does alkyl group have a positive inductive effect (i.e. exert an electron-donating effect)?

While C-C bonds are non-polar due to the equal electronegativity of the 2 carbon atoms, there is a slight electronegativity difference between C and H such that a very small accumulation of bonding electrons around the C atom of a -CH\({}_{3}\) group occurs.

If its adjacent carbon atom is electron deficient in some way (for example, being surrounded by only 7 electrons, as in a radical), the -CH\({}_{3}\) group can partially compensate for this deficiency by acting as an electron'reservoir' (exerts an electron-donating effect).

Therefore, the methyl radical is much less stable than a primary radical, which in turn is less stable than a secondary radical. A tertiary radical experiences an even greater stabilisation due to the inductive effect of three alkyl groups.

In addition, the carbon in alkyl group is sp\({}^{3}\) hybridised and has 25% s and 75% p character whereas the carbon with the unpaired electron is sp\({}^{2}\) hybridised which has 33% s and 67% p character. A sp\({}^{2}\) carbon has more s character than sp\({}^{3}\) carbon as s orbitals hold electrons closer to the nucleus than p orbitals

**formed** & = & equivalent H atom & **x** & **relative rate of** \\ \end{tabular}

Thus, the bonding electrons are pulled more strongly towards a sp\({}^{2}\) carbon than sp\({}^{3}\) carbon due to its greater s character which reduces the electron deficiency in the carbon with an unpaired electron.

## 8 Hydrocarbons as fuels (SDL)

Principal sources of alkanes are natural gas and petroleum (also called crude oil).

Natural gas contains mainly methane with small amounts of other gaseous alkanes such as ethane, propane and butane.

Petroleum is a complex mixture of hydrocarbons consisting of alkanes, cycloalkanes and aromatic compounds. It contains a wide range of alkanes, from the low molecular weight gases to the high molecular weight solids.

### (a) Fractional distillation of petroleum

Fractional distillation separates the components of petroleum based on their different boiling points.

The different fractions obtained from crude oil are shown below.

\(\square\)

Many of the fractions obtained from the distillation of crude oil are used as fuels such as petrol, kerosene and diesel. Combustion of alkanes as fuels can give rise to pollution problems.

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:26]

As photochemical reactions continue in the atmosphere, ozone levels increase. Small molecules combine to form larger ones and eventually tiny particles. The particles and the brown NO\({}_{2}\) give the air a dirty and smoggy appearance.

### Catalytic converters

* Catalytic converters employ metals such as platinum (Pt), palladium (Pd) and rhodium (Rh) as catalysts.
* Converts pollutant gases to harmless gases by redox reactions.
* CO(g) + NO(g) \(\rightarrow\) 12 \(\mathrm{N_{2}(g)}\) + CO\({}_{2}\)(g) _by Rh catalyst_
* CO(g) + 12 \(\mathrm{O_{2}(g)}\) \(\rightarrow\) CO\({}_{2}\)(g) _by Pt and Pd catalyst_
* Unburnt hydrocarbons, \(\mathrm{C_{x}H_{y}}\) + O\({}_{2}\) (g) \(\rightarrow\) CO\({}_{2}\) (g) + H\({}_{2}\)O (g) _by Pt and Pd catalyst_
* Lead in the form of (CH\({}_{3}\)CH\({}_{2}\))\({}_{4}\)Pb is often added to petrol as an anti-knocking agent.
* It is critical to use unheaded petrol when a car is fitted with catalytic converters. Lead present in the exhaust gas will bind onto the catalyst surface and render it useless. This is known as catalytic poisoning.

### Gases contributing to enhanced greenhouse effect

* **Carbon dioxide, CO\({}_{2}\)** CO\({}_{2}\), a major greenhouse gas, is produced from burning of fossil fuels for heating, transport and generating electricity.
* **Methane, CH\({}_{4}\)** Produced from more intensive agricultural activity, e.g. cattle-rearing
* **Water vapour, H\({}_{2}\)O** If global warming increases, the warmer atmosphere absorbs more water vapour, which in turn leads to a greater greenhouse effect, increasing the global warming even more.

**Consequences:** Increased greenhouse effect \(\Rightarrow\) global warming \(\Rightarrow\) melting icecaps, rising sea levels and climate changes

## 10 Conservation of finite resources (SDL)

**(a) Petroleum as a finite resource**

Petroleum (or crude oil) is a natural source of hydrocarbons. It is perhaps the most important substance consumed in modern society.

The fuels derived from petroleum form a large part of the world's total supplyof energy. Gasoline, karosene, and diesel oil provide fuel for automobiles,aircraft, and ships. Fuel oil and natural gas are used to heat homes as well as to generate electricity.

Petroleum serves as a source of basic raw materials (chemical feedstocks) for the chemical industry to produce useful products such as dyes, drugs, plastics, synthetic fibers and paints.

Petroleum is a fossil fuel. Fossil fuels are formed when marine plants and animals die and the remains become buried under several thousand feet in the sea beds in the absence of air. Under the extreme chemically reducing conditions, oxygen and nitrogen are removed from the carbohydrates and proteins that make up the organisms, and long carbon chains form. This formation of fossil fuels requires millions of years.

As a fossil fuel, petroleum is **a finite resource**. It is present in the Earth in a fixed amount and this amount is **non-renewable** and cannot last forever.

Our dependence on petroleum becomes clear that we must not only find alternative sources of energy but also **conserve the remaining limited oil reserves** by **recycling**.

**(b) Recycling**

To reduce our energy consumption and ease major environmental problems, it is important to preserve the Earth's natural resources by _recycling_.

Benefits/Importance of recycling:

Reduces the need for raw materials and conserves new resources.

Reduces waste material to be disposed of which saves space in landfills and lowers disposal costs and in the process reduce air, water and land pollution caused by the disposal process.

Conserves energy as less energy is required to recycle materials than to produce it. This will reduce air pollution as less hydrocarbons are combusted to produce energy. Process of ones also require more energy as compared to the energy required in recycling.

Recycling protect the environment and can reduce global warming as less fossil fuel will be burned at power station and thus less CO\({}_{2}\) will be released into the atmosphere.

Recycling creates jobs and innovation.
