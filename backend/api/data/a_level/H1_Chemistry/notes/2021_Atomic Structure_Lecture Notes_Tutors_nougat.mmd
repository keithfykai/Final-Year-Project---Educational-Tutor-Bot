[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:2]

The development and revision of the atomic model over time is due to new evidence found through advances in theory and technology. This does not necessarily mean that the past atomic models are inaccurate, they are still useful for explaining science in a simpler manner.

### The Fundamental Sub-Atomic Particles of Matter

* identify and describe protons, neutrons and electrons in terms of their relative charges and relative masses
* describe the distribution of mass and charges within an atom

* An atom is the smallest particle of an element that retains its chemical properties.
* An atom consists of a dense positively charged nucleus made up of **protons** and **neutrons**, collectively known as **nucleons**.
* The nucleus is surrounded by negatively charged **electrons** occupying regions in space around it (known as atomic orbitals).
* The electrons are attracted by protons via electrostatic forces.

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:4]

The **nucleon number** (**mass number**) gives the total number of protons and neutrons in the nucleus of an atom.

\begin{tabular}{l} \(\text{Eg.}\) \({}^{1}_{1}\text{H}\) and \({}^{12}_{6}\text{C}\) \\ \end{tabular}

In a neutral atom, the number of protons = the number of electrons.

When an atom gains electrons, a negatively charged ion or an **anion** is produced (number of protons<number of electrons).

When an atom loses electrons, a positively charged ion or a **cation** is produced (number of electrons<number of protons).

\(\bullet\) **Self- Check: Q2 to Q5**

### Isotopes

\begin{tabular}{l} \(\text{(e)}\) \(\text{(ii)}\) distinguish between isotopes on the basis of different numbers of neutrons present \\ \end{tabular}

Isotopes are atoms of the same element with the **same number of protons** (same proton number) but **different number of neutrons** (different nucleon numbers).

For example,

\begin{tabular}{l} \(\text{\(\begin{array}{c|c|c|c|c|c|}\hline&&\text{Isotopes of carbon}&\text{Isotopes of Hydrogen }\\ \cline{2-7}  & \({}^{12}_{6}\text{C}\) & \({}^{13}_{6}\text{C}\) & \({}^{1}_{1}\text{H}\) & \({}^{2}_{1}\text{H}\) & \({}^{3}_{1}\text{H}\) \\ \hline Number of nucleons & 12 & 13 & 1 & 2 & 3 \\ \hline Number of protons & 6 & 6 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\ \hline Number of neutrons & 6 & 7 & 0 & 1 & 2 \\ \hline \end{tabular}

Relative atomic mass of an element is often not a whole number. This arises due to the presence of isotopes occurring in different percentage abundance. _(Refer to Topic 1: The Mole Concept and Stoichiometry)_

\(\bullet\) **Self- Check: Q6**

## 2 Principal Quantum Numbers, Subshells and Orbitals

* In an atom or ion, the electrons are arranged in different **shells**, which consist of one or more **subshells**.
* Each subshell contains one or more **orbitals**.

### Principal Quantum Number, n (Shell)

* Electrons are arranged in **shells** with certain main energy levels around the nucleus.
* Each shell is described by a number known as the **principal quantum number**, n. The value of n ranges from n = 1 to n = \(\infty\)

* The first shell (n=1) is **closest** to the nucleus and it is of the **lowest** energy level. When the value of n increases, the electrons are in a shell that is **further away** from the nucleus and of **greater energy**. Hence, the electron is **less tightly bound** to the nucleus.
* Some examples from n = 1 to n = 4 are listed below:

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|} \hline
**Principal quantum number, n** & **Maximum no. of electrons** \\ \hline
1 & 2 \\ \hline
2 & 2 + 6 = 8 \\ \hline
3 & 2 + 6 + 10 = 18 \\ \hline
4 & 2 + 6 + 10 + 14 = 32 \\ \hline \end{tabular}

### Subshell

* Each quantum shell contains one or more subshells.
* In the shell of principal quantum number, n, there are n subshells.
* The subshells are designated by n and a letter (s, p, d, f, etc.)
* Within the same shell, the relative energies of the subshells increase in the following order: **s < p < d**

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:7]

p orbital**

* For shells with principal quantum number n = 2 and above, each p subshell has **three p orbitals**, namely **p\({}_{\text{x}}\)**, **p\({}_{\text{y}}\)** and **p\({}_{\text{z}}\)**. The subscript provides information on the orientation of the orbital with respect to the orbital.
* All p orbitals are of **dumb-bell shape** and are **directional** (different orientation along the x, y and z axes).
* p orbitals in the same subshell (same principal quantum number) have the same energy i.e. they are **degenerate**.

**Summary to principal quantum numbers, subshells and orbitals:**

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|} \hline \hline
**Principal Quantum Number** & **Type. of subshells** & **No. of orbitals** & **Maximum no. of** \\  & & & **electrons in shell (2n\({}^{2}\))** \\ \hline
1 & 1s & 1 & 2 \\ \hline
2 & 2s 2p & 1 + 3 = 4 & 8 \\ \hline
3 & 3s 3p 3d & 1 + 3 + 5 = 9 & 18 \\ \hline
4 & 4s 4p 4d 4f & 1 + 3 + 5 + 7 = 16 & 32 \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}

### Electronic Energy Level

[label=(f)]

 describe the number and relative energies of the s, p and d orbitals for the principal quantum numbers 1, 2 and 3 and also the 4s and 4p orbitals.

Each electron occupies an orbital and possesses a certain amount of energy.

A schematic representation of the energy levels of each orbital is shown below, indicating their relative energies:

In general,

- Energy level increases as principal quantum number increases.

- Within the same shell, the relative energies of the subshells increase in the following order:

**s < p < d**

- Orbitals in the same subshell are degenerate.

- An electron in a lower energy level orbital is closer to the nucleus.

\({}^{\star}\)_Note: the 4s orbital is of a lower energy than the 3d orbitals_

## 3 Electronic Configurations

[label=(h)]

state the electronic configuration of atoms and ions given the proton number (and charge)

The **electronic configuration** of an element refers to the way in which the electrons are distributed among the various orbitals.

### Representations of Electronic Configurations

There are a few ways to represent electronic configuration of an atom, namely:

* Quantum shell electrons notation: e.g. 1Na 2,8,1 (_NOT accepted in A-Level_) _In the A-Level, you must learn how to write the following:_
* Electronic configuration using **spdf notation** (default): e.g. 1Na 1s2s22p63s1

* _Note : the number of electrons in the subshell is denoted as a superscript_
* Electronic configuration using **noble gas core**: e.g. 1Na [Ne] 3s1 where [Ne] represents 1s2s22p6

* **Electrons-in-box notation**: e.g. 1Na 1s 2s 2p 3s The orbitals are shown in order of their principal quantum number, followed by the subshells.

### Rules of working out electronic configurations

When electrons in the atom occupy the lowest energy levels, the atom is said to be in its **ground state**. When an electron is promoted to one of the higher energy levels, the atom is unstable and is said to be in an **excited state**.

In order to determine the ground state electronic configuration of an atom of any element, there are three rules to follow:

**Rule 1: Aufbau ('Build-Up') Principle**

* Electrons are filled from the orbitals of **lowest** energy level to those of a **higher** energy level.
* Hence, the order in which the orbitals are filled are: 1s 2s 2p 3s 3p 4s 3d 4p etc.
* _Note: 4s has a lower energy than the 3d orbital_
* For example, the electronic configuration of boron is 1s2s2p1. Boron atom has 5 electrons. The first 2 electrons must occupy the 1s orbital as it has the lowest energy, the next two will occupy 2s orbital of higher energy and the remaining electron will occupy the 2p orbital

**Rule 2: Hund's Rule**

* The orbitals in the same subshell must be occupied **singly** and with **parallel** spins before they can be occupied in pairs. This is to ensure electrons are as far apart as possible to **minimise inter-electronic repulsion**.

**Rule 3: Pauli Exclusion Principle**

* An orbital can contain a maximum **two** electrons, and they must have **opposite** spins.

**Exercise 2:**

Draw the electron-in box diagram to show the electron distribution in 10Ne and 17Cl.

**Thinking process:**

What are the 3 rules in writing electronic configurations?

In writing the electronic configurations, **3d** should be written **before 4s** even though the 4s subshell is filled before 3d.

Example: Vanadium (23V) has the electronic configuration: 1s2s2p63s23p63d4s2

### Anomalous electronic configurations

Chromium (\({}_{2}\)Cr) and copper (\({}_{2}\)Cu) have **anomalous** electronic configurations.

**Chromium (\({}_{2}\)Cr)**

**Actual configuration: 1s\({}^{2}\)2s\({}^{2}\)2p\({}^{6}\)3s\({}^{2}\)3p\({}^{6}\)3d\({}^{5}\)4s\({}^{1}\) or [Ar] 3d\({}^{5}\)4s\({}^{1}\)**

3d 4s (more stable)

**NOT**

3d 4s (less stable)

The energy difference between the 4s orbitals and 3d orbitals is minimal, so electrons occupy the 3d orbitals singly to **minimise inter-electronic repulsion** in the 4s orbital.

**Copper (\({}_{2}\)Cu)**

**Actual configuration: 1s\({}^{2}\)2s\({}^{2}\)2p\({}^{6}\)3s\({}^{2}\)3p\({}^{6}\)3d\({}^{10}\)4s\({}^{1}\) or [Ar] 3d\({}^{10}\)4s\({}^{1}\)**

3d 4s (less stable)

The half filled (e.g. Cr) and fully-filled 3d subshells (e.g. Cu) are unusually stable due to a **symmetrical distribution of electron density** around the nucleus.

### Electronic configuration of ions

lons are formed when atoms gain or lose electrons, usually to attain the stable electronic configuration of a noble gas.

#### 3.4.1 Formation of cations

To obtain a cation, electron(s) are **removed** from the orbitals with the **highest** energy.

#### 3.4.2 Formation of anions

To obtain an anion, electron(s) are **added** to the next available orbital.

Example:

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|} \hline particle & \({}_{15}\)P & \({}_{15}\)P\({}^{3-}\) \\ \hline electronic configuration & 1s\({}^{2}\) 2s\({}^{2}\) 2p\({}^{6}\) 3s\({}^{2}\) 3p\({}^{3}\) & [Ne] 3s\({}^{2}\) 3p\({}^{6}\) \\ \hline electron in box diagram of 3d and 4s subshell & 3s & 3p \\ \hline \end{tabular}

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|} \hline particle & \({}_{15}\)P & \({}_{15}\)P\({}^{3-}\) \\ \hline electronic configuration & 1s\({}^{2}\) 2s\({}^{2}\) 2p\({}^{6}\) 3s\({}^{2}\) 3p\({}^{3}\) & [Ne] 3s\({}^{2}\) 3p\({}^{6}\) \\ \hline electron in box diagram of 3d and 4s subshell & 3s & 3p \\ \hline \end{tabular}

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|} \hline Particle & electronic configuration & \\ \hline \({}_{g}\)O\({}^{2-}\) & 1s\({}^{2}\) 2s\({}^{2}\) 2p\({}^{6}\) & 3. \\ \hline \({}_{20}\)Ca\({}^{2+}\) & 1s\({}^{2}\) 2s\({}^{2}\) 2p\({}^{6}\) 3s\({}^{2}\) 3p\({}^{6}\) & \\ \hline \({}_{25}\)Mn\({}^{2+}\) & 1s\({}^{2}\) 2s\({}^{2}\) 2p\({}^{6}\) 3s\({}^{2}\) 3p\({}^{6}\) 3d\({}^{5}\) & \\ \hline \end{tabular}

### Isoelectronic configurations

* Different species with the **same number of electrons** are said to be **isoelectronic** with each other.

## 4 Periodic Properties

Atomic Structure (i) explain the factors influencing the ionisation energies of elements (see the _Data Booklet_) (see also topic: The Periodic Table) The Periodic Table (b) describe and explain qualitatively the general trends and variations in atomic radius, ionic radius, first ionisation energy and electronegativity (i) across a Period in terms of shielding and nuclear charge (ii) down a Group in terms of increasing number of electronic shells, shielding and nuclear charge

### Factors affecting trends in the Periodic Table

* [label=()]
* **Nuclear Charge*
* Nuclear charge is the **total positive charge of all the protons*
* in the nucleus.
* Hence nuclear charge increases with increasing number of protons.
* **The greater the nuclear charge, the stronger is the attraction for the valence electrons.*
* (b) **Shielding Effect (Screening Effect)*
* Shielding electrons are the inner shell electrons found in between the nucleus and the outermost electrons.
* **Shielding effect*
* refers to the shielding of electrons from the electrostatic attraction of the positively-charged nucleus.
The shielding electrons repel the outermost electrons which decreases the electrostatic attraction experienced by the outermost electrons. Electrons in the same shell exert a smaller shielding effect on one another. Hence shielding effect increases with increasing number of inner shell electrons.

(c) Effective Nuclear Charge
* The effective nuclear charge is the **net attraction** felt by the outermost electrons after taking into account **both** the nuclear charge and the shielding effect.
* The term "effective" is used because the shielding effect by the inner shell electrons prevents the valence electrons from experiencing the full nuclear charge of the nucleus. When increase in nuclear charge outweighs the increase in shielding effect, effective nuclear charge increases. Hence, there is stronger attraction between the nucleus and the valence electrons and vice versa.
* The **greater** the effective nuclear charge, the **stronger** is the net attraction of the outermost electrons to the positively charged nucleus and vice versa.

(d) Number of electronic shells
* As number of filled inner shells increases, the **distance between the valence electrons and nucleus increases**, resulting in **weaker attraction** between the valence electrons and nucleus.

### Ionisation Energy (I.E.)

* First ionisation energy is defined as the energy required to **remove one mole of electrons** from **one mole of gaseous atoms** to form **one mole of gaseous singly charged cation**. 

* Ionisation energies are **endothermic** (i.e. have positive values) as energy is **required** to overcome the force of attraction between the electrons and nucleus.

#### 4.2.1 Trend of I.E. across the period

* The number of protons increases across the period, hence **nuclear charge increases**.
* Successive electrons are being added to the **same outermost shell** thus **increase in shielding effect is negligible**.
* Since the increase in nuclear charge outweighs the increase in shielding effect, **effective nuclear charge increases**. Hence, the valence electrons are **more strongly attracted** to the nucleus.
* **More energy** is required to **remove the valence electrons**.
* Ionisation energies **generally increase** across the period.

#### 4.2.2 Irregularities in I.E. trend

1st I.E. of AI is lower than that of Mg 12Mg : 1s2 2s2 2p6 3s2 13A : 1s2 2s2 2p6 3s2 3p1
* In Mg, the first electron is removed from the 3**s** orbital, whereas for AI, the first electron is removed from the 3**p** orbital.
* The valence electron in the 3p orbital is **further** away from the nucleus than the 3s and experiences **additional shielding effect** by the 3s electrons.
* This factor **outweigh the effect of increase in nuclear charge** from Mg to AI.
* The valence electron in 3p orbital of AI experience **weaker attraction** to the nucleus and **requires less energy to be removed**. _(A similar explanation can be applied to Boron & Beryllium in Period 2.)_* In S, electron is removed from a paired electron occupying the same 3p orbital. Thus the electron **experience additional inter-electronic repulsion**.
* This factor **outweighs the effect of increase in nuclear charge** from P to S.
* The paired electron in 3p orbital of S experience **weaker attraction** to the nucleus and **requires less energy to be removed**.

_(A similar explanation can be applied to Oxygen & Nitrogen in Period 2.)_

#### 4.2.3 Trend of I.E. down the Group

* **Nuclear charge increases** as the number of protons increases down the Group,
* With an **increase in the number of inner shells,** the **valence electrons** are **further away** from the nucleus and **shielding effect increases**.
* The valence electrons are **less strongly attracted** to the nucleus and **less energy is required to **remove the valence electron**.
* Ionisation energies **decreases** down the group.

* **Exercise 5:** Why is the first ionisation energy of sodium much lower than that of neon?

* **The electron to be removed from Ne is from the** **zp orbital**, while that of Na is from the** **ss orbital**. With an increase in the number of inner shells, the electron in the 3s orbital is further away from the nucleus and shielding effect increases. The electron in the 3s orbital is less strongly attracted to the nucleus and requires less energy to be be removed.

### Atomic Radii

The atomic radius of an atom can be interpreted as the distance from the centre of the nucleus to the outermost shell of electrons, i.e.

Figure 1: Atomic radius of an atom can be interpreted as the distance from the centre of the nucleus to the outermost shell of electrons, i.e.

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:20]

#### 4.4.2 Anionic Radius

* The radius of an **anion** is **larger** than that of its parent atom.
* The number of protons in both the atom and its anion is the same, hence **nuclear charge remains constant**.
* The anion has **more electrons** than its atom.
* Hence, the **attraction** between the nucleus and its valence electrons **decreases**.

#### 4.4.3 Trend of Ionic Radius across the period

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|} \hline Group & 1 & 2 & 13 & 14 & 15 & 16 & 17 \\ \hline Element & Na & Mg & A/J & Si & P & S & C/I \\ \hline Ion & Na\({}^{+}\) & Mg\({}^{2+}\) & A/\({}^{3+}\) & Si\({}^{4+}\) & P\({}^{3-}\) & S\({}^{2-}\) & C/I\({}^{-}\) \\ \hline Ionic radius / nm & 0.095 & 0.065 & 0.050 & 0.041 & 0.212 & 0.184 & 0.181 \\ \hline \end{tabular}

**Ionic radius of cations: Na\({}^{+}\)\(>\) Mg\({}^{2+}\)\(>\) A/\({}^{3+}\)\(>\) Si\({}^{4+}\)**

**Ionic radius of anions: P\({}^{3-}\)\(>\) S\({}^{2-}\)\(>\) C/I**

* The **nuclear charge increases** due to increasing number of protons.
* The cations (or anions) are **isoelectronic**. Hence, **shielding effect** is the **same**.
* **Effective nuclear charge increases** and the valence electrons are **more strongly attracted** to the nucleus. Hence, **ionic radius decreases**.

**Ionic radius of cations < anions**

* For example, ionic radius of P\({}^{3-}\)\(>\) A/\({}^{3+}\)

* A\({}^{3+}\): 1s\({}^{2}\) 2s\({}^{2}\) 2p\({}^{6}\) 3s\({}^{2}\) 3p\({}^{6}\)
* P\({}^{3-}\) has 2 more proton than A/\({}^{3+}\) and hence a **greater nuclear charge**.
* P\({}^{3-}\) has **one more shell of electrons** than A/\({}^{3+}\). The valence electrons of P\({}^{3-}\) are **further** away from the nucleus. Hence, **shielding effect increases**.
* The increase in shielding effect outweighs the increase in nuclear charge. Hence, **effective nuclear charge decreases**.
* The valence electrons are **less strongly attracted** to the nucleus. Hence, ionic radius of P\({}^{3-}\) is **larger** than that of A/\({}^{3+}\).

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:22]

An atom that is _more electronegative_ is likely to have a _higher electron density_ when it is bonded in a molecule. For example, the higher electron density on F atom in the covalent molecule of hydrogen fluoride as F is more electronegative.

#### 4.5.1 Trend of electronegativity across the period

* The number of protons increases across the period, hence **nuclear charge increases**.
* Successive electrons are being added to the **same outermost shell** thus **increase in shielding effect is negligible**.
* Since the increase in nuclear charge outweighs the increase in shielding effect, effective nuclear charge increases. Hence, the **ability of an atom to attract bonding electrons** to itself **increases**.
* Electronegativity **increases** across the period.

#### 4.5.2 Trend of electronegativity down the group

* **Nuclear charge increases** as the number of protons increases down the Group,
* With an **increase in the number of inner shells,** the **valence electrons** are **further away** from the nucleus and **shielding effect increases**.
* The **ability of an atom to attract bonding electrons** to itself **decreases**.
* Electronegativity **decreases** down the Group.

## 5 Experimental Determination of Ionisation Energies

* deduce the electronic configurations of elements from successive ionisation energy data
* interpret successive ionisation energy data of an element in terms of the position of that element within the Periodic Table.

### Successive ionisation energy

* The successive ionisation energies of an element **increase**.
* The number of electrons decreases but number of protons remain the same.
* **Stronger attraction between the nucleus and remaining electrons.**
* **More energy is required to remove an electron from increasingly positively-charged ion.**

### Large increase in ionisation energy

* There is a **large increase in I.E.** from the first to second I.E.
* Na: 1s\({}^{2}\)2s\({}^{2}\)2p\({}^{6}\)s\({}^{1}\)Na*: 1s\({}^{2}\)2s\({}^{2}\)2p\({}^{6}\)**

The first electron is removed from an outer shell, while the second electron is from an **inner shell** which is much **closer** to the nucleus.
* **Stronger attraction between the nucleus and the electron.**
* **Much more energy** is required to **remove** this electron.

_How would you explain the large increase between the 9th I.E. and 10th I.E?_

### Determining the Group number from successive ionisation data

From the successive ionisation energies values for an element, one can determine the Group of the element.

Example:

A **large** increase from the 1st IE to the 2nd IE indicates that the element has 1 valence electron (valence electronic configuration is ns') as the second electron is removed from an inner shell. The second electron is more strongly attracted to the nucleus and requires a larger amount of energy to remove. Hence, the element is from Group 1.

**Exercise 7:**

The successive ionisation energies, in kJ mol-1, of an element X are given below.

870 1800 3000 3600 5800 7000 13200

What group does X belong to?

**Thinking process :**

What is successive I.E.?

How to make sense of the

successive I.E data and the group?

**C** Group 16

**D** Group 17

**Self- Check: Q11**

**Across the Period,**

* The number of protons increases across the period, hence **nuclear charge increases**.
* Successive electrons are being added to the **same outermost shell** thus **increase in shielding effect is negligible**.
* Since the increase in nuclear charge outweighs the increase in shielding effect, effective nuclear charge increases.
* The valence electrons are **more strongly attracted*
* to the nucleus.
* Atomic radius **decreases*
* across the period.
* The **ability of an atom to attract bonding electrons*
* to itself **increases**.
* Electronegativity **increases*
* across the period.
* More energy is required to remove the valence electrons.
* Ionisation energies **generally increase*
* across the period.

**Down the Group,**

* **Nuclear charge increases*
* as the number of protons increases down the Group,
* With an **increase in the number of inner shells,*
* the **valence electrons*
* are **further away*
* from the nucleus and **shielding effect increases**.
* The valence electrons are **less strongly attracted*
* to the nucleus.
* Atomic radius **increases*
* down the group.
* The **ability of an atom to attract bonding electrons*
* to itself **decreases**.
* Electronegativity **decreases*
* down the Group.
* The valence electrons are **less strongly attracted*
* to the nucleus and **less energy is required to remove*
* the valence electron.
* Ionisation energies **decreases*
* down the group.

## Appendix A Uses of Radioactive Isotopes

The advantage of a radioisotope is that its position can be detected very easily by the radiation which it emits. It has wide applications in various fields like medicine, agriculture, etc. In agriculture, radioactive phosphorus (\({}^{32}\)P) is used in the study of metabolism of plants. Radioactive sulfur (\({}^{35}\)S) helps to study advantages and disadvantages of fungicides. Carbon dating involves using the naturally occurring radioisotope carbon-14 (\({}^{14}\)C) and one of the most frequent uses is to estimate the age of organic remains from archaeological sites.

## Appendix B Recent discoveries

As you may have learnt recently, 30 December 2015 IUPAC (the International Unions of Pure and Applied Chemistry) announced the claims for the discovery of four elements (proton numbers 113, 115, 117 and 118) had been accepted. This is in spite of the fact that the Periodic Table had these empty spots and that even as early 1976 suggestions of such elements had been proposed and yet it took close to 40 years before this could be announced by IUPAC to the rest of the world.

Was this due to laziness of scientists in these boards or that of the personal reasons? This was not so. Science is an evidence-based enterprise that is concerned with the natural world and needed the consensus within a community of scientists through critical debate and peer review before the knowledge could be certified as reliable and durable until proven otherwise. Independent teams of scientists in both Russia and Japan were tasked assess the validity of the claim from the years of 2004 to 2012, before IUPAC made the official announcement.
