## 1 Theories of Acids and Bases

* (a) show understanding of and apply the Arrhenius theory of acids and bases (b) show understanding of and apply the Bronsted-Lowy theory of acids and bases, including the concept of conjugate acids and conjugate bases (c) show understanding of and apply the Lewis theory of acids and bases (including non-aqueous system, e.g. reaction between BF\({}_{3}\) and NH\({}_{3}\)).

The concept of acids and bases has developed over time as chemists sought a model that could accurately classify, rationalise and predict acid-base chemistry. The Greeks first identified acids based on properties such as having a sour taste (the Latin word for sour is _Acidus_) and whether the substance could change the colour of some plant extracts.

The first historical concept developed came from Antoine Lavoisier, who proposed that all acids contain oxygen (e.g. HNO\({}_{3}\)). This was refuted by Humphry Davy, who found that hydrochloric acid has acidic properties, even though it does not contain oxygen. The next significant concept came from Justus von Liebig, who analysed empirical data and proposed that acids contained hydrogen, which is replaced by a metal, producing hydrogen gas (acid-metal reaction).

This was the paradigm for about 50 years until Svante Arrhenius put forth his theory of acids and bases in 1884. This became the foundation of the modern idea of acids and bases, which was further advanced by Johannes Bronsted, Thomas Lowry and Gilbert Newton Lewis. The findings of these chemists brought us to our current understanding of acids and bases.

We will explore the strengths and limitations of the different models proposed to explain the characteristics of acids and bases, namely the Arrhenius Theory, the Bronsted-Lowry Theory, and the Lewis Theory.

Each theory starts off with either the proposal of a hypothesis to explain empirical data, or to address the limitations of a previous theory. With each iteration, we obtain a better understanding of the science behind acids and bases. This is the nature of scientific knowledge.

(see **Example 1A**, 1)

You will realise that the Arrhenius theory is a sub-set of the Bransted-Lowry theory. The concept of the generation of H+ and OH- ions in the Arrhenius theory is linked to the concept of proton donors (H+ generated) and proton acceptors (OH+ generated to accept H+) in the Bransted-Lowry theory. The Bransted-Lowry theory too is a sub-set of the Lewis theory, which involves electron pair-donors (OH+ donates its lone pair to H+) and acceptors (H+ accepts a lone pair from OH-).

### The Hydrogen Ion

Central to the Arrhenius and Bransted-Lowry definition of an acid is the hydrogen ion or **proton**, a fundamental particle. It is very small (\(10^{-15}\) m diameter) compared to other cations (around \(10^{-10}\) m diameter), and thus has a very **high charge density** (charge density \(\propto\frac{q_{s}}{r_{*}}\)). As such the proton does not exist on its own and a Bransted-Lowry acid does not dissociate to give an isolated H+.

Rather a Bransted-Lowry acid attracts a lone pair of electrons of a particle, the Bransted-Lowry base, and transfer the H+ to (_i.e. protonate_) the base:

An Arrhenius acid is thus a special case of a Bransted-Lowry acid in _aqueous medium_, where water serves as the Bransted-Lowry base to generate the **hydronium ion**, H3O+ ion:

It is important to note that both symbols, H+(aq) and H3O+(aq) can be used to represent the hydronium ion, H3O+, and are often used interchangeably. H+(aq) is more commonly used for simplicity's sake. H3O+ is also sometimes referred to as the 'hydroxonium ion' or 'oxonium ion'.

For the rest of this topic of Acid-Base Equilibria, we will be concerned primarily with Bransted-Lowry acids and bases in water.

## Appendix A Acid-Base Equilibria

### Example A

1 Most commercially available concentrated nitric acid has a concentration of 68% in water.

\(\text{HNO}_{3}(\text{aq})+\text{H}_{2}O(l)\to\text{H}_{3}\text{O}^{+}(\text{aq})+ \text{NO}_{3}^{-}(\text{aq})\)

When mixed with concentrated sulfuric acid, it reacts to form the nitronium ion, \(\text{NO}_{2}^{+}\):

\(\text{HNO}_{3}+\text{H}_{2}\text{SO}_{4}\rightleftharpoons\text{H}_{2}\text{NO}_ {3}^{+}+\text{H}\text{SO}_{4}^{-}\)

\(\text{H}_{2}\text{NO}_{3}^{+}+\text{H}_{2}\text{SO}_{4}\rightleftharpoons\text{NO}_{2}^{+}+ \text{H}_{3}\text{O}^{+}+\text{H}\text{SO}_{4}^{-}\)

Explain whether HNO\({}_{3}\) is a Bronsted-Lowry acid, base, or both.

\(\text{HNO}_{3}\) can be, depending on _what it reacts with_.

* HNO\({}_{3}\) acts as a Bronsted-Lowry when reacting with water as it a proton to water (_i.e._ the Bronsted-Lowry base) to give H\({}_{3}\)O\({}^{+}\).
* HNO\({}_{3}\) acts as a Bronsted-Lowry when reacting with H\({}_{2}\)SO\({}_{4}\) as it a proton from H\({}_{2}\)SO\({}_{4}\) (_i.e._ the Bronsted Lowry acid) to give H\({}_{2}\)NO\({}_{3}^{+}\).

### Example A

1 An aqueous solution of boric acid is weakly acidic:

\(\text{B}(\text{OH})_{3}(\text{aq})+\text{H}_{2}O(l)\rightleftharpoons\text{H}^{+}( \text{aq})+\text{[B}(\text{OH})_{4}]^{-}(\text{aq})\)

Explain which type of acid (Arrhenius, Bronsted-Lowry or Lewis) boric acid belongs to.

Boric acid is \(\text{B}(\text{OH})_{3}\) itself, but from the H\({}_{2}\)O it reacts with.

Boric acid is \(\text{since it does not donate a proton.}\)

Boric acid is \(\text{since it accepts a lone pair of electrons from O of H\({}_{2}\)O to give H\({}^{+}\)[B(OH)_{4}]^{-}\) which then dissociates to give H\({}^{+}\)(aq).

## 3 Water as Solvent

Water can act as both a Bronsted-Lowry acid and a Bronsted-Lowry base. In the process called **auto-ionisation**, water can react with itself in a reversible acid-base reaction represented by the following equation:

From the auto-ionisation, we can see that water gives H\({}_{3}\)O\({}^{+}\)(aq) as its conjugate acid, and OH-(aq) as its conjugate base. Hence, **when water is used as the solvent, all acids produce H\({}_{3}\)O\({}^{+}\)(aq), while all bases produce OH-(aq)**. In this way, the Bronsted-Lowry definition of acids and bases corresponds to that of Arrhenius.

### Ionic Product of Water, \(K_{w}\)

LO (e) explain the terms pH; \(K_{\mathrm{a}}\); pK\({}_{\mathrm{a}}\); K\({}_{\mathrm{b}}\); pK\({}_{\mathrm{b}}\); \(K_{w}\) and apply them in calculations, including the relationship \(K_{w}\) = \(K_{\mathrm{a}}K_{\mathrm{b}}\)

At equilibrium, the equilibrium constant \(K_{\mathrm{c}}\) for the auto-ionisation of water is represented by

\[K_{\mathrm{c}}=\left[H_{3}O^{+}\right]_{\mathrm{e}om}\left[OH^{-}\right]_{ \mathrm{e}om}\]

Due to the ubiquitous nature of water in chemical systems, this equilibrium constant is given a special name, called the **tonic product of water**, \(K_{w}\).

For **pure water at 298K (25 \({}^{\circ}\)C)**, the ionic product of water, \(K_{w}\) = 10\({}^{-14}\) mol\({}^{2}\) dm\({}^{-6}\).

At this temperature, the **concentration of H\({}_{3}\)O\({}^{+}\) ions** in water can be calculated in the following way:

Since [H\({}_{3}\)O\({}^{+}\)] = [OH\({}^{-}\)] in pure H\({}_{2}\)O,

\[K_{w} =\left[H_{3}O^{+}\right]\left[OH^{-}\right]=10^{-14}\] \[=\left[OH^{-}\right]=\sqrt{10^{-14}}\] \[=10^{-7}\) mol dm\({}^{-3}\]

Since \(K_{w}\) is an equilibrium constant, **its value will change when temperature changes**. The variation of \(K_{w}\) values of pure water with temperature, \(T\), is shown in the table below:

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|} \hline \(T\)\({}^{\circ}\)C & \(K_{w}\)/mol\({}^{2}\) dm\({}^{-6}\) & \(T\)\({}^{\circ}\)C & \(K_{w}\)/mol\({}^{2}\) dm\({}^{-6}\) \\ \hline
0 & \(0.114\times 10^{-14}\) & 40 & \(2.916\times 10^{-14}\) \\ \hline
10 & \(0.293\times 10^{-14}\) & 50 & \(5.476\times 10^{-14}\) \\ \hline
20 & \(0.681\times 10^{-14}\) & 100 & \(51.3\times 10^{-14}\) \\ \hline \end{tabular}

When the temperature increases, the forward endothermic reaction is favoured to absorb the extra heat energy. Hence, water dissociates more at higher temperatures, and both [H\({}_{3}\)O\({}^{+}\)] and [OH\({}^{+}\)] atequilibrium increases, leading to larger values of \(K_{w}\). We will examine the consequences of this in the next section.

### pH and pOH

* (e) explain the terms pH; \(K_{\text{s}}\); \(pK_{\text{a}}\); \(K_{\text{b}}\); \(pK_{\text{b}}\); \(K_{w}\) and apply them in calculations, including the relationship \(K_{w}=K_{\text{a}}K_{\text{b}}\) (f) calculate [H+(aq)] and pH values for strong acids, weak monobasic (monoprotic) acids, strong bases, and weak monoacidic bases

* pH is a measure of the concentration of hydrogen ions in a solution, and is defined as the negative logarithm of the hydrogen ion concentration in mol dm-3.

* pH = -lg[H_3O+] Note: pH does **not** have units

* a solution that has a **lower pH** has a **higher [H_3O+]** than a solution with a higher pH.

* pOH on the other hand is a measure of the concentration of hydroxide ions in a solution. It is defined as the negative logarithm of the hydroxide ion concentration in mol dm-3.

* pOH = -lg[OH+] Note: pOH does **not** have units

* A solution that has a **lower pOH** has a **higher [OH+]** than a solution with a higher pOH.

* **Relationship between pH and pOH**

* For **aqueous** solutions at **298 K**,

\[K_{w}=\begin{bmatrix}H_{3}O^{\ast}\end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}OH^{\ast}\end{bmatrix} =10^{-14}\] \[-lg\begin{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}H_{3}O^{\ast}\end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix}OH^{\ast}\end{bmatrix}\end{bmatrix} =-lg\begin{bmatrix}10^{-14}\end{bmatrix}\] \[\begin{pmatrix}-lg\begin{bmatrix}H_{3}O^{\ast}\end{bmatrix} \end{pmatrix} +\begin{pmatrix}-lg\begin{bmatrix}OH^{\ast}\end{bmatrix}\end{pmatrix} =-lg\begin{pmatrix}10^{-14}\end{pmatrix}\] Therefore,

**Checkpoint for Section 3**

At the end of this section, you should know that:

1. The ionic product of water, \(K_{\mathrm{w}}\) = [H+]\({}_{\mathrm{e}om}\) [OH+]\({}_{\mathrm{e}om}\) = 10\({}^{-14}\) mol\({}^{2}\) dm\({}^{-6}\) at 298 K.
2. p\(K_{\mathrm{w}}\) = 14 at 298 K (25 \({}^{\circ}\)C).
3. pH is a measure of [H+] and is calculated by pH = -lg [H+].
4. pOH is a measure of [OH-] and is calculated by pOH = -lg [OH+].
5. Strength of an acid, HA, depends on the position of the equilibrium:
6. Strength of a base, B, depends on the position of the equilibrium:
7. A strong acid dissociates completely in water to form H\({}_{3}\)O+(aq).
8. A weak acid dissociates partially in water to form H\({}_{3}\)O+(aq).
9. A strong base dissociates completely in water to form OH-(aq).
10. A weak base dissociates partially in water to form OH-(aq).

## 4 Comparing the Strength of Acids and Bases

### pH

Is pH a good measure of the strength of acids and bases in water?

The pH of 1 mol dm\({}^{-3}\) ethanoic acid, CH\({}_{3}\)CO\({}_{2}\)H(aq), is approximately pH 2.4.

The pH of 1 \(\times\) 10\({}^{-3}\) mol dm\({}^{-3}\) hydrochloric acid, HC\(\left(\text{aq}\right)\), is pH 3.

We know that

* CH\({}_{3}\)CO\({}_{2}\)H is a weak acid as \(\left[\text{H}^{+}\left(\text{aq}\right)\right]\)\(\ll\)\(\left[\text{CH}_{3}\)CO\({}_{2}\)H(aq)\(\right]_{\text{initial}}\), _i.e._ CH\({}_{3}\)CO\({}_{2}\)H partially dissociates,
* HC\(\left.l\right.\)is a strong acid as \(\left[\text{H}^{+}\left(\text{aq}\right)\right]\)\(=\)\(\left[\text{HC}\left(\text{aq}\right)\right]_{\text{initial}}\), _i.e._ HC\(\left.l\right.\)fully dissociates in water

However, the pH of aqueous solution of the weak acid is lower, _i.e._ more acidic, than that of the strong acid! The reason is pretty obvious. The concentration of the ethanoic acid (1 mol dm\({}^{-3}\)) is much higher than that of the strong acid (1 \(\times\) 10\({}^{-3}\) mol dm\({}^{-3}\)).

pH is **not** a good measure of the strength of acids and bases in water. pH will give an indication of the strength of the acid **only** if the acids compared have the **same initial concentration**, **same vorticity/basicity** and are at the **same temperature**. In this situation, the acid with a lower pH will be a stronger acid.

So, the pH of 1 \(\times\) 10\({}^{-3}\) mol dm\({}^{-3}\) CH\({}_{3}\)CO\({}_{2}\)H is approximately 3.9, which is higher than for of HC\(\left.l\right.\)of the same concentration, showing that CH\({}_{3}\)CO\({}_{2}\)H is a weaker acid than HC\(\left.l\right.\)

In 1 \(\times\) 10\({}^{-3}\) mol dm\({}^{-3}\) HCl, at pH 3.0, \(\left[\text{H}^{+}\left(\text{aq}\right)\right]\)\(=\) 10\({}^{-3.0}\) = 1\(\times\) 10\({}^{-3}\) mol dm\({}^{-3}\), while in 1 \(\times\) 10\({}^{-3}\) mol dm\({}^{-3}\) CH\({}_{3}\)CO\({}_{2}\)H, at pH 3.9, \(\left[\text{H}^{+}\left(\text{aq}\right)\right]\)\(=\) 10\({}^{-3.9}\) = 1.3\(\times\) 10\({}^{-4}\) mol dm\({}^{-3}\).

Does it mean that the 25.0 cm\({}^{3}\) of 1 \(\times\) 10\({}^{-3}\) mol dm\({}^{-3}\) of HC\(\left.l\right.\)will require more NaOH for complete neutralisation, compared to 25.0 cm\({}^{3}\) of 1 \(\times\) 10\({}^{-3}\) mol dm\({}^{-3}\) of CH\({}_{3}\)CO\({}_{2}\)H?

\[\text{H}^{+}(\text{aq})+\text{OH}^{+}(\text{aq})\rightarrow\text{H}_{2}\text{O} (l)\]

**NO!**

 Removal of H\({}^{+}\)(aq) by OH\({}^{-}\)(aq) will cause the equilibrium CH\({}_{3}\)CO\({}_{2}\)H(aq) \(\rightleftharpoons\) CH\({}_{3}\)CO\({}_{2}^{-}\)(aq) + H\({}^{+}\)(aq) to shift to the right, until eventually all the CH\({}_{3}\)CO\({}_{2}\)H dissociates and reacts with NaOH fully!A Acid-Base Equilibria

We have seen in Section 3.3 that the strength of an acid depends on the _position_ of the equilibrium

\[\text{HA(aq)}+\text{H}_{2}\text{O}(l)\rightleftharpoons{\text{H}_{3}\text{O}^{*} \text{(aq)}+\text{A}^{-}\text{(aq)}}\]

Hence, the equilibrium constant, \(K_{\text{c}}\), which measures the extent of an equilibrium reaction _independent of the initial concentrations_ is a more appropriate measure of the strength of an acid.

\begin{tabular}{|l|} \hline LO (e) explain the terms pH; \(K_{\text{a}}\); \(\text{p}K_{\text{a}}\); \(K_{\text{b}}\); \(\text{p}K_{\text{b}}\); \(K_{w}\) and apply them in calculations, including the relationship \(K_{w}=K_{\text{a}}K_{\text{b}}\) \\ \hline \end{tabular}

### Acid Dissociation Constant, \(K_{\text{a}}\)

Consider the partial dissociation of a weak monobasic acid, HA(aq):

\[\text{HA(aq)}+\text{H}_{2}\text{O}(l)\rightleftharpoons{\text{H}_{3}\text{O}^{ *}\text{(aq)}+\text{A}^{-}\text{(aq)}}\]

Since water is the solvent in the system, we can write the equilibrium constant, which is known as the **acid dissociation constant**, \(K_{\text{a}}\).

\begin{tabular}{|l|} \hline \(K_{\text{a}}=\frac{\left[\text{H}_{3}\text{O}^{*}\right]_{\text{eom}}\left[ \text{A}^{-}\right]_{\text{eom}}}{\left[\text{HA}\right]_{\text{eom}}}\) \\ \hline \end{tabular}

units: mol dm\({}^{-3}\) \\ \end{tabular}

Since \(K_{\text{a}}\) is an equilibrium constant, it is **constant** at **constant temperature**.

The \(K_{\text{a}}\) values of different acids can be used to compare the **strength** of weak acids as it gives us a quantitative indication of the extent to which the acid is dissociated. However, as \(K_{\text{a}}\) values are typically very small for weak acids, it is usually more convenient to compare the acid strength using \(\text{p}K_{\text{a}}\) values.

\begin{tabular}{|l|} \hline \(\text{p}K_{\text{a}}=-\text{lg}K_{\text{a}}\) \\ \hline \end{tabular}

Note: p\(K_{\text{a}}\) does **not** have units \\ \hline \end{tabular}

The dissociation constants of some weak acids in water at 25 \({}^{\circ}\)C are given in the table below:

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|} \hline
**acids** & \(K_{\text{a}}\) / mol dm\({}^{-3}\) & p\(K_{\text{a}}\) \\ \hline HF(aq) & \(6.76\times 10^{-4}\) & 3.17 \\ \hline C\({}_{6}\)H\({}_{5}\)CO\({}_{2}\)H(aq) & \(6.31\times 10^{-5}\) & 4.20 \\ \hline CH\({}_{3}\)CO\({}_{2}\)H(aq) & \(1.75\times 10^{-5}\) & 4.76 \\ \hline HCN(aq) & \(6.17\times 10^{-10}\) & 9.21 \\ \hline C\({}_{6}\)H\({}_{5}\)OH(aq) & \(1.12\times 10^{-10}\) & 9.95 \\ \hline \end{tabular}

Note: \(K_{\text{a}}\) value or **smaller** p\(K_{\text{a}}\) value \(\Rightarrow\)**Stronger** acid, and _vice versa_.

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|} \hline
**dissociation** & **equilibrium** & \(K_{\text{a}}\) / mol dm-3 & p\(K_{\text{a}}\) \\ \hline first, \(K_{\text{a1}}\) & H\({}_{3}\)PO\({}_{4}\)(aq) + H\({}_{2}\)O(\(l\)) \(\rightleftharpoons\) H\({}_{3}\)O\({}^{+}\)(aq) + H\({}_{2}\)PO\({}_{4}\)(aq) & 7.08 \(\times\) 10-3 & 2.15 \\ \hline second, \(K_{\text{a2}}\) & H\({}_{2}\)PO\({}_{4}\)(aq) + H\({}_{2}\)O(\(l\)) \(\rightleftharpoons\) H\({}_{3}\)O\({}^{+}\)(aq) + HPO\({}_{4}\)(aq) & 6.31 \(\times\) 10-8 & 7.20 \\ \hline third, \(K_{\text{a3}}\) & HPO\({}_{4}\)2-(aq) + H\({}_{2}\)O(\(l\)) \(\rightleftharpoons\) H\({}_{3}\)O\({}^{+}\)(aq) + PO\({}_{4}\)3-(aq) & 4.47 \(\times\) 10-13 & 12.35 \\ \hline \end{tabular} From the table, you will notice that the value of \(K_{\text{a}}\) decreases upon each dissociation, _i.e._\(K_{\text{a2}}<K_{\text{a1}}\) and \(K_{\text{a3}}<K_{\text{a2}}\). This is because it is **more difficult to lose a proton** due to the **stronger electrostatic forces of attraction** between the **increasingly negatively charged conjugate base and the proton.

### Base Dissociation Constant, \(K_{\text{b}}\)

Consider the partial dissociation of a weak monoacidic base, B(aq):

\[\text{B(aq)}+\text{H}_{2}\text{O($l$)}\rightleftharpoons\text{BH}^{+}\text{(aq) }+\text{OH}^{+}\text{(aq)}\]

Like how \(K_{\text{a}}\) is derived, we can derive the **base dissociation constant**, \(K_{\text{b}}\) and p\(K_{\text{b}}\) of a weak base:

\[K_{\text{b}}=\frac{\left[\text{BH}^{+}\right]_{\text{gen}}\left[\text{OH}^{-} \right]_{\text{gen}}}{\left[\text{B}\right]_{\text{gen}}}\qquad\text{units : mol dm}^{-3}\]

\[\text{p}K_{\text{b}}=-\text{lg}K_{\text{b}}\qquad\text{Note: p}K_{\text{b}}\text{ does **not** have units}\]

\(K_{\text{b}}\) and p\(K_{\text{b}}\) values can be used to compare the strength of the weak bases.

The dissociation constants of some weak bases in water at 25 \({}^{\text{o}}\)C are given in the table below:

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|} \hline
**bases** & **formula** & \(K_{\text{b}}\) / mol dm-3 \\ \hline ethylamine & CH\({}_{3}\)CH\({}_{2}\)NH\({}_{2}\) & 5.62 \(\times\) 10-4 \\ \hline methylamine & CH\({}_{3}\)NH\({}_{2}\) & 4.54 \(\times\) 10-4 \\ \hline ammonia & NH\({}_{3}\) & 1.74 \(\times\) 10-5 \\ \hline phenylamine & C\({}_{6}\)H\({}_{5}\)NH\({}_{2}\) & 4.27 \(\times\) 10-10 \\ \hline \end{tabular}

Note: Larger \(K_{\text{b}}\) value or smaller p\(K_{\text{b}}\) value \(\Rightarrow\)Stronger base, and vice versa.

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:18]

### Degree of Dissociation, \(\alpha\) (not in H1 syllabus)

The fraction of acid or base molecules which is dissociated into ions in water, is known as the **degree of dissociation**, \(\alpha\).

\[\alpha=\frac{\text{amount dissociated}}{\text{total initial amount}}\]

In general, the degree of dissociation is **close to 1** for **strong** acids and bases, and **\(\ll\)1** for **weak** acids and bases. The degree of dissociation is sometimes represented by a percentage, _i.e._ close to 100% for strong acids and bases, and \(\ll\)100% for weak acids and bases.

Consider a weak acid, HA with concentration \(c\) mol dm\({}^{-3}\), and a degree of dissociation \(\alpha\):

\[\text{HA(aq)}\quad+\quad\text{H}_{2}\text{O}(\hat{l})\quad \rightleftharpoons\quad\text{H}_{3}\text{O}^{\ast}(\text{aq})\quad+\quad\text{A}^{ \ast}(\text{aq})\] \[\text{initial concentration/ mol dm${}^{-3}$}\quad c\quad\quad\quad\quad \quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad 0\] \[\text{change in concentration/ mol dm${}^{-3}$}\quad-c\alpha\quad\quad\quad \quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad \quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad+c \alpha\] \[\text{equilibrium concentration/ mol dm${}^{-3}$}\quad c\left(1-\alpha\right)\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad c \alpha\] \[\text{Using }\mathcal{K}_{\text{a}}=\frac{\left[\text{H}_{3}\text{O}^{ \ast}\right]_{\text{eqm}}\left[\text{A}^{\ast}\right]_{\text{eqm}}}{\left[ \text{HA}\right]_{\text{eqm}}}\,,\] \[\mathcal{K}_{\text{a}}=\frac{\left(c\alpha\right)\left(c\alpha \right)}{c\left(1-\alpha\right)}=\frac{\alpha^{2}c}{\left(1-\alpha\right)}\]

For a weak acid, since \(\alpha\ll 1\), hence, \(1-\alpha\approx 1\)

\[\mathcal{K}_{\text{a}}=\alpha^{2}c\quad\text{or}\quad\alpha=\sqrt{\frac{ \mathcal{K}_{\text{a}}}{c}}\]

Since \(c=\left[\text{HA}\right]_{\text{initial}}\),

\[\mathcal{K}_{\text{a}}=\alpha^{2}\left[\text{HA}\right]_{\text{initial}}\quad \text{or}\quad\alpha=\sqrt{\frac{\mathcal{K}_{\text{a}}}{\left[\text{HA} \right]_{\text{initial}}}}\]

Similarly for bases,

\[\mathcal{K}_{\text{b}}=\alpha^{2}\left[\text{B}\right]_{\text{initial}}\quad \text{or}\quad\alpha=\sqrt{\frac{\mathcal{K}_{\text{b}}}{\left[\text{B} \right]_{\text{initial}}}}\]

From the equations, we can see that \(\alpha\)**is dependent on the initial concentration of the acid or base**. The more dilute the acid or base, the more it dissociates. For example, the value of \(\alpha\) is 0.00417 (_i.e._ 0.4% dissociated) for 1 mol dm\({}^{-3}\) CH\({}_{3}\)CO\({}_{2}\)H, but 0.0417 (_i.e._ 4.2% dissociated) for 0.01 mol dm\({}^{-3}\) CH\({}_{3}\)CO\({}_{2}\)H, and 0.417 (_i.e._ 41.7% dissociated) for 0.0001 mol dm\({}^{-3}\) CH\({}_{3}\)CO\({}_{2}\)H.

\[\alpha=\sqrt{\frac{K_{\text{b}}}{\left[\text{B}\right]_{\text{Innal}}}}\text{ respectively.}\]

For _weak acid_, at initial concentration between \(1\times 10^{-4}\) mol dm\({}^{-3}\) and \(1\times 10^{-6}\) mol dm\({}^{-3}\).

* For CH\({}_{3}\)CO\({}_{2}\)H, \(\sqrt{K_{a}\times[CH_{3}CO_{2}H]}>\left[H^{+}\right]\) as the approximation that \([CH_{3}CO_{2}H]_{\text{eom}}\approx[CH_{3}CO_{2}H]_{\text{initial}}\) (see Section 5.2) breaks down, because the degree of dissociation, \(\alpha\), increases with dilution. So \([CH_{3}CO_{2}H]_{\text{eom}}\approx[CH_{3}CO_{2}H]_{\text{initial}}-[H^{+}]\) instead.
* For the even weaker acid, \(C_{6}H_{5}OH\), \(\sqrt{K_{a}\times[C_{6}H_{5}OH]}<\left[H^{+}\right]\) as \([H^{+}]\) from the acid is too low to suppress the auto-ionisation of water and H\({}^{+}\) from water contributes significantly to the total \([H^{+}]\) at concentration of \(1\times 10^{-4}\) mol dm\({}^{-3}\) and lower.

For simplicity, H\({}^{+}\)(aq) from auto-ionisation of the water solvent is taken into considerations if the **initial concentration of the acid is _lower_ than \(1\times 10^{-7}\) mol dm\({}^{-3}\).

So, for _dilute solutions_ (\(<1\times 10^{-7}\) mol dm\({}^{-3}\)) of

* _strong acids_, H\({}^{+}\) from the water solvent is taken into considerations by simply **adding \(1\times 10^{-7}\) mol dm\({}^{-3}\)** to the \([H^{+}]\) from the strong acid itself.
* _weak acids_, we assume that the weak acid is **fully ionised**, behaving just like a strong acid, and can be treated in the same way by **adding \(1\times 10^{-7}\) mol dm\({}^{-3}\)** to the \([H^{+}]\) from the weak acid itself.

Example 65 - - pH of dilute atomic acid

Calculate the pH of \(10^{-8}\) mol dm\({}^{-3}\) nitric acid.

\[\begin{array}{c}\text{HNO}_{3}(\text{aq})+H_{2}O(\textit{l})\rightarrowH_{3} O^{*}(\text{aq})+\text{NO}_{3}\text{-}(\text{aq})\\ H_{2}O(\textit{l})+H_{2}O(\textit{l})\rightleftharpoonsH_{3}O^{*}(\text{aq})+ OH^{*}(\text{aq})\end{array}\]

Due to the **low concentration** (_i.e._\(\leq\)**10\({}^{-7}\) mol dm\({}^{-3}\))** of HNO\({}_{3}\), contribution of \(H_{3}O^{+}\) from the **autolisation of water** is **significant** and should not be ignored.

**Checkpoint for Section 5**

At the end of this section, you should know that:

1. For a weak monobasic acid, \(\left[H^{+}\right]_{\text{eom}}=\sqrt{K_{a}\left[HA\right]_{\text{netal}}}\).
2. For a weak monoacidic base, \(\left[OH^{-}\right]_{\text{eom}}=\sqrt{K_{b}\left[B\right]_{\text{netal}}}\).

### Calculating pH of Salt Solutions

[0.5cm] Example 6A

Calculate the pH of 0.10 mol dm\({}^{-3}\) NH\({}_{4}\)_Cl_, given \(K_{\rm a}\) of NH\({}_{4}^{+}\) = 5.75 \(\times\) 10\({}^{-10}\) mol dm\({}^{-3}\).

NH\({}_{4}^{+}\)(aq) + H\({}_{2}\)O(_l_) \(\rightleftharpoons\) NH\({}_{3}\)(aq) + H\({}_{3}\)O\({}^{+}\)(aq)

NH\({}_{4}^{+}\)(aq) + H\({}_{2}\)O(_l_) \(\rightleftharpoons\) NH\({}_{3}\)(aq) + H\({}_{3}\)O\({}^{+}\)(aq)

initial conc/ mol dm\({}^{-3}\) 0.10 0 0 0 change in conc/ mol dm\({}^{-3}\) -\(x\) +\(x\) +\(x\) equilibrium conc/ mol dm\({}^{-3}\) 0.10-\(x\) \(x\) \(x\)

\[K_{\rm a}=\frac{\left[\text{NH}_{3}\right]\left[\text{H}_{3}\text{O}^{+}\right]}{ \left[\text{NH}_{4}^{+}\right]}\]

**(Note: Do you see that this calculation is similar to Example 5C?)**

Consider the salt ammonium chloride, NH\({}_{4}\)_Cl_, wherein the NH\({}_{4}^{+}\) ion hydrolyses to give an acidic solution:

NH\({}_{4}^{+}\)(aq) + H\({}_{2}\)O(_l_) \(\rightleftharpoons\) NH\({}_{3}\)(aq) + H\({}_{3}\)O\({}^{+}\)(aq)

The acid dissociation constant, \(K_{\rm a}\) of the conjugate acid can be derived from the base dissociation constant, \(K_{\rm b}\) of the base it was formed from using \(K_{\rm w}\) (refer to Section 4.4)

_i.e._

\[K_{\rm a}(\text{NH}_{4}^{+})\ \times\ K_{\rm b}(\text{NH}_{3})\ =\ K_{\rm w}\]

Similarly, for a basic salt such as sodium ethanoate, wherein the CH\({}_{3}\)CO\({}_{2}^{-}\) ion hydrolyses to give a basic solution:

CH\({}_{3}\)CO\({}_{2}^{-}\)(aq) + H\({}_{2}\)O(_l_) \(\rightleftharpoons\) CH\({}_{3}\)CO\({}_{2}\)H(aq) + OH-(aq)

the base dissociation constant, \(K_{\rm b}\) of the conjugate base can be derived from the acid dissociation constant, \(K_{\rm a}\) of the acid it was formed from using \(K_{\rm w}\) (refer to Section 4.4)

_i.e._

\[K_{\rm b}(\text{CH}_{3}\text{CO}_{2}^{-})\ \times\ K_{\rm a}(\text{CH}_{3}\text{CO}_{2} \text{H})\ =\ K_{\rm w}\]

**Checkpoint for Section 6**

At the end of this section, you should know that:

1. The salt formed from a reaction between a strong acid and a strong base will dissolve in water to give a neutral solution, as neither the cation nor the anion undergoes hydrolysis.
2. The salt formed from a reaction between a strong acid and a weak base will dissolve in water to form an acidic solution, as the cation is a moderately strong conjugate acid that hydrolys in water.
3. The salt formed from a reaction between a weak acid and a strong base will dissolve in water to form an alkaline solution, as the anion is a moderately strong conjugate base that hydrolys in water.
4. Both the cation and anion of a salt formed from a reaction between a weak acid and a weak base will hydrolyse in water.

## 7 Buffer Solutions

\begin{tabular}{|p{142.3pt} p{142.3pt}|} \hline LO (i) & (i) & explain how buffer solutions control pH \\  & (ii) & describe and explain their uses, including the role of H\({}_{2}\)CO\({}_{3}\)/HCO\({}_{3}\) in controlling pH in blood \\ (j) & calculate the pH of buffer solutions, given appropriate data \\ \hline \end{tabular}

A buffer solution is a solution which is able to **resist a change in pH** (_i.e._ pH remains **almost** unchanged) when a **small amount** of acid or base is added to it.

In general, there are two types of buffers:

\begin{tabular}{|p{142.3pt}|} \hline
**acidic buffer** & **basic buffer** \\ \hline A solution containing a **weak acid** and its **salt** (**conjugate base** of the acid) & A solution containing **weak base** and its **salt** (**conjugate acid** of the base) \\ _e.g._ a mixture of CH\({}_{3}\)CO\({}_{2}\)H and CH\({}_{3}\)CO\({}_{2}\)Na_ & e.g. a mixture of NH\({}_{3}\) and NH\({}_{4}\)_C_I_ \\ \hline pH < 7 & pH > 7 \\ \hline \end{tabular}

**Note:** Regardless of whether a buffer is acidic or basic, it contains a conjugate acid-base pair!

A buffer solution must contain a **high concentration** of a **conjugate acid-base pair** for it to function effectively as a buffer.

### Acidic Buffer

Consider a mixture of a weak acid and its salt, CH\({}_{3}\)CO\({}_{2}\)H and CH\({}_{3}\)CO\({}_{2}\)Na.

* weak acid
* basic salt, contains CH\({}_{3}\)CO\({}_{2}^{-}\), the conjugate base of the weak acid

In this solution, ethanolic acid being a weak acid, is only **partially dissociated**:

\[\text{CH${}_{3}$CO${}_{2}$H(aq)}+\text{H${}_{2}$O$($l)}\rightleftharpoons CH${}_{3}$CO${}_{2}$(aq)}+\text{H${}_{3}$O${}^{\prime}$(aq)} \tag{1}\]

On the other hand, sodium ethanoate is **fully dissociated**:

\[\text{CH${}_{3}$CO${}_{2}$Na${}^{\prime}$(aq)}\rightarrow\text{CH${}_{3}$CO${}_{2}$(aq)}+\text{ Na${}^{\prime}$(aq)} \tag{2}\]

According to **Le Chatelier's principle**, the presence of **CH\({}_{3}\)CO\({}_{2}^{-}\) ions** from the complete dissociation of sodium ethanoate **suppresses the dissociation of ethanolic acid** in (1).

Hence the buffer solution contains a **relatively high concentration of the undissociated ethanolic acid** (a weak acid) **and the ethanoate ions** (the conjugate base of the weak acid). These relatively high concentrations of both the ethanoic acid and ethanoate ions enable the solution to function as a buffer solution.

**On adding a small amount of H\({}_{3}\)O\({}^{+}\) or H\({}^{+}\)**, the large amount of CH\({}_{3}\)CO\({}_{2}\) ions present removes the added H\({}_{3}\)O\({}^{+}\) or H\({}^{+}\) ions. Thus, [H\({}_{3}\)O\({}^{+}\)] or [H\({}^{+}\)] in the aqueous system does not change much and the pH remains **almost unchanged**.

**H\({}_{3}\)O\({}^{+}\)(aq) + CH\({}_{3}\)CO\({}_{2}\)(aq) \(\rightarrow\) CH\({}_{3}\)CO\({}_{2}\)H(aq) + H\({}_{2}\)O(\(l\))**

**On adding a small amount of OH\({}^{-}\)**, the large amount of CH\({}_{3}\)CO\({}_{2}\)H present removes the added OH\({}^{-}\) ions. Thus, [OH\({}^{+}\)] in the aqueous system does not change much and the pH remains **almost unchanged**.

OH-(aq) + CH\({}_{3}\)CO\({}_{2}\)H(aq) \(\rightarrow\) CH\({}_{3}\)CO\({}_{2}\)(aq) + H\({}_{2}\)O(\(l\))

### Basic Buffer

Consider a mixture of a weak base and its salt, NH\({}_{3}\) and NH\({}_{4}\)Cl.

* weak base
* acidic, contains NH\({}_{4}^{+}\), the conjugate acid of the weak base

In this solution, aqueous ammonia being a weak base, is only **partially dissociated**:

\[\text{NH}_{3}(\text{aq})\ +\ H_{2}(\text{O}(l)\ \rightleftharpoons\ \text{NH}_{4}^{+}(\text{aq})\ +\ \text{OH}^{-}(\text{aq}) \tag{1}\]

On the other hand, ammonium chloride is **fully dissociated**:

\[\text{NH}_{4}\)Cl(s) \(\rightarrow\) NH\({}_{4}^{+}(\text{aq})\ +\ Cl^{-}(\text{aq}) \tag{2}\]

According to **Le Chatelier's principle**, the presence of **NH\({}_{4}^{+}\) ions** from the complete dissociation of ammonium chloride **suppresses the ionisation of aqueous ammonia** in (1).

Hence, the buffer solution contains a **relatively high concentration of aqueous ammonia** (a weak base) **and the ammonium ions** (the conjugate acid of the weak base). These relatively high concentrations of both aqueous ammonia and ammonium ion enable the solution to function as a buffer.

**On adding a small amount of H\({}_{3}\)O\({}^{+}\)**, the large amount of NH\({}_{3}\) present removes the added H\({}_{3}\)O\({}^{+}\) ions. Thus, [H\({}_{3}\)O\({}^{+}\)] in the aqueous system does not change much and the pH remains **almost unchanged**.

\[\text{H}_{3}\)O\({}^{+}(\text{aq})\ +\ \text{NH}_{3}(\text{aq})\ \rightarrow\ \text{NH}_{4}^{+}(\text{aq})\ +\ H_{2}\)O(\(l\))

**On adding a small amount of OH\({}^{-}\)**, the large amount of NH\({}_{4}^{+}\) ions present removes the added OH\({}^{-}\) ions. Thus, [OH\({}^{+}\)] in the aqueous system does not change much and the pH remains **almost unchanged**.

OH-(aq) + NH\({}_{4}^{+}(\text{aq})\ \rightarrow\) NH\({}_{3}\)(aq) + H\({}_{2}\)O(\(l\))

### pH of a Buffer (not in H1 syllabus)

Consider an acidic buffer containing an acid, HA, and its conjugate base, A-,

HA(aq) + H2O(_l_) == H3O'(aq) + A-(aq) Na(aq) \(\rightarrow\) Na*(aq) + A-(aq) HA, being a weak acid, undergoes slight dissociation in aqueous solution. Its dissociation is suppressed by the high concentration of A- ions from the complete dissociation of the salt, NaA. This is in accordance with Le Chatelier's Principle.

Hence, [HA]eqm = [HA]initial - [A-]from HA

[HA]initial [A-]eqm = [A-]from NaA

Hence for an acidic buffer solution,

\[K_{a}\left(\text{HA}\right) = \frac{\left[\text{H}_{3}\text{O}^{-}\right]\left[\text{A}^{-} \right]_{\text{from NaA}}}{\left[\text{HA}\right]_{\text{initial}}}\] \[\left[\text{H}_{3}\text{O}^{-}\right] = K_{a}\left(\text{HA}\right)\frac{\left[\text{HA}\right]_{\text{ initial}}}{\left[\text{A}^{-}\right]_{\text{from NaA}}}\] \[-\text{lg}\left[\text{H}_{3}\text{O}^{-}\right] = -\text{lg}K_{a}\left(\text{HA}\right)-\text{lg}\frac{\left[\text{HA} \right]_{\text{trial}}}{\left[\text{A}^{-}\right]_{\text{from NaA}}}\] \[\text{pH} = pK_{a}\left(\text{HA}\right)+\text{lg}\frac{\left[\text{A}^{-} \right]_{\text{from NaA}}}{\left[\text{HA}\right]_{\text{trial}}}\]

Consider a basic buffer containing a base, B, and its conjugate acid, BH+,

B(aq) + H2O(_l_) == BH+(aq) + OH-(aq) BHC(_l_(aq) ) \(\rightarrow\) BH+(aq) + _Cl-_(aq) B, being a weak base, undergoes slight dissociation in aqueous solution. Its dissociation is suppressed by the high concentration of BH+ ions from the complete dissociation of the salt, BHC_l_. This is in accordance with Le Chatelier's Principle.

Hence, [B]eqm = [B]initial- [BH+]from B

[BH+]eqm = [BH+]from BHC_l_(BH+) = [BH+]from B

Considering dissociation of the conjugate acid, BH+, of the weak base, B:

BH+(aq) + H2O(_l_) = B(aq) + H3O'(aq) K_a (BH+) = K_w K_b (B)Hence for a basic buffer solution,

### Buffering Capacity

Buffering capacity refers to the amount of acid or base that may be added to a buffer solution before its pH changes appreciably. It represents the ability of a buffer to resist changes in pH.

For a buffer to be effective, 0.1\(\leq\)\(\left[\text{(conjugate) base}\right]\)\(\leq\) 10

Hence, \(\text{p}K_{\text{a}}+\text{lg 0.1}\) to \(\text{p}K_{\text{a}}+\text{lg 10}\)

_i.e._\(\text{p}K_{\text{a}}-1\) to \(\text{p}K_{\text{a}}+\text{1}\)

The **effective buffer range** of a buffer is about one pH unit on either side of the \(\text{p}K_{\text{a}}\) value _i.e._\(\text{p}K_{\text{a}}\pm\text{1}\). Beyond this range, the pH of the solution changes appreciably upon the addition of small amounts of acid or base.

A buffer solution is **most effective** in resisting changes in pH when:

1. The amount of both the weak acid (or base) and its conjugate base (or acid) are **large** relative to that of the acid or base to be added to the buffer solution.

2. The ratio of the concentrations of the conjugate acid and its conjugate base is close to 1 : 1.

When the ratio of the concentrations of the acid and its conjugate base is 1 : 1,

\[\text{pH}=\text{p}K_{\text{a}}+\text{lg}\frac{\left[\text{( conjugate) base}\right]}{\left[\text{( conjugate) acid}\right]}\] \[=\text{p}K_{\text{a}}+\text{lg}1\] \[=\text{p}K_{\text{a}}\]

Hence we usually try to select a **buffer** whose acid form has a \(\text{p}K_{\text{a}}\) close to the desired pH to ensure effectiveness.

\begin{tabular}{|c c c|} \hline \multicolumn{3}{|c|}{Example 7A} \\ Phosphoric acid is a tribasic acid. & \\ \(\text{H}_{3}\text{PO}_{4}(\text{aq})\) & \(\rightleftharpoons\) & \(\text{H}^{\prime}(\text{aq})\) & \(\text{p}\text{K}_{a1}=2.15\) \\ \(\text{H}_{2}\text{PO}_{4}(\text{aq})\) & \(\rightleftharpoons\) & \(\text{H}^{\prime}(\text{aq})\) & \(\text{p}\text{K}_{a2}=7.20\) \\ \(\text{HPO}_{4}^{2-}(\text{aq})\) & \(\rightleftharpoons\) & \(\text{H}^{\prime}(\text{aq})\) & \(\text{p}\text{K}_{a3}=12.35\) \\ \hline \end{tabular}

Suggest how a buffer at pH 6.80 can be prepared from 1.00 mol dm\({}^{-3}\) NaOH and 1 dm\({}^{3}\) of 1.00 mol dm\({}^{-3}\) H\({}_{3}\text{PO}_{4}\).

The effective buffer range is approximately \(\underline{\text{p}\text{K}_{a}\pm 1}\). Hence for a buffer at pH 6.80, we will choose the conjugate acid-base pair as.

\begin{tabular}{|c|} \hline \multicolumn{3}{|c|}{\(\text{pH}=\text{p}\text{K}_{a}+\text{lg}\dfrac{\text{conjugate base}}{\text{[acid]}}\)} \\ \(\text{6.80}=7.20+\text{lg}\dfrac{\text{[HPO}_{4}^{2-}}{\text{H}_{2}\text{PO}_{4} ^{-}}\) \\ \(\dfrac{\text{[HPO}_{4}^{2-}}{\text{H}_{2}\text{PO}_{4}^{-}}\) \\ \(\dfrac{\text{[HPO}_{4}^{2-}}{\text{H}_{2}\text{PO}_{4}^{-}}\) \\ \(n_{\text{HP}\text{O}_{4}^{2-}}\) \\ \(n_{\text{HP}\text{O}_{4}^{2-}}\) \\ \(n_{\text{HP}\text{O}_{4}^{2-}}\) \\ \(n_{\text{HP}\text{O}_{4}^{2-}}\) \\ \(n_{\text{HP}\text{O}_{4}^{2-}}\) \\ \end{tabular}

Both \(\text{HPO}_{4}^{2-}\) and \(\text{H}_{2}\text{PO}_{4}^{-}\) are obtained by reacting \(\text{H}_{3}\text{PO}_{4}\) with an appropriate amount of NaOH:

\(\text{H}_{3}\text{PO}_{4}(\text{aq})\) + NaOH(\(\text{aq})\) \(\rightarrow\) NaH\({}_{2}\text{PO}_{4}(\text{aq})\) + \(\text{H}_{2}\text{O}(\textit{l})\)

\(\text{H}_{3}\text{PO}_{4}(\text{aq})\) + 2NaOH(\(\text{aq})\) \(\rightarrow\) Na\({}_{2}\text{HPO}_{4}(\text{aq})\) + 2H\({}_{2}\text{O}(\textit{l})\)

\(n_{\text{HP}\text{O}_{4}^{2-}}\) + \(n_{\text{HP}\text{O}_{4}^{2-}}\) = \(n_{\text{HP}\text{O}_{4}}\) = 1.00 mol

\(0.3981n_{\text{H}_{3}\text{PO}_{4}}\) + \(n_{\text{HP}\text{O}_{4}^{2-}}\) = 1.00

\(n_{\text{H}\text{PO}_{4}}\) = 0.7153 mol

so, \(n_{\text{HP}\text{O}_{4}^{2-}}\) = 0.2847 mol

\(n_{\text{NaOH}}\) required = 2\(n_{\text{HP}\text{O}_{4}^{2-}}\) + \(n_{\text{HP}\text{O}_{4}}\)

\(=\) 2\(\times\) 0.2847 + 0.7153

\(=\) 1.285 mol

Hence, a buffer at pH 6.80 can be obtained by adding \(\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad \qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad \qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad \qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad \qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad \

### Uses of Buffers

Buffer solutions are used in situations in which it is necessary to maintain a constant pH. A few examples are given below:

1. Buffers are used widely to control chemical processes including electroplating, manufacture of dyes, photographic materials and leather.
2. Chemists use buffers in analysis e.g. in calibration of pH meters.
3. Analytical biochemists use buffers to determine the number and type of amino acids present in proteins by electrophoresis, a technique which involves the migration of charged particles in solution through an electric field.
4. Many biological systems in which a change in pH can have a great effect on the functioning of a cell are buffered. For example, all intravenous injections and eye drops are buffered as human blood and tears have specific pH.
5. In bacteriological research, a buffer solution is used to maintain the pH of culture media used for the growth of bacteria.
6. In agriculture, buffers are used to maintain the pH of soils for growth of certain plants _e.g._ azalea, rhododend - pH 4

#### Blood Buffer System

The pH of human blood must be maintained within a narrow range of 7.35 - 7.45. It is important for the pH of blood to be kept constant so that enzymes in the blood which only work within a small pH range can function properly.

In a healthy person, the pH of blood never deviates more than approximately 0.2 pH unit from the average value. If the pH of blood falls below 6.8 or rises above 7.8, death may result.

The buffer in blood mainly consists of proteins, a mixture of phosphates (HPO\({}_{4}^{2}\)/H\({}_{2}\)PO\({}_{4}^{2}\)) and a mixture carbonates (HCO\({}_{3}\)/H\({}_{2}\)CO\({}_{3}\)).

1. The proteins are made up of amino acids containing acidic and basic side chains, which act as buffers (_e.g._ lysine, arginine, aspartic acid)
2. CO\({}_{2}\) produced as the by-product of metabolic reactions in the body, dissolves to form carbonic acid which dissociates partially to give hydrogen carbonate (or bicarbonate) ion, HCO\({}_{3}^{-}\). \[\text{CO}_{2}\text{(g) + H}_{2}\text{O}\text{($l$)}\rightleftharpoons H_{2}\text{CO}_{3}\text{(aq) + H}_{2}\text{O}\text{($l$)}\rightleftharpoons H\text{CO}_{3}\text{(aq) + H}_{3}\text{O}\text{(aq)}\] \[\text{H}_{2}\text{CO}_{3}\text{/HCO}_{3}^{-}\text{ forms a buffer system in blood plasma.}\]If the concentration of H\({}_{3}\)O\({}^{+}\) increases (_e.g._ from lactic acid which is produced during exercise), HCO\({}_{3}^{-}\) present reacts with and removes the additional H\({}_{3}\)O\({}^{+}\) ions to resist changes in pH.

H\({}_{3}\)O\({}^{+}\)(aq) + HCO\({}_{3}\)(aq) \(\rightarrow\) H\({}_{2}\)CO\({}_{3}\)(aq)

When [OH\({}^{-}\)] increases, H\({}_{2}\)CO\({}_{3}\) present reacts with and removes the additional OH\({}^{-}\) ions to resist changes in pH.

OH\({}^{-}\)(aq) + H\({}_{2}\)CO\({}_{3}\)(aq) \(\rightarrow\) H\({}_{2}\)O(\(\textit{l}\)) + HCO\({}_{3}^{-}\)(aq)

Hydrogen carbonate buffer is constantly replenished in the body through the dissolved carbon dioxide produced during normal metabolism.

* Phosphate (HPO\({}_{4}^{2^{-}}\)/H\({}_{2}\)PO\({}_{4}^{-}\)) buffer in blood \[\begin{array}{cccc}\text{H${}_{2}$PO${}_{4}^{-}$(aq)}&+&\text{H${}_{2}$O${} (\textit{l})}&\rightleftharpoons\text{H${}_{2}$O${}_{4}^{-}$(aq)}&+&\text{H${}_{3}$O${}^{+}$(aq)}& \text{$K${}_{a}$ = 6.2\times 10^{-8}$mol dm${}^{-3}$}\\ \text{acid}&&\text{conjugate}&&\text{base}\\ \end{array}\] With excess H\({}_{3}\)O\({}^{+}\): \[\begin{array}{cccc}\text{HPO${}_{4}^{2^{-}}$}&+&\text{H${}_{3}$O${}^{+}$}& \rightarrow&\text{H${}_{2}$PO${}_{4}^{-}$}&+&\text{H${}_{2}$O${}_{4}^{-}$}\\ \text{With excess OH${}^{-}$}&\text{H${}_{2}$PO${}_{4}^{-}$}&+&\text{OH${}^{-}$}& \rightarrow&\text{H${}_{2}$O${}_{4}^{-}$}&+&\text{H${}_{2}$O$}\\ \end{array}\] With elevated units.

From the Henderson- Hasselbach equation

\[\text{pH}=\text{p}K${}_{a}$+lg\frac{\left[(\text{conjugate})\text{ base}\right]}{\left[(\text{conjugate})\text{ acid}\right]}\]

if we add water to a buffer, the ratio \(\frac{\left[(\text{conjugate})\text{ base}\right]}{\left[(\text{ conjugate})\text{ acid}\right]}\) remains the same since both the conjugate acid-base pair are diluted to the same extent. Hence we would expect the pH of the buffer to remains the same.

However, common sense also tells us that if we add enough water to any solution to dilute it sufficiently, it becomes essentially "pure" water, with a pH of 7!

What is wrong with the logic here?

**Checkpoint for Section 7**

At the end of this section, you should know that:

1. An acidic buffer contains a weak acid and its salt (conjugate base).
2. A basic buffer contains a weak base and its salt (conjugate acid).
3. A buffer must contain a large concentration of a conjugate acid-base pair to function effectively.
4. When a small amount of acid or base is added to a buffer, it will be neutralised by the basic component or acidic component of the buffer, respectively.
5. When a small amount of acid or base is added to a buffer, the pH of the buffer remains almost unchanged.
6. The pH of a buffer can be calculated by the formula \(\PH=\rho K_{a}+\lg\frac{[(\text{conjugate})\text{ base}]}{[(\text{conjugate})\text{ acid}]}\).
7. The effective buffer range of any buffer is \(\rho K_{a}\pm 1\).
8. A buffer solution is most effective when [(conjugate) acid] = [(conjugate) base], and the amount of conjugate acid-base pair is large as compared to the amount of acid or base added

## 8 Indicators

An indicator is a substance that changes colour in response to pH changes of the solution it is added to. Most indicators are usually weak acids or bases, which change colour depending on the pH of the solution. Different colours will be exhibited by their dissociated and un-dissociated forms. Indicators are used to detect the end-point in acid-base titrations.

Let the formula of the undissociated indicator be HIn.

At equilibrium,

\[\begin{array}{ll}\text{HIn(aq) + H}_{2}\text{O(}l\rightleftharpoons\text{H}_{3}\text{O}^{ \ast}\text{(aq) + In}^{\ast}\text{(aq)}\\ \text{weak acid}&\text{conjugate base}\\ \text{(colour A)}&\text{(colour B)}\end{array}\]

The dissociation constant of an indicator is termed \(K_{\text{In}}\).

\[K_{\text{In}}=\frac{\left[\text{H}_{3}\text{O}^{\ast}\right]\left[\text{In} ^{\ast}\right]}{\left[\text{HIn}\right]}\qquad\qquad\text{pH}=\text{p}K_{ \text{In}}+\text{lg}\frac{\left[\text{In}^{\ast}\right]}{\left[\text{HIn} \right]}\]

At different pH, the proportion of HIn to In- is different, giving rise to different colours.

At low pH, [H\({}_{3}\)O] is high, the equilibrium position shifts to the **left**. Hence, there is a larger proportion of **HIn** and **colour A** is observed.

At high pH, [H\({}_{3}\)O] is low (as large amounts of H\({}_{3}\)O\({}^{\ast}\) is consumed during the titration), the equilibrium position shifts to the **right**. Hence there is a larger proportion of **In** and **colour B** is observed.

For the 2 colours to be distinguishable by the human eye, one form must be about **10 times more concentrated** than the other form, _i.e._ in the ratio of 1 : 10.

_i.e._ If \(\frac{\left[\text{In}^{\ast}\right]}{\left[\text{HIn}\right]}=0.1\), colour A is observed. \(\Rightarrow\) pH = p\(K_{\text{In}}-1\)

If \(\frac{\left[\text{In}^{\ast}\right]}{\left[\text{HIn}\right]}=10\), colour B is observed. \(\Rightarrow\) pH = p\(K_{\text{In}}+1\)

If \(\left[\text{In}^{\ast}\right]=\left[\text{HIn}\right]\), colour changed observed is a combination of A and B \(\Rightarrow\) pH = p\(K_{\text{In}}\)

Hence, an indicator is found to change colour over an approximate pH range of **p\(K_{\text{In}}\pm 1\)**, which is called the **working pH range** of the indicator.

### Choice of indicator

An indicator is suitable for a titration if the **working pH range of the indicator** (pH range for colour change) **lies within the range of rapid pH change for the titration**.

The working pH range of some indicators can be found in the table below

\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|c|c|} \hline  & \multicolumn{2}{c|}{**colour**} & \multicolumn{1}{c|}{} & \multicolumn{1}{c|}{} \\ \cline{2-5}
**indicator** & **HIn** & **In\({}^{-}\)** & **p\(K_{\text{in}}\)** & **pH range/** \\  & **(acidic)** & **(alkaline)** & & **working range** \\ \hline thymol blue\({}^{\text{A}}\) & red & yellow & 1.6 & 1.2 - 2.8 \\ \hline methyl orange & red & yellow & 3.4 & 3.1 - 4.4 \\ \hline screened methyl orange\({}^{\star}\) & violet & green & 3.4 & 3.1 - 4.4 \\ \hline methyl red & red & yellow & 5.1 & 4.2 - 6.3 \\ \hline litmus & red & blue & 6.5 & 6.0 - 8.0 \\ \hline thymol blue\({}^{\text{A}}\) & yellow & blue & 8.9 & 8.0 - 9.6 \\ \hline phenolphthalein & colourless & pink & 9.3 & 8.2 - 10.0 \\ \hline thymolphthalein & colourless & blue & 9.9 & 9.3 - 10.5 \\ \hline \end{tabular}

\({}^{\text{A}}\) Thymol blue is a dibasic acid and there are three forms: H2In (red), HIn\({}^{-}\) (yellow) and In\({}^{2-}\) (blue).

\({}^{\star}\) Screened methyl orange is a mixture of methyl orange and an inert blue dye, xylene cyanide FF, to make the end-point more prominent.

### What is the difference between equivalence point and end-point of a titration?

* **Equivalence point** is the point at which stoichiometric amounts of acid and base react completely.
* **End-point** is an experimentally determined value and it is reached when the **first drop of titrant changes the colour of the indicator permanently**.

When an appropriate indicator is chosen, the **end-point will be close to the equivalence point**. Hence, the end-point of titration depends on the indicator being used.

\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|c|} \hline  & \multicolumn{1}{c|}{} & \multicolumn{1}{c|}{} & \multicolumn{1}{c|}{} \\ \cline{2-4}

\({}^{\text{A}}\) Thymol blue is a dibasic acid and there are three forms: H2In (red), HIn\({}^{-}\) (yellow) and In\({}^{2-}\) (blue).

\({}^{\star}\) Screened methyl orange is a mixture of methyl orange and an inert blue dye, xylene cyanide FF, to make the end-point more prominent.

### What is the difference between equivalence point and end-point of a titration?

* **Equivalence point** is the point at which stoichiometric amounts of acid and base react completely.
* **End-point** is an experimentally determined value and it is reached when the **first drop of titrant changes the colour of the indicator permanently**.

When an appropriate indicator is chosen, the **end-point will be close to the equivalence point**. Hence, the end-point of titration depends on the indicator being used.

For example, in the titration of 25.0 cm\({}^{3}\) of 0.100 mol dm\({}^{-3}\) H\({}_{3}\)PO\({}_{4}\) against 0.100 mol dm\({}^{-3}\) NaOH shown above, thymolphthalein is a good indicator for the second end-point, but methyl orange is not a good indicator for the first end-point. There is no suitable indicator for the third end-point.

## 9 Titration Curves

* (g) describe the changes in pH during acid-base titrations and explain these changes in terms of the strengths of the acids and bases (h) explain the choice of suitable indicators for acid-base titrations, given appropriate data

A titration curve is a graph of pH against volume of an acid or base. It shows how the pH of the solution in the conical flask changes with the volume of solution added from the burette (the titre) during a titration. This change in pH during a titration depends largely upon the strength of the acid and base used. The graphs can be obtained by monitoring the pH of a titration using a pH meter. There are 4 types of acid-base titration and the indicator suitable for each type of titration is shown below.

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|} \hline
**type of titration** & \begin{tabular}{c} **range of rapid** \\ **pH change** \\ \end{tabular} & \begin{tabular}{c} **examples of suitable indicator** \\ \end{tabular} \\ \hline strong acid - strong base & 3 - 11 & \begin{tabular}{c} screened methyl orange, methyl orange, \\ thymulphthalein or phenolphthalein \\ \end{tabular} \\ \hline strong acid - weak base & 3 - 7 & \begin{tabular}{c} screened methyl orange or methyl orange \\ \end{tabular} \\ \hline weak acid - strong base & 7 - 11 & 
\begin{tabular}{c} thymulphthalein or phenolphthalein \\ \end{tabular} \\ \hline weak acid - weak base & nil & no suitable indicator \\ \hline \end{tabular}

### Strong Acid - Strong Base Titration

Consider a titration of a strong acid, 25.0 cm\({}^{3}\) of 1.00 mol dm\({}^{-3}\)HCl, with a strong base, 1.00 mol dm\({}^{-3}\) NaOH.

HC_l_(aq) + NaOH(aq) \(\rightarrow\) NaCl_l_(aq) + H\({}_{2}\)O_l_)

\begin{tabular}{c} **equivalence point** \\ neutral salt (NaC_l_) only \\ \end{tabular}

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:43]

* **When excess base is added (after equivalence point)*
* From now on, the base added has nothing to react with, so the pH rises towards a final value of 14.
* When excess base is added, the mixture contains excess **strong base*
* and the **salt*
* formed. The pH of the mixture is due to the strong base since the salt formed is neutral. When 25.10 cm\({}^{3}\) of 1.00 mol dm\({}^{-3}\)NaOH have been added to 25 cm\({}^{3}\) of 1.00 mol dm\({}^{-3}\)HCl, HC_I_(aq) + NaOH(aq) \(\rightarrow\) NaC_I_(aq) + H\({}_{2}\)O(_I_) initial amt/mol 0.025\(\times\)1 = 0.0251\(\times\)1 = 0.0251 0 change in amt/mol -0.025 -0.025 +0.025 final amt/mol 0 10\({}^{-4}\) 0.025 final conc/mol dm\({}^{-3}\) 0 10\({}^{-4}\) + 50.10 1000 0.025 + 50.100 [OH+] = [NaOH] = 10\({}^{-4}\) + 50.10 1000 = 2.00 \(\times\) 10\({}^{-3}\) mol dm\({}^{-3}\) pOH = -lg (2.00 \(\times\) 10\({}^{-3}\)) = 2.7 pH = 14 - 2.70 = 11.3 The pH changes rapidly near the equivalence point (from 2.70 at 24.90 cm\({}^{3}\) of base to 11.3 at 25.10 cm\({}^{3}\) of base in this case).

_Suitable Indicators:_

Suitable indicators for a strong acid-strong base titration: **methyl orange/screened methyl orange and thymolphthalein/phenolphthalein**.

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:45]

Solution is an **acidic buffer** as a weak acid, CH\({}_{3}\)COOH and its conjugate base, CH\({}_{3}\)COONa salt is present.

\[\text{pH}=\text{p}K_{a}+\text{lg}\frac{\left[\text{conjugate base}\right]}{\left[\text{acid}\right]}=-\text{lg}(1.74\times 1 0^{-6})+\text{lg}\frac{0.01+\frac{35}{1000}}{0.015+\frac{35}{1000}}\]

\[=\text{\bf 4.58}\]

When 12.50 cm\({}^{3}\) of 1.00 mol dm\({}^{-3}\) NaOH is added to 25.0 cm\({}^{3}\) of 1.00 mol dm\({}^{-3}\) CH\({}_{3}\)CO\({}_{2}\)H,

**Half-equivalence point:** where half of the acid present in the reaction mixture is neutralised

_i.e._ volume at half-equivalence point = \(\frac{1}{2}\times\)**volume at equivalence point**

At this point,

[weak acid] = [conjugate base]

**Buffer is at its maximum buffer capacity**

pH = pK\({}_{a}\) (because pH = pK\({}_{a}\) + lg 1, and lg 1 = 0)

pH = pK\({}_{a}\) = **4.76**

**(c) At equivalence point**

The pH at equivalence point is > 7 due to the hydrolysis of CH\({}_{3}\)CO\({}_{2}\)Na salt.

\[\text{CH}_{3}\text{CO}_{2}(\text{aq})\ +\ \text{H}_{2}\text{O}(\text{l}) \rightleftharpoons\text{CH}_{3}\text{CO}_{2}\text{H}(\text{aq})\ +\ \text{OH}^{-}(\text{aq})\]

\[\left[\text{CH}_{3}\text{CO}_{2}^{-}\right]=0.025+0.05=0.5\ \text{mol dm}^{-3}\]

\[K_{b}\left(\text{CH}_{3}\text{CO}_{2}^{-}\right)=\frac{K_{w}}{K_{a}\left(\text {CH}_{3}\text{CO}_{2}\text{H}\right)}=5.75\times 10^{-10}\ \text{mol dm}^{-3}\]

\[\left[\text{OH}^{-}\right]=\sqrt{K_{b}\left[\text{CH}_{3}\text{CO}_{2}^{-} \right]}=\sqrt{5.75\times 10^{-10}\times 0.5}\]

\[=1.70\times 10^{-6}\ \text{mol dm}^{-3}\]

pOH = -lg(1.70 \times 10^{-5}) = 4.77

pH = 14 - 4.77 = **9.23**

**(d) When excess base is added (after equivalence point)**

From now on, the base added has nothing to react with, so the pH rises towards a final value of 14 (_i.e._ the pH of 0.1 mol dm\({}^{-3}\) NaOH).

When excess base is added, the mixture contains excess strong base and the salt formed. The pH of the mixture is due to the strong alkali since the [OH\({}^{+}\)]\({}_{\text{salt}}\) produced from the hydrolysis of the salt is much smaller than the excess [OH\({}^{+}\)]\({}_{\text{base}}\) added.

_Suitable Indicators:_

The region of rapid pH change lies between 7 and 11.

Any indicator which changes colour over the range of pH 7 to 11 can be used to gauge the equivalence point.

Suitable indicators: **thymolphthalein/phenolphthalein**.

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:47]

* **When excess base is added (after equivalence point)*
* pH gradually increases but resists pH change near maximum buffer capacity.
* In this region, the mixture consists of the additional **weak base*
* and the **conjugate acid*
* formed from neutralisation, forming a **basic buffer**. When 50.00 cm\({}^{3}\) of 1.00 mol dm\({}^{-3}\) NH\({}_{3}\) is added to 25.0 cm\({}^{3}\) of 1.00 mol dm\({}^{-3}\) HC\({}^{\prime}\).
* **Maximum buffer capacity*
* occurs when **[weak base] = [conjugate acid]*
* pH = pK\({}_{\text{a}}\) (where \(K_{\text{a}}\) is for NH\({}_{4}^{+}\))
* This point occurs at 2_V_**cm\({}^{3}\) where \(V\) cm\({}^{3}\) is the volume of base required to neutralise the acid completely. 1 \(V\) = amount of base needed for neutralisation and 1 \(V\) = amount of base added equal to the amount of salt present.
* HC_I_(aq) + NH\({}_{3}\)(aq) \(\rightarrow\) NH\({}_{4}\)C_I_(aq) initial amt/mol 0.025\(\times\)1 = 0.025 0.050\(\times\)1 = 0.050 0 change in amt/mol -0.025 -0.025 +0.025 final amt/mol 0 0.025 0.025 pH = pK\({}_{\text{a}}\)(NH\({}_{4}^{+}\)) OR pOH = pK\({}_{\text{b}}\)(NH\({}_{3}\)) = 4.70 = -lg (5.00 \(\times\) 10\({}^{-10}\)) = **9.30*
* pH = 14 - 4.70 = **9.30**

_Suitable Indicators_:

* The region of rapid pH change generally lies between 3 and 7.
* Any indicator which changes colour over the range of pH 3 to 7 can be used to gauge the equivalence point.
* Suitable indicators: **methyl orange/screened methyl orange**.

### Weak Acid - Weak Base Titration (not required to know)

Consider a titration of 25.0 cm\({}^{3}\) of a weak acid, 1.00 mol dm\({}^{-3}\) CH\({}_{3}\)CO\({}_{2}\)H (\(K_{\rm a}\) = 1.74 \(\times\) 10\({}^{-5}\) mol dm\({}^{-3}\)) with weak base, 1.00 mol dm\({}^{-3}\) NH\({}_{3}\) (\(K_{\rm b}\) = 1.77 \(\times\) 10\({}^{-5}\) mol dm\({}^{-3}\)).

(a) **Before titration (at initial point)**

* At the initial point, the solution contains only weak acid. The pH of the solution is caused by the weak acid present. \(\left[{\rm H^{+}}\right]\)=\(\sqrt{K_{\rm a}\times\left[{\rm H\Lambda}\right]_{\rm metal}}\) = 4.17 \(\times\) 10\({}^{-3}\) mol dm\({}^{-3}\) pH = -lg(4.17 \(\times\) 10\({}^{-3}\)) = 2.38
**(b) When acid is partially neutralised (after initial, before equivalence point)**

* pH gradually increases as the weak acid is being neutralised by added weak base.
* In this region, the mixture consists of the remaining **weak acid** (CH\({}_{3}\)CO\({}_{2}\)) and the **conjugate base** (CH\({}_{3}\)CO\({}_{2}\)) formed from neutralisation, forming an **acidic buffer**.
* The conjugate acid of the weak base, NH\({}_{4}^{+}\), does not contribute significant to the [H\({}^{+}\)] as it is a much weaker acid than CH\({}_{3}\)CO\({}_{2}\)H. \(K_{\rm a}\left({\rm NH_{4}^{+}}\right)\)=\(\dfrac{K_{\rm w}}{K_{\rm b}\left({\rm NH_{3}}\right)}\) = 5.65\(\times\)10\({}^{-10}\) mol dm\({}^{-3}\).

When 12.50 cm\({}^{3}\) of 1.00 mol dm\({}^{-3}\) NH\({}_{3}\) is added to 25.0 cm\({}^{3}\) of 1.00 mol dm\({}^{-3}\) CH\({}_{3}\)CO\({}_{2}\)H,

**Half-equivalence point:** where half of the acid present in the reaction mixture is neutralised

_i.e._ volume at half-equivalence point = \(\dfrac{1}{2}\times\)**volume at equivalence point**

At this point,

* [weak acid] = [conjugate base]
* **Buffer is at its maximum buffer capacity**

* pH = pK\({}_{\rm a}\) = 4.76 (because pH = pK\({}_{\rm a}\) + lg 1, and lg 1 = 0)

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:50]

### Polyprotic (polybasic) Acid - Strong Base Titration

Polyprotic acids contain more than one ionisation proton. In a solution of a polyprotic acid, one proton at a time dissociates from the acid molecule, and each dissociation step has a different \(K_{\mathrm{a}}\). For example, phosphoric acid is a triprotic acid, and has three pK\({}_{\mathrm{a}}\) values:

\[\begin{array}{cccccccc}\mathrm{H_{3}PO_{4}(aq)}&+&\mathrm{H_{2}O(\mathit{l})}& \rightleftharpoons&\mathrm{H_{2}PO_{4}^{-}(aq)}&+&\mathrm{H_{3}O^{+}(aq)}& \mathrm{p}K_{a1}=2.15\\ \mathrm{H_{2}PO_{4}^{-}(aq)}&+&\mathrm{H_{2}O(\mathit{l})}&\rightleftharpoons& \mathrm{HPO_{4}^{-}(aq)}&+&\mathrm{H_{3}O^{+}(aq)}&\mathrm{p}K_{a2}=7.20\\ \mathrm{HPO_{4}^{2-}(aq)}&+&\mathrm{H_{2}O(\mathit{l})}&\rightleftharpoons& \mathrm{PO_{4}^{-}(aq)}&+&\mathrm{H_{3}O^{+}(aq)}&\mathrm{p}K_{a3}=12.35\end{array}\]

The pK\({}_{\mathrm{a}}\) values increase from each dissociation step for phosphoric acid. This implies that H\({}_{3}\)PO\({}_{4}\) is a much stronger acid than H\({}_{2}\)PO\({}_{4}^{-}\), which is in turn stronger than HPO\({}_{4}^{2-}\).

_Theoretically_, we would expect **three equivalence points** in the titration of H\({}_{3}\)PO\({}_{4}\) against NaOH. However, the titration of H\({}_{3}\)PO\({}_{4}\) is an interesting case. The pH curve obtained when 25.0 cm\({}^{3}\) of 0.100 mol dm\({}^{-3}\) H\({}_{3}\)PO\({}_{4}\) is titrated against 0.100 mol dm\({}^{-3}\) NaOH is shown below.

The titration curve contains only **two inflection points** and phosphoric acid can be titrated either as a _monoprotic acid_ or as a _diprotic acid_.

* the acid is titrated with an indicator that changes colour at around pH 9.65 (for example thymolphthalein, working range 9.3
- 10.5). Phenolphthalein cannot be used, as it starts to change colour around pH 8.2, when phosphoric acid is titrated in about 95%.

It is interesting to mention, that phosphoric acid can be titrated as triprotic - if the PO\({}_{4}\)\({}^{3-}\) anion is precipitated first using a suitable metal ions (for example Ca\({}^{2+}\) or Ag\({}^{+}\)):

\[2\mathrm{H_{3}PO_{4}(aq)}+3\mathrm{Ca}C\mathit{L}(aq)\rightarrow\mathrm{Ca_{3 }(PO_{4})_{2}(s)}+6\mathrm{HCI}(aq)\]

After precipitation HC_l_ can be titrated against NaOH.

[title=0.5em,title=0.

### Double Indicator Titrations

The use of two different acid-base indicators (which change colour at different pH from one another) can be applied to determine the composition of mixtures of weak and strong bases (or acids), or in the titration of polyprotic substances with two equivalence points or more. Some common examples are:

* Acid-carbonate titrations
* Titration of a mixture of carbonate and hydrogen carbonate solution

### Titration of sodium carbonate solution against strong acid

The reaction of CO\({}_{3}^{2-}\) with acids occurs in 2 steps:

**Step 1**: **CO\({}_{3}^{2-}\)(aq) + H\({}^{+}\)(aq) \(\rightarrow\) HCO\({}_{3}^{2-}\)(aq)**

**Step 2**: **HCO\({}_{3}^{2-}\)(aq) + H\({}^{+}\)(aq) \(\rightarrow\) CO\({}_{2}\)(g) + H\({}_{2}\)O(I)**

Overall: **CO\({}_{3}^{2-}\)(aq) + 2H\({}^{+}\)(aq) \(\rightarrow\) CO\({}_{2}\)(g) + H\({}_{2}\)O(I)**

This implies that there are two sharp changes observed in the titration, as illustrated below for the titration of \(V\) cm\({}^{3}\) of 1.00 mol dm\({}^{-3}\) Na\({}_{2}\)CO\({}_{3}\) against 1.00 mol dm\({}^{-3}\) HC\({}_{3}\)(aq)

When HC\(I\) is first added to Na\({}_{2}\)CO\({}_{3}\), **reaction 1** will occur and an indicator, such as phenolphthalein can be used to detect the first end-point since the working pH range of phenolphthalein (_i.e._ pH 8.2 - 10.0) coincides with the sharp pH change of the equivalence point of **reaction 1**.

Similarly, when **reaction 2** starts to occur, methyl orange or screened methyl orange can be used to detect the second end-point, since the working pH range of methyl orange (_i.e._ 3.1 - 4.4) coincides with the sharp pH change of the equivalence point of **reaction 2**.

**Checkpoint for sections 8 and 9**

At the end of these two sections, you should know that:

1. At low pH, a larger proportion of HIn is present and the colour corresponding to the acidic form is observed.
2. At high pH, a larger proportion of In- is present and the colour corresponding to the basic form is observed.
3. When [HIn] = [In-], the colour observed is a mixture of both the acidic and basic form, where pH = pK\({}_{\text{in}}\).
4. An indicator changes colour over an approximate pH range of pK\({}_{\text{in}}\pm 1\), which is the working pH range of the indicator.
5. An indicator is suitable for use if the working pH range of the indicator lies within the range of rapid pH change for the titration.
6. For a strong acid-strong base titration, the pH of the solution at equivalence point is 7 because the salt does not hydrolyse.
7. For a weak acid-strong base titration, the pH of the solution at equivalence point is > 7 because the anion of the salt formed (conjugate base) hydrolyses to give an alkaline solution.
8. For a strong acid-weak base titration, the pH of the solution at equivalence point is < 7 because the cation of the salt formed (conjugate acid) hydrolyses to give an acidic solution.
9. For a weak acid-weak base titration, the pH of the solution at equivalence point depends on the \(K_{\text{a}}\) and \(K_{\text{b}}\) of the conjugate acid and conjugate base formed.
10. If a titration has more than one equivalence point, then each equivalence point can be determined by a different indicator as long as a sharp change in pH occurs at that equivalence point.

## 10 APPENDIX: The Levelling Effect of Water

Let us consider the scenarios where we introduce a strong acid (such as 0.20 mol dm\({}^{-3}\)HCl) or strong base (such as 0.20 mol dm\({}^{-3}\) NaOH) to water, the changes in pH of the solution tends to follow the curve in **Fig. A1.1**.

As we can see from the figure, the changes to pH tends to "level off" at a certain value after a large enough quantity of acid or base is added. In the case where an _infinite_ volume of 0.20 mol dm\({}^{-3}\) of HCl is introduced to 50 cm\({}^{3}\) of water, the effective concentration of H\({}_{3}\)O\({}^{+}\) approaches 0.20 mol dm\({}^{-3}\), and the measured pH of the solution tends to be -lg (0.20) = **0.699**. Similarly, if another hydrohalic acid, such as HBr, is used, the measured pH will have the same values. This is **counter-intuitive**, especially if we were to taken into consideration that the _K_a values of HCl and HBr are 1.3 \(\times\) 10\({}^{6}\) and 1.0 \(\times\) 10\({}^{9}\) respectively. It suggests that the pH value is independent of the identity of the (strong) acid added.

This observed phenomenon is due to the **levelling effect**, which suggests that:

* An acid stronger than the conjugate acid of the solvent cannot exist in any appreciable concentration in that solvent, and
* A base stronger than the conjugate base of the solvent cannot exist in any appreciable concentration in that solvent,

which arises due to the acid/ base dissociating completely in the solvent.

To rank strong acids in terms of their relative strength, the acids must be dissolved in a solvent that is a weaker base than water. This is illustrated by the solvation of hydrohalic acids in ethanolic acid:

\[\text{HCl}(\text{g})+\text{CH}_{3}\text{CO}_{2}\text{H}(\text{l}) \rightleftharpoons\quad\text{C}l^{\prime}(\text{{a}ceet})+\text{CH}_{3} \text{CO}_{2}\text{H}_{2}^{*}(\text{{a}ceet}) K_{\text{a}}=1.3\times 10^{6}\] \[\text{HBr}(\text{g})+\text{CH}_{3}\text{CO}_{2}\text{H}(\text{l}) \rightleftharpoons\quad\text{Br}\,(\text{{a}ceet})+\text{CH}_{3} \text{CO}_{2}\text{H}_{2}^{*}(\text{{a}ceet}) K_{\text{a}}=1.0\times 10^{9}\] \[\text{HI}(\text{g})+\text{CH}_{3}\text{CO}_{2}\text{H}(\text{l}) \rightleftharpoons\quad\text{I}\,(\text{{a}ceet})+\text{CH}_{3} \text{CO}_{2}\text{H}_{2}^{*}(\text{{a}ceet}) K_{\text{a}}=3.2\times 10^{9}\]

The strength of the H-X bond is inversely proportional to the strength of the acid. In the case of ethanolic acid, which is a weaker base than water, the acids protonate ethanolic acid to different extents. Measurements shows that HI protonates ethanolic acid to a greater extent than HBr, and HBr more than HCl. In this case, ethanolic acid serves as a differentiating solvent. Similarly, the relative strength of strong bases may be determined using a weaker acid than water, such as liquid NH\({}_{3}\).
