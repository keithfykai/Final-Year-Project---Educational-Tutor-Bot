### Gravitational Field

A "field" is a _region of space_ where a force is experienced by an "entity" without contact. A _mass_ experiences a gravitational force when placed in a _gravitational field_.

\begin{tabular}{|p{142.3pt}|} \hline \multicolumn{1}{|c|}{A gravitational field is} \\ \multicolumn{1}{|c|}{a region of space} \\ \multicolumn{1}{|c|}{where a mass} \\ \multicolumn{1}{|c|}{experiences a gravitational force.} \\ \hline \multicolumn{1}{|c|}{Forces are vector} \\ \multicolumn{1}{|c|}{quantities so the} \\ \multicolumn{1}{|c|}{direction has to be} \\ \multicolumn{1}{|c|}{well-defined.} \\ \multicolumn{1}{|c|}{where a mass} \\ \multicolumn{1}{|c|}{experiences a gravitational force.} \\ \hline \end{tabular}

An isolated mass generates its gravitational field in the region surrounding the mass and it permeates all of space ("to infinity"). When another mass is inside this region, that mass _interacts_ with the existing gravitational field and _both_ masses experience gravitational force.

#### 7.1.1 Field Lines

Field lines represent a field visually. Arrows show the direction of force acting on a _test_ mass.

A _test_ particle is an idealized object which does not _alter_ the behaviour of the rest of the system.

The value of a test particle is shown when there is more than one body of significant mass. The diagram below shows the _resultant_ field lines of the gravitational field _jointly_ generated by both the Earth and the moon:

\begin{tabular}{|p{142.3pt}|} \hline _The moon is not a test particle. It itself generates a gravitational field of its own and alters the behaviour of Earth's gravitational field. If we replace the moon with a test particle, the resulting field will be purely radial towards Earth's centre._ \\ \hline \end{tabular}

_At this point (location), a test mass will be attracted to both the moon (weaker) and the Earth (more strongly). The resultant direction is due to the vector sum of forces:_ \\ \hline \end{tabular}

The tangent at a point on a gravitational field line is the direction of gravitational force acting on a test mass placed at that point. Field lines will never cross each other.

**Example 1**: By reference to lines of gravitational force near the Earth's surface, explain why the acceleration of free fall near the Earth's surface is approximately constant.

**Solution**

* The lines of force are radial and appear to converge at the centre of Earth.
* Earth is a large radius, relatively the heights near and above the surface is small so the lines are approximately parallel.
* The parallel field lines indicate uniform field strength hence constant acceleration of free fall.

**Notes**: (i) we represent uniform fields using equally-spaced parallel field lines pointing in the same direction. (ii) A uniform field is one where the field strength has the same magnitude and same direction everywhere within the field. (iii) Near Earth's surface, by Newton's \(2^{\text{nd}}\) Law, \(F_{\text{net}}=ma=mg\) so the gravitational field strength \(g\) is equal to the acceleration of free fall.

There is a formal definition for _field strength_ which we will introduce later. Visually, from the above example we can already see that gravitational field strength is

* stronger where gravitational field lines are closer together
* weaker where gravitational field lines are further apart from each other

Now that we are familiar with

1. the direction of gravitational force (mutual attraction between masses)
2. the general variation (the further away, the weaker the force of attraction)

We now look at how to _quantify_ the gravitational force.

**Newton's law of gravitation** states that the

**[type of force]** gravitational force of attraction between two point masses

**[magnitude]** is directly proportional to the product of the masses and

**inversely proportional to the square of separation**

**between the masses**

**The gravitational constant** \(G=6.67\times 10^{-11}\,\mathrm{N}\) **m**\({}^{2}\,\mathrm{kg}^{2}\)**.** \(m_{1}\) **and** \(m_{2}\) **are the masses of the two point masses and** \(r\) **is the distance (separation) between the two point masses (i.e. the distance between the centres of the masses).**

**The direction of the gravitational force acts along the line joining the two point masses. By Newton's** \(3^{\mathrm{rd}}\) **Law, the gravitational attraction that** \(m_{1}\) **experts on** \(m_{2}\) **is equal in magnitude and opposite in direction as the gravitational force that** \(m_{2}\) **experts on** \(m_{1}\)**.**

**Newton's Law of Gravitation works between point masses. Even though planets and stars are massive, Newton's Law of Gravitation still applies as the** _distances between planetary bodies are significantly much larger than their diameters_ **so the bodies can still be regarded as point masses.**

**Note: In some textbooks, Newton's Law of Gravitation is given as** \(F=-\dfrac{GMm}{r^{2}}\)**; the negative sign denotes that the direction of the force is opposite to the direction of** \(r\)**, the displacement (or position) vector.**

### Satellites

A satellite is an object in space that orbits around a more-massive body. An example of _natural_ satellite is the moon orbiting around Earth; an example of _artificial_ satellite is the International Space Station also orbiting Earth.

The results of Example 3 show that the orbital properties of a satellite are not affected by the mass of the satellite; the period of revolution is dependent on the distance of the satellite from the centre of the more massive body, \(T^{2}\propto r^{3}\).

#### 7.3.1 Geostationary Satellites

As the name suggests, a geostationary satellite appears to be stationary in the sky to an observer on Earth. Therefore, a geostationary satellite must:

* have a period of 24 hour
* be in circular orbit at a particular radius
* orbit directly above Equator
* move from west to east along same axis as Earth's rotation

Geostationary satellites allow transmission of signals between two regions at all times because the satellite will remain within "line-of-sight" of ground-based transmission and reception equipment.

They are useful for constant monitoring of weather especially in the equatorial region.

[style=]
**Example 4**: Show that all geostationary satellites orbiting the Earth (of radius \(6.4\times 10^{6}\) m and mass \(6.0\times 10^{24}\) kg ) have the same the orbital radius which is independent of the mass of the satellite.

Find the orbital radius.

Find the height of a geostationary satellite above Earth's surface.

[style=]
**Solution**

(a) gravitational force on satellite by Earth provides centripetal force

(b) \[\begin{split}\frac{Gm_{\text{Earth}}}{r^{2}}&= \mathcal{P}_{\text{sat}}^{\text{}}re^{2}\\ Gm_{\text{Earth}}&=r^{3}\bigg{(}\frac{2\pi}{T} \bigg{)}^{2}\\ r&=\sqrt[3]{\frac{Gm_{\text{Earth}}T^{2}}{4\pi^{2}}}= \sqrt[3]{\frac{\left(6.67\times 10^{-11}\right)\left(6.0\times 10^{24}\right) \left(\left(24\right)60^{2}\right)^{2}}{4\pi^{2}}}\\ &=4.23\times 10^{7}\text{ m}\\ \end{split}\]

### Gravitational Field Strength

In Physics and beyond, the use of ratios help us describe and characterize systems. For example, GDP _per_ capita describes prosperity, number of people _per_ unit area describes population density, and moles _per_ cubic decimetre describes concentration.

Similarly, gravitational field strength describes how strong the gravitational force on a unit mass at a point could be. When a unit mass is placed at two points with different gravitational field strengths, a greater gravitational force acts on the unit mass at the point where there is a greater gravitational field strength.

#### 7.4.1 Apparent Weight

We read our "apparent weight" as the normal contact force on us via weighing scales.

At the poles: actual weight = apparent weight \(W=N\)

Alonso the equator: vector sum of weight and normal force provides centripetal force

\[W-N =mr\,\alpha^{2}\] \[N =mg-mr\,\alpha^{2}\] \[=m\bigg{[}g-R_{\text{E}}\bigg{(}\frac{2\pi}{T}\bigg{)}^{2}\bigg{]}\] \[=m\bigg{[}g-\big{(}6.4\times 10^{6}\big{)}\bigg{(}\frac{2\pi}{24 \times 60^{2}}\bigg{)}^{2}\bigg{]}\] \[=m\big{(}9.78\big{)}\]

Apparent weight (N) is less than actual weight

**Example 5**

For Earth (of radius 6.39\(\times\)10\({}^{6}\) m and mass 5.98\(\times\)10\({}^{24}\) kg ), find the gravitational field strength (a) on Earth's surface, and

(b) at the International Space Station, orbiting at a height of 400 km above Earth's surface.

**Solution**

(a) \(g_{\text{surface}}=\frac{Gm_{\text{Earth}}}{r^{2}}\)

(b) \(g_{\text{SS}}=\frac{Gm_{\text{Earth}}}{r^{2}_{\text{ISS}}}=\frac{Gm_{\text{Earth }}}{\big{(}h_{\text{ISS}}+R_{\text{E}}\big{)}^{2}}\)

(400\(\times\)10\({}^{3}+6.39\times 10^{6}\big{)}^{2}\)

(8.68 N kg\({}^{-1}\)

**Example 6**

Astronauts in the International Space Station (ISS) and the ISS itself are subject to the effects of Earth's gravity. Explain why astronauts experience weightlessness while on-board the ISS.

**Solution**

Gravitational force provides centripetal force for both astronaut and ISS.

Both astronaut and ISS are subject to the same gravitational field strength and so accelerates to the centre of earth at the same rate.

ISS cannot provide normal contact force to the astronaut.

H207 Gravitational Field - Notes

In the topic on Work Energy and Power, we revisited the equation \(E_{p}=mgh\) for gravitational potential energy changes _near the Earth's surface_, something we are made familiar with in secondary school.

For solving questions, we are accustomed to defining arbitrary locations as zero height and working out the _change in gravitational potential energy_ using the difference in heights.

In the diagram to the left, ball B has greater gravitational potential energy than ball A, because it is at a "higher height".

It is therefore logical that ball C has more gravitational potential energy than ball B because it is at a "higher height".

What will be the gravitational potential energy of a ball that is at infinity?

Mathematically it is an issue because infinity is a _concept_ rather than a number that we perform operations on. For example, if we were to bring a ball that is "at infinity" by 10 km closer to the Earth, the distances involved will result in statements such as:

\[{}^{*}\,\infty-\left(10\times 10^{3}\right)=\infty\,^{*}\]

Similarly, it becomes quite nonsensical to describe the amount of gravitational potential energy stored in this Earth-ball system as "infinity".

Instead, we (scientists) chose to define the _maximum_ gravitational potential energy of massive objects at infinitely far away distances as... zero.

Another inherent issue is the difficult in comparison - the total gravitational potential energy does not only depend on the distance of separation but also both the masses involved.

Again, we turn to the _ratio_ concept mentioned in Section 7.4 on Gravitational Field Strength to characterise only one massive body.

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:12]

#### 7.5.2 Variation of Gravitation Potential with Displacement between Earth and Moon

First, consider the gravitational potential due to the Earth \(\phi_{\mathrm{E}}\) and Moon \(\phi_{M}\) independently. The resultant gravitational potential \(\phi\) due to both the Earth and Moon is the scalar sum of both the gravitational potentials of the Earth and the Moon.

The gravitational field strength at a point is the negative of the potential gradient at that point.

#### 7.5.3 At Point A:

The gradient of the tangent drawn at the point on the resultant gravitational potential graph is positive. Hence the potential gradient is positive. Since \(g=-\frac{\mathrm{d}\phi}{\mathrm{d}r}\), the gravitational field strength at that point in the field is directed in the negative-\(r\) direction (directed towards the Earth). Any mass that is nearer to the Earth than it is to the moon shall experience a net gravitational force directed towards the centre of the Earth.

#### 7.5.4 At Point B:

The gradient of the tangent drawn at that point on the resultant gravitational potential graph is zero. Hence the potential gradient is zero. This implies that the gravitational field strength at that point is zero.

Any mass that is located at B experiences equal magnitudes of gravitational force of attraction from both the Earth and the moon. Hence the mass experiences a net gravitational force of zero.

Also note that Point B is NOT at the point of where the 2 gravitational potentials are equal in magnitude (where the individual potentials intersect).

#### 7.5.5 At Point C

The gradient of the tangent drawn at the point on the resultant gravitational potential graph is negative. Hence the potential gradient is negative. Since \(g=-\frac{\mathrm{d}\phi}{\mathrm{d}r}\), the gravitational field strength at that point in the field is positive (directed towards the Moon).

Any mass at Point C shall experience a net gravitational force directed towards the centre of the Moon, as it is located sufficiently near the Moon such that the moon's gravitational force of attraction is stronger than that of Earth's.

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:14]

**Example 9**

Calculate the gravitational potential at point X due to masses A and B shown in the diagram below. Hence determine the gravitational potential energy of mass C, which is placed at point X.

**Solution**

gravitational potential at X due to A:

\[\dot{\phi}_{\text{at X by A}} = -\frac{GM_{A}}{r}=-\frac{\left(6.67\times 10^{-11}\right)\left(2.0 \right)}{4.0}\] \[= -3.335\times 10^{-11}\text{ J kg}^{-1}\]

gravitational potential at X due to B:

\[\dot{\phi}_{\text{at X by B}} = -\frac{GM_{B}}{r}=-\frac{\left(6.67\times 10^{-11}\right)\left(2.0 \right)}{5.0}\] \[= -2.668\times 10^{-11}\text{ J kg}^{-1}\]

total gravitational potential at X due to A and B:

\[\dot{\phi}_{\text{at X}} = \dot{\phi}_{\text{at X by A}}+\dot{\phi}_{\text{at X by B}}\] \[= -\left(3.335+2.668\right)\times 10^{-11}\] \[= -\left(6.00\right)\times 10^{-11}\text{ J kg}^{-1}\]

**Try**: find the field strength at X due to A and B, and hence the force on C at X.

**Example 10**: The diagram below shows the Earth's gravitational field. The dashed lines represent equipotential lines. The gravitational potential is as shown for each of the equipotential lines.

**(a)**: Explain which of the 4 points is the gravitational potential the highest.
**(b)**: Calculate the work done by the gravitational field in bringing a spacecraft of mass 5000 kg

**(i)**: from A to C
**(ii)**: from C to D
**(c)**: Explain why the equipotential lines are not equally spaced.

**Solution**

**(a)**: gravitational potential is the highest (least negative) at A because it is furthest from the Earth

\(\phi\propto-\frac{1}{r}\)
**(b)**: **(i)**: w.d. by gravitational force in bringing spacecraft from A to C

= loss in gravitational \(E_{\text{p}}\) of spacecraft

= initial \(E_{\text{p}}\) (at point A) - final \(E_{\text{p}}\) (at point C)

\(=m\left(\phi_{\text{A}}-\phi_{\text{C}}\right)=(5000)\left[\left(-4.0-\left(- 5.0\right)\right)\times 10^{7}\right]=5.0\times 10^{10}\) J
**(ii)**: w.d. \(=m\left(\phi_{\text{C}}-\phi_{\text{D}}\right)=0\); C and D lie on the same equipotential line

so same gravitational potential
**(c)**: Gravitational potential is inversely proportional to the distance from Earth's centre, \(\phi\propto-\frac{1}{r}\). Hence each change in distance will be different for the same equal change in gravitational potential.

**Example 11**: By reference to the definition of gravitational potential, explain why gravitational potential is a negative quantity.

**Solution**

Gravitational potential at infinity is defined as zero.

Gravitational force is attractive, so displacement of object moves from infinity to point is field is in opposite direction to applied force

Negative work is done, so net loss of energy from system.

It is useful to consider that the definition of gravitational potential involves an _external agent_.

This external agent exerts a force on the unit test mass that is always of same magnitude but opposite in direction to that of the gravitational force attracting the test mass.

The external agent brings the test mass closer to the more-massive body without a change in kinetic energy (i.e. no acceleration because no net force on the unit test mass).

All of the work done by the external agent only changes the gravitational potential energy of the test mass; and not does change the kinetic energy

#### 7.5.3 Escape Velocity

When an object has sufficient escape velocity, the object has enough initial kinetic energy to escape the influence of the gravitational field it is currently in.

This means moving to "infinite" distance away. Take note that this is an object projected with an initial velocity and is _not_ like a rocket which continuously burns fuel to generate thrust. At infinity, the object's kinetic energy is zero and velocity is zero.

By Principle of Conservation of Energy,

for an object of mass \(m\) escaping from the surface of a

planet of mass \(M\) and radius \(R\):

loss in \(E_{\kappa}=\text{gain in}E_{\text{p}}\)

\(E_{\kappa,\text{ initial}}-E_{\kappa,\text{ final}}=m\Delta\phi\)

\(\frac{1}{2}\dot{m}v_{\text{esc}}^{2}-0=\dot{m}\left(\phi_{\text{final}}-\phi_ {\text{final}}\right)\)

\(\frac{1}{2}v_{\text{esc}}^{2}=0-\left(-\frac{GM}{R}\right)\)

\(v_{\text{esc}}=\sqrt{\frac{2GM}{R}}\)

This allow us to explain why Earth's atmosphere can exist, whereas gases of "lighter" atoms or molecules are rare because given the same kinetic energy (temperature), their mean square speeds permit them to escape Earth's gravitational field.

**Example 12**: Determine the escape velocity of a rocket from the surface of Earth, ignoring effects of air resistance as the rocket leaves the Earth's atmosphere. Mass of the Earth is \(5.98\times 10^{24}\) kg and the average radius of the Earth is \(6.37\times 10^{6}\) m.

**Solution**

gain in gravitational potential energy = loss in kinetic energy

\[E_{\text{p, final}}-E_{\text{p, initial}} =E_{\text{K, initial}}-E_{\text{K, final}}\] \[0-\left(-\frac{Gm_{e}m_{\text{p}}}{R_{E}}\right) =\frac{1}{2}m_{\text{p}}\nu^{2}-0\] \[\nu =\sqrt{\frac{2Gm_{\text{p}}}{R_{E}}}\] \[=\sqrt{\frac{2(6.67\times 10^{-11})(5.98\times 10^{24})}{(6.37 \times 10^{6})}}\] \[=1.12\times 10^{4}\text{ m s}^{-1}\]

**OR**

initial total energy = final total energy

\[E_{\text{K, initial}}+E_{\text{p, initial}} =E_{\text{K, final}}+E_{\text{p, final}}\] \[\frac{1}{2}m_{\text{p}}\nu^{2}+\left(-\frac{Gm_{e}m_{\text{p}}}{R _{E}}\right) =0+0\] \[\nu =\sqrt{\frac{2Gm_{e}}{R_{E}}}\]

**Further Challenge:** Reduce \(\nu\) to be in terms of \(g\) and \(R_{\text{E}}\) only.

**Example 13**: A satellite in circular orbit at height \(h\) above the surface of a planet experiences no resistive forces. The planet has mass \(M\) and radius \(R\).

**(a)**: Express the speed of the satellite \(v_{\rm s}\) in terms of \(M\), \(R\), \(h\) and the gravitational constant \(G\).
**(b)**: A rock, initially at rest at an infinite distance away, approaches the planet. It travels at speed \(v_{\rm rock}\) when it passes by tangential to the planet, at height \(h\) above the planet's surface. Express the speed of the rock \(v_{\rm rock}\) in terms of \(M\), \(R\), \(h\) and the gravitational constant \(G\).
**(c)**: Hence, explain if the rock will fall into the planet's surface **or** orbit around the planet **or** continue to travel off into space.

**Solution**

(a) gravitational force provides centripetal force

\[\frac{m_{\rm s}v_{s}^{2}}{r_{\rm s}}=\frac{GMm_{\rm s}}{r_{\rm s}^{2}}\]

\[\frac{m_{\rm s}^{\prime}v_{s}^{2}}{R+h}=\frac{GMm_{\rm s}^{\prime}}{\left(R+h \right)^{2}}\]

\[V_{\rm s}=\sqrt{\frac{GM}{R+h}}\]

\[\frac{GM}{R+h}\]

\[\frac{\text{the rock will not enter orbit}}{\text{and will travel off into space}}\]

\[E_{\rm K,\,final}+E_{\rm P,\,final}=E_{\rm K,\,initial}+E_{\rm P,\,final}\]

\[\frac{1}{2}m_{\rm rock}V_{\rm rock}^{2}+m_{\rm rock}\phi_{\rm metal}=0+0\]

\[V_{\rm rock}^{2}=-2\phi_{\rm metal}=\left(-2\right)\left(-\frac{GM}{R+h}\right)\]

\[V_{\rm rock}=\sqrt{\frac{2GM}{R+h}}\]

**Note:** because \(T^{2}\propto r^{3}\), a satellite must have a well-defined speed to remain orbiting the planet. At that orbit, if a satellite "suddenly" has increased speed it will veer off the orbit and away from the planet. If a satellite "suddenly" loses speed, it will spiral towards the planet with increasing speed as its gravitational potential energy is converted into kinetic energy and thermal energy in the drop.

#### 7.5.4 Total Energy of a Satellite in Circular Orbit

A satellite of mass \(m\) orbiting round the Earth has total energy (\(E_{\rm T}\)) due to the sum of its kinetic energy \(E_{\rm K}\) and potential energy \(E_{\rm P}\).

To derive \(E_{\rm K}\):

gravitational force provides centripetal force:

\[\frac{mv^{2}}{t} =\frac{GMm}{r^{2}}\] \[\left(\frac{r}{2}\right)\frac{mv^{2}}{r} =\left(\frac{r}{2}\right)\frac{GMm}{r^{2}}\] \[E_{\rm K} =\frac{GMm}{2r}\]

To derive \(E_{\rm T}\):

\[E_{\rm total} =E_{\rm K}+E_{\rm P}\] \[=\frac{GMm}{2r}+\left(-\frac{GMm}{r}\right)\] \[=-\frac{GMm}{2r}\]

When a satellite is "bound" to the planet, it has negative total energy (since maximum possible energy potential is defined to be zero at infinite distance away).

An object that has positive total energy has enough energy to escape the gravitational influence of the planet and still have KE!

\[E_{\rm K} =\frac{GMm}{2r}\] \[E_{\rm P} =-\frac{GMm}{r}\] \[E_{\rm total} =-\frac{GMm}{2r}\] \[E_{\rm total} =-E_{\rm K}\] \[E_{\rm total} =\frac{1}{2}E_{\rm P}\]

**Example 14**: A satellite of mass \(m_{\rm S}\) is in circular orbit around the Earth, with an orbital radius \(r\). The mass and radius of the Earth are \(m_{E}\) and \(R_{E}\) respectively.

**(a)**: State the expression of the gravitational potential energy possessed by the satellite when it is **(i)**: on the Earth's surface, **(ii)**: at its orbit.
**(b)**: Express the kinetic energy of the orbiting satellite in terms of \(G\), \(m_{E}\), \(m_{\rm S}\) and \(r\).
**(c)**: Using answers to **(a)(ii)** and **(b)**, write an expression the total energy of the orbiting satellite.
**(d)**: Using answers to **(a)** and **(b)** or otherwise, determine the energy required by the satellite to move it from the Earth's surface to its orbit. Ignore the rotation of the Earth.
**(e)**: Explain the impact of atmospheric drag on the subsequent trajectory of satellites.

**Solution**

**(a)**: \[E_{\rm p}=-\frac{Gm_{\rm E}m_{\rm S}}{R_{\rm E}}\qquad\qquad E_{\rm p}=-\frac{Gm _{\rm E}m_{\rm S}}{r}\]

**(b)**: gravitational force of Earth on the satellite provides the centripetal force for circular motion.

\[\frac{m_{\rm S}\nu^{2}}{r} = \frac{Gm_{\rm E}m_{\rm S}}{r^{2}}\] \[\left(\frac{r}{2}\right)\frac{m\nu_{\rm S}^{2}}{r} = \left(\frac{r}{2}\right)\frac{Gm_{\rm E}m_{\rm S}}{r^{\prime}}\] \[E_{\rm K} = \frac{Gm_{\rm E}m_{\rm S}}{2r}\]
**(c)**: \[E_{\rm total} = E_{\rm K}+E_{\rm p}\] \[= \frac{Gm_{\rm E}m_{\rm S}}{2r}+\left(-\frac{Gm_{\rm E}m_{\rm S}}{ r}\right)\] \[= -\frac{Gm_{\rm E}m_{\rm S}}{2r}\]
**(d)**: by principle of conservation of energy

\[\text{total energy required} = \text{gain in }E_{\rm p}+\text{gain in }E_{\rm K}\] \[= \left(E_{\rm p,\text{ final}}-E_{\rm p,\text{ initial}}\right)+\left(E_{\rm K,\text{ final}}-E_{\rm K,\text{ initial}}\right)\] \[= \left[\left(-\frac{Gm_{\rm E}m_{\rm S}}{r}\right)-\left(-\frac{Gm _{\rm E}m_{\rm S}}{R_{\rm E}}\right)\right]+\left[\frac{Gm_{\rm E}m_{\rm S}}{ 2r}-0\right]\] \[= Gm_{\rm E}m_{\rm S}\left(\frac{1}{R_{\rm E}}-\frac{1}{2r}\right)\]
**(e)**: negative work is done against drag so total energy decreases. GPE decreases, so satellite lowers in height \(\left(E_{\rm total}=\frac{1}{2}E_{\rm p}\right)\). KE increases, so linear speed increases\(\left(E_{\rm total}=-E_{\rm K}\right)\). Satellite spirals towards planet surface with increasing speed.
