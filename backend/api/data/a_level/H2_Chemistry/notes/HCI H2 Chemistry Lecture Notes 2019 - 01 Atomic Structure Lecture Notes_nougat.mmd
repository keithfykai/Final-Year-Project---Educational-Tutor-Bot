## 1 The Structure of the Atom

### The Discovery of the Subatomic Particles

The 5\({}^{\text{th}}\) century B.C. Greek philosopher _Democritus_ proposed that one couldn't divide a piece of gold wire forever until there isn't any gold left as all matter consists of very small, indivisible particles. He called these particles _atoms_, meaning "uncuttable" or "indivisible". This concept remained undeveloped until nineteenth century.

In 1808, an English scientist and school teacher, _John Dalton_ formulated the atomic theory that all matter is made up of atoms.

In 1897, _J.J. Thomson_ proposed a model that described atoms as negatively charged electrons embedded in a sphere of positive charge, which was then known as the "plum pudding" model.

In 1910, _Rutherford_ observed that the majority of the \(\alpha\)-particles passing through a thin sheet of gold foil went through with little deflection. But every now and then, he would observe great deflection. In some instances the particle actually bounced back. This surprising discovery led to the theory that the positive charge in the atom is concentrated into an incredibly small nucleus right in the middle of it. The diameter of the nucleus is less than \(10^{-5}\) of the atom.

Not until 1932 did the English physicist _James Chadwick_ finally discover the neutron. He found it to be electrically neutral, having about the same mass as a proton. Together, the proton and neutron received the name "nucleon."

Isotopes of an element do not all have the same mass. _Isotopes_ are **atoms of an element that have the same proton number but different nucleon numbers (or same number of protons but different number of neutrons).**

Isotopes of an element have the same electronic configuration and chemical properties. They have different relative isotopic masses (and physical properties.

Some common isotopes include: hydrogen (\({}^{1}\)H, \({}^{2}\)H, \({}^{3}\)H), carbon (\({}^{12}\)C, \({}^{13}\)C), oxygen (\({}^{16}\)O, \({}^{18}\)O), sulfur (\({}^{32}\)S, \({}^{34}\)S) and nitrogen (\({}^{14}\)N, \({}^{15}\)N).

Isotopes may be stable or unstable (radioactive). E.g. the isotope \({}^{14}\)C decays by \(\beta\)-emission with a half-life of 5730 years.

When writing the chemical symbol for an element, it is not always necessary to write either or both the nucleon and proton numbers. E.g., \({}^{1}_{1}\)H may be written as \({}^{1}\)H or H. We assume the most abundant isotope is referred to when simply writing \({}^{1}\)H\({}^{\prime}\) for example. However, when it is necessary to refer to a particular isotope of an element, the nucleon number as well as the proton number must be indicated E.g. if we want to refer to deuterium then we should write \({}^{2}_{1}\)H for clarity's sake.

### Ions and deflection of charged particles

A negative ion (anion) has more electrons than protons. It is represented by \({}^{\rm A}_{2}X^{\rm n+}\) where the number of electrons = Z + n.

E.g., \({}^{16}_{8}O^{2-}\) has 8 + 2 = 10 electrons, 8 protons and 8 neutrons.

A positive ion (cation) has fewer electrons than protons. It is represented by \({}^{\rm A}_{2}X^{\rm n+}\) where the number of electrons = Z - n.

E.g., \({}^{24}_{12}Mg^{2+}\) has 12 - 2 = 10 electrons, 12 protons and 12 neutrons.

Because of their relative masses and charges, protons, electrons and neutrons behave differently when placed in an electric field. Protons are deflected to the negative plate, electrons deflected to the positive plate, and neutrons being neutral pass straight through.

Similarly, **cations** are deflected to the **negative** plate and **anions** are deflected to the **positive** plate.

Figure 4: The nuclei of the three isotopes of hydrogen

In general, we expect that the angle of deflection (\(\theta\)) of a charged particle passing through an electric field to be directly proportional to the size of the charge (\(\mathbf{q}\)), and inversely proportional to the mass (\(\mathbf{m}\)).

The angles of deflection may be calculated as given in the example below:

In a particular experimental set-up, protons are deflected through an angle of +15\({}^{\circ}\). Assuming an identical set of experimental conditions, by what angles will the following particles be deflected?

(D is deuterium, \({}^{2}\)H, and T is tritium, \({}^{3}\)H)

#### 3.3.3 The d Orbital

Each **d subshell** has **five d orbitals**. Since each orbital can hold a maximum of **2** electrons, each d subshell can hold up to **10** electrons. There are **five** d orbitals: d\({}_{xy}\), d\({}_{x}\), d\({}_{yx}\), d\({}_{z}^{2}\), d\({}_{x}^{2}\)-\({}_{y}^{2}\). The five d orbitals are also **degenerate**. The size of d orbitals increases with the principal quantum number, i.e. 3d < 4d < 5d...

Figure 9: The d orbitalsFigure 11 below shows the sequence in which the electron orbitals are populated with electrons in an atom as the proton number increases.

The 1s subshell is the first to be filled, then the 2s orbital, the 2p orbitals and then the 3s orbitals and so on. Electrons only enter higher energy levels after lower energy levels have been filled.

## 4 Periodic Trends in Atomic and Ionic Radii

In explaining periodic trends in atomic and ionic radii, two fundamental considerations are important:

**(i)**: number of quantum shells
**(ii)**: effective nuclear charge

The **effective nuclear charge**, **Z**eff, is the **net nuclear charge** experienced by an **outer electron**, It is dependent on:

**(a)**: **Nuclear charge** (Z). The nuclear charge is dependent on the number of protons; The larger the number of protons, the greater the nuclear charge and the attraction for the outermost electrons by the nucleus.
**(b)**: **Shielding or screening effect (S)**: Presence of inner-shell electrons reduces the electrostatic attraction between the outermost electrons and the nucleus.

Hence,

Electrons in the same quantum shell do exert some shielding effect on each other.*

* _For example, shielding of \(p\) electrons by \(s\) or \(p\) electrons in the same quantum shell does occur, However this shielding effect is small compared to that by the inner core electrons.*_Order of shielding effect by electrons in the same quantum shell: \(s>p>d>f\).

### Trend in Atomic Radius

* The effect of an increase in nuclear charge (due to the increase in the number of protons in the nucleus) is nullified by the increasing shielding effect (due to the increase in the number of inner-shell electrons); resulting in effective nuclear charge to be approximately the same. Hence, the number of quantum shells is the more important factor to consider
* As the number of quantum shells increases (as additional electrons are added to a new principal quantum shell), the outermost electrons are further away from the nucleus, hence the atomic radius increases

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:16]

### Application of successive ionisation energy values

Successive ionisation energy values can be used to determine the electronic configuration of atoms and hence the identity of the element.

E.g., the ground state electronic configuration of magnesium is 1\(s^{2}\) 2\(s^{2}\) 2p\({}^{6}\) 3s\({}^{2}\).

Figure 17: Successive ionisation energies of magnesium

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:19]

Figure 20: First ionisation energy trend across the first transition elements series

**Reson:**

* **1**st ionisation energy involves removal of a 4s electron
* The nuclear charge increases due to increasing number of protons while additional electrons are added to the inner 3d subshell, which contributes to the shielding effect. The shielding effect increases thereby nullifying, to a considerable extent, the influence of each additional proton in the nucleus
* Effective nuclear charge remains almost constant Thus energy required to remove the outermost electron of each succeeding element remains relatively invariant

**Self-Practice 5.3**

The diagram shows part of the Periodic Table.

**Self-Practice 5.4**

Use of the _Data Booklet_ is relevant to this question.

The bar chart gives some information about the first ionisation energies of elements, numbering from 1 to 4.

The elements are adjacent to one another in the Periodic Table with increasing proton number either across a period from left to right, or down a group.

**SIn this topic, we have looked at the structure of the atoms, the shapes and energies of the atomic orbitals, as well as the energies associated with removal of electrons from isolated gaseous atoms. In the following topic, we will be applying these concepts to help us understand how atoms interact to form chemical bonds.

A particularly important and useful concept is that of effective nuclear charge. We have used this concept of effective nuclear charge quite extensively in this last section of Topic 1. So far, we have only considered isolated gaseous atoms and discussed the impact of the effective nuclear charge on removing electrons from these atoms. In reality, the electrostatic forces due to the effective nuclear charge of the atom extend beyond its outermost electron.

When two atoms are in proximity, the nucleus of each atom exerts an attractive force on its own electrons as well as the electrons of the other atom. The same nucleus also exerts a repulsive force on the nucleus of the other atom. This attraction and repulsion on the electrons and nucleus of the other atom by the first atom result in a net attractive force on the electrons of the other atom. It is quite clear then that the effective nuclear charge of the first atom would play a significant role in attracting the electrons of the other atom.

This attraction was first referred to as 'oxygenicity' in 1809 by Avogadro and Bezelius adopted the term 'electronegativity' in 1811. The concept of 'electronegativity' was finally defined and quantified by Linus Pauling in 1932. (Interesting fact: Linus Pauling is the only person to be awarded two unshared Nobel Prizes.)

Electronegativity quantifies the attractive force one atom exerts on the electrons of another atom in a chemical bond. A larger number implies a larger force of attraction towards the electrons. We will have a more thorough discussion of the concept of electronegativity when we deal with chemical bonding in Topic 2.

## Appendix A SIMPLIFIEDTEMICAL BASIS**

In 1886, Eugen Goldstein, when studying the cathode ray tube, observed rays in gas discharges under low pressure that travelled away from the anode and through channels in a perforated cathode, opposite to the direction of negatively charged cathode rays (which travel from cathode to anode). Goldstein called these positively charged anode rays "kanalstrahlen"; the standard translation of this term into English is "canal rays". Wilhelm Wien found that strong electric or magnetic fields deflected the canal rays and, in 1899, constructed a device with parallel electric and magnetic fields that separated the positive rays according to their charge-to-mass ratio (q/m). Wien found that the charge-to-mass ratio depended on the nature of the gas in the discharge tube. English scientist J.J. Thomson later improved on the work of Wien by reducing the pressure to create the mass spectrograph.

**1) Ionisation Chamber (Points 0,0 & c)**

The ionisation chamber or ion source is the part of the mass spectrometer that ionises the material under analysis (the analyte). This chamber is kept under very low pressure or even vacuum conditions so that the ions created do not interact with the air in the chamber and dissipate before they can be analysed. Techniques for ionisation include electron ionization and chemical ionization. These are generally used for analytes which form gases and vapours (created by heating a volatile sample). In electron ionisation, the analyte is bombarded by a stream of high energy electrons which knock off an electron from the atom or molecule, creating an ion. In chemical ionisation techniques, the analyte is ionized by chemical ion-molecule reactions during collisions in the source. Two more sophisticated techniques often used with liquid and solid samples include electrospray ionization and matrix-assisted laser ionization.

The ions created in the ionisation chamber are then transported by magnetic or electric fields to the mass analyser. The stream of ions is accelerated by passing them through an ion accelerator. Energy is imparted to the stream of ions so that the ions can be passed through a mass analyser and have enough energy to reach the detector at the end of the spectrometer. The stream of ions are then focused into a narrow beam and passed through a slit so that random unwanted ions are excluded from the mass analyser downstream.

3) Mass Analyser (Point \(\mathrm{t}\))

Mass analysers separate the ions according to their charge-to-mass ratio. The dynamics of the ions in electric and magnetic fields in vacuum are governed by Lorentz Force Law and Newton's Second Law of Motion. In general, this charge-to-mass ratio represents the ratio of the number of elementary charges of the ion (for example, \({}^{A}_{2}\)M\({}^{n+}\), the charge being n+) to the nucleon number (which is A in this example). The ability of the mass analyser to distinguish between two ions of slightly different q/m ratio is called the mass resolving power. Hence a good mass analyser (or a high resolution analyser) will be able to distinguish between very small differences in the q/m ratio. The detection of isotopes would require a high resolution mass analyser since the difference between isotopes could differ only by one nucleon number.

4) Detector

The final element of the mass spectrometer is the detector. The detector records either the charge induced or the current produced when an ion passes by or hits a surface. A modern day detector employs a scanning technique where the instrument scans through a range of q/m values (preset) and any signal produced in the detector during the course of the scan will be captured. Repeated scans will produce a mass spectrum, a record of ions as a function of their q/m (or more commonly m/q ratio as it is easier to read) versus the signal intensity of the relevant q/m ratios. Because the number of ions leaving the mass analyser at a particular instant is typically quite small, considerable amplification is often necessary to get a signal.

5) Mass Spectrum

The result of the separation of ions of different charge-to-mass ratio is usually expressed as a mass spectrum as shown below. Note mass-to-charge is preferred as it gives values > 1 and makes the spectrum easier to read. The spectrum shows the different isotopes of tin and their relative abundances. A weighted average of these isotopic abundances gives the relative atomic masses in the Period Table.
