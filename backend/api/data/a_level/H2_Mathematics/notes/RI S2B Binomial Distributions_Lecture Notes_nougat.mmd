## Introduction

Some random variables occur so frequently in real-life that they are given special names.

In this chapter, we will look at one such probability distribution for discrete random variables, namely, the Binomial distribution.

## 1 Binomial Distribution

### Binomial Experiment

Experiments consisting of \(n\) trials, each with two possible outcomes that may be regarded as either _success_ or _failure_, are very common in the study of probability. If, in addition, the probability of getting a success (or a failure) at each trial remains constant and the trials are independent, then we called such experiments **binomial experiments**.

For example, when we toss a coin 10 times, the outcome of each toss may be a head or a tail. Let us regard getting a head as a success. Since we are using the same coin, the probability of success will remain constant. Obviously, the tosses are independent of each other. This coin-tossing experiment is then a binomial experiment.

A binomial experiment is one that possesses the following properties:

1. It consists of \(n\) independent trials.
2. The outcome of each trial is either a success or a failure.
3. The probability of success for each trial, denoted by \(p\), remains constant.

Now consider drawing 5 cards from a deck of playing cards, one at a time and without replacement. Let us regard the outcome of each draw a success if the card drawn is a King and a failure if it is not. Then such an experiment is not a binomial experiment as we could see that it obviously violates property 1 of binomial experiment.

**Question:**: What if the card is replaced before the next draw? Will this experiment be a binomial experiment?
**Answer:**: Yes, it will satisfy all properties of a binomial experiment.

1. It consists of 5 independent trials.
2. The outcome is either a success (if the card drawn is a King) or a failure (if the card drawn is not a King).
3. The probability of drawing a King for each draw remains constant.

### Binomial Random Variable

The random variable \(X\) denoting the number of successes in the \(n\) trials of a binomial experiment is called a **binomial random variable**. It takes values \(\{0,1,2,...,n\}\).

The probability that \(X\) takes the value \(x\), denoted by \(\mathrm{P}(X=x)\), depends on the number of trials (\(n\)) as well as the probability of success (\(p\)) for each trial.

The _probability distribution_ of this discrete random variable is called a **binomial distribution**.

We called \(n\) and \(p\) the _parameters_ of the distribution and we write \(X\sim\mathrm{B}(n,p)\).

**Example 1**: A coin is biased such that the probability of obtaining a head when the coin is tossed is \(\dfrac{2}{3}\). The coin is tossed 3 times. If \(X\) represents the number of heads obtained, find \(\mathrm{P}(X=x)\) for \(x=0,1,2,3\) and tabulate the probability distribution of \(X\).

**Solution:**

\(\mathrm{P}(X=0)=\mathrm{P}(3\ \mathrm{tails})=\left(\dfrac{1}{3}\right)^{3}= \dfrac{1}{27}\)

\(\mathrm{P}(X=1)=\mathrm{P}(1\ \mathrm{head,\ 2\ \mathrm{tails}})=\,^{3}\mathrm{C}_{1} \left(\dfrac{2}{3}\right)\left(\dfrac{1}{3}\right)^{2}=\dfrac{2}{9}\)

\(\mathrm{P}(X=2)=\mathrm{P}(2\ \mathrm{heads,\ 1\ \mathrm{tail}})=\,^{3} \mathrm{C}_{2}\left(\dfrac{2}{3}\right)^{2}\left(\dfrac{1}{3}\right)=\dfrac{4}{9}\)\[\begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|c|}\hline\text{P}(X=3)=\text{P}(3\text{ heads})=\left(\frac{2}{3} \right)^{3}=\frac{8}{27}\\ \hline\text{P}(X=x)&\frac{1}{27}&\frac{2}{9}&\frac{4}{9}&\frac{8}{27}\\ \hline\end{array}\]

**Note:**

The random variable \(X\)representing the number of heads obtained is a binomial random variable. The number of trials \((n)\) is 3 while the probability of success \((p)\), i.e. the probability of obtaining a head, for each trial is \(\frac{2}{3}\). We write \(X\sim\text{B}\left(3,\frac{2}{3}\right)\).

In general, if \(X\sim\text{B}(n,p)\), how do we evaluate \(\text{P}(X=x)\) for \(x=0,1,2,...,n\)? We seek a formula that expresses \(\text{P}(X=x)\) in terms of \(x\), \(n\) and \(p\).

### Binomial Distribution

If \(X\sim\text{B}(n,p)\) where \(X\) denotes the number of successes in \(n\) trials of a binomial experiment, then the probability distribution of \(X\) is given by

\[\text{P}(X=x)=\left(\begin{array}{c}n\\ x\end{array}\right)p^{*}(1-p)^{*-x}\text{, for }x=0,1,2,...,n\text{, where }\left( \begin{array}{c}n\\ x\end{array}\right)={}^{*}C_{x}=\frac{n!}{(n-x)!x!}\]

This is called the _binomial distribution_ with parameters \(n\) and \(p\).

The mean and variance of \(X\) are given by

1. \(\text{E}(X)=np\)
2. \(\text{Var}(X)=np(1-p)\) [Highlighted formulae can be found in formula list]

**Note:**

When \(n=1\), the binomial distribution is known as the Bernoulli distribution.

**Example 2**

An ordinary fair die is tossed eight times. Find the probability of obtaining at least 6 sixes.

**Solution:**

Let \(X\) be the number of sixes obtained in 8 tosses of the die.

Then \(X\sim\text{B}\left(8,\frac{1}{6}\right)\).

Probability of obtaining at least 6 sixes

\(=\text{P}(X\geq 6)\)

\(=\text{P}(X=6,\ 7,\ 8)\)

\(=\)

**Example 3**: A binomial random variable \(X\) has mean 1.2 and variance 1.08. Evaluate the parameters of the distribution.

**Solution:**

\(X\sim\text{B}(n,p)\).

We have \(\text{E}(X)=1.2\) and \(\text{Var}(X)=1.08\).

\(\Rightarrow\)\(np=1.2\) and \(np(1-p)=1.08\)

\(\Rightarrow\)\((1.2)(1-p)=1.08\)

\(\Rightarrow\)\(1-p=0.9\)\(\Rightarrow\)\(p=0.1\) and \(n=12\)

\(\therefore X\sim\text{B}\big{(}12,0.1\big{)}\)

**Note:**

For special discrete random variables such as binomial distribution, stating \(X\sim\text{B}(n,p)\) is equivalent to listing all probabilities of the probability distribution.

### Graph of the Probability Distribution of a Binomial Random Variable

Suppose \(X\sim\text{B}(n,p)\). The graphs of the probability distribution of \(X\) for various values of \(n\) and \(p\) are shown below.

In general, as \(x\) increases, \(\text{P}(X=x)\) will increase to a maximum value and after which, it will decrease.

Using the Graphing Calculator for the last part in Example 4a

Find the value \(x\) such that \(\mathrm{P}(X=x)\) is greatest.

1. Key \(Y_{\mathrm{i}}=\) binompdf\(\left(10,0.8,x\right)\)
2. Look at the table of values and scroll down to find value \(x\) such that \(\mathrm{P}(X=x)\) is greatest.
3. Greatest \(\mathrm{P}(X=x)\) occurs when value of \(x\) is 8.

Presentation:

From GC,

P(\(X=7\)) = 0.201 (3 s.f.)

P(\(X=8\)) = 0.302 (3 s.f.)

P(\(X=9\)) = 0.268 (3 s.f.)

Since \(\mathrm{P}(X=8)\) is the greatest, he will most likely hit 8 shots on target.

Using the Graphing Calculator for an alternative method in Example 4b

Find the least value of \(n\) such that \(\mathrm{P}(Y=0)\leq 0.1\).

1. Key \(Y_{\mathrm{i}}=\) binompdf\(\left(X,0.1,0\right)\)
2. Look at the table of values and scroll down to find least value of \(n\) such that \(Y_{\mathrm{i}}=\mathrm{P}(Y=0)\leq 0.1\)
3. Since 22 is the first value such that \(Y_{\mathrm{i}}=\mathrm{P}(Y=0)\leq 0.1\), the least value of \(n\) is 22. Presentation:

From GC,

When \(n=\)21, \(\mathrm{P}(Y=0)=0.10942>0.1\)

When \(n=\)22, \(\mathrm{P}(Y=0)=0.09848<0.1\)

Therefore, the least value of \(n\) is 22.

**Example 6**: In Singapore, 1 out of 5 primary school students are myopic. A random sample size of \(n\) is taken to study the problem of myopia among Singapore students. Let \(X\) be the number of primary school students who suffer from myopia.

State, in the context of the question, two assumptions needed to model \(X\) by a binomial distribution. Explain why one of the assumptions stated may not hold in this context.

Assume now that these assumptions do in fact hold. Find the least value of \(n\), such that the probability of getting at least 2 myopic students in the sample is greater than 0.96.

**Solution:**

\(X\)\(\sim\) B(\(n\),0.2)

Assumptions: (1) The event of a student is myopic is independent from the event of another student being myopic.

(2) The probability of a student being myopic remains constant at 0.2.

(1) might not hold as if two students are from the same family, factors such as genetics (parental myopia) or study habits and conditions may determine whether the student is myopic.

\(\text{P}(X\geq 2)>0.96\)

\(\Rightarrow 1-\text{P}(X=0)-\text{P}(X=1)>0.96\)

\(\Rightarrow\text{P}(X=0)+\text{P}(X=1)<0.04\)

\(\Rightarrow\text{P}(X\leq 1)<0.04\)

From GC,

When \(n=22,\text{ P}(X\leq 1)=0.04796>0.04\)

When \(n=23,\text{ P}(X\leq 1)=0.03984<0.04\)

Therefore, least value of \(n\) is 23.
