### Introduction

In case you have not already realised, the concept of energy is central to the study of physics. As you have just learnt in the topic of Work, Energy & Power, energy can manifest in many different forms. The topic of Thermal Physics deals with several of these manifestations, which we term "heat", "thermal energy" or, as you will learn later, "internal energy of a substance". This study is important because energy in these forms is responsible for a host of phenomena which include how "hot" an object is, state changes in substances, and chemical reactions. This topic is split into two different parts. This first set of notes deals with how we perceive heat at a macroscopic level. This involves temperature and a study of the thermal properties of matter.

#### 6.1.1 Temperature & Thermometric Properties

In general, we measure the "hotness" of an object using a concept called "temperature".

In order to construct a suitable temperature "ruler" or scale, we may rely on the thermometric properties of substances.

Intuitively, a thermometric property of a substance is a physical property that varies with hotness/temperature.

Examples include:

* Length (of a strip of metal)
* Area (of a sheet of metal)
* Volume (of a column of mercury)
* Pressure (exerted by a gas on the surface of a container)A good thermometric property to set up a temperature scale would exhibit the following traits:

* Measurable
* Substance remains in the same state over the range of temperatures to be measured
* Property varies linearly over the range of temperatures to be measured

For the temperature scale that we are about to construct, we will use a column of mercury with a fixed cross sectional area.

If the surroundings of the bulb get warmer, the volume of the mercury will expand, causing the height of the liquid column to rise.

Conversely, if the surroundings of the bulb get colder, the volume of the mercury will contract, causing the height of the liquid column to fall.

#### The Centigrade Scale & Thermometer Calibration

In order to set up any scale, we need to define a lower and a higher reference (fixed) point. As we are going to chop up the difference between these two levels of hotness into 100 parts (degrees), we shall call this particular temperature scale the "_cent_igrade" scale

As water is so commonplace in both scientific study and everyday life, it makes sense that in the temperature scale that we are about to construct, water should be involved.

The **lower fixed point is the melting point of water**. We designate this as 0 degrees on the centigrade scale (0\({}^{\circ}\)C).

The **upper fixed point is the boiling point of water**. We designate this as 100 degrees on the centigrade scale (100\({}^{\circ}\)C)

With these two reference points and the column of mercury mentioned above, we are now ready to properly set up the temperature scale.

The following steps describe this process:

**Liquid-in-glass Thermometer Calibration**

1. Place the bulb of the mercury column in crushed, melting, pure ice. Measure the height of the mercury column, \(x_{0}\) * Ice must be crushed to ensure that maximum coverage of the bulb. * Ice must be melting to ensure that the temperature is at 0 degrees.
2. Immerse the bulb of the mercury column in steam. Measure the height of the mercury column \(x_{100}\). * Water must be boiling to ensure that the height represents 100 degrees. Thus, the height for each degree of temperature is given by \[\frac{\Delta x}{\Delta T}=\frac{x_{100}-x_{0}}{100}\]

For an unknown temperature which causes the mercury column to have a height of \(x_{\gamma}\), we may thus determine the temperature by taking \[T=\frac{x_{\gamma}-x_{0}}{x_{100}-x_{0}}\times 100\]

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:7]

### Learning outcomes

1. _apply the concept that, on the thermodynamic (Kevin) scale, absolute zero is the temperature at which all substances have a minimum internal energy._

The constant volume gas thermometer makes use of the pressure of the gas contained as its thermometric property.

At the lower fixed point, the mercury level on the left limb of the manometer is recorded. The gas pressure may be determined by

\[\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{lower}}=\rho_{\mathrm{Hg}}\mathrm{gh}_{\mathrm{lower}}+ \mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{atmosphere}}\]

At the upper fixed point, the higher temperature causes the gas pressure to increase and force the mercury up the tube. The flexible tube is adjusted until the mercury in the left limb is the same level as before. The new pressure is thus calculated,

\[\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{upper}}=\rho_{\mathrm{Hg}}\mathrm{gh}_{\mathrm{upper}}+ \mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{atmosphere}}\]If ice and steam points are chosen for the lower and upper fixed points, for pressures recorded at unknown temperatures, the temperature may be determined using the calibration equation in the previous section,

\[\text{T}=\frac{\text{P}_{\gamma}\text{-P}_{0}}{\text{P}_{100}\text{-P}_{0}}\times 100\]

When we try to plot a graph of pressure against temperature, a linear graph is formed. If the gas pressure is suitably low and the temperature much higher than the boiling point of the substance used, the type of gas used should not matter (as they all behave similar to an ideal gas, which we shall learn about later). The graphs for trials at different initial pressures are shown below.

The dotted lines denote the extensions of the linear graphs obtained. It is interesting to note that they all meet at -273.15 'C. This very special temperature is known as **absolute zero**. Initially this was thought to be the temperature where the molecules stopped moving. However, as you will later learn in quantum physics, it is impossible for particles to do so.

**Absolute zero** is defined as the temperature where all substances have a minimum internal energy.

#### Absolute Scale

_Learning outcomes_ _(b) show an understanding that there is an absolute scale of temperature which does not depend on the property of any particular substance, i.e. the thermodynamic scale._ _(d) convert temperatures measured in Kelvin to degrees Celsius: T/K=T/ ~C_ + 273.15._

The problem with using ice and steam points of water in the practice of science is that it is far too imprecise. The exact conditions for ice and steam points are impossibly hard to duplicate in the laboratory due to impurities in water or pressure differences at different locations. Furthermore, the thermometric properties of different materials may differ in a non-linear manner, leading to differences in the temperature scale constructed. For greater precision, we must define an **absolute thermodynamic scale**.

An **absolute thermodynamic scale** is a temperature scale that does not depend on the thermometric property of any particular substance.

This is in contrast to **empirical temperature scales**, like the centigrade.

**Empirical temperature scales** are scales which are based on the variation with temperature of a property of a substance, assuming that the property varies linearly with temperature.

As we did in the centigrade scale, we have to choose a suitable upper and lower fixed point.

We already have a most obvious candidate for a lower fixed point, and that is absolute zero.

The lower fixed point on the absolute thermodynamic scale of temperature is absolute zero.

Choosing an upper fixed point however, is less obvious. By common agreement, this was decided to be the **triple point of water**.

The upper fixed point on the absolute thermodynamic scale of temperature is the triple point of water.

The **triple point of water** is the specific pressure and temperature at which three states of water can co-exist in equilibrium.

The triple point of water was chosen because it is

unique

invariant

experimentally easy to duplicate in the laboratory

Now that we have decided on the upper and lower fixed points, we now have to decide how many divisions to chop up the scale by. Since we are used to the centigrade, we want the divisions to be similar.

Absolute zero and the triple point of water were designated the values of -273.15 'C and 0.01 'C respectively as these are the temperatures that they are _typically_ found at on the centigrade scale. Hence, by cutting up the difference in hotness between these two points into 273.16 parts and setting the start point as absolute zero, we have thus created the Kelvin scale of temperature.

**1 Kelvin (1 K)** is defined as 1/273.16 of the temperature difference between absolute zero and the triple point of water.

If we disguise the Kelvin scale to look like the centigrade scale and insist that the triple point occurs at 0.01 units of temperature above zero, we get what we now call the Celsius scale.

To convert temperature from Kelvin to Celsius and vice-versa, we use the formula,

\(T_{K}=T_{C}+273.15\)

For the A-levels, we do not distinguish between Celsius and centigrade, but note that the two scales are _not_ the same. **The Celsius and Kelvin scales are both absolute scales**, with lower and upper fixed points as absolute zero and the triple point of water. **The centigrade scale is an empirical scale** which sets the ice and steam points of water as the lower and upper fixed points. To highlight this difference, on the Celsius scale, the steam point of water is 99.98 'C (373.13 K), while on the centigrade scale, it is precisely 100 'C.

#### The Zeroth Law of Thermodynamics

Now that we have a proper understanding of temperature, we can begin to construct the laws of thermodynamics.

When two or more objects in thermal contact have no net heat transfer or cease to have any exchange of heat, i.e., at the same temperature, the objects are said to be in **thermal equilibrium**.

The **zeroth law of thermodynamics** states that if objects A and B are separately in thermal equilibrium with object C, then object A and B are in thermal equilibrium with each other.

This is the law upon which all other laws of thermodynamics are based upon.

#### Heat Capacities and Specific Heat Capacities

_Learning outcomes_

(e) define and use the concept of specific heat capacity, and identify the main principles of its determination by electrical methods.

If an object A is placed in an environment where the temperature is higher, the **energy supplied by the external hotter environment is known as thermal energy (or heat)**. Conversely, if object A is placed in a region where the **temperature is lower**, **heat is removed from the object**. The process will continue until the **object's temperature is the same as the environment**. In physics, we say **thermal equilibrium has been reached**.

Heat is usually represented mathematically with the symbol Q.

If the object in the oven is supplied with Q amount of energy, assuming that no chemical changes have occurred, and there is no change of state, it's temperature change will be proportional to Q.

Dunman High School (Senior High Physics Department)

Q = C\(\Delta\)T

The constant of proportionality, C is known as the heat capacity of the object.

The **heat capacity (C)** of an object is defined as the quantity of heat required per unit temperature rise.

Units: J.K-1, J.-C-1

For twice the amount of object A, twice the amount of energy is needed to illicit the same temperature rise. We modify the equation above slightly to give

Q = mc\(\Delta\)T

The constant of proportionality, c, is known as the specific heat capacity of the object.

The **specific heat capacity (c)** of an object is defined as the quantity of heat required per unit temperature rise per unit mass.

Units: J.(kg.K)-1, J.(kg.'C)-

Every material will have three specific heat capacities, one for each state.

Dunman High School (Senior High Physics Department)

**Example 3**

An electric heater supplies 1.8 kW of power in the form of heat to a tank of water. How long will it take to heat the 200 kg of water in the tank from 10 to 70 'C? Assume that no heat is lost to the surroundings.

Specific heat capacity of water: 4186 J.(kg.K)-1

Solution:

Heat is supplied by the electric heater.

Therefore,

\[\text{P}\Delta\text{t}=\text{Q}\]

\[\text{P}\Delta\text{t}=\text{mc}\Delta\text{T}\]

\[1800\times\Delta\text{t}=200\times 4186\times(70\text{-}10)\]

\[\Delta\text{t}=\frac{200\times 4186\times 60}{1800}=27907\text{ s}=7.75\text{ h}\]

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:16]

Note that heat can be supplied by conversion from other forms of energy.

**Example 5**

A lead bullet of mass m is fired at a tree trunk and emerges on the other side. The speed of the bullet is 500 m.s-1 as it enters and 300 m.s-1 as it emerges. Assuming that 40% of the loss of kinetic energy is stored as heat in the bullet, calculate the rise in temperature of the bullet.

Specific heat capacity of lead: 129.766 J.(kg.K)-1

Solution:

\[0.4\times\Delta\text{KE}=\text{Q}\]

\[0.4\times(\text{KE}_{\text{initial}}-\text{KE}_{\text{final}})=\text{mc}\Delta \text{T}\]

\[0.4\times\frac{1}{2}\text{m}(\text{v}_{\text{initial}}^{2}-\text{v}_{\text{ final}}^{2})=\text{mc}\Delta\text{T}\]

\[\Delta\text{T}=0.4\times\frac{\left(500^{2}-300^{2}\right)}{2\times 129.766}=246.6 \ ^{\circ}\text{C}\]

#### Changes of State, Latent Heats and Specific Latent Heats

_Learning outcomes_

* define and use the concept of specific latent heat, and identify the main principles of its determination by electrical methods.

If we plot a graph of the temperature of an object against the heat energy supplied, we obtain a plot that looks like the following.

Notice that the object increases in temperature until the melting or boiling point before it is able to undergo a change in state (physicists refer to this as phase). During the change in state, there is no temperature change.

The **latent heat** of a substance is defined as the _amount of thermal energy_ required to bring about a _complete change of state_, _without any change in temperature_.

Units: J

The **specific latent heat (I)** of a substance is defined as the _amount of thermal energy_ required _per unit mass_ to bring about a _complete change of state_ without any change in temperature_.

Units: J.kg-1

9646 Physics

Topic 6A: Thermal Physics (I) 6A-18The formula relating the latent heat to the specific latent heat is given by,

\[\begin{array}{c}\mbox{Q}=\mbox{ml}\\ \end{array}\]

Every substance has two latent heats, one for melting (or fusion) and the other for vapourisation (or condensation). The definitions above thus change slightly.

The **latent heat of fusion** a substance is defined as the amount of thermal energy required to bring about a complete change of state from solid to liquid, without any change in temperature.

The **specific latent heat of fusion, (I\({}_{\mbox{\scriptsize I}}\))** of a substance is defined as the amount of thermal energy required per unit mass to bring about a complete change of state from solid to liquid without any change in temperature.

The **latent heat of vaporisation** a substance is defined as the amount of thermal energy required to bring about a complete change of state from liquid to gas, without any change in temperature.
