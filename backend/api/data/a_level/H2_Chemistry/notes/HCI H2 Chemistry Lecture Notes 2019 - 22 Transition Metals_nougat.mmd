## 1 Introduction

### Definition of Transition Elements

_10 13(a): explain what is meant by a transition element, in terms of _d_:block elements forming one or more stable ions with partially filled _d_: subshell.

**Transition elements** are _d_-block elements that form one or more stable ions with partially filled \(d\) subshell.

By this definition, both scandium and zinc will be **excluded** from the class of transition elements, even though they are part of _d_-block elements. This is because:

\begin{tabular}{l l} Scandium forms only \(\text{Sc}^{\text{a}}\) ion which has no electron in the 3d subshell (3d): \\ Zinc forms only \(\text{Zn}^{\text{2+}}\) ion which has 10 electrons in the 3d subshell (3d): \\ \end{tabular}

Electronic Configurations of First Row Transition Elements and its ions (covered in Topic 1) Atomic Structure and Physical Periodicity)

_10 13(b): state the electronic configuration of a first row transition element and its ion_

\begin{tabular}{l l} Ac & \(\text{Sc}\) and Zn are not part of transition elements. \\ \end{tabular}

\begin{tabular}{l l} Ac & \(\text{Cr}\) and Cu are two exceptions to the general pattern of electronic configurations. \\ \end{tabular}

**Redox reactions involving transition elements**

_10 13(g): describe and explain the use of Fe\({}^{3+}\)/Fe\({}^{3+}\)/MnO\({}_{4}\)/Mn\({}^{2+}\) and Cr\({}_{2}\)O\({}^{3+}\) as examples of redox systems._

One of the applications of transition metal compounds is in the field of redox chemistry. In general, ions that have the transition metal in a high oxidation state tend to be oxidising agents (e.g. \(\bar{\mathrm{Cr}}_{2}\)O\({}_{2}\)?, MnO\({}_{4}\)?) while transition metal in low oxidation state tends to be reducing agents (e.g. Cr\({}^{2+}\), V\({}^{2+}\)). When transition metal ions undergo redox reactions, a colour change is usually observed.

Common redox systems involving transition elements include:

To predict whether a redox reaction is feasible, or to explain colour changes due to redox reactions, we can make use of \(E^{0}\) values of the relevant species to find overall \(E^{0}\) values as learnt in Topic 20 Electrochemistry.

**If \(E^{0}\) values 0, redox reaction is feasible.**
**Lecture Exercise 2.2**

By quoting and using relevant \(E^{\text{o}}\) values from the _Data Booklet_, explain each of the following observations. Write balanced equations for the reactions.

### Mode of action of the catalyst

* Adsorption: Gaseous reactant molecules, N2 and H2, diffuse towards surface of the Fe catalyst. N2 and H2 adsorb onto the active sides of Fe catalyst by formation of weak attraction forces.
* The adsorption process brings reactant molecules closer together, thus increasing their surface concentration at the catalyst surface; weakens the NNN and H-H bonds in them; and allows these molecules to be orientated in the right positions for reaction to form new bonds between N and H. All these lower the activation energy of the reaction.
* Desorption: Product molecule, NH3, desorbs and diffuses away from catalyst surface so that active sites are exposed for further reaction.

### Homogeneous Catalysis

In homogeneous catalysis, the catalyst and the reactants are dispersed in the same phase (either liquid or gaseous):

The relative ease of inter-conversion between the different oxidation states of transition metals enables them to act as homogeneous catalysts.

We shall use the same example of homogeneous catalyst given in Topic 6 Reaction Kinetics: the oxidation of iodide ion, \(\Gamma\), by peroxodisulfate ion, \(\mathrm{S_{2}O_{8}}^{2}\)-.

Based on the data above, the reaction is found to have \(E^{\mathrm{O_{cell}}}\) = +1.47 V, which is expected to occur spontaneously. However, the rate of the reaction is found to be very slow. The electrostatic repulsion between the two negatively charged ions causes the reaction to have a high activation energy and hence to proceed very slowly.

### Introduction

Transition elements and their ions tend to form complexes.

A **complex** is a molecule or ion formed by a central metal atom or ion surrounded by one or more ligands.

When white anhydrous CuSO4 solid is dissolved in water, a pale blue solution is formed. In water, Cu(II) exists as the aqua complex, with formula [Cu(H\({}_{2}\)O)6]2*. When we write "Cu2*(aq)", it refers to [Cu(H\({}_{2}\)O)6]2*(aq).

In this complex, the central metal ion is Cu2*, with six H\({}_{2}\)O molecules acting as ligands.

Each H\({}_{2}\)O molecule bonds to the Cu2* ion by forming a **coordinate (dative) bond**.

Notice that the formula of a complex ion is usually written with a square bracket, the charge of the complex is indicated outside the square bracket.

This complex is called the 'aqua complex' since its ligands are water.

A complex can be neutral, cationic or anionic. The net charge on the complex is the sum of the oxidation number of the central metal ion and the total charges of the ligands that surround it. The charge on the central metal is the oxidation number of the metal in that complex ion.

To maintain charge neutrality, complex ion is typically associated with **counter ions**, as in the case of the compound [Co(NH\({}_{3}\))6]3*, in which the complex ion is [Co(NH\({}_{3}\))6]3*, the six NH\({}_{3}\) molecules acting as ligands, and the three CF ions are counter ions. So the whole compound is like \(\bar{a}\) salt.

Figure 4: Copper(II) complex with water
The tendency of transition metal ions to form complex ions rather than simple ions is due to two main factors:

The "bare" cations of transition elements, with their incomplete 3d subshells are relatively small and highly charged. The resulting high charge density and hence high polarising power of the transition metal cations, produces a strong tendency towards covalent bond formation with ligands.

The transition metal cations have vacant 3d orbitals (as well as 4s and 4p orbitals) which can be used to accommodate the lone pair of electrons from the ligands, resulting in native bond formation.

### Ligands

A ligand is an ion or molecule with one or more lone pairs of electrons available to be donated into the vacant orbitals of transition metal atom or ion.

Ligands can be classified according to the number of dative bonds that it forms with the central metal atom or ion.

Monodentate ligands bond using the electron pair of a single donor atom.

Bidentate ligands bond using electron pairs on two donor atoms.

Polydentate ligands bond using electron pairs on more than one donor atom (which includes bidentate ligand).

Polydentate ligands are sometimes called **chelating agents** (pronounced as _key-late-ting_) because of their ability to hold a metal ion like a claw. Chelating ligands form a stable complex ion with the central metal ion as the pincer-like grip of these polydentate ligands are able to hold the cation more securely. They typically form rings in the complex ion.

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:16]

### _Acidity of aqua complexes_

In aqueous solution, the transition metal ions exist as aqua complexes. Aqua complexes containing transition metal cations like Fe\({}^{3+}\) and Cr\({}^{3+}\) undergo hydrolysis in water to give a mildly acidic solution.

This is due to the **high charge density** on the central transition metal cation and these aqua complexes undergo appreciable hydrolysis in a similar fashion to the [A/(H\({}_{2}\)O)\({}_{6}\)]\({}^{3+}\) ion (refer to salt hydrolysis in Topic 15 Acid-Base equilibria).

However, for oxidation states higher than +3, the polarising power of the central metal cation is so great that the release of protons and loss of water molecules results in the formation of oxoanions.

For instance, [Cr(H\({}_{2}\)O)\({}_{6}\)]\({}^{6+}\) ions do not exist in aqueous solution. Instead, Cr(VI), occurs in two well-known oxoanions, the chromate (VI) ion, CrO\({}_{4}\)\({}^{2-}\), and the dichromate (VI) ion, Cr\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{7}\)\({}^{2-}\).

#### Effects of ligand exchange on reduction potential (Application Example)

Ligands interact differently with the central metal ion, which will result in some change in reduction potential. For example, when water (H\({}_{2}\)O) ligands are replaced by cyanide ligands (CN-) for Fe\({}^{3+}\), we can see that there is a change in redox potential for the complex ions.

With the replacement of water ligands by cyanide ligands, \(E^{0}\) for the reduction of Fe(III) to Fe(II) becomes less positive. This is significant in the reaction with iodide ions.

#### 4.5.3 Ligand exchange reaction in haemoglobin

Haemoglobin is the iron-containing protein in red blood cells that transports oxygen in blood, It consists of four protein chains loosely held together in a cluster. Each chain has a haem molecule within its folds. Iron (in the +2 oxidation state) is located in the centre of a plane of four nitrogen atoms. A haemoglobin molecule in the lungs picks up an O\({}_{2}\) molecule, which forms a dative bond with the iron to form a species called _oxyhaemoglobin_. This binding is reversible and enables haemoglobin to carry oxygen around the body and release it where it is needed.

Carbon monoxide, CO, can replace O\({}_{2}\) as the ligand attached to the iron(II). This is a ligand exchange reaction. The new complex is called _carboxyhaemoglobin_. The binding between CO and the iron(II) is irreversible, thus making carboxyhaemoglobin a very stable complex. The affinity of human haemoglobin for CO is about 210 times greater than that for O\({}_{2}\). As a result, a relatively small quantity of CO can inactivate a substantial fraction of the haemoglobin for oxygen transport. If the concentration of CO is high and the level of carboxyhaemoglobin becomes too high, oxygen transport is effectively shut down and death occurs.

Figure 5: (a) Structure of the haem group. (b) Haem, haemoglobin and oxygen transport. The central iron(II) exhibits hexa co-ordination. Four of the co-ordination sites are taken up by nitrogen from a ring system called a porphyrin that acts as a tetradentate ligand. Below the plane of this ring is a fifth nitrogen atom from a histidine side-chain on a protein molecule called globin. The O\({}_{2}\) molecule may be reversibly bonded at the sixth site. (c) O\({}_{2}\) molecules bind to the deoxyhaemoglobin, forming oxygenoglobin that is transported around the circulatory system in red blood cells. The O\({}_{2}\) molecules bind reversibly with the iron, thus allowing easy release of O\({}_{2}\) for cellular respiration

## 5 Coloured compounds and complexes

Transition metal compounds are frequently coloured, both in the solid state and in solution. This is due to absorption of part of the visible spectrum by the solution. The reason behind the observed colour can be explained using crystal field theory.

### Light and Colour

White light is an electromagnetic radiation consisting of all wavelengths in the visible range. It can be dispersed into a spectrum of colours, each of which has a narrower range of wavelengths, for example, it can be dispersed into seven colours commonly known as the rainbow by using a prism:

Each colour has a complementary colour. For example, green and red are complementary colours. This is shown as opposite wedges in the colour wheel diagram below.

The energy of the light is inversely proportional to its wavelength. Therefore, red colour, with longer wavelength is lower in energy as compared to blue light, which is shorter in wavelength.

Objects appear coloured in white light because they absorb certain wavelengths and reflect or transmit others: an opaque object reflects light, whereas a clear one transmits it. The reflected or transmitted light enters the eye and the brain perceives a colour. If an object absorbs all visible wavelengths, it appears black; if it reflects all, it appears white.

### Crystal field theory

The crystal field theory was first developed to account for the properties of transition metal ions in solids. In this theory, the lone pair on ligand is modelled as a point negative charge that attracts the positive central metal ion, which provides the stability to the complex. They also repel the electrons in the d orbitals of the metal ion.

Figure 6: A diagram of the colour wheel, with approximate wavelength ranges (in nm), shown as wedges.

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:23]

* When white light shines on the solution, the electron at the lower energy level will absorb energy from the light and jump to one of the higher energy orbitals.
* The energy gap (\(\Delta E\)) between the two levels corresponds to a range of wavelength in the visible spectrum: For Ti\({}^{3+}\)(aq), it happens to be in the green and yellow range.
* The complementary colours red, orange, blue and violet lights are transmitted, thus the solution looks purple.

_LO 13(I): explain, in terms of \(d\) orbital splitting and \(d\)-\(d\) transition, why transition element complexes are usually coloured [knowledge of the relative order of ligand field strength is not required]_

In the presence of ligands, the partially filled degenerate 3\(d\) orbitals of a transition metal ion are split into two different energy levels with a small energy gap \(\Delta E\) between them. There are vacancies in the higher energy \(d\) orbitals. The promotion of an electron from the lower to the higher of these \(d\) orbitals requires the absorption of radiation in the visible spectrum with energy corresponding to the energy gap. Such a d-d transition is responsible for the colour of the complex ion. The colour observed is the complement of the colours absorbed.

Figure 10: Orbital diagram depicting \(d\)-\(d\) electron transition.

Figure 9: Splitting of \(d\) orbitals by an octahedral field of ligands.

### Factors affecting the colour of complexes

#### 5.3.1 Oxidation state of the metal

Different number of electrons in the \(d\) orbitals of the transition metal ion will result in different interactions with the electrons from the ligands. This will give rise to different energy gap (\(\Delta E\)) thus the wavelengths of light absorbed will also be different. The table below shows the example of vanadium complexes.

#### 5.3.2 Nature of ligand

Different ligands have different effects on the splitting of the \(d\) orbitals. The difference in magnitude of \(\Delta E\) will lead to different colours observed. The diagram below shows the example of nickel complexes.

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:28]

You may be asked to propose a sequence of test-tube reactions to identify inorganic ions. This means you need to review your inorganic Chemistry Qualitative Analysis notes. Inorganic QA tests are based on four main types of chemical reactions that produce precipitates, gases, and colour changes. Try to identify these four main types of inorganic reactions in your QA notes:

Ionic precipitation reactions

Acid-base reactions

Redox reactions

Complex forming reactions including ligand exchange

When planning a qualitative analysis experiment, you may be asked to:

Present the sequence of tests. You may use a flowchart or table.

Write the procedure with essential details of quantities and conditions for each test.

State the expected observations for both positive and negative tests.

Explain the chemistry underlying each test e.g. type of reaction, identity of species responsible for precipitate / gas / colour change.

The unknown ions might be present in a mixture, and you might be required to plan a filtration to separate the ions or precipitates. For example, **FA1** contains two cations (Fe\({}^{2*}\) and Zn\({}^{2*}\)). NaOH(aq) and NH\({}_{3}\)(aq) are common test reagents for cations: Fe\({}^{2+}\) forms an insoluble basic hydroxide while Zn\({}^{2*}\) forms a soluble amphoteric hydroxide, which can be separated by filtration. A sample plan is shown below.
