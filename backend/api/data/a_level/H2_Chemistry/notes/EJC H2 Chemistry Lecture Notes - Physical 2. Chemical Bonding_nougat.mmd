At **a** when a covalent bond is formed, the average nucleus-nucleus distance is known as the **bond length**.

Being attracted to both the hydrogen nuclei, the two electrons spend most of their time in the region between the two nuclei. This is where the **highest electron-density** (or electron probability) occurs in a covalent bond. The two electrons are therefore _shared_ between the two adjacent atoms.

Similar to the idea of _atomic orbitals_, the region of space _within_ a molecule where a particular electron is found is known as a **molecular orbital**.

#### 1.2.1 Sigma (\(\alpha\)) Bonds

A single bond is formed when a pair of electrons is shared between two atoms. If this bond is formed due to the **head-on overlap of an orbital of each atom** (this can involve s orbitals, p orbitals, or a mixture of the two as shown in the diagram below), then this bond is referred to as a **sigma (\(\alpha\)) bond**.

#### 1.5.2 Bond Strength

The strength of a covalent bond is measured by its **bond energy**. The **stronger** the covalent bond, the **higher** the bond energy.

 Bond energy is the **amount of energy** required to break **one mole of covalent bonds** in the **gaseous state**.

_e.g._\(Cb(g)\to 2Cl(g)\)

Energy is **released** during bond **formation** (i.e. this is an **exothermic** reaction)

Energy is **absorbed** during bond **breaking** (i.e. this is an **endothermic** reaction)

The strength of covalent bonds is generally dependent on the following factors:

* **bond order** i.e. number of covalent bonds formed between two atoms
* **effectiveness of overlap of orbitals**
* **bond polarity**

(i) Bond order

As bond order **increases**, the **number of bonding electrons within the inter-nuclei region increases**. Hence, the **electrostatic forces of attraction for these electrons increases**.

 bond order types of bond

1 **single**

2 **double**

3 **triple**

Example: Strength of covalent bond: \(C\)-\(C\) < \(C\)=\(C\) < \(C\)=\(C\)

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|} \hline  & \(C\)-\(C\) & \(C\)=\(C\) & \(C\)=\(C\) \\ \hline bond energy / kJ mol\({}^{-1}\) & 350 & 610 & 840 \\ \hline bond length / nm & 0.154 & 0.134 & 0.120 \\ \hline \end{tabular}

(ii) **Effectiveness of orbital overlap**

Generally, **larger orbitals are more diffused**, which results in **less effective orbital overlap**. Hence, bonds formed by **larger atoms** will tend to have **lower bond strength**.

 Example: Trend of bond energies of some Group 17 elements

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|} \hline  & bond energy / kJ mol\({}^{-1}\) \\ \hline C\(L\)-\(Cl\) & 244 \\ \hline Br-Br & 193 \\ \hline I-I & 151 \\ \hline \end{tabular}

* **Bond polarity** (i.e. unequal sharing of electrons in a covalent bond) In a polar bond, there are **additional attractive forces between the \(\delta\)+ and \(\delta\)-** that **strengthens the covalent bond**, leading to **higher bond strength**. The **more polar** the bond, the **stronger** the bond. This factor of bond polarity only comes into play when bonds have **comparable** bond order and effectiveness of orbital overlap.

**Example:**

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|} \hline  & bond energy / kJ mol\({}^{-1}\) & bond length / nm \\ \hline C\(\equiv\)O & 1070 & 0.113 \\ \hline N\(\equiv\)N & 994 & 0.110 \\ \hline \end{tabular} CO and N\({}_{2}\) have similar bond lengths. However, the C\(\equiv\)O bond is polar while the N\(\equiv\)N is not, leading to the C\(\equiv\)O bond having higher bond strength.

#### Bond Length

Bond length is the **average distance** between the **nuclei of atoms**.

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|} \hline  & bond length & \\ \hline \end{tabular} The **longer** the bond, the **weaker** the covalent bond. For example, the H\(-\)F bond energy is 562 kJ mol\({}^{-1}\) while the H\(-\)Cl bond energy is 431 kJ mol\({}^{-1}\), indicating that the H\(-\)F bond is stronger. This is due to fluorine having a smaller atomic radius, leading to H\(-\)F bond having a shorter bond length than H\(-\)Cl.

In summary, when

* **bond order increases** or
* **effectiveness of orbital overlap increases** or
* **polarity of bond increases**,
* **bond length decreases** and **bond strength increases**.

### 1.6 Representing Covalent Bonding

[label=LO]
**Representing Covalent Bonds: Dot-And-Cross Diagrams**

[label=LO]
**Deccribe, including the use of 'dot-and-cross' diagrams:**

**covalent bonding, as in hydrogen; oxygen; nitrogen; chlorine; hydrogen chloride; carbon dioxide; methane; ethene**
** co-ordinate (dative covalent) bonding, as in formation of the ammonium ion and in the A**\({}_{b}\)C**\({}_{b}\) molecule.**

When an atom bonds with others, normally only electrons in the **valence shell** are involved. When looking at bonding in _simple terms_, we can ignore the distinction between the various types of orbitals (s, p, d, _etc._) in a shell and consider all electrons in the valence shell as a group.

If an atom has more than one electron in its valence shell, it can form more than one covalent bond with other atoms. For example, the beryllium atom (1s\({}^{2}\) 2s\({}^{2}\)) has a pair of 2s electrons. When forming a compound such as beryllium hydride, BeH\({}_{2}\), these electrons can unpair themselves and form two bonds with two hydrogen atoms:

The boron atom (1s\({}^{2}\) 2s\({}^{2}\) 2p\({}^{1}\)) can form three bonds as exemplified by boron hydride, BH\({}_{3}\), while the carbon atom (1s\({}^{2}\) 2s\({}^{2}\) 2p\({}^{2}\)) with four electrons in its valence shell can form four bonds as in methane, CH\({}_{4}\), shown above.

Often, for clarity, bonding diagrams show only the electrons in the valence shell, omitting the inner shells.

[label=How to draw dot-and-cross diagrams for species containing covalent bonds]

* Identify the **central atom** in the **chemical formula**. The central atom is _usually_ the atom with the **lowest electronegativity (except H)**.
* Determine the **number of valence electrons (by group number)** for each atom.

[label=Step 0] For an **anion, add electron(s)** to the **more electronegative** atom (F, O, C_l, N_). For a **cation, remove electron(s)** from the **less electronegative** atom.
* Determine the **type of bond formed** (single, double, triple or dative) between the central atom and its neighbouring atoms through sharing of valence electrons to achieve **noble gas electronic configurations**. Use **dots** and **crosses** on **alternate atoms**.
* Arrange the **remaining valence electrons (not involved in bonding) in pairs**. These electrons are known as **lone pairs of electrons** (non-bonding electrons).
* Check that each atom achieves a **stable noble gas configuration** (_ideal case_, but sometimes, the central atom does not achieve this). **Elements from period 3 onwards can expand octet** i.e. have more than 8 electrons around the atom (see Note on next page for the reason why). If the central atom cannot expand octet, consider changing a double bond to a dative bond.

## 2 Shape and Polarity

In a polyatomic species, the valence electron pairs of each atom, both bond pairs and lone pairs, repel one another to be as far as possible from each other. Hence, covalent molecules and polyatomic ions possess a definite, unique, three-dimensional shape which is determined by the angles between the bonds within them.

\begin{tabular}{|c c|c|} \hline LO (d) & Explain the shapes of, and bond angles in, molecules such as BF\({}_{3}\) (trigonal planar); CO\({}_{2}\) (linear); CH\({}_{4}\) (tetrahedral); NH\({}_{3}\) (trigonal pyramidal); H\({}_{2}\)O (bent); SF\({}_{6}\) (octahedral) by using the Valence Shell Electron Pair Repulsion theory. (e) & Predict the shapes of, and bond angles in, molecules analogous to those specified in (d) \\ \hline \end{tabular}

### The Valence Shell Electron Pair Repulsion (VSEPR) Theory

The Valence Shell Electron Pair Repulsion (VSEPR) theory is used to predict the shape of a molecule or ion. The two general principles of VSEPR theory are:

**2** & & opposite sides of each other \\ \hline

**Principle 2**: **lone pair-lone pair** > **lone pair-bond pair** > **bond pair-bond pair**

**repulsion**

**repulsion**

**Orbitals containing lone pairs are closer to the nucleus than those containing bond pairs. Thus, they take up more space around the central atom and occupy a larger volume. Hence, lone pairs repel the other electron pairs that surround the atom more strongly.**

**Due to the difference in extent of repulsion, bond angle between the bond pairs decreases when there are more lone pairs.**

**Example** & **CH4** & **NH3** & **H2O** \\ \hline

**The starting point for working out a molecular shape is the dot-and-cross diagram. From there, determine the number of lone pairs and bond pairs. Refer to the table on the next page for the various shapes and bond angles.**

_Useful info to take note of:_

**A dative bond is a covalent bond. Hence, it is counted as a bond pair.**

**Single unpaired electrons generally occupy less space compared to an electron pair, whether bond pair or lone pair, and will be less effective in diminishing the basic angle as lone pair-bond pair repulsion is greater than lone electron-bond pair repulsion:**

### 2 Polarity of Molecules

[label=LO(g)]

Deduce the polarity of a molecule using bond polarity and its molecular shape (analogous to those specified in **(d)**).

Each of the polar bonds in a molecule has its own dipole associated with it.

[label=

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:25]

**Comparing the Polarities of NH\({}_{3}\) and NF\({}_{3}\) (for enrichment)**

Despite the differences in electronegativities between N and H, and between N and F, being similar, NH\({}_{3}\) has a much higher dipole moment compared to NF\({}_{3}\).

This is because dipoles are induced not just in polar bonds, but also in lone pairs of electrons. The lone pair of electrons is an area of negative charge, so it forms the \(\delta\)- end of a dipole which points away from the positively charged nucleus of the atom.

In NH\({}_{3}\), the dipole due to the lone pair helps reinforce the dipoles from the N-H bonds, resulting in a highly polar molecule. However, in the case of NF\({}_{3}\), this dipole partially offsets the dipole due to the N-F bonds, resulting in a smaller resultant dipole.

**Cinelepoint**

I am able to predict the shape of the molecule and its bond angle.

I am able to represent and represent the shape of molecules and polyatomic ions clearly, using dash and wedge where necessary, and drawing the bonds at appropriate angles to each other.

I am able to able to predict if a molecule is polar or non-polar.

Intermolecular Forces of Attraction

The covalently bonded molecules we have looked at so far have **simple molecular structures**.

Substances made up of such molecules are often gases or liquids at room temperature. This is because, although the **intramolecular** covalent bonding _within_ each molecule is very strong, the **intramolecular attractions**_between_ one molecule and another are comparatively weak.

There are three main categories of intermolecular attraction:

* **instantaneous dipole-induced dipole interactions**
* **permanent dipole-permanent dipole interactions**
* **hydrogen bonding**

LO (h): Describe the following forces of attraction (electrostatic in nature):

(i): intermolecular forces, based on permanent and induced dipoles, as in CHCh(I); Brz(I) and the liquid noble gases

(ii): hydrogen bonding, using ammonia and water as examples of molecules containing -NH and -OH groups

### Instantaneous Dipole-Induced Dipole Interactions

Temporary fluctuations in the electron distributions within atoms and non-polar molecules could result in the formation of short-lived **instantaneous dipole moments**, which produce attractive forces between otherwise non-polar substances. These attractive interactions are weak and fall off rapidly with increasing distance.

Consider a pair of adjacent He atoms:

* On average, the two electrons in each He atom are uniformly distributed within the nucleus. However, because the electrons are in constant motion, their distribution in one atom is likely to be _asymmetrical_ at any given instant, resulting in an **Instantaneous dipole moment** that lasts in the order of 10-16 seconds:

* As shown above, the instantaneous dipole on one atom can interact with the electrons in an adjacent atom, pulling them towards the positive end of the instantaneous dipole or repelling them from the negative end. The net effect is that the first atom causes the **temporary** formation of a dipole, called an **induced dipole**, in the second. Interactions between these temporary dipoles cause atoms to be attracted to one another.
* An instant later, the first atom might change its dipole through another movement of electrons within it, so the original dipole attraction might be destroyed. This changed dipole will induce new dipoles in another neighbouring atom, however, and so new intermolecular attractions will be formed.

The **strength of instantaneous dipole-induced dipole interactions** is related to the ease of deformation of the electron distribution in an atom or molecule (i.e. their **polarisability**)

The polarisability of the electron cloud of a substance depends on:

* **Number of electrons*
* When a molecule has **more electrons**, it will have a **bigger and more polarisable electron cloud**.
* This leads to **stronger** intermolecular instantaneous dipole-induced dipole interactions, which requires **more energy** to overcome.

\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|} \hline
**molecule** & **boiling point/\({}^{9}\)C** & **reasons** \\ \hline CH\({}_{4}\) & \(-164\) & These molecules have the same shape (tetrahedral), but the number of electrons \\ GeH\({}_{4}\) & \(-89\) & increases going down the group, from 10 in \\ SnH\({}_{4}\) & \(-52\) & CH\({}_{4}\) to 18 in SiH\({}_{4}\) to 36 in GeH\({}_{4}\) and 54 in SnH\({}_{4}\). \\ \hline \(F_{2}\) & \(-188\) & All of these are linear, diatomic molecules. \\ C\({}_{2}\) & \(-35\) & Down the group, the number of electrons \\ Br\({}_{2}\) & 59 & increases, from 18 in F\({}_{2}\), to 34 in C\({}_{2}\), to 70 in \\ I\({}_{2}\) & 184 & Br\({}_{2}\) and 106 in I\({}_{2}\). \\ \hline CH\({}_{4}\) & \(-164\) & \\ CH\({}_{3}\)CH\({}_{3}\) & \(-89\) & Along the alkane series, the molecules contain \\ CH\({}_{3}\)CH\({}_{2}\)CH\({}_{3}\) & \(-42\) & more electrons (an extra 8 for each CH\({}_{2}\) group).

Intermolecular Forces of Attraction

* **Shape of molecule** (refers to **elongated** versus **spherical** shape)
* Compared to spherical molecules, the **elongated molecules have greater surface area of contact.**
* This leads to **stronger** intermolecular instantaneous dipole-induced dipole interactions, which requires **more energy** to overcome.

For example, 2,2-dimethylpropane and pentane are **isomers** i.e. they both have the same chemical formula, C\({}_{5}\)H\({}_{12}\), but different arrangement of atoms.

Since they have the same chemical formula, they will have the same number of electrons. However, 2,2-dimethylpropane has a lower boiling point of 9.5 \({}^{\circ}\)C, while pentane boils at a higher temperature of 36.1 \({}^{\circ}\)C. This is due to the difference in the shapes of the molecules.

[MISSING_PAGE_POST]

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:30]

### Hydrogen Bonding

When a **hydrogen atom is bonded to a very electronegative atom such as nitrogen, oxygen or fluorine**, it will have a significant partial positive charge (\(\delta+\)). Hence, this hydrogen atom with a large \(\delta+\) can experience a particularly strong attraction to a **lone pair of electrons on a nitrogen, oxygen or fluorine atom** in an adjacent molecule, as the lone pairs of electrons in such atoms are in orbitals that are small enough to interact with the \(\delta+\) hydrogen atom. An intermolecular attractive force called a **hydrogen bond** is thus created.

Hydrogen bond is defined as the **electrostatic forces of attraction** between the **partial positive** (\(\delta+\)) **hydrogen atom that is directly bonded to a very electronegative F, O or N atom and a **lone pair of electrons** of another F, O or N atom.

While the name "hydrogen bond" makes such an interaction sound like it is a type of covalent bond, it is not. In fact, hydrogen bonds are about 10 times weaker than a typical covalent bond.

Hydrogen bonds are represented by dotted lines between the \(\delta+\) hydrogen and the lone pair of electrons on a very electronegative element (F, O, N).

[FIGURE:S3.F1][ENDFIGUR

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:32]

Intermolecular Forces of Attraction

Generally, for molecules with similar number of electrons, the relative strengths of intermolecular forces of attraction are in the order of:

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|} \hline
**hydrogen** & **permanent dipole-** & **imstantaneous dipole-** \\
**bonds** & **permanent dipole interactions** & **induced dipole interactions** \\ \hline \end{tabular} This has implications on physical properties such as boiling points of covalent compounds.

In the examples below, the compounds are grouped together by similar number of electrons. This implies that the instantaneous dipole-induced dipole interactions will be similar in strength within each grouping.

The first compound in each grouping is a hydrocarbon which is essentially non-polar. Molecules of these compounds are held together by instantaneous dipole-induced dipole interactions _only_.

The second compound in each grouping is an aldehyde with a polar -CHO group. Molecules of these compounds are held together by stronger permanent dipole-permanent dipole interactions, on top of instantaneous dipole-induced dipole interactions, leading to higher boiling points.

The last compound in each grouping is an alcohol with a polar -OH group, which is capable of forming hydrogen bonds. These molecules are held together by even stronger hydrogen bonding, on top of the permanent dipole-permanent dipole interactions and instantaneous dipole-induced dipole interactions. Hence, they have the highest boiling points compared to the rest in the group.

## Appendix A

### Influence of Hydrogen Bonding on Physical Properties of Molecules

#### 4.2.1 Unusually high boiling points of ammonia, water and hydrogen fluoride

when compared to other hydrides in the same group:

All hydrides in each group have **simple molecular** structures.

As **number of electrons increases** down each group, **strength of intermolecular instantaneous dipole-induced dipole interactions increases**. A **larger amount of energy** is required to overcome the stronger intermolecular instantaneous dipole-induced dipole interactions. Hence, boiling point of hydrides increases down the group.

However, boiling points of ammonia, water and hydrogen fluoride are **higher than expected**. This is because **more** energy is needed to overcome the **stronger** intermolecular **hydrogen bonds** in **ammonia**, **water** and **hydrogen fluoride** compared to the **weaker** intermolecular **instantaneous dipole-induced dipole interactions** in other hydrides.

(See Section 3.3 for the comparison between the boiling points of ammonia, water and hydrogen fluoride.)

#### 4.2.2 Anomalous relative molecular masses of organic acids (R-CO\({}_{2}\)H)

Ethanoic acid, CH\({}_{3}\)CO\({}_{2}\)H, has an **apparent _M\({}_{r}\)_ of 120.0 which is **double** the expected _M\({}_{r}\)_ of 60.0 in the gas phase or when dissolved in benzene.

This is due to each acid molecule pairing up to form a **cyclic** (closed ring) **dimer**_via_ intermolecular **hydrogen bonds**.

.2.3 High solubility of ammonia, alcohols (R-OH), organic acids and amines (R-NH\({}_{2}\)) in water

These substances can form intermolecular hydrogen bonds with water molecules as shown below:

\begin{tabular}{l l} \multicolumn{2}{l}{_Note:_ When illustrating solubility in water via hydrogen bonding, show: \\
1 & at least 1 solute molecule and 1 water molecule \\
2 & hydrogen bonds, \\
3 & lone pair of electrons, \\
4 & partial charges (dipoles) \\ \end{tabular}

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:40]

#### 4.2.5 Higher density of water compared to ice

Intermolecular hydrogen bonding holds ice molecules in place in an **orderly open structure** with **large amount of empty spaces** in between.

In this extended network, each water molecule forms **two** hydrogen bonds with its neighbouring water molecules such that each oxygen atom is surrounded by **four** hydrogen atoms.

Water molecules in the liquid state are able to occupy the spaces in between when ice melts. More molecules present in a fixed volume accounts for the higher density of water.

### 4.3 Giant Molecules

Giant molecules can have **giant covalent** or **macromolecular lattices**. Such lattices consist of an **extensive three-dimensional arrays of atoms**, which can either be all of the same type, as in the elements carbon (diamond and graphite) and silicon, or of two different elements such as in silicon(IV) oxide, SiO\({}_{2}\), and boron(III) nitride, BN.

The **atoms are all joined to one another by strong covalent bonds**. So a single crystal of diamond or quartz is in fact a single molecule. For atoms to become free from the lattice, these strong bonds have to be broken. Substances containing this type of lattice therefore have very high melting and boiling points:

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|} \hline
**substance** & **formula** & **type of interatomic** & **melting** & **boiling** \\  & & **attraction** & **point\({}^{o}\)C** & **point\({}^{o}\)C** \\ \hline silicon & Si & covalent & 1412 & 3265 \\ \hline silicon(IV) oxide & SiO\({}_{2}\) & covalent & 1610 & 2959 \\ \hline diamond & C & covalent & 3500 & 3930 \\ \hline \end{tabular}

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|} \hline
**Property** & **Reasons** \\ \hline
**High melting / boiling point** & **Large amount of energy is needed to **overcome** the **strong covalent bonds between atoms** in a **giant molecular structure**. \\ \hline
**Non-conductors** of **electricity** in any state & Electrons are **localised** in **covalent bonds** and are **not** **mobile** to conduct electricity. \\ \hline
**Insoluble** in both **water** and **non-polar** solvents & **No favourable solute-solvent interactions** between solute particles and water / solvent molecules can be formed to **break down the giant molecular structure** for hydration / solvation. \\ \hline
**Hard, strong** and **non-malleable** & **Atoms** are held closely together by **strong covalent bonds** in **a giant molecular structure**. \\  & (Can be used as **abrasives** due to their **hardness** and **high melting points**, _e.g._ diamond-tipped tools is used to cut rocks) \\ \hline \end{tabular}

**Giant molecular layered structure** consists of **atoms** held together by **strong covalent bonds** in **giant extensive planar layers** with the **adjacent layers** held together by **weak instantaneous dipole-induced dipole interactions**.

**Soft and slippery** **Adjacent layers** are held together by **weak instantaneous dipole-induced dipole interactions** and so the layers can **easily slide** over one another.

(Can be used as a lubricant because of this property, as well as its ability to withstand high temperatures due to its high melting point).

### _Formation of Ionic Bond_

\begin{tabular}{|c|} \hline
**Ionic bonds** are **strong electrostatic forces of attraction** between **oppositely charged ions** in a giant ionic lattice structure \\ \hline
**Ionic bonds** are typically formed between a metallic element and a non-metallic element, when one atom (the metal) totally gives away one or more electrons to the non-metallic atom. This results in **ions** being formed. \\ \hline Atoms with _low ionisation energies_ can lose valence electrons to become positive ions, known as **actions**. The electrons are donated to atoms to form negative ions, known as **anions**. This can be represented using a **'dot-and-cross' diagram**: \\ \end{tabular}

Dots and crosses distinguish where the electron comes from, although in reality there is no difference between them. The charge on the ion should be shown as a superscript outside the square bracket.

The ions that make up ionic compounds are not always monatomic, _i.e._, they do not always contain _only one atom_. Several common ions contain _groups_ of atoms which are **covalently bonded** together, and which have an overall positive or negative charge e.g. SO\({}_{4}\)\({}^{2}\)- and NH\({}_{4}\)\({}^{*}\).

### 5.2 Factors affecting Ionic Bond Strength

The strength of an **ionic bond** is measured by the **magnitude** of **lattice energy** (\(\Delta H_{\text{lat}}\)) of the ionic compound.

**Lattice energy, \(\Delta H_{\text{lat}}\) of an ionic crystal is the **energy released** when **one mole** of the **solid ionic compound** is **formed from** its **constituent gaseous ions**.

_e.g._ Na\({}^{*}\)(g) + \(Ct(g)\) \(\rightarrow\) Na\(C\)(s) \(\Delta H<0\)

\[\left|\Delta H_{\text{lat}}\right|\propto\left|\frac{q^{+}\times q^{-}}{r_{+}+ r_{-}}\right|\]

where \(q^{+}\) and \(q^{-}\) : charges on the cation and anion respectively

\(r_{+}\) and \(r_{-}\) : ionic radii of cation and anion respectively

Generally, the **greater** the **magnitude of lattice energy**, the **stronger** the ionic bonds. Also, generally the **difference in charge is more important than the difference in radius**.

**Equible SA**

In terms of structure and bonding, explain why MgO (m.p. 2850 \({}^{\circ}\)C) has a higher melting point than Na\({}_{2}\)O (m.p. 1130 \({}^{\circ}\)C).

Both MgO and Na\({}_{2}\)O have held together by

Both compounds have the same anionic charge and radius.

However, Mg\({}^{2+}\) has a ionic charge and ionic radius than Na\({}^{*}\).

is required to overcome the in MgO. Hence, MgO has a higher melting point.

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:47]

### Giant Ionic Lattice

In an ionic lattice of a solid, ions are arranged in a fixed, **orderly** manner in a **giant ionic lattice** structure.

* Each cation is surrounded by a number of anions as its closest neighbours.
* Each anion is surrounded by a number of cations as its closest neighbours.
* No two cations or anions will be adjacent to each other.
* The electrostatic force of attraction exists between any two adjacent ions of opposite charge. Hence, an ionic bond is said to be **non-directional**.

In the case of sodium chloride, NaCl, each Na+ ion is surrounded by six of the larger \(CI\) ions while each \(CI\)- ion is surrounded by six Na+ ions. (Refer to Appendix 5 for information on Coordination Number for ionic compounds)

Describe the bonding in magnesium oxide and explain why it acts as an insulator.

Suggest a reason why copper is suitable for encasing the magnesium oxide.

## 6 Intermediate Bond Types

Many covalent and ionic bonds have **intermediate bond character** - some covalent bonds have **ionic character** and some ionic bonds have **covalent character**

### Ionic Character in Covalent Bond

Ionic character in a covalent bond arises due to sharing of electrons between atoms with a **considerable electronegativity difference**.

The **more electronegative** atom acquires a **partial negative charge** (denoted by \(\delta\)-), the **less electronegative** atom acquires a **partial positive charge** (denoted by \(\delta\)+), forming a **dipole moment** in a **polar** covalent bond

The extent of **ionic character** in a covalent bond **increases** with an **increase in electronegativity difference** between the covalently bonded atoms.

If we compare HBr and HI, both are simple molecular compounds with weak intermolecular permanent dipole-permanent dipole interactions between molecules.

As electronegativity of iodine is lower than that of bromine (as electronegativity decreases down a group), the electronegativity difference between the atoms in HI is smaller than that between HBr. Hence, HI has a smaller degree of ionic character.

### 6.2 Covalent Character in Ionic Bond

In a pure ionic bond, there is complete transfer of electrons and the electron clouds of both the cation and anion remain intact.

Covalent character in an ionic bond arises due to **polarisation**, which refers to the **distortion of anion electron cloud by a neighbouring cation** in an ionic compound. Due to this, there is some form of "electron sharing" between oppositely charged ions, leading to some covalent character being induced in the ionic bond

Fajans' rules can be used to predict the extent of polarisation, which depends on the **charge on the cation** and the **relative sizes of the cation and anion**:

\begin{tabular}{|l|c|} \hline Low & Polarisation & High \\ \hline Low positive charge & High positive charge \\ \hline Large cation & Small cation \\ \hline Small anion & Large anion \\ \hline \end{tabular}

The concept of **charge density** is useful for explaining the influence that an ion (usually a cation) has on the electrons in adjacent ions or molecules.

The extent of polarisation (and hence attraction) of the electrons in adjacent anions depends on the charge density and, in turn, the **polarising power of the cation**.

* Small, highly charged ions (e.g. A\(\ell^{+}\)) have **greater charge densities** and hence **higher polarising powers** than large, singly charged ions (e.g. Cs\({}^{*}\)).
* If two ions have similar charge densities, their compounds often have similar properties (e.g. A/\(Cl_{3}\) and Be\(Cl_{2}\)).

The extent of polarisation also depends on the **polarisability of the anion**. The **larger the anionic radius**, the **more polarisable** the anion is.

Hence, the extent of covalent character in an ionic bond is larger when:

* The cation has a high charge and a small radius i.e. high charge density (highly polarising).
* The anion has a large radius (highly polarisable).

The idea of ion polarisation is important in explaining the thermal decomposition of Group 2 carbonates under the topic of 'Periodic Table'.

## 7 Metallic Bonding

* [label=LO]
* Show understanding that all chemical bonds are electrostatic in nature and describe:
* (ii) metallic bond as the electrostatic attraction between a lattice of positive ions and delocalised electrons.
* Describe, in simple terms, the lattice structure of a crystalline solid which is:
* (v) metallic, as in copper

### Definition of Metallic Bond

* [label=Metallic bonds are strong electrostatic forces of attraction between metal cations and sea of delocalised electrons in a giant metallic lattice structure

The metal atoms contribute their valence electrons to form cations in a sea of delocalised electrons. The valence electrons are delocalised due to the weak electrostatic forces of attraction between them and the nucleus.

In any given piece of metal, the metallic lattice is electrically neutral as the number of positive and negative charges balance out.

### Factors affecting Metallic Bond Strength

The strength of metallic bonds is:

* **proportional to number of delocalised valence electrons** contributed per atom
* **proportional to the charge density of metal cation, \(\frac{\mathbf{q}^{+}}{\mathbf{r}_{+}}\)**

where \(\mathbf{q}^{+}\) is the charge of the cation, \(\mathbf{r}_{+}\) is the cationic radius.

In comparing two metals, the **difference in cationic charge tends to have a greater effect on metallic bond strength than the difference in cationic radius**.

The metallic bond strength is reflected in the boiling point of the metal.

_E.g._ Comparing the metallic bond strength of sodium, magnesium and aluminium

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|} \hline
**metal** & **sodium (Na)** & **magnesium (Mg)** & **aluminium (Al)** \\ \hline
**boiling point / \({}^{\circ}\)C** & 883 & 1091 & 2519 \\ \hline
**no. of delocalised** & 1 & 2 & 3 \\
**valence electrons** & (Group 1) & (Group 2) & (Group 13) \\ \hline
**cationic charge, \(\mathbf{q}^{+}\)** & +1 & +2 & +3 \\ \hline
**cation radius, \(\mathbf{r}_{+}\) / nm** & 0.095 & 0.065 & 0.050 \\ \hline
**metallic bond strength** & Na & \(<\) & Mg & \(<\) \\ \hline \end{tabular}

_Note:_

**Transition metals** tend to have particularly high melting and boiling points. The reason is that they can involve the **3d** electrons in the delocalisation as well as the **4s**. We will talk about this again in the topic of 'Chemistry of Transition Elements'.

## Appendix 1: A Little Bit of History....

In the early 20th century, the American chemist Gilbert N. Lewis began to use dots in lecture, while teaching undergraduates at Harvard, to represent the electrons around atoms. His students favoured these drawings, which stimulated him in this direction. From these lectures, Lewis noted that elements with a certain number of electrons seemed to have a special stability: it appeared that once a core of _eight electrons_ has formed around a nucleus, the layer is filled, and a new layer is started. Lewis also noted that various ions with eight electrons also seemed to have a special stability. On these views, he proposed the rule of eight or octet rule: ions or atoms with a filled layer of eight electrons have a special stability.

Moreover, noting that a cube has eight corners Lewis envisioned an atom as having eight sides available for electrons, like the corner of a cube. Subsequently, in 1902 he devised a conception in which cubic atoms can bond on their sides to form cubic-structured molecules.

In 1913, while working as the chair of the department of chemistry at the University of California, Berkeley, Lewis read a preliminary outline of paper by an English graduate student, Alfred Lauck Parson, who was visiting Berkeley for a year. In this paper, Parson suggested that the electron is not merely an electric charge but is also a small magnet (or "magneton" as he called it) and furthermore that a chemical bond results from two electrons being shared between two atoms.

Moreover, he proposed that an atom tended to form an ion by gaining or losing the number of electrons needed to complete a cube. Thus, Lewis structures show each atom in the structure of the molecule using its chemical symbol. Lines are drawn between atoms that are bonded to one another; occasionally, pairs of dots are used instead of lines. Excess electrons that form lone pairs are represented as pair of dots, and are placed next to the atoms on which they reside.

To summarise his views on his new bonding model, Lewis states:

Two atoms may conform to the rule of eight, or the octet rule, not only by the transfer of electrons from one atom to another, but also by sharing one or more pairs of electrons...Two electrons thus coupled together, when lying between two atomic centres, and held jointly in the shells of the two atoms, I have considered to be the chemical bond. We thus have a concrete picture of that physical entity, that "hook and eye" which is part of the creep of the organic chemist.

The following year, in 1917, an unknown American undergraduate chemical engineer named Linus Pauling was learning the Dalton hook-and-eye bonding method at the Oregon Agricultural College, which was the vogue description of bonds between atoms at the time. Each atom had a certain number of hooks that allowed it to attach to other atoms, and a certain number of eyes that allowed other atoms to attach to it. A chemical bond resulted when a hook and eye connected. Pauling, however, wasn't satisfied with this archaic method and looked to the newly emerging field of quantum physics for a new method.

In 1927, the physicists Fritz London and Walter Heitler applied the new quantum mechanics to the deal with the saturable, non-dynamic forces of attraction and repulsion, _i.e._, exchange forces, of the hydrogen molecule. Their valence bond treatment of this problem, in their joint paper, was a landmark in that it _brought chemistry under quantum mechanics_. Their work was an influence on Pauling, who had just received his doctorate and visited Heitler and London in Zurich on a Guggenheim Fellowship.

Subsequently, in 1931, building on the work of Heitler and London and on theories found in Lewis' famous article, Pauling published his ground-breaking article "The Nature of the Chemical Bond" in which he used quantum mechanics to calculate properties and structures of molecules, such as angles between bonds and rotation about bonds. On these concepts, Pauling developed hybridisation theory to account for bonds in molecules such as CH\({}_{4}\), in which four sp\({}^{3}\) hybridised orbitals are overlapped by hydrogen's 1s orbital, yielding four sigma (\(\sigma\)) bonds.

_Why are We Studying This?_

Molecular structure is the foundation on which chemistry, the study of matter and the changes it undergoes, rests. Much of chemistry is concerned with changes at the molecular level as structures are elucidated and chemical reactions occur.

## Appendix 2: Structure of the Atom

Understanding the nature of the chemical bond relies on knowledge of the composition and structure of the atom. The model of the atom that emerged from the early work of Thomson, Rutherford, Moseley, and Bohr was of a central, very small, positively charged nucleus composed of positively charged protons and neutral neutrons, surrounded by one or more negatively charged electrons moving at high speed and effectively occupying a volume much larger than that of the nucleus.

The lack of reactivity of the noble gases - no known compounds at that time - led both Walther Kossel and Lewis to conclude in 1916 that these substances have a particularly stable arrangement of electrons. This in turn led to the development of the shell model of the atom. In the shell model, the electrons in an atom are arranged in successive spherical layers or shells surrounding the nucleus. The outer shell is never found to contain more than the number of electrons in the valence shell of a noble gas. The outer shell is called the valence shell because it is these electrons that are involved in bond formation and give the atom its valence.

Experimental support for the shell model has been provided by the determination of the ionisation energies of free atoms in the gas phase and by the analysis of the spectra of such atoms. These measurements have given a picture of the arrangement of the electrons in an atom in terms of their energies, which can also be deduced from the quantum mechanical description of an atom. Quantum mechanics also shows us that electrons do not have fixed positions in space but are in constant motion, following paths that cannot be determined. Hence, it is strictly not correct to talk about the _arrangement_ of the electrons. It is their energy, not their positions, which can be determined.

On the basis of the shell mode, two apparently different models of the chemical bond were proposed, the ionic model and the covalent model.

## Appendix 4: Covalent Bonding - Prelude

Clearly the explanation of the chemical bond given by Kossel cannot apply to homonuclear molecules (_i.e._ molecules comprising of the same type of atoms) such as C_l_2. Almost simultaneously with the publication of Kossel's theory, G. N. Lewis published a theory that could account for such molecules. Like Kossel, Lewis was impressed with the lack of reactivity of the noble gases. But he was also impressed by the observation that the vast majority of molecules have an even number of electrons, which led him to suggest that in molecules, electrons are usually present in pairs. In particular, he proposed that in a molecule such as C_l_2 the two atoms are held together by sharing a pair of electrons because in this way each atom can obtain a noble gas electron arrangement, as in the following examples:

Diagrams of this type are called Lewis diagrams or Lewis structures. The bond between the two atoms could be called a shared-electron-pair bond but it is now universally called a covalent bond - a term introduced by Irving Langmuir (1919). In a Lewis diagram, the pairs of electrons that are not forming bonds are called nonbonding pairs or, more usually, lone pairs.

Although Lewis had no clear idea of why electrons are found in molecules as pairs, or how a shared pair of electrons holds two atoms together, the ideas of the shared electron pair, the covalent bond and the octet rule enable us to understand the formulas of a vast number of molecules and their relationship to the positions of the elements in the periodic table.

Because the formation of electron pairs seemed to contradict Coulomb's law, according to which electrons repel each other so that they should keep as far apart as possible, Lewis even suggested that Coulomb's law is not obeyed over the very short distances between electrons in atoms and molecules. Although we now know that Coulomb's law is obeyed for all distances between charges, in making the assumption about the importance of electron pairs, Lewis displayed remarkable _intuition_: electrons do indeed form pairs in most molecules, despite their mutual electrostatic repulsion. Nonetheless Lewis diagrams showing bonding pairs and lone pairs are still widely us ed today, and the electron pair remains a central concept in chemistry.

Lewis called the apparent tendency of atoms to acquire a noble gas electron arrangement, either by forming ions or by sharing electron pairs, the rule of eight. Later Langmuir called it the octet rule, and this is the term that is now generally used. Lewis did not regard the rule of eight as being as important as the rule of two, according to which electrons are present in molecules in pairs, because he found more exceptions to the octet rule than to the rule of two. There are only a few exceptions to the rule of two, such as molecules with an odd number of electrons (free radicals), whereas there are a large number of exceptions to the octet rule.
