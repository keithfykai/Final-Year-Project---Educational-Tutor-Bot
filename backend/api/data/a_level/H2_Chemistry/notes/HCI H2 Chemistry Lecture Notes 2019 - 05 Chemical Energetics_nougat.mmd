Introduction

All matter contains energy and energy changes take place when a matter undergoes either a physical or chemical change. Thermodynamics is the study of energy and its transformation. In this chapter, we will focus on thermochemistry, the study of heat change in chemical and physical processes. We will also be looking at why certain physical and chemical changes take place spontaneously.

### Enthalpy and enthalpy changes

The total chemical energy of a substance is called its **enthalpy** (or heat content). Chemical energy consists of kinetic energy and potential energy. The potential energy, due to electrostatic attraction between the particles, is usually the main component of the total chemical energy, [1].

During a chemical reaction, bonds are broken and new bonds are formed. The breaking of bonds requires energy while the formation of bonds releases energy. The energy change that occurs is called the **enthalpy change of reaction**. The symbol is \(\Delta H_{r}\) and the units are \(J\) mol\({}^{-1}\) or \(J\) mol\({}^{-1}\).

As most chemical reactions take place at constant pressure, the heat involved in the process (the flow of thermal energy) can be expressed as \(\Delta H\). Hence, when a reaction vessel feels warm, thermal energy is given off by the reaction and transferred to our hands. At the microscopic level, thermal energy can be represented by the movement of particles. The greater the average kinetic energies of the particles, the greater the amount of thermal energy of the system.

### Endothermic and Exothermic processes

Enthalpy changes may be exothermic or endothermic as illustrated below.

\end{table}

### Standard conditions and standard states

Besides the physical state of the substances, the enthalpy change of a reaction is also affected by the physical conditions of temperature and pressure. For valid comparison, a set of **standard conditions** have to be specified under which enthalpy changes are measured.

A substance in its normal (most stable) physical state at 298 K and 1 bar is said to be in its **standard state**. E.g. \(\mathrm{I_{2}(s)}\), \(\mathrm{Br_{2}(\mathit{I})}\), \(\mathrm{C_{S}(\mathit{R})}\) (Refer to note below).

The actual enthalpy of an element cannot be measured. Hence, elements in their standard states under standard conditions are assigned zero enthalpy (\(\mathit{H=0}\)).

When the enthalpy change is measured under standard conditions, it is referred to as the **standard enthalpy change** and is represented by the symbol \(\Delta H^{\mathrm{\Theta}}\).

Note:

C(s) refers to the graphite allotrope since graphite has a lower energy level and is thus energetically more stable than diamond.

Figure 3: Standard conditions for thermochemical measurements

Note: According to IUPAC, the standard state pressure is 1 bar; in some books, 1 atm may be used as reference in thermodynamic data. 1 atm (1.013 bar) is a more practical and convenient unit of measure for pressure. The difference in thermodynamic values at 1 atm and 1 bar may not be very significant.

## 3 Hess' Law and its Applications

Very few enthalpy changes of reaction can be determined directly by experiment. For reactions that are diffcult to carry out directly, we can use Hess' Law to calculate the enthalpy changes of these reactions from other data such as enthalpy changes of combustion which can be measured accurately using a bomb calorimeter (Refer to Section 5).

### Hess' law of constant heat summation

The enthalpy change (\(\Delta H\)) of a reaction is determined only by the **initial and final states** and is **independent of the reaction pathway taken**.

## 5 Experimental determination of enthalpy change of reaction

The First Law of Thermodynamics states that _energy cannot be created or destroyed; it can only be converted from one form into another_. Using this law, we can determine the enthalpy change of a reaction.

The reaction (part of the universe that is being studied) is defined as the system. The environment of the reaction (rest of the universe that is not part of the system) is known as the surrounding.

The enthalpy change of a reaction at constant pressure appears as heat. The heat given out (or taken in) by a reaction is transferred to the surrounding. The surrounding is often some water or a solution containing the reactants and products.

For example, CuSO\({}_{4}\)(aq) + Zn(s) \(\rightarrow\) ZnSO\({}_{4}\)(aq) + Cu(s) \(\Delta H=-219\) kJ mol\({}^{-1}\)

The system consists of the reactants and the products. The reaction between CuSO\({}_{4}\) and Zn takes place in an aqueous medium. Since the reaction is exothermic (sign of \(\Delta H\) is negative), heat is released by the reaction and is transferred to the surrounding aqueous medium.

The heat that is absorbed by the aqueous medium or solution causes the temperature of the solution to rise. This amount of heat can be determined by measuring the temperature change.

\begin{tabular}{c} q = heat change of solution (J) \\ m = mass of solution (g) \\ c = specific heat capacity of solution (J g\({}^{-1}\) K\({}^{-1}\)) \\ \(\Delta T\) = change in temperature of the solution (K(or \({}^{o}\)C) \\ \end{tabular} \\ \end{tabular}

The **specific heat capacity**, **c**, is defined as the amount of heat required to raise the temperature of 1 g of the substance by 1 K. The unit of specific heat capacity is J **g\({}^{-1}\) K\({}^{-1}\)**.

The **heat capacity**, **c**, is defined as the amount of heat required to raise the temperature of the substance by 1 K (or 1 \({}^{o}\)C). The SI unit for heat capacity is J K\({}^{-1}\).

If heat capacity of the solution is given instead, then the heat that is absorbed (or released) by the solution can be calculated as follows:

\begin{tabular}{c} q = c \(\Delta T\) \\ c = heat capacity of solution (J K\({}^{-1}\)) \\ \(\Delta T\) \\ \end{tabular}

Hence by measuring the temperature change of the solution, we can determine the heat transferred to the surrounding solution and hence the heat absorbed or released by the reaction.

\begin{tabular}{c} HWA CHONG \\ \(\Delta T\) \\ \(\Delta T\) \\ \(\Delta T\) \\ \end{tabular}

### The calorimeter

For reactions involving solutions, a simple calorimeter consisting of a polystyrene cup with a lid and a thermometer can be used to measure the heat change.

The temperature changes are relatively small, so for accurate work the thermometer should have a precision of \(\pm 0.1^{\circ}\)C.

### Assumptions in the calculations

To ensure accurate results, all the heat released (or absorbed) by the reaction must be used to raise (or lower) the temperature of the solution. In practice, we cannot totally eliminate heat exchanges with the surrounding air or apparatus so we make the following assumptions in our calculations.

No heat loss to (or heat gain from) surrounding air

Heat capacity of the calorimeter (e.g. polystyrene cup) is omitted

In addition, it is more convenient to measure the volume of the solution. Hence to calculate the mass of the solution, we assume that the density of the solution is the same as that of water (1.00 g cm\({}^{-3}\)) since the solution is very dilute;

### Experimental method to determine enthalpy change of combustion

The following experiment set-up can be used to determine the \(\Delta H_{\epsilon}^{\circ}\) for a fuel such as ethanol. The heat released during combustion is used to heat a known mass of water in a copper calorimeter.

#### 7.2.2.1 Ionisation Energy, I.E.

The first ionisation energy is the energy required to remove 1 mole of electrons from 1 mole of gaseous atoms to form 1 mole of singly charged gaseous cations.

#### 7.2.2 Electron Affinity, E.A.

The first electron affinity is the enthalpy change when 1 mole of electrons is added to 1 mole of gaseous atoms to form 1 mole of singly charged gaseous anions.

1st E.A. is usually negative as the effective nuclear charge of the atom leads to an attraction of the incoming electron. When the attraction is stronger, the energy given off is greater and hence E.A. is more negative.

2nd and subsequent E.A. are always positive because energy is required to overcome the electrostatic repulsion between the incoming electron and the anion.

### Entropy and entropy changes

**Entropy** 'S' is a measure of the randomness or disorder in a system, reflected in the number of ways that the energy of a system can be distributed through the motion of its particles. Units: **J mol-1 K-1**.

For the same amount of a substance, entropy of solid < liquid << gas

In a solid, the particles are relatively fixed and possess the least kinetic energy.

There are few ways that the energy of particles is distributed:

In a gas, the particles are able to move freely and possess a wide range of kinetic energy. There are many ways that the energy of the particles is distributed.

Many chemical reactions or physical processes are accompanied by a change in entropy, AS.

If a reaction or process results in more ways to disperse or distribute the energy, entropy increases (AS 0).

If a reaction or process results in less ways to disperse or distribute the energy, entropy decreases (AS < 0).

Whether or not a reaction or process will be spontaneous is governed by the _Second Law of Thermodynamics_ which states that the entropy of the universe (system and surrounding) increases in a spontaneous change.

We shall first look at some factors that affect the change in entropy of a system before we consider how we can apply the Second Law of Thermodynamics to predict whether a given reaction or process is spontaneous.

Figure 7: Arrangement of particles in solid and gaseous state

#### 9.2.1 Predicting the sign of AS for some processes

##### 1.1.1 Change in temperature

As temperature increases, the _average kinetic energy_ of the particles and the _range of energies_ increase as shown in the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution curves below. (Refer to Topic 3 The Gaseous State for explanation on the shape of the curves.) There are _more ways to disperse the energy among the particles_, Hence, _entropy_ increases (\(\Delta S>0\)).

2.2 The particles in the solid state vibrate about their fixed positions. The energy is thus the least dispersed and the solid has the lowest entropy.

2.3 When temperature increases, entropy increases gradually as the kinetic energy of the particles increases.

2.4 When the solid melts, the _particles move more freely in the liquid state_ and _become more disordered_. Hence there is an abrupt increase in entropy (\(\Delta S>0\)) as there are _more ways to distribute the particles and their energy in the liquid state.

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:34]

Figure 11: Expansion of gas

When gases are mixed at **constant volume**, i.e. the **volume available to distribute each gas particle is the same**. Hence the **entropy does not change** (\(\Delta S\) = 0).

Figure 13: Entropy change during dissolution of an ionic solid

### Gibbs Free Energy

To predict whether a process is spontaneous, we need to apply the Second Law of Thermodynamics which states that the entropy of the universe increases for a spontaneous change. We have to consider the entropy change that takes place both in the system and in the surrounding.

\[\Delta S_{\text{universe}}=\Delta S_{\text{system}}+\Delta S_{\text{ surrounding}}\]

In chemistry, to simplify discussion, the focus of analysis is on the system. Hence it is more convenient if \(\Delta S_{\text{system}}\) and \(\Delta S_{\text{surrounding}}\) are combined together in a single function known as the change in Gibbs free energy. The derivation is beyond the scope of the syllabus; The change in Gibbs free energy is named after Josiah Willard Gibbs and is given the symbol \(\Delta G\). \(\Delta G\) can be expressed in terms of \(\Delta H\) and \(\Delta S\) of the system:

When \(\Delta G\) is negative (Gibbs free energy is lowered), \(\Delta S_{\text{universe}}\) is positive and vice versa. Hence we can use the sign of \(\Delta G\) to predict if a reaction is spontaneous.

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:39]

#### 9.3.2 Calculations of \(\Delta G_{r}\) from \(\Delta G_{t}\)

Like enthalpy change (\(\Delta H\)), Gibbs free energy change (\(\Delta G\)) is a state function. This means that the value that it takes only depends on the state of the substance, and not how it was brought to that state. The'state' is specified by variables such as temperature and pressure. Hence \(\Delta G\) of a reaction can be calculated in a similar way as \(\Delta H\) in Section 3. Likewise, \(\Delta S\) is a state function and \(\Delta S\) of a reaction can also be calculated a similar way.

#### 9.3.3 Temperature Dependence of \(\Delta G\)

The term, [-TAS] in the equation \(\Delta G=\Delta H-TAS\) indicates that \(\Delta G\) is temperature-dependent. However, we can assume that \(\Delta H\) and \(\Delta S\) remain roughly constant regardless of temperature and use them to calculate \(\Delta G\) at other temperatures.

This assumption is valid as shown in the following example involving reaction between hydrogen gas and chlorine gas at 298 K and 500 K.

If we were to assume that \(\Delta H\) and \(\Delta S\) do not change with temperature, we can use the values of \(\Delta H\) and \(\Delta S\) at 298 K to calculate a value for \(\Delta G\) at 500 K as shown:

\(\Delta G_{500}\approx\Delta H_{298}-500\times\Delta S_{298K}\)

\(=-184.6-500\times\Delta S_{1000}\)

This approximate value of \(\Delta G\) (194.6 k mol\({}^{-1}\)) is close to the actual value (-194.4 k mol\({}^{-3}\)) obtained by using values of \(\Delta H\) and \(\Delta S\) at 500 K.

The assumption that \(\Delta H\) and \(\Delta S\) remain roughly constant is **not valid** if there is a **change in phase** of one of the reactants or products as the temperature is increased. Under these conditions, both \(\Delta H\) and \(\Delta S\) change significantly. For example, consider the synthesis of hydrogen iodide at 298 K and 500 K.

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:42]

#### 9.3.4 Effect of Temperature on spontaneity of a reaction

For a reaction to be **spontaneous**, \(\Delta\)\(G\) should be **negative**. The sign of \(\Delta\)\(G\) depends on the signs and magnitudes of \(\Delta\)\(H\) and \(\Delta\)\(S\), as well as temperature. We observe that most exothermic reactions are spontaneous as the enthalpy contribution to \(\Delta\)\(G\) is much more than the entropy contribution. Hence a highly negative \(\Delta\)\(H\) is likely to make \(\Delta\)\(G\) negative. However, the temperature of a reaction influences the magnitude of the term \(T\)\(\Delta\)\(S\) and hence the spontaneity of many reactions depends on the temperature. We can use the equation \(\Delta\)\(G\) = \(\Delta\)\(H\) - \(\Upsilon\)\(S\) to predict the sign of \(\Delta\)\(G\) when temperature is varied (assuming \(\Delta\)\(H\) and \(\Delta\)\(S\) do not change with temperature).

There are four possibilities:

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{l|l|l|l} \hline
**If**\(\Delta\)\(H\) **is** & **and**\(\Delta\)\(S\) **is** & \(\Delta\)\(G\) **(=**\(\Delta\)\(H\) - \(\Upsilon\)\(S\)**) is** & **Reaction is** \\ \hline negative & positive & always negative & _spontaneous at all temperatures_ \\ \hline positive & negative & always positive & _not spontaneous at all temperatures_ \\ \hline negative & negative & negative if \(|\Delta\)\(H\) **\(>\)\(|\Upsilon\)\(S\)** & _spontaneous at low temperatures_ \\ \hline positive & positive & negative if \(\Delta\)\(H\) **\(<\)\(\Upsilon\)\(S\)** & _spontaneous at high temperatures_ \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 8: Effect of Temperature on spontaneity of a reaction

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:44]

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:45]

#### Non-standard condition

\(\Delta G^{\circ}\) can only be used to predict spontaneity of a reaction under standard conditions. Under non-standard conditions, \(\Delta G\) must be calculated. Refer to example under Section 9.3.4 (4) on the boiling of water. At temperature above 100 \({}^{\circ}\)C, say at 150 \({}^{\circ}\)C, \(\Delta G=44.0=423\) (118 \(\times\)10\({}^{-3}\)) = -5.91 kJ mol\({}^{\pm 1}\) < 0. Hence the boiling of water is spontaneous at 150 \({}^{\circ}\)C.

#### Kinetics consideration

The term _spontaneous_ does not mean _instantaneous_. It is important to keep in mind that just because a reaction is spontaneous does not mean that it will occur at an observable rate.

While the Gibbs free energy change can be used to determine the spontaneity of a reaction, it does not take into account the kinetics of the reaction, that is, the rate at which the reaction takes place. The reacting species may have to overcome a large energy barrier (\(F_{s}\)) before reaction can occur.

Some reactions are thermodynamically (or energetically) favourable (\(\Delta G\) is negative) but kinetically not favourable (occur very slowly). Such reactions are spontaneous but slow, for example rusting. Another example is the conversion of diamond into graphite.

With respect to graphite, diamond is thermodynamically less stable (\(\Delta G\) < 0). However, due to the high activation energy for the reaction, diamond does not turn into graphite overnight. We say that diamond is kinetically stable.

## Looking ahead

We have seen in this topic that energy is the key consideration for any transformation to take place - energy (and/or matter) tends to be dispersed during a chemical or physical change. However, not all transformations take place at considerable rate (as mentioned in Section 9.4) and transformation from reactants to products may not occur to completion. In the next two topics, we will be looking at some characteristics of chemical and physical change, such as the rate of change (reaction kinetics) as well as the extent of change (chemical equilibrium). We will revisit the concept of Gibbs free energy change and learn how the value of \(\Delta G^{\circ}\) can allow us to predict the extent of change (chemical equilibrium).

## Energy sources

### Fossil fuels

Our main source of energy is the combustion of fossil fuels, namely coal, oil and natural gas. They give out large amounts of energy when burnt, but there are two main disadvantages to their use. The first is that supplies are finite and may run out in the foreseeable future. The second is that this combustion produces carbon dioxide, which contributes to the greenhouse effect, and also other pollutants.

Coal, oil and natural gas are respectively solid, liquid and gaseous fuels. The following considerations are made when choosing which to use.

* solid fuels are difficult to ignite and do not burn at a constant rate. For this reason, coal is often powdered before being injected into a furnace.
* for local use, natural gas does not need to be stored, as it is carried by pipeline from the source. Oil is easily stored and can also be distributed by pipeline. In both cases, expensive pipelines must be laid. Coal has the disadvantage that it needs to be carried by road or rail to where it will be used. To transport methane without a pipeline, it must be liquefied, which requires expensive refrigeration. This makes natural gas of limited use as a vehicle fuel, though propane and butane are more useful as they can be liquefied by pressure alone (and are then called liquefied petroleum gas, LPG). LPG is an important fuel for cooking and heating in rural areas without piped natural gas. As increasing numbers of pipelines for natural gas are installed throughout the world, for example in India and China, the use of LPG in factories and homes is gradually being phased out. But it will still be the fuel of choice in most rural areas of the world. The use of coal for driving steam engines and trains was once important but is now of only historical interest throughout the world.
* coal contains many impurities and, when burnt, gives off much sulfur dioxide. The same is true of oil, unless it is carefully refined before use. Crude oil is notorious for the environmental damage caused by spillage from tankers or from the oil extraction and flaring of the associated natural gas.

Figure 16: A coal-burning power station. Coal has the highest energy density of the fossil fuels, giving out 76 kJ of energy for each cm\({}^{3}\) of coal burnt.

- the relative prices of coal, oil and gas must take into account the costs of transport, storage and pollution-reducing measures, as well as political expediency, and are subject to wide local variations. Fuel taxes raise revenue for governments, and the resulting increased price of fossil fuels may encourage people to reduce their energy consumption.

Because there are serious problems associated with burning fossil fuels, much research has been carried out to find alternative energy sources. These are increasingly important, but it is unlikely, that they will provide more than a quarter of our energy demands during the next few years. Many alternative energy sources are renewable - they can be replaced as fast as they are used.

### Alternative energy sources

Alternative energy sources do not rely on the combustion of fuels. The following are some of those in current use.

* there are many places in the world where rivers have been dammed and the resulting difference in water level used to provide energy to generate electricity, for example at Kariba on the Zambezi river between Zimbabwe and Zambia, at ttaipu on the Parana river between Brazil and Paraguay, and the Three Gorges dam on the Yangtze river in China. The last two examples alone generate over \(6\times 10^{17}\) J of energy per year, the equivalent of burning \(6\times 10^{7}\) tonnes of coal in a coal-fired power station. This saves pumping millions of tonnes of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. However, there can be resultant damage to the environment, which needs to be considered as it may be unacceptable.
* these are little used, even though the large-scale tidal power generator at La Rance in northern France first produced electricity 50 years ago.

Figure 17: Wind farms provide pollution-free energy, but have visual effect on the landscape.

* **Geothermal power** potentially this could be an easy way to provide energy for home heating, though it can only be carried out at sites with particular geological features. Water is pumped from deep under the ground and comes to the surface at a temperature near to boiling point. It is not usually possible to use this hot water to produce electricity, because superheated steam is needed in order to obtain a reasonable energy conversion. However, the Philippines, New Zealand and Costa Rica obtain a reasonable proportion of their energy from this source.
* the direct conversion of sunlight into electricity using solar cells used to be quite expensive, but the application of conducting polymers has reduced the cost of these, and in sunny places, for example in California, Spain and India, solar energy is now economically viable.
* the use of nuclear reactors based on **fission reactions**, in which large nuclei split into two smaller nuclei and give out nuclear energy, has sharply declined as a result of accidents such as that at Chernobyl in 1986. There is much debate over the long-term implications of the disposal of nuclear waste, and most countries had cut back on their nuclear programmes until a few years ago, when concern for the rise in atmospheric carbon dioxide caused a rethink. There is the possibility that reactors using **fusion reactions**, in which lighter nuclei join to form a heavier one, may be developed in the next few decades. These provide the best hope for a long-term solution to the energy problem, because they are 'cleaner' and do not produce radioactive waste.

**Renewable fuels**

Most of the alternative energy sources listed above are renewable because they are powered by the Sun, and so are always available. Some fuels are made out of resources that can be replaced quickly. For example, tropical countries such as Brazil can grow fast-ripening crops such as corn or sugar cane which can be used to produce ethanol cheaply and this can be used mixed with petrol in motor vehicles.

Hydrogen is another renewable energy resource. It has the advantage of being pollution free, since its combustion produces water only, and can be used in fuel cells. its great disadvantage is the difficulty of transporting it (being much lighter than natural gas, it is difficult to contain it), though there is hope that the use of metal hydrides (compounds of transition metals with hydrogen) may overcome this problem.

For special applications, for example in space rockets, special synthetic fuels are being developed.
