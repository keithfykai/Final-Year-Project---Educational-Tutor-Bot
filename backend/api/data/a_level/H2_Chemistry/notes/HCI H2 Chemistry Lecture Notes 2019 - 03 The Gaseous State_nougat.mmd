### Units of Pressure

Pressure is defined as force exerted per unit area. Gas pressure is a gauge of the frequency and force of collisions between gas particles and the walls of the container that hold them. It is measured in a number of different units. One of the units is the millimetre of mercury, mmHg, which originates from measuring atmospheric pressure (760 mmHg) with a mercury barometer.

The SI units of pressure is the basal, Pa, defined as 1 newton, N\({}_{r}\) per square metre. This is a very common unit used in the A-level syllabus.

It is a much smaller unit of pressure than the standard atmosphere (atm) and the bar, which are approximated to the following values for calculations:

### Measuring standards for gas samples

Because the physical properties of a gas sample can vary greatly depending on several factors, we often have to specify the conditions under which the measurements were made.

**Molar volume, \(V_{m}\), of any gas is the volume occupied by 1 mole of the gas at a specified temperature and pressure. The common conditions used for gas measurements and molar volumes are summarised in the table below.**

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{l|c|c|c} \hline \hline \multicolumn{1}{c}{**Table 1.**_Molar volume and measurement conditions for gas samples_} & \multicolumn{1}{c}{Measurement conditions used_} \\ \hline Standard temperature and & 1 bar (100,000 Pa) & 273 K (0 °C) & 22,7 dm\({}^{3}\) mol\({}^{-1}\) \\ pressure (s.t.p.) & 1 atm (101,325 Pa) & 293 K (20 °C) & 24 dm\({}^{3}\) mol\({}^{-1}\) \\ pressure (r.t.p.) & & & \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}

## 2 The simple gas laws and ideal gas law

Because most gases are difficult to observe directly, they are described through the use of four macroscopic properties.

### Simple gas laws

The simple gas laws describe the relationships between pairs of the above variables, when the other two variables are held constant,

In the early 1660s; the English scientist Robert Boyle found that at constant temperature, the volume of a fixed mass of gas (i.e. for n is constant) is _inversely proportional_ to its pressure. The mathematical and graphical relationships of Boyle's law are given below:

\begin{tabular}{l} \end{tabular}

Later, in 1787, the French physicist Jacques Charles found that at constant pressure, the volume of a fixed mass of gas is _directly proportional_ to its absolute temperature measured in K). The mathematical and graphical relationships of Charles' Law are given below:

\begin{tabular}{l} \end{tabular}

In 1811, Amadeo Avogadro proposed that at constant temperature and pressure, the volume of a gas is _directly proportional_ to the number of molecules (or number of moles of gas) present. The mathematical and graphical relationships of **Avogadro's Law** are given below:

Take note that at constant temperature and volume, the pressure of a gas is also _directly proportional_ to the number of moles present.

Which of the simple gas laws is at work in each of the following examples?

The bubbles exhaled by a scuba diver grow in size as the bubbles approach the surface of the ocean.

On collision, airbags in cars inflate rapidly. A sensor triggers the ignition of sodium nitride according to the following equation: 2NaNa(s) \(\rightarrow\) 2Na(s) + 3Na(g)

The print head of a bubble jet printer contains 64 or 128 tiny nozzles. The tip of the nozzle is filled with ink which is then heated by an electronic heater. This vaporizes the ink and a bubble of vapor ink is then published on the paper. This bubble when published acts as a dot, of a letter or image.

### The Ideal Gas Equation

By combining the three relationships given above, we get \(V\propto\frac{nT}{p}\)

We can replace the proportionality sign by incorporating a proportionality constant known as the _molar gas constant_ (R):

This equation is known as the **ideal gas equation**. It expresses the relationship among the four variables P, V, T and n for an **ideal gas**. An **ideal gas** is one which follows this equation exactly, under all conditions of pressure, volume and temperature. Refer to Section 4 for more information on the assumptions of the kinetic theory as applied to an ideal gas.

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:7]

### Applications of the Ideal Gas Equation

#### Calculating gas density and relative molecular mass using the Ideal Gas Equation

The ideal gas law can be recast to determine other properties of gases, such as density and relative molecular mass. In the table below, express the ideal gas equation to make the specified parameter the subject of the equation.

### Combined Gas Equation

The combined gas equation is useful for changes to gas systems where the amount of the gas, n, is kept constant.

Since n and R are constants,

Because pv is a constant, it follows that for any change in condition, the expression will give the same value.

where P1, V1 and T1 relate to the gas in its initial condition, and P2, V2 and T2 relate to the gas in its final condition. Temperature values must only be in K for the expression to be valid.

The combined gas equation can be further reduced to:

\[\begin{array}{ll}\text{P}_{1}\text{V}_{1}=\text{P}_{2}\text{V}_{2}&\text{ if temperature is constant}\\ \text{P}_{1}\text{/}\text{T}_{1}=\text{P}_{2}\text{/}\text{T}_{2}&\text{ if volume is constant and}\\ \text{V}_{1}\text{/}\text{T}_{1}=\text{V}_{2}\text{/}\text{T}_{2}&\text{ if pressure is constant}\\ \end{array}\]

_Useful tip:_

* Because these relationships do not make use of the gas constant R, it is possible to use _any units of pressure or volume_, as long as they are consistently used for initial and final values.

Figure 11: \(\bullet\) Because these relationships do not make use of the gas constant R, it is possible to use _any units of pressure or volume_, as long as they are consistently used for initial and final values.

### Making use of the combined gas equation

An air bubble rises from the bottom of the sea, where the temperature is 6.0 "C and pressure is 8.4 atm, to the water surface. The water surface has a temperature of 24.0 "C at 1.0 atm. Calculate the volume of the bubble in cm\({}^{3}\), to 2 decimal places, if its initial volume is 0.030 cm\({}^{3}\).

### Strategy

An air bubble contains a _fixed mass of gas_ (assuming it doesn't combine with other air bubbles on the way up) so in is constant. We need to determine the final volume of the gas sample when both pressure and temperature change. We need to use \(\frac{p_{1}y_{1}}{T_{1}}=\frac{p_{2}y_{2}}{T_{2}}\).

### Working and solution

### _Note:_

Here, values of pressure and volume can be directly used (with the units given in the question), without being converted to SI units, as we are using a direct proportionality relationship which does not require the use of the gas constant R, nor finding the exact amount of gas (in moles).

### Self-practice 2.4

A 400 cm\({}^{3}\) mixture of petrol vapour and air is taken into the cylinder of a car engine at 200 "C and a pressure of 100 kPa. The piston compresses this gaseous mixture to 50.0 cm\({}^{3}\).

Find the pressure of the compressed gas if temperature is constant. [Assume that the gases do not react]

[800 kPa]

### Graphical Relationships for Ideal Gases

The graphical relationships for simple gas laws are introduced in _section 2.1_. In this section, we will attempt to predict the graphical relationship between other variables, based on manipulation of the ideal gas equation \(\mathbf{PV}\) = nRT. Figure out which of the four variables are constants, and rearrange this equation in the form \(y=mx+c\).

## 3 GAS MIXTURES AND PARTIAL PRESSURES

If a mixture of non-reacting gases is confined in a container, each gas occupies the volume (V) of the container and exerts its own pressure (P) on the walls of the container as if it alone were present. This observation is known as **Dalton's law of partial pressures**, and the pressure exerted by a particular gas in a mixture is referred to as its **partial pressure**.

**Definition:**

In a mixture of gases, the pressure exerted by any individual gas on the sides of a container is known as the **partial pressure** of the gas.

**Definition:**

**Dalton's law of partial pressures** states that _the total pressure of a mixture of gases is the sum of the partial pressures of the constituent gases._

In other words, if we let \(P_{\text{total}}\) be the total pressure of a gas mixture, we can write Dalton's law of partial pressures as:

where \(P_{a},P_{b},P_{c},...\) are the partial pressures of the individual gases \(a,b,c,...\) respectively.

Since T and V are constant, the partial pressure of each component is directly dependent on (and proportional to) the amount of each gas in the mixture. So, for gases \(a,b,c,\)_etc..._

Combining these into the expression for \(P_{\text{total}}\), we get:

\[P_{\text{total}} =n_{a}\left(\frac{RT}{V}\right)+\ n_{b}\left(\frac{RT}{V}\right)+ \ n_{c}\left(\frac{RT}{V}\right)+...\] \[=\left(n_{a}+\ n_{b}+\ n_{c}+\cdots\right)\left(\frac{RT}{V}\right)\] \[=n_{\text{total}}\left(\frac{RT}{V}\right)\]

Dividing the expression for \(P_{a}\) by that for \(P_{\text{total}}\), and rearranging:

where \(\left(\frac{n_{a}}{n_{\text{total}}}\right)\) is called the **mode fraction**, sometimes represented by the Greek letter _chi_, \(x\), or:

Thus, in a gas mixture, the **partial pressure of any individual gas is directly proportional to its mole fraction** in the mixture.

## 4 Assumptions about ideal gases

The kinetic theory of gases is a model used to describe the microscopic behaviour of gas particles and their interactions. This theory was developed in reference to _ideal gases_ (refer to _section 2.2_), though it can be applied reasonably well to real gases. The following assumptions are about ideal gases:

1. The size of the gas particles is so small compared to the space between them that we can assume that the particles themselves have negligible volume. In other words, the gas particles have negligible volume compared to the volume of the container.
2. The intermolecular forces of attraction between gas particles are negligible.
3. Collisions between gas particles, and their collisions with the walls of the container, are perfectly elastic; i.e. there is no net loss or gain of kinetic energy during collision.

### Conditions for real gases to behave ideally

* At low pressures, the gaseous molecules are relatively far apart. The volume of the molecules themselves is negligible compared to the volume of the container. Thus, real gas molecules at low pressure can be approximated to have negligible volume. Also, intermolecular forces are negligible as the particles are far apart. Hence their behaviour at low pressures would approach that of ideal gases.
* At high temperatures, gas particles have enough kinetic energy to overcome intermolecular forces, which can thus be considered insignificant. As such, the behavior of real gases approach ideal gas behavior at high temperatures.

## 5 Real gases and deviation from ideal behaviour

Based on the reasons given in Section 4.1, real gases would therefore deviate from ideal behaviour at high pressures and low temperatures.

Under these conditions, the following two assumptions about ideal gases are no longer valid, namely:

1. The gas particles have negligible volume compared to the volume of the container; and
2. The intermolecular forces of attraction between gas particles are negligible.

The behaviour of some real gases is compared with that of an ideal gas in Figure 4. In general, deviations from ideal behaviour become greater at higher pressures.

For molecules with similar electron cloud size, e.g. NH\({}_{3}\)(\(M_{e}\) = 17.0) versus CH\({}_{4}\) (\(M_{e}\) = 16.0), other intermolecular forces besides dispersion forces need to be considered. NH\({}_{3}\), with stronger hydrogen bonding, should deviate more from ideal behaviour than CH\({}_{4}\), with only intermolecular dispersion forces.

Figure 4: Effect of pressure on the behaviour of several real gases at 300 K

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:19]

### Explaining deviations at high pressures

* The gas particles can no longer be considered to have negligible volume compared to the volume of the container.

At high pressures, the molecules take up a large portion of the volume of the container, resulting in a considerably smaller space in which the molecules can move. The volume of the molecules becomes an increasingly significant proportion of the volume of the container. Thus, it is no longer valid to assume that its volume is negligible, and so the gas deviates from ideal behaviour. (In fact, the total volume occupied by a real gas is actually greater than the volume predicted by the ideal gas equation.)

### Explaining deviations at low temperatures

* The intermolecular forces between gas particles become significant.

As temperature is lowered, the kinetic energy of the gas particles decreases, causing them to move more slowly and intermolecular forces to become more significant. This also causes collisions to become inelastic (such that assumption 3 is no longer valid either). Eventually, it reaches a point where the particles can no longer overcome the intermolecular forces, at which point real gases liquefy (condense to form a liquid) when cooled to below its boiling point.

Figure 7: Illustration of effect of non-zero particle size at low and high pressures
Increasing the pressure on a real gas has opposite effects on the value of the product P \(\times\) V. It increases the observed V, while decreasing the observed P. This effect is summarized in Figure 8 below:

* where the value of PV deviates below that of ideal gas, the effect of intermolecular forces dominates. The _stronger the intermolecular forces present, the greater the extent of deviation_;
* at higher pressures, where the value of PV deviates above that of ideal gas; the gas particles can no longer be considered to have negligible volume compared to the volume of the container

The competition between the two effects is responsible for the minimum observed in the plots of some of the gases.

Figure 8: Understanding the shape of a non-ideal gas curve

The following curves represent the behaviour for equal amounts of three real gases and an ideal gas at a fixed temperature. Among the options given, what could the possible identities of real gases (X, Y and Z be?)

The question mentions that 'equal amounts' of all gases are plotted - we therefore expect n to be the same, and thus their PV/T (which is = nR) values should also be the same when behaving ideally.

Line Z has the greatest deviation below the ideal line and should represent the gas that has the strongest intermolecular forces, i.e. NH\({}_{3}\) (hydrogen bonding).

Between the two remaining options, N\({}_{2}\) should show greater deviation (line Y) than H\({}_{2}\) (line X) as it has larger electron cloud (stronger dispersion forces)

The value of PV is plotted against P for two gases, an ideal gas and a non-ideal gas, where P is the pressure and V is the volume of the gas.

Which gas shows the greatest deviation from ideality?

## 6 Distribution of molecular speeds

The **average kinetic energy** of the gas particles is **directly proportional** to the **absolute temperature**. So at a particular temperature, all types of gaseous particles have the same average kinetic energy.

Although collectively the molecules in a gas sample have the **same _average_ kinetic energy, the individual molecules are moving at **different speeds**. There exists a distribution of speeds among the particles in a sample of gas. At a given temperature, heavier gases travel slower while lighter gases travel faster (recall: KE = \(\mathrm{\chi_{2}mv^{2}}\)). Figure 9 shows how the speed distribution varies with the molar mass of the gas for different gas samples at the same temperature.

For a gas sample at **different temperatures** as shown in Figure 10, the speed distribution of the molecules shifts toward higher speeds, and becomes less sharply peaked as the temperature of the gas sample is increased. Even at low temperatures, a small number of molecules have high speed and kinetic energy. This number of molecules increases with temperature, while the number of molecules with low speed and kinetic energy becomes smaller but does not vanish.
