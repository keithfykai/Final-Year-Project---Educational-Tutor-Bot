## Heating Effect

When current flows through a circuit, it may create a heating effect due to the resistance of the components.

Heating element are usually made of nichrome wire coiled around an insulating fireproof material.

**Nichrome** is the most commonly used due to:

- high resistance, therefore heats up quickly

- high melting point

- does not oxidise or rust easily

## Application

### Electric Kettle

The heating element is enclosed in a metal tube and when a current flows through the heating element, the water around the element is heated by conduction and thermal energy is then transferred throughout the fluid by convection.

### Electric Iron

Thermal energy produced is spread evenly over a large metal base which conducts thermal energy well.

Electric iron's usually contain a thermostat which switches the current of when it gets too hot and switches it back on when the iron cools below selected temperature.

## Electrical Power

Electrical power is defined as the rate at which electrical energy is converted to other forms of energy due to the circuit components.

Units: **Watts (W)**

P = E / t

_Where, P = Power  E = Energy converted  t = time_

_In current electricity, we learnt that V = E / Q  E = VQ if we combine the 2 formulas, P = VQ/ t Current is charge over time 1 = Q/ t Hence,_

P = VI

_If we sub in V = RT, we can also get,_

P = PR

P = VZ / R

## 5 Electricity Consumption

Joule or even kilo-joulees are too small units to measure electricity consumption.

Hence the electricity consumption is measured in terms of **kilowatt-hour (WM)**.

Energy used = Power x Time

1kWh = 1kWh x 1 hour

= 1000W x 3600s

= 3600 000 1

= 3.6 M]

So technically, 1kWh is 3.6 M].

## 6 Appendix I Importance of EARTH WIRE WIRING IN ELECTRICAL SYSTEMS

Live wire is always at high voltage as it draws current from the socket at high voltage.

Neutral wire is at zero voltage as the components would have used up the electrical energy.
