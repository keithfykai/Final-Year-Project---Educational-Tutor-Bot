## 1 Introduction to Aliphatic Alcohols

\(\mathcal{O}^{\text{m}}\): Aliphatic alcohols are classified as _primary_, _secondary_ or _tertiary_ depending on the number of alkyl (or aryl) groups attached to the \(\alpha\)-carbon, _i.e._ the carbon linked to the \(-\)OH group.

### Nomenclature

\(\mathcal{O}^{\text{m}}\): The hydroxyl group is treated as a _principal functional group_ of the hydrocarbon and named in the _suffix_. \(\mathcal{O}^{\text{m}}\): The _position_ of the \(-\)OH groups are indicated (if necessary) by _numbering_ the carbon atoms of the hydrocarbon. \(\mathcal{O}^{\text{m}}\): _Multipliers_ such as di-, tri-, tetra-, _etc._ are used to indicate the _number of \(-\)OH_ groups present. \(\mathcal{O}^{\text{m}}\): _E.g._

### Physical Properties of Aliphatic Alcohols

#### 1.2.1 Boiling Points of Alcohols

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|} \hline
**compound** & \(M_{r}\) & **no. of** & **boiling point / \({}^{\circ}\)C** & **intermolecular forces of attraction** \\ \hline C\({}_{2}\)H\({}_{5}\)OH & 46.0 & 26 & 78.4 & **hydrogen bonding** \\  & & & & \\  & & & & \\ \hline CH\({}_{3}\)C\(I\) & 50.5 & 26 & \(-\)24.2 & **permanent dipole-permanent dipole** \\  & & & & \\  & & & & \\ \hline C\({}_{3}\)H\({}_{8}\) & 44.0 & 26 & \(-\)42.0 & **instantaneous dipole-induced dipole** \\ \hline \end{tabular}

\({}^{\circ}\)\({}^{\alpha}\) Boiling points of alcohols are **higher** than boiling points of alkanes of comparable \(M_{r}\).

\begin{tabular}{l l} _Reason:_ & Larger amount of energy is needed to overcome the **stronger hydrogen bonds** \\  & between the alcohol molecules than the weaker instantaneous dipole-induced dipole interactions between the alkane molecules. \\ \hline \end{tabular}

\({}^{\circ}\)\({}^{\alpha}\) Factors Affecting Boiling Points

\({}^{\sim}\)\({}^{\sim}\)**Length of alkyl chain**: Boiling point increases with **increasing length** of alkyl chain.

**boiling point / \({}^{\circ}\)C** & 64.7 & 78.4 & 97.0 \\ \hline \end{tabular}

\begin{tabular}{l l} _Reason:_ & Instantaneous dipole-induced dipole interactions **strengthen** with **increase** \\  & **in size (_i.e._ number of electrons)** and hence **polarisability of electron cloud**. \\ \hline \end{tabular}

**boiling point / \({}^{\circ}\)C** & 64.7 & 78.4 & 97.0 \\ \hline \end{tabular}

#### 1.2.2 Solubility

\(\mathcal{O}^{\text{\tiny{m}}}\): Alcohols are relatively more soluble in water than alkanes due to the **presence of the -OH group** which enables them to form **hydrogen bonds** with water molecules.

\(\mathcal{O}^{\text{\tiny{m}}}\): Solubility decreases as the number of carbon atoms increases.

_Reason:_ The bulky non-polar alkyl/aryl groups in the higher alcohols **hinder** the formation of effective hydrogen bonds between alcohol and water molecules.

\begin{tabular}{|c|l|c|} \hline
**name** & **structural formula** & **solubility** \\  & **(g/100 g H\({}_{2}\)O)** \\ \hline methanol & CH\({}_{3}\)OH & miscible \\ \hline ethanol & CH\({}_{3}\)CH\({}_{2}\)OH & miscible \\ \hline propan-1-ol & CH\({}_{3}\)CH\({}_{2}\)CH\({}_{2}\)OH & miscible \\ \hline butan-1-ol & CH\({}_{3}\)(CH\({}_{2}\))\({}_{2}\)CH\({}_{2}\)OH & 7.9 \\ \hline penta-1-ol & CH\({}_{3}\)(CH\({}_{2}\))\({}_{3}\)CH\({}_{2}\)OH & 2.3 \\ \hline hexan-1-ol & CH\({}_{3}\)(CH\({}_{2}\))\({}_{4}\)CH\({}_{2}\)OH & 0.6 \\ \hline \end{tabular}

\(\mathcal{O}^{\text{\tiny{m}}}\): All alcohols are miscible with most organic solvents. Some are useful organic solvents themselves.

\(\mathcal{O}^{\text{\tiny{m}}}\): As a result of having a polar -OH group and a non-polar hydrocarbon chain, alcohols can act as **good solvents** to dissolve **both** water-soluble species (_e.g._ KOH, NaOH) and organic ones (_e.g._ alkyl halides).

## 3 Introduction to Phenols

The parent compound, hydroxybenzene, was discovered in 1834 by Friedlieb Ferdinand Runge, who extracted it (in impure form) from coal tar. Runge called the compound "Karbolsaure" (coal-oil-acid, carbonic acid). Coal tar remained the primary source until the development of the petrochemical industry.

In 1841, the French chemist Auguste Laurent obtained hydroxybenzene in pure form.

In 1836, Auguste Laurent coined the name "phene" for benzene; this is the root of the word "phenol" and "phenyl". In 1843, French chemist Charles Gerhardt coined the name "phenol".

Phenol is an important industrial commodity as a precursor to many materials and useful compounds. It is primarily used to synthesise plastics and related materials. Phenol and its chemical derivatives are essential for production of polycarbonates, epoxies, Bakelite, nylon, detergents, herbicides such as phenoxy herbicides, and numerous pharmaceutical drugs.

### Nomenclature

#### 3.1.1 Phenol as the parent

In many simple compounds, _phenol_ is the parent name and other substituents are simply indicated by a prefix added to the word _-phenol_.

When more than two substituents are present and the substituents are different, they are listed in alphabetical order.

The ring is numbered so as to give _the lowest possible numbers to the substituents_ while the hydroxy group is assumed to be at position 1

#### 3.1.2 Hydroxy group as the substituent

In aromatic compounds containing the carboxyl group, acid derivatives, nitrile group, or carbonyl group, these form the parent and the -OH group is named as a substituent instead, indicated by the prefix _hydroxy-_, preceded by a number indicating it's position relative to the major (parent) functional group.

### Physical Properties of Phenol

* Phenol is a colourless, crystalline, hygroscopic solid (m.p. 42 \({}^{\circ}\)C; b.p. 181 \({}^{\circ}\)C).
* It is **sparingly soluble in water** and the resultant solution is **weakly acidic** (p\(K_{\alpha}\) = 9.98).
* Phenol and its **vapours** are corrosive to the eyes, the skin, and the respiratory tract.
* Its corrosive effect on skin and mucous membranes is due to its ability to denature and coagulate proteins.
* Repeated or prolonged skin contact with phenol may cause dermatitis, or even second and third-degree burns.
* The melting point and boiling point of phenol are higher than that of an alkane of similar \(M_{r}\) due to more energy required to overcome the stronger **hydrogen bonds** between phenol molecules than the weaker instantaneous dipole-induced dipole interactions between alkane molecules.
* Boiling point depends on the _extent_ of _intramolecular_ hydrogen bonding.
* _E.g._ In 2-nitrophenol, the proximity of the -OH and -NO\({}_{2}\) groups allows **intramolecular hydrogen bonding** to occur. Thus, intermolecular hydrogen bonding is **less extensive**, resulting in a lower boiling point than 4-nitrophenol.

### Structure of Phenol

* The oxygen atom of the OH group in phenol can be taken to be **sp\({}^{2}\)-hybridised**, same as the six carbon atoms of the benzene ring.
* The **2p-orbital** on the oxygen atom of the -OH group, carrying a lone pair of electrons, can have a **side-on overlap** with the \(\pi\)**electron cloud** of the benzene ring. As a result, the lone pair of electrons on the oxygen atom is **delocalised into** the benzene ring.
* The delocalisation of the lone pair of electrons on the oxygen atom into the benzene ring has profound influence on the reactivity of
* the **-OH group** of phenol compared to that in aliphatic alcohols, and
* the **benzene ring** of phenol compared to benzene itself.

LO **(a)** recall the chemistry of alcohols, exemplified by ethanol: (iii) reaction with sodium:

**(b)** recall the chemistry of phenol, as exemplified by the following reactions: (i) with bases, (ii) with sodium

**(e)** explain the relative acidities of water, phenol and ethanol in aqueous medium (interpret as Bransted-Lowy acids)

### _Factors Affecting Acid Strength_

\(\mathcal{O}^{m}\): The **strength of acid**, **HA**, depends on the **relative stability** of the resulting **conjugate base**, **A**-, formed.

\(\mathcal{O}^{m}\): The **more stable** the resulting **conjugate base**, **A**-

\(\mathcal{O}^{m}\): the position of equilibrium will lie more to the **right**

\(\mathcal{O}^{m}\)**more H**+**(aq) is formed** due to greater dissociation

\(\mathcal{O}^{m}\): the **stronger the acid**, **HA**

\(\mathcal{O}^{m}\): Hence, to evaluate the acidity of an alcohol / phenol, we assess the **stability** of the corresponding **alkoxide / phenoxide** ion, with the **negative charge on the O atom:

### _Relative Acidity of Water, Ethanol and Phenol_

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|} \hline
**alcohol** & **equilibria** & **pK**\({}_{\text{a}}\)* \\ \hline ethanol & CH3CH2OH & **CH3CH2O**-** & **H**+ & **15.9** \\ \hline water & H2O & **HO**-** & **+** & **H**+ & **15.7** \\ \hline phenol & C6H5OH & **C6H5O**-** & **+** & **H**+ & **10.0** \\ \hline \end{tabular}

* *The higher the value of pK, the less acidic is the compound.

\(\mathcal{O}^{m}\): **Ethanol is a weaker acid than water**.

\(\mathcal{O}^{m}\): The electron-donating CH3CH2- group **intensities** the negative charge, thereby **destabilising** the ethoxide ion, CH3CH2O-, relative to the hydroxide ion.

\(\mathcal{O}^{m}\): **Phenol is a stronger acid than alcohol and water**.

\(\mathcal{O}^{m}\): The 2p-orbital of the oxygen atom of the O-group, carrying a lone pair of electrons, can have a **side-on overlap** with the \(\pi\) electron cloud of the benzene ring. As a result, the lone pair of electrons on the oxygen atom is **delocalised** into the benzene ring, which **disperses** the negative charge, **stabilising the phenoxide ion**. The phenoxide ion is said to be **resonance-stabilised**.
