_Nature of Science_

_Physics is an experimental science. Precise measurements enable the collection of useful experimental data that can be tested against theoretical predictions to refine the development of physical theories. Experimental evidence is the ultimate authority in discriminating between competing physical theories. Scientific knowledge continues to evolve as data from new or improved measurements helps us to understand and quantify the natural world._

_Relating Science and Society_

_Other sciences and society as a whole have benefited from the invention of many amazing measuring devices and techniques. Examples include_

_Modern engineering, in areas like design, construction,_

_Medical industry, where sophisticated devices like magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanners provide important information that aids in diagnosis and treatment decisions._

## Appendix A Physical Quantities and SI Units

### Physical Quantities

* Quantities that can be measured are known as physical quantities. A physical quantity consists of a numerical magnitude and a unit. For example, 

* A symbol may be used to represent a physical quantity. In the above example, the symbol "_m_" represents both the numerical magnitude and the unit. Hence, writing "_Let the mass be m kilograms_" is incorrect, and should be written as "_Let the mass be m_".
* A symbol divided by a unit represents a number. This is used in labelling of graphs axes and for headings of table columns
* Physical quantities can be classified into two categories: base quantities (see A.2) and derived quantities (see A.3). Consequently, units are also classified into two categories, base units and derived units.
* S.I. units was adopted to put an end to more than a hundred years of disarray with a great number of units and unit systems. The S.I. system (metric system) makes a distinction between two classes of units: S.I. base units and S.I. derived units.

### Base Quantities and Base Units

* A base quantity is one that is independent of other base quantities.
* A set of 7 base (or fundamental) quantities were chosen for convenience, instead of necessity and all other units are derived from them. Their corresponding units are called base units and are independent of each other.
* The seven base quantities in the S.I. convention and their corresponding base units are as below.
* A mole of any pure chemical element or compound contains a definite number of molecules, the same number for all elements and compounds.
* One mole is the amount of substance that contains as many elementary entities as there are atoms in 0.012 kilogram of carbon\({}^{-}\)12.
* The number of molecules in a mole is given by the Avogadro number, \(N_{h}\), and it is equal to 6.02 x\(10^{23}\) mol\({}^{-1}\).

### Derived Quantities and Derived Units

A derived quantity is a quantity obtained through a defining equation of base quantities. From the defining equation, a derived unit can be expressed as the product and/or quotient of the base units.

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|} \hline
**derived quantity** & **defining equation** & **derived unit** \\ \hline density & density = volume & \(\frac{\text{kg}}{\text{m}^{3}}=\text{kg}\;\text{m}^{-3}\) \\ \hline velocity & velocity = \(\frac{\text{displacement}}{\text{time}}\) & \(\text{m}\;\text{s}^{-1}\) \\ \hline \end{tabular}

Other examples of derived quantities are shown below.

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|} \hline
**Derived quantity** & **S.I. base units** & \multicolumn{2}{c|}{**S.I. unit**} \\ \cline{2-4}  & & **Name** & **Symbol** \\ \cline{2-4}  & Area & m\({}^{2}\) & - & - \\ \cline{2-4}  & Momentum & kg m s\({}^{-1}\) & - & - \\ \cline{2-4}  & Pressure & kg m\({}^{-1}\) s\({}^{-2}\) & Pascal & Pa \\ \cline{2-4}  & S.I. unit. & Force & kg m s\({}^{-2}\) & Newton & N \\ \cline{2-4}  & Work Done & kg m\({}^{2}\) s\({}^{-2}\) & Joule & J \\ \cline{2-4}  & S.I. unit & Power & kg m\({}^{2}\) s\({}^{-3}\) & Watt & W \\ \cline{2-4}  & Electric Charge & A s & Coulomb & C \\ \cline{2-4}  & Potential Difference & kg m\({}^{2}\) A\({}^{-1}\) s\({}^{-3}\) & Volt & V \\ \cline{2-4}  & Resistance & kg m\({}^{2}\) A\({}^{-2}\) s\({}^{-3}\) & ohm & \(\Omega\) \\ \cline{2-4}  & Frequency & s\({}^{-1}\) & Hertz & Hz \\ \hline \end{tabular}

Note:

Units should be written in index form, e.g. m s\({}^{-2}\) instead of m / s\({}^{2}\).

There is also a space break between different unit.

For example, in "m s\({}^{-1}\)" there is a space between "m" and "s\({}^{-1}\)".

Writing "ms\({}^{-1}\)" means "per millisecond", and not "meter per second".

### Homogeneity of Equations

* Base units can be used to check the homogeneity of equations.
* A homogeneous equation is one whereby every term in the equation has the same unit.
* An inhomogeneous equation is one whereby not every term has the same unit.
* A physical equation is one which is governed by the law of Physics. For an equation to be physically correct, it has to be confirmed experimentally.
* A physically correct equation must be homogeneous and the units of an unknown quantity can be determined by comparing the base units of both sides of the equation.
* However, a homogeneous equation may not necessarily be physically correct. There could be an incorrect coefficient, a missing or extra term, or simply a wrong positive or negative sign.

For example, the equation \(E_{\text{k}}=mv^{2}\) is homogeneous because the units on both sides of the equation are the same. However, it is not physically correct.

The correct equation should be \(E_{\text{k}}=\gamma_{2}mv^{2}\).
* An inhomogeneous equation is definitely physically incorrect.

**Example 2**

Bernoulli's equation, which applies to fluid flow, states that

\[p+h\rho g+\gamma_{2}\;\rho v^{2}=k\]

where \(p\) is pressure, \(h\) is height, \(\rho\) is density, \(g\) is acceleration, \(v\) is velocity and \(k\) is a constant.

**(a)** Show that the left-hand side of the equation is homogeneous.

**(b)** State the SI base unit for \(k\).

### _Making Reasonable Estimates of Physical Quantities_

* It is important to be aware of the typical order of magnitude of certain physical quantities and their respective units.
* The following is a compilation of some reasonable estimates.

**Example 3**

Estimate the average kinetic energy of an ASRJC student competing in a 100 m race.

There is no one answer for estimation questions. The skill assessed for such questions is the ability to make reasonable estimates (i.e. the correct order of magnitude)

## Appendix B Errors and Uncertainties

* Errors might arise in the process of taking a measurement, whether intentionally or unintentionally. They could arise from different sources.
* In general, errors can be classified into two main types: SYSTEMATIC errors or RANDOM errors.

### Systematic Error and Random Error

* A systematic error will result in all readings having a constant error in one direction.

* An error is systematic if repeating the measurement under the _same conditions_ yields all measurements having a constant error in one direction i.e. being either all bigger or all smaller than the true value.
* Measurements with systematic errors change in a predictable manner depending on the conditions.

* Systematic errors can never be eliminated by taking average of repeated measurements with no change to the experimental setup or technique.
* They can be reduced or eliminated by using good experimental technique and by varying the instrumentation used.

For example, check for proper calibration of instruments, check and account for zero error and verifying time taken by a stopwatch with another.

* A **random** error will result in a scatter of readings about a mean value.
* An error is random if repeating the measurement under the _same conditions_ yields all measurements being scattered about a mean value. Measurements with random errors have an equal chance of being negative or positive.

* Random errors cannot be eliminated.
* They can be reduced by repeating a measurement and averaging the measurements and by plotting a graph and drawing a best fit line for the plotted points.
* Since positive and negative errors of this type are equally probable, a large number of measurements will give an average which is almost free from random error (as the positive and negative errors will tend to offset each other in the average).
* Hence quantities which are prone to random error can be made more reliable by repeating the measurement several times and obtaining the mean value.

### Distinguishing between Systematic and Random Errors through Illustrations

In the diagram below,

* random error causes a spread of readings approximately centred about a mean value.
* whereas systematic error shifts the mean value away from the true value.

### Actual uncertainty

* In experimental Physics, one deals with measurements which involve the use of instruments. The accuracy is invariably limited by the sensitivity of the instrument; one can only read as precisely as the instrument can measure.
* For a reading \(R\) from a measuring instrument, its uncertainty, attributed to the measuring instrument only, is known as the actual uncertainty, \(\Delta R\).
* The reading \(R\) is between 10.5 cm to 10.6 cm, thus at best one can read it as 10.55 cm with an _actual uncertainty_\(\Delta R\), of \(\pm\) 0.05 cm, generally taken to be half the smallest division (_here, the smallest division of the metre rule is 0.1 cm_).
* The standard way of expressing the reading \(R\) with its actual uncertainty in this example is \(R=(10.55\pm 0.05)\) cm.
* As actual uncertainties are estimated values, their numerical values are always quoted to one significant figure only.
* The reading \(R\) is expressed to the same place value as that of the uncertainty \(\Delta R\).
* The uncertainty of a reading is an indication of the range within which the reading is most likely to lie. e.g. \((10.55\pm 0.05)\) cm simply means that the most likely value is 10.55 cm but it could be as low as 10.50 cm or as high as 10.60 cm.
* In general, the uncertainty of a reading is half the smallest division if the markings on the scaled instrument are close to one another. If the spacing between the markings is large (further apart than 1 mm), then the uncertainty of a reading may become one-quarter or one-fifth of the smallest division.

### Fractional and Percentage Uncertainty

* Generally, all readings can be recorded in the form \(R\pm\Delta R\) in which \(\pm\Delta R\) is the actual uncertainty.
* However, the suitability of an instrument in relation to a measurement is reflected in the fractional or percentage uncertainty.
* fractional uncertainty of \(R=\pm\frac{\Delta R}{R}\)

#### b.5.2 Uncertainty of a Derived Quantity from Multiplication and/or Division of measured quantities

(you can refer to Appendix B for the derivations from first principle)

Suppose:

\(A\) and \(B\) are measured quantities

\(\Delta A\) and \(\Delta B\) are the corresponding actual uncertainties

\(m\) and \(n\) are numerical constants

\(R\) is related to \(A\) and \(B\) via the following multiplication and/or division equations and the fractional uncertainty can be obtained as per the table below.

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|} \hline
**Physical Quantity** & **FRACTIONAL Uncertainty** \\ \hline \(R=AB\) & \\ \(R=\frac{A}{B}\) & \(\frac{\Delta R}{R}=\frac{\Delta A}{A}+\frac{\Delta B}{B}\) \\ \hline \(R=A^{m}\) & \(\frac{\Delta R}{R}=m\frac{\Delta A}{A}\) \\ \hline \(R=A^{m}B^{n}\) & \(\frac{\Delta R}{R}=m\frac{\Delta A}{A}+n\frac{\Delta B}{B}\) \\ \hline \end{tabular}

Note:

Equations that consist of trigonometric or logarithmic functions would require an analysis from the first principle.

**Example 7**

The dimensions of a rectangle are recorded as \((1.873\pm 0.005)\) mm and \((1.580\pm 0.005)\) mm.

Determine the actual uncertainty and fractional uncertainty of

**(a)**  its perimeter, and

**(b)**  its area.

#### 6.5.3 Steps for finding the actual uncertainty of a derived quantity

1. Manipulate the equation to make the quantity \(x\) that you want to find its actual uncertainty as the subject.
2. Calculate the value of the quantity \(x\).
3. Depending on the nature of the equation, do the following: 1. the equation is a sum and/or difference of quantities * find the sum of the actual uncertainties of the quantities involved. This gives the actual uncertainty \(\Delta x\).
2. the equation is a product and/or quotient of quantities * find the sum of fractional uncertainties. This gives the fractional uncertainty \(\Delta x/x\). * calculate actual uncertainty \(\Delta x\), by multiplying the fractional uncertainty with value of quantity \(x\).
3. the equation is a combination of sum, difference, multiplication and/or division of quantities * break down equation into parts and work through by parts by applying \(i\) and \(ii\) above separately.
4. Keep actual uncertainty \(\Delta x\) to 1 significant figure.
5. Round off the value of the quantity \(x\) found in part 2 to the same place value as the actual uncertainty \(\Delta x\) and express in scientific notation.

### Vector Addition

* Unlike scalars, vector quantities cannot be added and subtracted using algebra.
* Instead, one of the following vector diagrams can be used to perform vector addition (and subtraction).

1. Vector Triangle Method

* Rearrange the vectors \(A\) and \(B\) such that one vector (_B_) has its tail placed at the tip of the other vector (_A_).

* Complete the vector triangle by drawing the line directed from the tail of vector \(A\) to the tip of vector \(B\), with a double arrow.

This is the resultant vector, \(R\), which is equal to the addition of the two vectors \(A\) and \(B\).

2. Parallelogram method

* Rearrange the vectors \(A\) and \(B\) such that the tails of both vectors are placed together.

Using the two vectors as adjacent sides of a parallelogram, draw the remaining two sides (parallel to the two vectors) in dotted lines.

The resultant vector, \(R\), is the line drawn along the diagonal of the parallelogram from the tail of the two vectors to the other vertex, with a double arrow.

This resultant vector, \(R\), is also equal to the addition of the two vectors \(A\) and \(B\).

Both methods will give the same resultant vector.

PHYSICS 9749 / 8867

### Resolving Vectors

* Since two vectors can be added to give a resultant vector, any vector can be resolved (or separated) into two vectors or components.
* It is more convenient to resolve a vector into two mutually-perpendicular components through the use of trigonometry and Pythagoras' theorem.
* Mutually-perpendicular vectors are independent of each other.
* Method of resolving a vector into 2 perpendicular components
* Identify the 2 perpendicular directions that you want to resolve the vector \(F\) into.
* Draw a rectangle using the 2 perpendicular directions as reference. Ensure that the vector \(F\) to be resolved lies on the diagonal of the rectangle.
* The components of vector \(F\), _F_x and _F_y, are on the adjacent sides of the rectangle.
* The arrows of the component vectors _F_x and _F_y are drawn with their tails at the same position as the tail of the resolved vector \(F\) and the arrowheads are at ends of the respective length of the rectangle.
* Adding and/or subtracting more than 2 vectors can be easily handled without having to adopt the vector triangle method or parallelogram method repeatedly.
* We can resolve all the vectors into the identified two perpendicular components, and apply vector addition and/or subtraction in the two directions separately. The result would give the components of the resultant vector.

## Appendix A Calculation of actual uncertainty from first principle

For all the following parts, we will use

\(R_{1}=41.2\pm 0.1\) cm

\(R_{2}=20.1\pm 0.1\) cm

**(a)**: **Addition**: Let \(R=R_{1}+R_{2}\) and \(\Delta R\) be the actual uncertainty of \(R\).

\(R=41.2+20.1=61.3\) cm

Then \(R\) can be written as \(R=(61.3\pm\Delta R)\) cm

From first principle,

\(R_{\min}=(R_{1})_{\min}+(R_{2})_{\min}=41.1+20.0=61.1\) cm

\(R_{\max}=(R_{1})_{\max}+(R_{2})_{\max}=41.3+20.2=61.5\) cm

Hence, \(\Delta R=\frac{R_{\max}\cdot R_{\min}}{2}=0.4\) / \(2=0.2\)

Therefore, \(R=(61.3\pm 0.2)\) cm since \(\Delta R=\pm 0.2\) cm

Thus for addition \(\Delta R=\Delta R_{1}+\Delta R_{2}\).

**(b)**: **Subtraction**: Let \(R=R_{1}-R_{2}\) and \(\Delta R\) be the actual uncertainty of \(R\).

\(R=41.2-20.1=21.1\) cm

Then \(R\) can be written as \(R=(21.1\pm\Delta R)\) cm

From first principle,

\(R_{\min}=(R_{1})_{\min}-(R_{2})_{\max}=41.1-20.2=20.9\) cm

\(R_{\max}=(R_{1})_{\max}-(R_{2})_{\min}=41.3-20.0=21.3\) cm

Hence, \(\Delta R=\frac{R_{\max}\cdot R_{\min}}{2}=0.4\) / \(2=0.2\)

Therefore, \(R=(21.1\pm 0.2)\) cm since \(\Delta R=\pm 0.2\) cm

Thus for subtraction \(\Delta R=\Delta R_{1}+\Delta R_{2}\).

**(c)**: **Product**: Let \(R=R_{1}\times R_{2}\) and \(\Delta R\) be the actual uncertainty of \(R\).

\(R=41.2\times 20.1=828.12\) cm\({}^{2}\)

Then \(R\) can be written as \(R=(828.12\pm\Delta R)\) cm\({}^{2}\)

From first principle,

\(R_{\min}=(R_{1})_{\min}\times(R_{2})_{\min}=41.1\times 20.0=822.00\) cm\({}^{2}\)

\(R_{\max}=(R_{1})_{\max}\times(R_{2})_{\max}=41.3\times 20.2=834.26\) cm\({}^{2}\)

## Appendix B Derivation of uncertainty formulae

Consider the following quantities with their actual uncertainty:

\[R_{1}=A\pm\Delta A\quad\text{ and }\quad R_{2}=B\pm\Delta B\]

**(a) Addition**

Let \(W=R_{1}+R_{2}\).

maximum \(W=(A+\Delta A)+(B+\Delta B)=(A+B)+(\Delta A+\Delta B)\)

minimum \(W=(A-\Delta A)+(B-\Delta B)=(A+B)-(\Delta A+\Delta B)\)

\(\Delta W=\gamma_{2}\) (maximum \(W-\) minimum \(W\)) \(=\Delta A+\Delta B\)

Hence, \(W\pm\Delta W=(A+B)\pm(\Delta A+\Delta B)\)

**(b) Subtraction**

Let \(X=R_{1}-R_{2}\).

maximum \(X=(A+\Delta A)-(B-\Delta B)=(A-B)+(\Delta A+\Delta B)\)

minimum \(X=(A-\Delta A)-(B+\Delta B)=(A-B)-(\Delta A+\Delta B)\)

\(\Delta X=\gamma_{2}\) (maximum \(X-\) minimum \(X\)) \(=\Delta A+\Delta B\)

Hence, \(X\pm\Delta X=(A-B)\pm(\Delta A+\Delta B)\)

From **(a)** and **(b)**, we can see that when quantities are added and/or subtracted, the _actual uncertainty is the sum of the individual actual uncertainties_.

**(c) Multiplication**

Let \(Y=R_{1}\times R_{2}\).

maximum \(Y=(A+\Delta A)\times(B+\Delta B)=AB+B\Delta A+A\Delta B+\Delta A\Delta B\)

minimum \(Y=(A-\Delta A)\times(B-\Delta B)=AB-B\Delta A-A\Delta B+\Delta A\Delta B\)

\(\Delta Y=\gamma_{2}\) (maximum \(Y-\) minimum \(Y\)) \(=B\Delta A+A\Delta B\)

Hence, \(Y\pm\Delta Y=AB\pm(B\Delta A+A\Delta B)\).

But this is not an easy form to remember, especially in cases with more than 2 quantities in the equation. Instead, we divide the actual uncertainty, \(\Delta Y\), with \(Y\) throughout.

\[\frac{\Delta Y}{Y}=\frac{B\Delta A}{Y}+\frac{A\Delta B}{Y}\]

Since \(Y=AB\), we have

\[\frac{\Delta Y}{Y}=\frac{B\Delta A}{AB}+\frac{A\Delta B}{AB}\]

Hence, for multiplication of quantities, the _fractional uncertainty is given by the sum of the individual fractional uncertainties of the quantities_.

**(d) Division**

**Let** \(Z=R_{i}\) **/** \(R_{2}\)**.**

\[\text{maximum}\ Z=(A+\Delta A)\ /\ (B-\Delta B)=\frac{A(1+\frac{\Delta A}{A})}{B(1- \frac{\Delta B}{B})}=\frac{A}{B}(1+\frac{\Delta A}{A})(\frac{1}{1-\frac{\Delta B }{B}})\]

**The expression** \((\frac{1}{1-\frac{\Delta B}{B}})\) **can be written as** \((1-\frac{\Delta B}{B})^{-1}\) **and we can apply the Binomial expansion**\({}^{\star}\) **to obtain the following:**

\[(1-\frac{\Delta B}{B})^{-1}=1+\frac{\Delta B}{B}+(\frac{\Delta B}{B})^{2}+( \frac{\Delta B}{B})^{3}+...\]

**Since usually,** \(\left|\frac{\Delta B}{B}\right|\ll 1\)**, the terms** \((\frac{\Delta B}{B})^{2}\)**,** \((\frac{\Delta B}{B})^{3}\)**,** \(...\) **will all be** \(<<1\)**. These terms can be neglected and the expression converges to become**

\[(1-\frac{\Delta B}{B})^{-1}\approx 1+\frac{\Delta B}{B}\]

**Hence, maximum** \(Z\!\!=\!\frac{A}{B}(1+\frac{\Delta A}{A})(1+\frac{\Delta B}{B})\!=\!\frac{A}{ B}(1+\frac{\Delta A}{A}+\frac{\Delta B}{B}+\frac{\Delta A}{A}\frac{\Delta B}{B})\)

**Similarly,**

\[\text{minimum}\ Z\!=\!(A-\Delta A)\ /\ (B+\Delta B)=\frac{A(1-\frac{ \Delta A}{A})}{B(1+\frac{\Delta B}{B})}=\frac{A}{B}(1-\frac{\Delta A}{A})( \frac{1}{1+\frac{\Delta B}{B}})\]

\[(1+\frac{\Delta B}{B})^{-1}=1-\frac{\Delta B}{B}+(\frac{\Delta B}{B})^{2}-( \frac{\Delta B}{B})^{3}+\ldots\approx 1-\frac{\Delta B}{B}\]

**Hence, minimum** \(Z\!\!\approx\!\frac{A}{B}(1-\frac{\Delta A}{A})(1-\frac{\Delta B}{B})=\!\frac{ A}{B}(1-\frac{\Delta A}{A}-\frac{\Delta B}{B}+\frac{\Delta A}{A}\frac{\Delta B}{B})\)

\(\Delta Z\!=\!\gamma_{2}\ (\text{maximum}\ Z-\text{minimum}\ Z)=\frac{A}{B}( \frac{\Delta A}{A}+\frac{\Delta B}{B})\)

**Dividing throughout by** \(Z\)**, we have**

\[\frac{\Delta Z}{Z}=\frac{\frac{A\Delta A}{B}\frac{\Delta A}{A}\frac{\Delta B }{Z}}{Z}=\frac{\frac{A\Delta A}{B}\frac{\Delta A}{A}\frac{\Delta B}{B}}{\frac {\Delta B}{B}}\]

\[\frac{\Delta Z}{Z}=\frac{\Delta A}{A}+\frac{\Delta B}{B}\]

**Hence, for division of quantities, the fractional uncertainty is also given by the** _sum_ **of the fractional uncertainties of the quantities.**

\({}^{\star}\)**The binomial expansion is part of the H2 Mathematics syllabus. Here is one form of the binomial expansion used in the above derivation.**

\[(1+x)^{n}=1+nx+\frac{n(n-1)}{2!}x^{2}+\frac{n(n-1)(n-2)}{3!}x^{3}+\ldots\]
