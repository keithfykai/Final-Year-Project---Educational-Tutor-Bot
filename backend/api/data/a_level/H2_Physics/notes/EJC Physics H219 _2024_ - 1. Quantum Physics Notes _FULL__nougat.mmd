### Particles and waves

We often model matter using particles (small masses) that are hard, rigid and move according to Newton's Laws of motion. The macroscopic phenomena can then be explained by the random motion and collisions of the distribution of particles.

\begin{tabular}{|p{56.9pt}|p{56.9pt}|p{56.9pt}|p{56.9pt}|} \hline

On the other hand, waves are used to explain the transport of energy without matter being transported. The medium of transport is often described as oscillating.

### Light can behave like waves or like particles

Light (or, in general, electromagnetic radiation) can undergo _superposition_ and _interference_. These are _strong evidences that electromagnetic radiation behaves like waves_.

However, in order to explain the photoelectric effect, electromagnetic radiation needs to be treated as if they were particles.

### Energy of a photon

A **photon** is a discrete packet of energy of electromagnetic radiation.

Energy of one photon = Planck constant \(\times\) frequency

The Planck constant, \(h\), is \(h=6.63\times 10^{-34}\) J s.

**Example 1**

Determine the energy of one photon of frequency 5.5 x 10\({}^{14}\) Hz.

\[E = hf\] \[=(6.63\times 10^{-34})(5.5\times 10^{14})\] \[=3.6\times 10^{-19}\) J

**Note**: The energy in Joules for a photon is not a convenient order of magnitude, so the electronvolt (eV) is often used. One eV is the energy gained by an electron that is accelerated through the potential difference of 1 V:

**1 eV = 1.6 x 10-19 C x 1 V = 1.6 x 10-19 J.

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:4]

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:5]

**Work function energy** is the minimum energy needed to cause emission of electron from the surface of a metal

The work function energy \(\Phi\) is unique to each type of metal. It is typically measured in eV.

The work function energy can be affected by the surface condition of the metal, such as it being oxidised.

**Example 4**

Light of wavelength 543 nm is incident on a clean sodium surface. The photoelectrons released are found to have negligible amount of kinetic energy. Determine the work function \(\Phi\) for sodium metal in eV.

\[\hbar f =\Phi+\frac{1}{2}mv_{\max}^{2} \Phi_{\rm{Na}} =\frac{\hbar c}{\lambda}-E_{\kappa,\max}\] \[\frac{\hbar c}{\lambda} =\Phi_{\rm{Na}}+E_{\kappa,\max} =\frac{(6.63\times 10^{-34})(3\times 10^{8})}{543\times 10^{-9}}-0\] \[=3.66\times 10^{-19}\ \rm{J}\] \[=2.29\ \rm{eV}\]

**19.7 The threshold frequency and threshold wavelength**

In other words, it is the frequency of electromagnetic radiation for electrons to be emitted from metal surface with zero kinetic energy.

\[\hbar f =\Phi+\frac{1}{2}mv_{\max}^{2}\] \[\hbar f_{0} =\Phi+0\]

Threshold frequency is therefore unique to each type of metal and can be affected by the surface condition.

**Threshold wavelength** is the

In other words, it is the wavelength of electromagnetic radiation for electrons to be emitted from metal surface with zero kinetic energy.

**Threshold wavelength** is the

In other words, it is the wavelength of electromagnetic radiation for electrons to be emitted from metal surface with zero kinetic energy.

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:7]

**Example 8**

Violet light of 400 nm is incident on a clean surface of potassium metal of work function 2.0 eV. Determine the maximum speed of photoelectrons.

\[hf=\Phi+\frac{1}{2}mv_{\max}^{2}\] \[\frac{hc}{\lambda}=\Phi+\frac{1}{2}m_{\rm e}v_{\max}^{2}\] \[\nu_{\max}=\sqrt{\frac{2\Big{(}\frac{hc}{\lambda}-\Phi\Big{)}}{m_ {\rm e}}}=\sqrt{2\Big{(}\frac{\big{(}6.63\times 10^{-34}\big{)}(3\times 10^{8} \big{)}}{400\times 10^{-9}}-(2.0)\big{(}1.6\times 10^{-19}\big{)}\Big{)}}{9.11 \times 10^{-31}}=6.24\times 10^{5}\ \text{ ms}^{-1}\]

**Note:** Do check against logic and verify that the speed does not exceed the speed of light.

### The stopping potential, \(V_{s}\)

The movement of electrons in the vacuum tube is invisible, and the velocities involved are large. A convenient way of measuring the maximum kinetic energy of the photoelectrons, is to "repel" them such that none of them can reach the collector, _that is, all the kinetic energy of the photoelectrons is converted into electric potential energy before any photoelectron can reach the collector plate._

Stopping potential, \(V_{s}\),is the minimum potential difference between the emitting metal and collector that prevents the most energetic photoelectrons from reaching the collector plate, resulting in zero photoelectric current

**Example 9**

UV light of wavelength 350 nm falls onto Cesium metal of work function 2.1 eV. Find the stopping potential required for the ammeter to register zero current.

by conservation of energy, \(\epsilon V_{s}=hf-\Phi\)

max KE of electron

= gain in Electric PE of electron at \(V_{s}\)

\(\frac{1}{2}mv_{\max}^{2}=eV_{s}\)

\(\frac{1}{2}\)\(mv_{\max}^{2}=eV_{s}\)

\(hf=\Phi+\frac{1}{2}mv_{\max}^{2}\)

**Note:** The stopping potential is a negative voltage (relative to the emitter) as it needs to "repel" the photoelectrons.

**Example 10**: Light of wavelength 300 nm falls onto a metal emitter. The photon energy is enough to cause emission of photoelectrons. The ammeter reads 0.08 mA.

1. Calculate the number of electrons being emitted per second.
2. If the probability of a photon successfully causing photoemission is 2.3%, estimate the power of the light shining on emitter.

Current flows only when photoelectric effect is active. Since the collector plate is positive with respect to the emitter, we assume all emitted photoelectrons reach the collector plate.

1. (i) total charge emitted per second \(=It=0.08\times 10^{-3}\times 1=0.08\times 10^{-3}\)C no. of electrons emitted per sec \(=\frac{\text{total charge}}{\text{charge per electron}}\)\(=\frac{0.08\times 10^{-3}}{1.6\times 10^{-19}}=5.0\times 10^{14}\) s\({}^{-1}\) total number of photons \(=\frac{\text{no. of photoelectrons emitted}}{0.023}\)\(=\frac{5.0\times 10^{14}}{0.023}\)\(\text{power}=\text{energy emitted in 1 second}\)\(=n_{\text{photon}}E_{\text{photon}}\)\(=n_{\text{photon}}\bigg{(}\frac{\hbar c}{\lambda}\bigg{)}\)\(=\frac{5.0\times 10^{14}}{0.023}\bigg{(}\frac{(6.63\times 10^{-34})(3\times 10^{8})}{3 00\times 10^{-9}}\bigg{)}\)\(=0.0144\) W

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:11]

**How will the graph change when the intensity of electromagnetic radiation increases?**

If frequency remains constant, energy per photon remains constant, the maximum kinetic energy of photoelectrons remains constant, and so the stopping potential remains the same.

(the terms used in the corresponding photoelectric equation \(\ hf=\Phi+\frac{1}{2}mv_{\rm max}^{2}\) remains the same)

Since the energy per photon remains constant, with increasing intensity, there must be more photons reaching the emitter per second. Hence, more photoelectrons will be emitted per second, and the saturation current will be higher.

**How will the graph change when the frequency of electromagnetic radiation increases, but the number of photons reaching the emitter per second remains the same?**

Energy per photon, given by \(E=hf\), increases. The maximum kinetic energy of photoelectrons increases. By the photoelectric equation \(\ hf=\Phi+\frac{1}{2}mv_{\rm max}^{2}=\Phi+eV_{\rm s}\), a larger stopping potential is required to prevent the most energetic photoelectrons from reaching the collector plate.

The number of photons reaching the emitter per second remains the same. The number of emitted electrons per second remains the same. The saturation current remains the same.

**How will the graph change when the frequency of electromagnetic radiation increases while the power output of the light source remains?**

The individual photon energy will increase but the number of photons reaching the emitter per second will decrease.

\[\text{power}=\text{no. of photons per unit time }\times\text{energy per photon}\]

The stopping potential will be of a larger magnitude, but the saturation current will decreases.

**Example 11**

In a photoelectric experiment, a metal with work function 1.8 eV is irradiated with light of wavelength 450 nm.

Determine the stopping potential.

The metal is then replaced with another of a higher work function. Sketch the graph for both metals in the axes provided.

(i)

\[\begin{split} hf&=\Phi+\frac{1}{2}m\nu_{\text{ max}}^{2}\\ &=\Phi+\text{eV}_{s}\\ V_{s}&=\left(\frac{n}{e}\right)\left(f\right)-\frac{ \Phi}{e}\\ &=\left(\frac{n}{e}\right)\left(\frac{c}{\lambda}\right)-\frac{ \Phi}{e}\\ &=\left(\frac{6.63\times 10^{-34}}{1.6\times 10^{-19}}\right) \left(\frac{3\times 10^{8}}{450\times 10^{-9}}\right)-\frac{1.8\times 1.6\times 10^{ -19}}{1.6\times 10^{-19}}\\ &=0.96\text{ V}\end{split}\]

(ii) Threshold frequency for metal 1:

\[\begin{split}\Phi&=hf_{0}\\ f_{0}&=\frac{\Phi}{h}\\ &=\frac{(1.8)(1.6\times 10^{-19})}{6.63\times 10^{-34}}\\ &=4.3\times 10^{14}\text{ Hz}\end{split}\]

**Note:** Gradient is the same, as \(\frac{h}{e}\) is constant. The y-intercept is \(\frac{\phi}{e}\). Since there is no emission of electrons until the threshold frequency \(f_{0}\) is reached, the x-intercept reflects \(f_{0}\).

### 19.12 Waves undergo superposition and interference

Typical experimental set-ups involve double slits and diffraction grating:

"White light" consists of light of all the wavelengths (400 to 700 nm) that are visible to human eyes. When white light passes through a diffraction grating, each wavelength is diffracted by a different angle. The resulting separation pattern, which looks like a rainbow, is a spectrum (plural: _spectra_).

### 19.13 Line Spectra

An absorption line spectra is a continuous spectrum crossed by dark lines

An emission line spectra is discrete bright lines of different colours on a dark background

The _emission_ line spectrum and the _absorption_ line spectrum of hydrogen gas are shown above. Notice that an absorption spectrum is the _inverse_ of the emission spectrum for the same element.

The positions of the lines are the same for neutral atoms belonging to the same element - the atoms can only _emit_ or _absorb_ light of certain wavelengths. These lines (representing wavelengths) are _unique_ or _characteristic_ of the element. In astrophysics (analyzing light from a distant star) or qualitative analysis of compounds, this feature is useful for identifying the presence of elements.

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:16]

### De-excitation of electron in atom emits photon

An electron in an excited state (higher energy level) tends to deexcite. When an electron deexcites and transits to a lower energy level, the energy loss is emitted as a single photon which has energy that is equal to the difference between the initial and final energy levels.

Figure 17: **The energy loss of the electron in atom emits photon**

**Example 12**: An excited electron is at the \(E_{3}\) energy state of a hydrogen atom.

State the number of different possible de-excitation transitions possible.

Determine the wavelengths of the emitted photons with each possible transition, and identify which part of the EM spectrum these photons lie in.

3 transitions are possible:

\[E_{3\to 1} = hf=\frac{hc}{\lambda_{A}}\] \[\lambda_{A} = \frac{hc}{\left|E_{1}-E_{3}\right|}=\frac{\left(6.63\times 10^{-34} \right)\left(3\times 10^{8}\right)}{\left(-13.6-\left(-1.51\right)\right)\left(1.6 \times 10^{-19}\right)}\] \[= 103\text{ nm (UV)}\] \[E_{3\to 2} = hf=\frac{hc}{\lambda_{B}}\] \[\lambda_{B} = \frac{hc}{\left|E_{2}-E_{3}\right|}=\frac{\left(6.63\times 10^{-34} \right)\left(3\times 10^{8}\right)}{\left(-3.40-\left(-1.51\right)\right) \left(1.6\times 10^{-19}\right)}\] \[= 658\text{ nm (visible)}\] \[E_{2\to 1} = hf=\frac{hc}{\lambda}\] \[\lambda_{A} = \frac{hc}{\left|E_{1}-E_{2}\right|}=\frac{\left(6.63\times 10^{-34} \right)\left(3\times 10^{8}\right)}{\left(-13.6-\left(-3.40\right)\right) \left(1.6\times 10^{-19}\right)}\] \[= 122\text{ nm (UV)}\]

Energy required for electrons to transit from lower energy levels to higher energy levels is _absorbed by the atom_ via 2 ways: by the absorption of a single photon, or by the collision of another high speed particle, such as an electron.

For photon absorption _by atom_, the energy of the photon (\(E=hf\)) must be just the correct amount for the electron to make the energy level transition.

No such requirement exists for exciting electrons through bombarding _the atom_ with high speed particles. _The atom_ can absorb _some_ of the kinetic energy required by the electron to make the transition, i.e. the kinetic energy of the bombarding particle can be _greater than or equal to_ the energy difference between the energy levels involved in the transition.

In other words, the bombarding particle can lose any fraction of its kinetic energy during collision with the _atom_.

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:19]

**Example 13**: A cool region of hydrogen gas surrounds a hot gas cloud emitting white light in outer space. Describe and explain the type of spectrum observed from point X, Y and Z.

**Point X:**

* Continuous spectrum of wavelengths of electromagnetic radiation that are visible to the human eye.
* Appears as rainbow colours, which make up white light.

**Point Y:**

* Absorption spectrum, a continuous spectrum crossed by dark lines.
* The atoms in the cool hydrogen absorb photons of specific energy values that are equal to the difference between discrete energy levels when an orbital electron transits from a lower energy level to a higher energy level.
* The specific energy of an absorbed photon is _E = hf_, shows up as dark lines of specific frequencies, hence wavelengths, against white light spectrum.
* The absorbed photons are re-emitted in all directions, so only a small negligible fraction of the re-emitted photons are observed at Y, thus still appears as dark lines.

**Point Z:**

* Emission spectrum, discrete bright lines of different colours on a dark background.
* When cool hydrogen atoms absorb photons, they are excited and unstable. They shortly de-excite and re-emit photons in all directions.
* The photons have specific energy values that are equal to the difference in discrete energy levels

when an orbital electron transits from a higher energy level to a lower energy level.
* The specific energy of a re-emitted photon is _E = hf_, and shows up

as coloured lines of specific frequencies, hence wavelengths, on a dark background.

**Example 14**: Line spectra is evidence of discrete energy levels for electrons in isolated atoms.

Describe 2 experiments that prove this.

White light passes through a cold hydrogen gas that is contained in a glass flask.

Photons that correspond to the energy changes between energy levels are absorbed.

All other photons pass through unabsorbed.

As the atoms de-excite, photons are re-emitted in all directions, with much less intensity (negligible) in the original direction of travel.

A prism or diffraction grating separates the wavelengths.

This results in dark lines on a coloured background.

Hydrogen gas is contained in a glass discharge tube with a high potential difference applied between the electrodes, which causes the gas to heat up and the atoms excited.

Upon de-excitation, photons are emitted as the electrons changes their energy level from higher to lower. These photon energies correspond to the energy difference between energy levels.

The light emitted from the gas passes through a prism or diffraction grating that separates its wavelengths.

This results in coloured lines on a dark background.

**Each line corresponds to a specific photon energy. The discrete energy changes proves that atoms contain discrete electronic energy levels.**

**Example 15**: The allowed energy levels of a hydrogen atom, in eV, are given by the formula \(E_{n}=-\frac{13.6\) eV \(n^{2}\)

1. Draw a labelled energy level diagram for \(n=1\) to \(n=4\).
2. Explain why a cool hydrogen atom will be unable to absorb a photon of 11.0 eV.
3. State the number of absorption lines expected for electronic transitions between these energy levels for a cool, diffuse hydrogen gas.
4. Given a hot hydrogen gas where the atoms are all excited to the \(n=4\) state, state the number of emission lines expected when the gas returns to a cool, diffuse state.

(a)

(b) An atom can only absorb a photon of energy that is exactly the difference in discrete energy levels of the atom.

A cool hydrogen atom has the electron at the ground state of \(n=1\).

None of the transitions from \(n=1\) to \(n=2\), 3 or 4, has an energy difference of 11.0 eV.
3. 3.

A cool hydrogen gas has atoms at ground state of \(n=1\).

The transitions are \(n_{1+2}\), \(n_{1+3}\) and \(n_{1+4}\).

(d) 6. For de-exciting to ground state, there are 6 possible transitions:

### 19.17 X-rays

**X-rays** are very high-energy **photons** with **wavelengths ranging from 0.01 nm to 10 nm**. The wavelength is in the same order of magnitude as the interatomic spacing in crystals, making it suitable to study crystal structures.

X-rays are highly penetrating. This property is useful for non-invasive medical imaging of animal bodies because different types of body tissue absorb X-rays in different amounts. Because ionizing radiation is absorbed and over-exposure can cause dangerous changes to living tissue at a cellular level, the quantity and frequency of X-ray exposure has to be moderated.

### 19.18 X-ray production is somewhat the reverse of photoelectric effect

For photoelectric effect, photons are incident on a metal surface, resulting in the emission of electrons.

In X-ray production, electrons strike a target metal, causing emission of photons, some of which are X-ray photons.

A typical set up for x-ray production is shown below.

A filament is heated up in order to emit electrons.

The electrons gain kinetic energy by accelerating through a large potential difference.

The high-speed electrons strike the target metal and lose their kinetic energy in the form of X-ray photons.

### A typical X-ray spectrum has two components

A typical X-ray spectrum spans a range of wavelengths and has two components, which are:

a _continuous spectrum_

_characteristic peaks_

These correspond to the two ways that a single bombarding electron can lose its kinetic energy when it strikes the target metal.

### X-ray spectrum: The continuous spectrum

The continuous spectrum refers to the shaded portion in the diagram on the right.

In the experimental set up shown on page 25, electrons with very high kinetic energies can penetrate deep into the target metal. When the bombarding electrons come close to, and interact with, the nuclei in the metal target, they lose energy (experiencing slowing down) and emit photons in the X-ray energy range. i.e. X-ray photons. Thus, the continuous spectrum is known as Bremsstrahlung radiation, which stands for "braking radiation" in German.

X-ray photon is produced when electron is decelerated due to its interaction with a nucleus.

e.m. radiation is produced whenever charged particle is accelerated

larger acceleration results in larger photon energy

electrons hitting target have distribution of accelerations

hence distribution of wavelengths

Therefore, there is a continuous distribution of wavelengths.

One important quantity characterising the continuous spectrum is the shortest wavelength, \(\lambda_{\rm min}\), which corresponds to the most energetic X-ray photon being emitted (since \(E=\hbar c\lambda\)). \(\lambda_{\rm min}\) occurs when all the kinetic energy of a single bombarding electron is converted into one X-ray photon.

Electrons are accelerated through potential difference \(V\)\(\Rightarrow\) kinetic energy of electron = \(qV\)\(\Rightarrow\)\(E_{\rm photon}\)\(qV=\hbar c\)\(\lambda_{\rm min}\)

Therefore, \(\lambda_{\rm min}\) depends only the potential difference that is used to accelerate the bombarding electrons. It does not depend on the target metal.

### X-ray spectrum: The characteristic peaks

The characteristic peaks refer to the sharp, distinct peaks which protrude out from the smoothly-changing continuous spectrum.

They result from the similar mechanism as _emission spectra_: orbital electrons transit from a higher energy level to a lower energy level in the atom of the target metal, giving out energy in the form of photons in the process. The difference however lies in the electrons involved in both processes.

The electrons involved in X-ray production are those closest to the nucleus while the electrons involved in producing emission spectra are valence electrons. In particular, the high-speed electrons from an external source strike the electrons in the inner-most shell (K-shell), sometimes transferring enough energy to cause the ejection of these electrons from the K-shell, thereby leaving vacancies in K-shell. The electrons in the nearby shells (L-shell or M-shell) with higher energies deexcite to fill up the vacancies in the K-shell, in the process releasing X-ray photons. The energy of each X-ray photon released is exactly equal the energy difference between the 2 electron shells.

The electron shells of each type of metallic atoms have fixed energies. The X-ray photons thus also have fixed energy values, and thereby wavelengths that are _unique_ to each type of target metal. The identity of metals can be found this way.

Note that the kinetic energy of the bombarding electrons must be enough to remove the K shell electrons (to infinity) before the characteristic peak can be produced. This energy needed is greater than the energies corresponding to either of the characteristic peaks.

### 19.22 X-ray notation: Naming the characteristic peaks

When a bombarding electron strikes the target metal, an innermost-shell (K shell) electron may be ejected. An electron in the next higher shell (L shell) can emit an X-ray photon and transit down into the K shell to fill the vacancy.

* The vacancy is first formed in the K shell, so the X-ray characteristic peak is labelled K.
* If the de-excitation comes from the L shell, the X-ray photon contributes to the K\({}_{\alpha}\) peak.
* If the de-excitation comes from the M shell, the X-ray photon contributes to the K\({}_{\beta}\) peak.

To compare the K\({}_{\alpha}\)and K\({}_{\beta}\)peaks,

* The energy difference between M shell and K shell is larger than that between L shell and K shell. So, the X-ray photons corresponding to the K\({}_{\beta}\)peak is of higher energy (hence shorter wavelength) than those corresponding to the K\({}_{\alpha}\) peak (lower energy, hence longer wavelength).
* The L shell is closer to the K shell, hence electrons in L shell have a higher probability (than those in M shell) of deexciting to fill the vacancies in K shell. Hence, the K\({}_{\alpha}\)peak is higher in intensity than the K\({}_{\beta}\)peak.

The external high-speed electrons can also happen to strike and remove the electrons in the L shell. M shell and N shell electrons will then deexcite to fill the vacancies in L shell, emitting X-ray photons in the process. These processes give rise to the L\({}_{\alpha}\) and L\({}_{\beta}\) peaks.

**Example 16**

An X-ray tube operates at 200 kV with a tungsten target metal. The target metal is then replaced with an molybdenum version. Which of the following graphs correctly shows the possible spectra plotted on the same axis?

**Example 17**

The energy of an incoming photon required to remove a K-shell electron in Uranium is 115.9 keV. If the K\({}_{\alpha}\) wavelength is 0.126 A, find the wavelength of an incoming photon needed to remove an electron from L-shell completely. 1A = 1 x 10\({}^{-10}\) m.

\[E_{\text{X-ray photon emitted}} = \hbar f=\frac{\hbar c}{\lambda}\] \[= \frac{\left(6.63\times 10^{-34}\right)\left(3\times 10^{8} \right)}{0.126\times 10^{-10}}\] \[= 1.58\times 10^{-14}\text{ J = 98.66 keV}\] \[E_{\text{L}\rightarrow\infty} = 115.9-98.66=17.24\text{ keV}\] \[E_{\text{required}} = \hbar f=\frac{\hbar c}{\lambda}\] \[\lambda_{\text{required}} = \frac{\hbar c}{E_{\text{required}}}=\frac{\left(6.63\times 10^{-34} \right)\left(3\times 10^{8}\right)}{\left(17.24\times 10^{3}\right)\left(1.6 \times 10^{-19}\right)}\] \[= 7.21\times 10^{-11}\text{ m}\]* Calculate the difference in the energy levels of the K and M shells of the target material. Energy level difference between K and M shells is the photon energy corresponding to \(K_{\theta}\). \[\Delta E = \left|E_{\text{K}}-E_{\text{M}}\right|\] \[= E_{\text{photon}}=\frac{hc}{\lambda}\] \[= \frac{\left(6.63\times 10^{-34}\right)\left(3\times 10^{8}\right) }{0.06\times 10^{-9}}\] \[= 3.32\times 10^{-15}\text{ J}\]
* If the accelerating potential difference is 40 kV, determine the value for \(\lambda_{\text{min}}\). By Principle of Conservation of energy, loss in electric potential energy provides kinetic energy of one bombarding electron, which is then fully converted into one most-energetic photon. \[qV = \frac{hc}{\lambda_{\text{min}}}\] \[\lambda_{\text{min}} = \frac{hc}{qV}=\frac{\left(6.63\times 10^{-34}\right)\left(3 \times 10^{8}\right)}{\left(1.6\times 10^{-19}\right)\left(40\times 10^{3} \right)}\] \[= 3.11\times 10^{-11}\text{ m}=0.0311\text{ nm}\]
* Sketch on the same axes above, the spectrum that will be obtained when the accelerating potential difference is increased.

### 19.23 Wave-particle duality

From the Photoelectric Experiment, we concluded that light can behave like particles. Conversely, electrons, which are normally considered as point-like particles, can display wave-like behaviour. Electron beams can undergo superposition and interference, which are typical wave-like behaviour. Louis de Broglie, a French Physicist, suggested that if light can behave as particles, then electrons and protons, conventionally treated as particles, should in some situations also exhibit wave-like behavior. He was awarded the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1929 for this discovery.

The **de Broglie wavelength** associated with a particle moving with momentum \(p\) is

\[\lambda=\frac{h}{p}\,,\]

where \(h\) is the Planck constant, \(h=6.63\times 10^{-34}\) J s.

The above equation holds for massive particles (electrons, neutrons, etc.) as well as massless particles (photons). For example, the momentum carried by a photon of wavelength \(\lambda\) is given by, according to the equation above, \(p=\frac{h}{\lambda}\). _Photons do not have mass, but can carry momentum!_

A lightweight spacecraft can be propelled via a photon sail by the Sun. As photons bounce off an ultra-thin reflective sail, radiation pressure acts across the surface area of the sail, giving thrust.

A photon sail has an area of 32 m\({}^{2}\) and exhibits perfect reflectance. Determine the magnitude of thrust if energy from the Sun reaches the sail perpendicularly with a total intensity of 1400 Wm\({}^{2}\).

Light from the Sun has many different frequencies, and so there is a wide range of photons each of different photon energies.

\[\begin{split}\mathbf{E}_{\text{1 photon}}&=\hbar t= \frac{\hbar c}{\lambda}\\ &=\left(\frac{h}{\lambda}\right)c=p_{\text{1 photon}}c\end{split}\]

For perfect reflectance, the change in momentum for each photon is:

\[\begin{split}\left|\Delta p\right|=\left|p_{\text{ final}}-p_{\text{trial}}\right|=\left|2p\right|\end{split}\]

By Newton's 2\({}^{\text{nd}}\) Law,

\[\begin{split}\left|F_{\text{net}}\right|&=\left| \frac{dp_{\text{total}}}{dt}\right|=\left|N_{\text{photons}}\left(\frac{2p_{ \text{1 photon}}}{t}\right)\right|\\ &=\left(\frac{2}{t}\right)\left(\frac{N_{\text{photon}}E_{ \text{1 photon}}}{c}\right)=\left(\frac{2}{t}\right)\left(\frac{E_{\text{ total}}}{c}\right)\\ &=\left(\frac{2}{c}\right)\left(\frac{E_{\text{total}}}{t}\right) =\left(\frac{2}{c}\right)\left(I(\text{Area}_{\text{sat}})\right)\\ &=\left(\frac{2}{3\times 10^{8}}\right)\left(1400\right)\left(3 2\right)\\ &=2.99\times 10^{-4}\text{ N}\approx 30\text{ mN}\end{split}\]

By Newton's 3\({}^{\text{rd}}\) Law, force by photons on sail = force by sail on photons = 30 mN

**Example 20**

Find the de Broglie wavelength associated with

(i) Mr Lim (mass = 100 kg) sprinting with speed = 10 ms-1.

(ii) an electron (mass = 9.11 \(\times\) 10\({}^{-31}\) kg) accelerated through 30 V from rest.

(i)

By Principle of Conservation of Energy,

loss in EPE = gain in KE

\(qV=\frac{\rho^{2}}{2m_{\mathrm{e}}}\)

\(p_{\mathrm{electron}}=\sqrt{2m_{\mathrm{e}}qV}\)

\(\lambda_{\mathrm{electron}}=\frac{h}{\rho_{\mathrm{electron}}}=\frac{h}{ \sqrt{2m_{\mathrm{e}}qV}}\)

\(=\frac{6.63\times 10^{-34}}{\sqrt{2(9.11\times 10^{-31})(1.6\times 10^{-19})(30)}}\)

**Notes**: "Everyday" masses (such as humans and bullets) have extremely small de Broglie wavelengths - the wave-like behaviour is effectively not observable.

Consequently, "everyday" masses cannot undergo appreciable diffraction because the associated wavelengths are orders of magnitude smaller than dimensions of everyday life.

By choosing an appropriate accelerating potential, the de Broglie wavelength of electrons can be made to be in the X-ray region, which is of the same order of magnitude as the inter-atomic spacing in solid crystals, and a noticeable diffraction pattern can be observed if X-ray is incident on solid crystals. Therefore, it is very common to study crystals using X-rays or electron beams.

### Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle

If a measurement of position is made with uncertainty \(\Delta x\) and a simultaneous measurement of momentum is made with uncertainty \(\Delta p\). The product of the two uncertainties can never be smaller than the Planck constant

\(\Delta p\Delta x\geq h\)

The uncertainty principle limits the precision that complementary quantities (such as position along \(x\)-axis and the momentum in the \(x\) direction) can have. For example, if we know very well the position along the \(x\)-axis of a particle (\(\Delta x\) is very small), then we cannot be very certain what momentum in the \(x\)-direction the particle possesses, since \(\Delta p\approx h/\Delta x\) is huge if \(\Delta x\) is very small. Note that this has nothing to do with the precision of the apparatus/method used to perform the measurements. The uncertainty principle is a fundamental principle of nature. However, we may still know \(p_{\gamma}\) or \(p_{z}\) very well, even if we know the \(x\) position very well, since the uncertainty principle applies only to position and momentum along the same direction.

**Example 21**

For an electron passing through a single slit, the uncertainty in its position \(\Delta y\) and the uncertainty in its momentum \(\Delta p\) are related by \(\Delta p\Delta y\geq h\). Which diagram shows the positions where in the equation above are defined correctly?

Most will find the idea for \(\Delta y\) intuitive - that the slit width where the electron could have been anywhere in between. For momentum, the electrons initially have momentum in the \(x\) direction. After passing through the slit, the electrons spread out in the \(y\) direction (up/down). The uncertainty therefore is their momentum in \(y\) direction.
