\begin{tabular}{c c c} Chromosome & \(\bullet\) & Chromosome is a compact structure visible in the nucleus during cell division and it is made up of DNA \\  & \(\bullet\) & The place on the chromosome where the gene is located is called the gene locus. \\ Dominant & \(\bullet\) & A dominant allele is the allele that is always expressed in the phenotype, no matter under \\  & homozygous or heterozygous condition. \\  & \(\bullet\) & A recessive allele is the allele that is only expressed under homozygous recessive condition. \\  & \(\bullet\) & When both alleles have an equal effect on the phenotype of the offspring. \\  & \(\bullet\) & Both alleles are expressed in the phenotype. \\  & \(\bullet\) & When organisms have two identical alleles of a particular gene. Allele can be either both dominant or both recessive. \\  & \(\bullet\) & When organisms have two different alleles of a particular gene. \\  & \(\bullet\) & The genetic makeup of an organism. \\  & \(\bullet\) & An organism's genotype is homozygous for a trait if the two alleles controlling the trait are identical, \\  & \(\bullet\) & heterozygous for a trait if the alleles controlling the trait are different. \\  & \(\bullet\) & Phenotype refers to the observable, physical traits that are determined by the genotype. \\ \end{tabular}

3 purple flower: 1 white flower is the expected ratios, but the actual observed ratio can be different especially when there are small numbers of progeny, because

Fertilisation of the ova and sperms is a random event.

Therefore the expected ratios are only based on chance and probabilities.

With small number of offspring, the observed ratios often differ from expected ratios. But, with large number of offspring (large sample size), the observed ratios will be closer to expected ratios.

(g) describe the determination of sex in humans - XX and XY chromosomes

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:15]

(h) describe mutation as a change in the sequence of a gene such as in sickle cell anaemia, or in the chromosome number, such as the 47 chromosomes in the condition known as Down syndrome (i) name ionising radiation (e.g. X-ray) and chemical mutagens as factors which may increase the rate of mutation (j) distinguish between continuous and discontinuous variation and give examples of each (k) State that variation and competition lead to differential survival of, and reproduction by, those organisms best fitted to the environment (l) give examples of environmental factors that act as forces of natural selection (m) explain the role of natural selection as a possible mechanism for evolution which is a gradual change in the inheritable characteristics of a population over time
