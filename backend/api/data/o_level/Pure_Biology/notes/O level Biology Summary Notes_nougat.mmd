## Chapter 3 Movement of Substances

Define diffusion, osmosis and active transport.

Diffusion is the net movement of particles in solid, liquid or gaseous state, down a concentration gradient without the need of energy(passive). (_No need membrane_)

Osmosis is the net movement of water molecules from a region of higher water potential to a region of lower water potential, through a partially permeable membrane. (_No need energy_)

Active transport is a process in which energy from cellular respiration is used to move particles against a concentration gradient across a partially permeable membrane. (_only in living cells_)

Describe the importance of diffusion in nutrient uptake and gaseous exchange in plants and humans.

Nutrient uptake in Humans

Example: Diffusion allows digested food substances likeglucose amino acids to absorbed from small intestine into blood capillaries (_Both Active Transport and Diffusion_ can occur there)

Gaseous exchange in Humans

Diffusion of oxygen from alveolar air space intoblood capillaries through the alveolar walls allows oxygen to be transported to all parts of the body. Diffusion of carbon dioxide from respiring cells into the blood and _through_ the alveolar walls allows removal of carbon dioxide from the body.

Gaseous exchange in Plants

Diffusion of water vapour _out of_ the stomata allows transpiration to occur.

Transpiration is important as it draws water and mineral salts from the roots to the stem to the leaf. Latent heat of vapourisation is removed during the evaporation of water from the cells in the leaves, cooling the plant. It also helps to keep the plant cells turigl, maintaining the shape of soft tissues in plants.

Describe the importance of active transport as in ion uptake by root hairs and uptake of glucose by cells in the viilli.

**Ion uptake by root hairs**

The root hair cells absorb ions against a concentration gradient. This lowers the water potential of the sap in the root hair cell. Thus water from the soil solution enters the root hair cell by osmosis. The entry of water then dilutes the sap and the sap of the root hair cell now has a higher water potential than the inner cells. Hence water passes by osmosis from the root hair cell into the adjacent inner cell. This process continues until water enters the root xylem vessels and moves up the plant.

Glucose uptake by cells in viilli

Glucose and amino acids are absorbed by active transport when there is a lower concentration of them in the lumen of the small intestine than in the blood capillaries.

State the similarities and differences between diffusion and osmosis.

Similarities & Differences

Both involve the movement of _molecules_

down a concentration gradient

Both are passive processes in which no

Diffusion does not require a membrane

whereas osmosis only takes place

across a partially permeable membrane

State the differences between active transport and diffusion

Active transport & Diffusion

Movement of particles against a

concentration gradient.

Energy is required.

Occurs only in living cells

Occurs in living and non living things.

Requires partially permeable membrane

Does not require partially permeable

membrane

State the difference between **hypotonic**, **hypertonic** and **isotonic** solutions and use

these terms in appropriate situations.Note: for ANIMAL systems only

Hypotonic solution has a lower concentration with respect to the cell.

Hypotonic solution has a higher concentration with respect to the cell.

Isotonic solution has the same concentration with respect to the cell.

Describe fully, what happens when:

a) A plant cell is placed in a solution of higher **water potential**

Water enters the plant cell by osmosis across a partially permeable membrane as

surrounding solution has a higher water potential than the cell sap of the plant.

_Vacuole increases in size_ and pushes the cell contents against the cellulose

cell wall.

Water exerts a turgor pressure onto the cellulose cell wall preventing cell from

bursting.

Plant cell enlarges and becomes turigl.

\({}^{\star}\)This is important for a seedling to emerge from the soil.

b) A plant cell is placed in a solution of **lower water potential**

Water moves out of the plant cell by osmosis across a partially permeable

membrane as surrounding solution has a lower water potential than the

cell sap of the plant.

_Vacuole decreases in size_ and cell contents shrink away. Cell membrane

detaches itself from the cellulose cell wall.

The plant cell decreases in size and becomes plasmolysed if the surrounding solution is highly concentrated. Plant cell/tissue turns flaccid.

c) An animal cell is placed in a **hypotonic** solution

Water enters the animal cell by osmosis down a water potential gradient across a partially permeable membrane as surrounding solution has a higher water potential.

Animal cell expands and swells up.

The cell bursts due to absence of cell wall.

d) An animal cell is placed in a **hypertonic** solution

Water moves out of the animal cell by osmosis down a water potential gradient

across a partially permeable membrane as surrounding solution has a lower water potential.

Animal cell shrinks in size and **membrane** forms spikes. The cell

becomes crenated.

What is **turgor** pressure and what are the advantages of it?

Turgor pressure is the water pressure that is exerted onto the cell wall which causes

the cell to expand _without bursting_.

Advantages

Turgor pressure helps to keep plant cells firm and makes the plant stay upright.

State the functions of carbohydrates.

1. As a substrate for _respiration( a process that requires enzymes)_ to provide energy for cell activities.

2. For the formation of _nucleic acids_, for example, DNA.

3. To synthesise _lubricants_, for example, mucus, which consists of a carbohydrate and a protein.

4. To be _converted_ into other organic compounds such as amino acids and fats. (Happens in plants and animals)

5. To form _supporting structures_ for example cell walls in plants.

6. To synthesise _nectar_ in some flowers.

List and differentiate between the three main categories of carbohydrates.

1. Monosaccharides (Single Sugars)

Glucose, Fructose, Galactose

2. Disaccharides (Double Sugars)

Maltose (malt sugar), Sucrose (cane sugar - plants only), Lactose (milk sugar -

found in milk of all mammals)

3. Polysaccharides (Complex Carbohydrates)

Starch, Glycogen, Cellulose

Conclude the amount of reducing sugar present with respect to the colour of the

precipitate after a Benedict's test.(Note: sucrose is NON-reducing)

Green - Traces of reducing sugar

Yellow or orange precipitate - Moderate amount of reducing sugar

Brick-red or orange-red precipitate - Large amount of reducing sugar

Blue - Reducing sugars absent

List the steps of Benedict's Test.

\({}^{*}\)If sample is a solid, mash up, add water, decant and retrieve the solution.

1. Add \(2cm^{3}\) of Benedict's Solution to \(2cm^{3}\) of the solution. Shake.

2. Leave the test tube in a beaker of boiling water for 5 minutes.

3. Observe for a colour change.

Identify where each polysaccharide; starch, glycogen and cellulose is found in plants

and animals.

Starch -stored as starch granules in leaves and roots.

Glycogen - found in the liver and muscles of animals.

Cellulose - found in the cell wall of plant cellsList down reasons why glycogen and starch are used as _storage materials_.

Molecules of starch and glycogen are **Compact and tightly coiled** so they occupy less space than all the individual glucose molecules that make up a glycogen or starch molecule.

They can be easily Hydrolysed to glucose when needed for example in tissue respiration.

They are Insoluble in water so they do not change the water potential in cells (to prevent cells from creating)

They are Large molecules which cannot diffuse through cell membranes so they will not be lost from the cell.

**State** that large molecules are synthesised from smaller basic units.

Large molecules are synthesised from smaller basic units during condensation.

Condensation is a chemical reaction in which \(2\) smaller, simpler molecules are joined together to form a larger, _complex_ molecule with the removal of _1 water molecule_.

_Note: Hydrolysis is a chemical reaction in which 1 water molecule is used to break down a larger, complex molecule into 2 smaller, simpler molecules_.

Carbon, Hydrogen and Oxygen, with _lesser_ oxygen in proportion to hydrogen.

List the steps of **ethanol emulsion test** and state conclusions for the observations.

*If sample is a solid, mash up, decant after adding \(2cm^{3}\) of _ethanol_ and retrieve the solution.

1. Add \(2cm^{3}\) of water and shake.

Presence of fat produces a white emulsion _and heat is given off_.

State the functions of fats.

1. A source and store of energy when there is insufficient glycogen. Fats would be oxidised to give twice the amount of energy for metabolic reactions.

2. An insulating material in adipose tissues under the skin and around vital organs to prevent excessive heat loss. (Mammals which live in the water tend to lose heat quickly so they have a thick layer of fat beneath the skin to reduce loss of body heat).

3. Solvent for fat-soluble vitamins (A,D,E,K)

4. An essential part of protoplasm, especially in cell membranes.

5. A way to reduce water loss from the skin surface. (Glands in skin secrete an oily substance which forms a thin layer on the skin surface, reducing rate of evaporation of water and thus reducing heat loss from the skin.)

\begin{tabular}{|p{284.5pt}|} \hline Define enzymes. \\ Enzymes are biological catalysts made of protein which speed up(alter) the rate of chemical reactions by lowering the activation energy required to start the reaction without being chemically changed at the end of the reaction. \\ _Note: Enzymes do not participate in the chemical reaction, they ACT on substrates_ \\ \hline Define activation energy. \\ It is the minimum energy required for a chemical reaction to proceed/start. \\ \hline \end{tabular}

State the characteristics of enzymes.

Remains chemically unchanged

Speed up chemical reactions

Specific : lock and key hypothesis

Required in small amounts

Affected by temperature

Affected by pH

Explain enzymes' specificity in terms of lock and key hypothesis.

Enzyme reactions are specific as _enzymes act on a specific substrate_. They have a unique active site which can only _bind to a specific substrate_ which has a complementary shape. The enzyme is the lock and the substrate is the key. Thus the substrate binds to the enzyme forming an enzyme-substrate complex.

Explain how enzymes **speed up the rate of reaction** in terms of activation energy.

Enzymes lower the activation energy required to start a reaction thus the reaction proceeds faster.

Explain how enzymes are affected by temperature in terms of kinetic energy. At low temperature, enzymes are less active and both enzyme and substrate have low KE and thus less effective collisions and decrease in rate of enzyme activity/less products formed per unit time.

As temperature increases, enzymatic activity doubles for every \(10^{0}\)C._(note: cannot be used to explain all questions on enzymes)_

Enzyme and substrate have more KE therefore _effective_ collisions are more frequent and rate of formation of enzyme-substrate complexes increases and thus rate of enzyme activity increases/more products formed per unit time.

After optimum temperature, enzyme activity decreases. The enzyme molecule vibrates violently and hydrogen bonds within it are broken. The enzyme loses its three-dimensional shape as well as its active site. Hence, the enzyme becomes denatured.

Explain how pH affects enzymatic reactions. Different enzymes have different optimum pH. At this pH, enzymatic reaction is at its highest rate. The enzyme will decrease in activity when the pH environment is lower or higher than the optimum pH of the enzyme. However, when the pH environment differs greatly from the enzyme's optimum pH, many weak hydrogen bonds within the enzyme are destroyed, hence the enzyme is denatured.

State an example of a reversible reaction catalysed by an enzyme.

1. Carbonic anhydrase catalyses the reversible reaction between water and carbon dioxide to form carbonic acid (note: this is not hydrolysis)

Define ingestion, digestion, absorption and assimilation and state the differences between them.

Ingestion: Food is taken into the alimentary canal via the mouth into the body.

Digestion: Process whereby Large. Insoluble. Complex: molecules of food is broken down into smaller, soluble, simpler molecules to be absorbed into the _circulatory_ system. Digestion takes place in the mouth stomaeh and small intestine.

1) Physical digestion: breaks/large-food pieces up into smaller pieces to increase the surface area to volume ratio for digestive enzymes to work on.

ii) Chemical digestion breaks down large, complex food _molecules_ down into smaller, simpler _molecules_ through the action of enzymes.

Absorption: Process whereby digested food: substances like simple sugars and amino acids move into the blood capillaries via diffusion and active transport from the lumen of the small intestine to the bloodstream _through_ the wall of small intestine. fatty acids and glycerol are absorbed into the lateral.

Assimilation: Distribution and use of the products of digestion as an energy source and conversion into other nutrients needed for growth and repair of body parts.

Describe and differentiate between physical and chemical digestion.

Physical digestion, like mastication of food in mouth, breaks up large food pieces into smaller pieces to increase surface area to volume ratio for more rapid action of digestive enzymes to work on.

BENEFITS OF CHEWING

-

Chewing helps to physically digest: the food into smaller pieces so that it increases surface area to volume ratio for more rapid action of digestive enzymes and to facilitate swallowing, preventing choking.

-
Chewing allows food to be homogenously mixed up with saliva to be at a suitable pH throughout for enzyme action.

-
Through chewing, food pieces get mixed well with enzymes like amylase in saliva so that starch can be hydrolys faster.

-
Chewing helps to allow mucus and water in saliva to softenas well as moisten the food for the tongue to roll it into food boil which allows for easier swallowing down the pharynx into the rest of the alimentary canal.

Chemical digestion breaks complex food substances down into simpler molecules through the action of enzymes. Example: Hydrolysis of starch into maltose due to the action of amylase.

1. During chemical digestion, enzymes are involved but during physical digestion, enzymes are not involved.
2. During chemical digestion, new compounds are formed due to the hydrolysis of larger _molecules_, but during physical digestion, compounds of food molecules remain the same.

When blood glucose levels are higher than normal:

Pancreas secretes insulin into the bloodstream, insulin travels to the liver and

STIMUATES the conversion of EXCESS glucose into glycogen.

When blood glucose levels are lower than normal:

Pancreas secretes glucagon into the bloodstream, glucose travels to the liver and

STIMUATES the conversion of glycogen to glucose.

State the role of liver.

1. Liver produces Bile (formed from breakdown of Haemoglobin too) which

emulsifies fats to increase rate of digestion of fat by lipase. Fat metabolism.

lapse fat through the liver. Amino groups are removed and

converted to urea. This process is called deAimation. Urea is then excreted in

urine. Premains of the deaminated amino acids (carbon residue) are converted to

glucose which in excess is converted to glycogen.

3. Harmful substances may be absorbed into blood from gut. Harmful substancesmade harmless in the process called Detoxidation: Alcohol is also broken down in the liver into harmless products like water and carbon dioxide.

catalase

Hydrogen peroxide water + oxygen

4. Liver synthesizes Plasma proteins from amino acids, examples are fibrinogen for blood clotting.

5. Red blood cells that are worn out are destroyed in the spleen (a gland near the liver). The haemoglobin is brought to the liver: The liver breaks down the Haemoglobin and stores the Iron released in the process.

6. Liver plays a role in carbohydrate metabolism hence regulating blood Glucose levels. If _blood glucose level is lower than normal_, glycogen is converted to glucose by liver cells (stimulated by glucagon). If there is excess glucose, excess glucose converted to glycogen by liver cells (stimulated by insulin).

7. Stores fast soluble vitamins A & D.

Remember the acronym: BAD PIGS

Note: Excess Glucose is converted to fats.

Explain detoxification of alcohol in the liver.

It is the process of converting harmful substances into harmless products.

Enzyme alcohol dehydrogenase converts alcohol into acetaldehyde, Acetaldehyde is used as a source of energy in cells.

Describe the effects of excessive alcohol consumption.

Alcohol stimulates acid secretion in the stomach and excess acid increases the risk of gastric ulcers:

Prolonged alcohol abuse may lead to liver cirrhosis whereby the liver cells are destroyed and replaced with fibrous tissue.

Blending in the liver occurs for liver cirrhosis resulting in liver failure and subsequently death.

Alcohol is a depressant and it slows down some brain functions.

Under the influence of alcohol a person has reduction in self-control.

Observable effects of intoxication are slurred speech, blurred vision and poor

muscular co-ordination. Judgement deteriorates and during driving, underestimates

speed, hence driving faster with slower reactions.

State the experiments that test:

- How presence of starch is tested in leaves

- How to find out whether sunlight is necessary for photosynthesis

- How we can find out whether chlorophyll is necessary for photosynthesis

- How we can find out whether carbon dioxide is necessary for photosynthesis

- How we can find out what gas is given off during photosynthesis

- How we can investigate the effect of different light intensities on the rate of photosynthesis

I. **How the presence of starch is tested in leaves**

Remove a green leaf from a plant that has been exposed to sunlight for a few hours and place it in boiling water for 2 minutes. Remove leaf, soak in alcohol, remove and soak in water again. Spread it evenly on a white tile and add a few drops of iodine to the leaf. (On: Why bolt? To destroy cell membrane so that alcohol can reach chloroplast and decolourise the leaf)

II. **How to find out whether sunlight is necessary for photosynthesis**

De-starch a potted plant by placing it in the dark for 2 days and sandwich a leaf

that's attached to the plant between two pieces of black paper. Each paper has a certain pattern cut out to allow the leaf in cut out area receive sunlight. Place plant in strong sunlight. Remove leaf and test for starch - refer to ci.

III. **How we can find out whether chlorophyll is necessary for photosynthesis**

Remove a leaf from a de-starched plant that was left in the dark for 2 days with

variegated leaves and make a drawing of distribution of green parts. Then expose it

to strong sunlight for a few hours. Decolorize leaf and test for starch. Compare

drawing of green parts on leaf and the distribution of blue-black color.

**IV. How we can find out carbon dioxide is necessary for photosynthesis**

De-starch 2 potted plants by placing them in the dark for 2 days. Place one pot in a bell jar with no supply of carbon dioxide by adding a beaker filled with potassium hydroxide solution. Place the other in a bell jar with carbon dioxide supply in the form of sodium carbonate. Both jars are left in strong sunlight for a few hours. Remove a leaf from each plant and test for starch.

**v. How we can find out what gas is given off during photosynthesis**

In a beaker full of water, place some freshwater plants in an inverted filter funnel. Place a test tube filled with water over the filter funnel. Place apparatus in strong sunlight for a few hours until the test tube is half filled with the gas produced.

Remove the test tube by placing a thumb over its mouth. Test gas with a glowing splint. (Glowing splint would rekindle, gas is oxygen.)

Fate of Glucose.

i) Used immediately as glucose for cellular respiration, or to form cellulose cell walls

ii) Excess glucose can also be converted to sucrose for transport to other storage organs so it will not diffuse out of phloem sieve tube elements to be stored as starch in stem and roots.

iii) In daylight, excess glucose converted to starch in leaves to be stored in chloroplast temporarily. At night, starch is reconverted by enzymes. First, into maltose by:diatase, then to glucose. Converted sucrose for transport.

iv)Reacts with nitrates to form amino acids which condense to form proteins to build new protoplasm;

v) Excess amino acids are transported to other parts of plant especially growing regions for the synthesis of new protoplasm.

vi)Forms fats for storage in seeds, usage in cellular respiration and synthesis of new protoplasm I.e cell membranes.

Discuss light intensity, carbon dioxide concentration and temperature as limiting factors on the rate of photosynthesis.

When it is a limiting factor, as light intensity increases, rate of photosynthesis increases. **More** light energy can be trapped and converted to chemical energy by chlorophyll. It increases until it reaches light **saturation point**, where it is no longer a **limiting factor** and increasing the light intensity would not increase rate of photosynthesis and the rate levels off. CO2 or temperature could be a limiting factor.

When carbon dioxide concentration is a limiting factor, as concentration increases rate of photosynthesis increases. More carbon dioxide can be reduced by hydrogen ions to form carbohydrates during photosynthesis i.e. more substrates (CO\({}_{2}\)) can be converted by enzymes. When it reaches a saturation point, it is no longer a limiting factor and increasing the concentration would not increase rate of photosynthesis and the rate levels off.

When temperature is a limiting factor, rate of photosynthesis increases as temperature increases. Kinetic energy increases and there is faster molecular movement of enzymes and substrates therefore increasing no. of effective collisions. Photosynthesis is enzyme-controlled so enzymes become more active as temperature increases. More substrates (CO\({}_{2}\)) can be converted by enzymes. Rate of photosynthesis is at maximum at optimum temperature and beyond optimum temperature, rate of photosynthesis steeply falls to zero. Extremely high temperatures denature the enzymes thus reactions cannot occur, decreasing the rate of photosynthesis.

Lf: A factor that directly affects the rate at which a process (e.g. chemical reaction) occurs if its quantity is changed

## Chapter 8 Transport in Humans

Describe the main functions of blood.

1. Acts as a transport medium transporting varying substances from one part of the body to another.
2. It protects the body against disease causing organisms (pathogens)
3. Blood clotting at wounds prevents excessive loss of blood. It seals the wound and prevents entry of microorganisms into the bloodstream.

Understand the importance of a double circulation.

1. Allow blood pressure in lungs (pulmonary circulation) to be low so that there is sufficient time for exchange of gases to take place in lungs.
2. Allow blood pressure going into systemic circulation (rest of body) to be high so that oxygenated blood is distributed rapidly to other organs and extremities.
3. Ensures oxygen level in blood is high enough to maintain metabolic/respiration rate.

Describe the difference between pulmonary and systemic circulation.

For pulmonary, blood leaves from the **right side of the heart** but for systemic, it leaves from the left side of the heart.

For pulmonary, blood leaving heart is deoxygenated but for systemic, blood leaving the heart is oxygenated.

For pulmonary, blood leaving the heart goes to the **lungs** but for systemic, blood leaving the heart goes to the rest of the body.

For pulmonary, **length of circuit** is shorter but for systemic, length of circuit is longer.

For pulmonary, **pressure** is lower but for systemic, pressure is higher.

How do humans adapt to living at high altitudes?

At high altitudes, concentration of oxygen in the atmosphere is low. Body cannot absorb sufficient oxygen to maintain its metabolic rate. Hence body needs to produce more red blood cells to compensate for lower concentration of oxygen (acclimatization). Increasing the proportion of red blood cells also increases the haemoglobin content per unit volume of blood. This means that more oxygen can be absorbed and be transported to the tissue cells per unit time. Thus having a larger number of red blood cells in their bodies over time.

Long distance runners train at high altitudes for several months as it increases the amount of haemoglobin in their blood. Hence when they run at lower altitudes, their bodies are able to transport oxygen at a higher rate, thus able to run for longer periods.

Describe the process of blood clotting and components involved.

Compared tissue and platelets release thrombokinase.

Thrombokinase, together with calcium ions, converts inactive protracorship in the plasma to active thrombob.

Thrombin then catalyses the conversion of solute fibrinogen to insoluble fibrin threads which forms a mesh to entangle blood cells to form a clot.

**to Close**, preventing a backflow of blood into the atria. This produces a loud 'lub' sound. When pressure in the contracting ventricles is higher than pressure in the aorta and pulmonary artery, the semi lunar valves in the pulmonary and aortic arches are forced **Open**. Blood flows from the left and right ventricle into the aorta and pulmonary artery respectively. As the ventricles contract the atria relax and receives blood.

The ventricles then relax. The **drop in pressure in the ventricles lower than arteries** causes the semi lunar valves to **Close**, producing a soft 'dub' sound. This prevents the backflow of blood into the ventricles. The drop in pressure in the ventricles causes the bicuspid and tricuspid valves to **Open** as atria contracts and pressure is higher than the ventricles.

Describe the process of the transfer of materials from blood to tissue cells.

Dissolved food substances and oxygen diffuse from the blood in blood capillaries into the tissue fluid then into the cells. Tissue fluid is a colorless liquid that has lesser soluble proteins than plasma. All tissue cells are bathed with tissue fluid which carries substances in solution between the tissue cells and blood capillaries.

(Phagocytes often move out of blood vessels as they can change their shape to squeeze through capillary walls)

At arterial end of the capillaries where blood pressure is higher, blood plasma is forced out (without its proteins) through the capillary walls into intercellular spaces as tissue fluid. Body cells would absorb oxygen and nutrients from tissue fluid.

At venous end, blood pressure is lower, tissue fluid enters the blood capillary along with waste products.
Identify the ABO blood groups and discuss the results when different blood groups are mixed together.

\begin{tabular}{|p{142.3pt}|p{142.3pt}|} \hline Describe coronary heart disease. \\ \hline It occurs when coronary arteries become narrowed, thus oxygen and nutrients is supplied to the heart muscles at a lower rate. Coronary arteries are narrowed by lipids (fat and cholesterol) carried by the blood which get deposited on the inner walls of coronary arteries, making them narrower (atherosclerosis). When blood pressure gets too high and plaque rupture, blood clots and arteries are completely blocked, supply of blood to heart muscles is stopped (coronary occlusion). Atherosclerosis would cause angina, continuous pain in the chest. Coronary occlusion causes heart attacks, which can occur without pain.

Why doctors advice patients with atrial septal defect to not engage in vigorous exercise

The hole in the septum of the heart allows oxygenated blood from the left atrium and deoxygenated blood in the right atrium to mix. This lowers the concentration of oxygen carried by the blood pumped out by the left side of the heart and subsequently pumped to the rest of the body via the aorta. With less oxygen carried by the blood to the rest of the body, the heart will have to work harder to supply the body oxygen it needs when it engages in vigorous sports. This will strain the heart and cause it to fail.

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:31]

Describe the process of the entry of water, in terms of water potential from the soil to xylem.

The thin film of liquid surrounding each soil particle is a dilute solution of mineral salts.

The sap in the root hair cell is relatively concentrated solution of sugars and various salts. Thus the sap has a lower water potential than the soil solution.

The 2 solutions are separated by a partially permeable cell membrane of the root hair cell. Water enters the root by osmosis.

The entry of water dilutes the sap

The sap of the root hair cell now has a higher water potential than that of the inner cell. Hence water passes by osmosis from the root hair cell into the inner cell.

Similarly water is continuously passed into the next cell until the water enters the root xylem vessel (_lateral movement_) and moves up the plant (_vertical movement_).

Importance of root pressure.

The living cells around the xylem vessels in the root use active transport to pump ions into the xylem vessel. This lowers water potential in the xylem vessels. Water then move by osmosis from the living cells into the xylem vessels and flow upwards.

Define transpiration.

Transpiration is the loss of water vapour from aerial parts of a plant, especially through the stomata of the leaves.

Describe the movement of water from the leaf to the air outside.

Water moves out of the mesophyll cells via osmosis to form a thin film of moisture over the surface.

Water evaporates from the thin film of moisture and moves into the intercellular air.

spaces
Water vapour accumulates in the large air spaces near the stomata.

Water vapour then diffuses through the stomata to the anter at outside the leaf.

As water moves out of the mesophyll cells and evaporates from the thin film of moisture, water potential of the cell sap decreases. The mesophyll cells begin to absorb water by osmosis from the cells deeper inside the leaf. The cells in turn remove water from the xylem vessels.

This suction force pulls the whole column of water up the xylem vessels.

Describe the movement of carbon dioxide from the atmospheric air to the leaf.

Photosynthesis concentration of carbon dioxide in the cytoplasm of mesophyll cells

Thin film of moisture surrounding mesophyll cells now has a higher concentration of dissolved carbon dioxide than the cytoplasm.

Carbon dioxide diffuses into mesophyll cell cytoplasm.

This \(\downarrow\) concentration of carbon dioxide in the thin film of moisture with respect to carbon dioxide in the intercellular air spaces

Carbon dioxide from intercellular air spaces diffuses and dissolves into the thin film of moisture.

This \(\downarrow\) carbon dioxide concentration in intercellular air spaces with respect to the atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration.

Atmospheric carbon dioxide _diffuses_ into intercellular air spaces through the stomata.

Identify and explain the factors affecting the rate of transpiration.

Humidity of air

Intercellular air spaces in leaf are usually saturated with water vapour. The less

humid the air outside the leaf, the steeper the concentration gradient of water vapour

_between_ the atmosphere and within leaf. Thus rate of transpiration will be higher.

Air movement

Wind blows-away the water vapour accumulated outside the stomata. This maintains

concentration gradient of water vapour _between_ atmosphere and within leaf. The

stronger the air movement, higher the rate of transpiration.

Temperature of air

A rise in temperature increases the rate of evaporation of water, increasing the

concentration of water vapour in the air spaces. Hence, a steep concentration

gradient of water vapour _between_ the atmosphere and within leaf. Thus rate of

 transpiration higher at higher temperatures.

Light intensity

In sunlight, guard cells photosynthesize and become-target. Stomata become wider. This increases the rate of transpiration.

State the importance of transpiration in plants.

1. Transpiration pull draws water and mineral salts from roots to stems and leaves

2. Evaporation of water from cells in leaves removes latent heat of vapourisation.

This cools the plant, preventing it from being scorched by the hot sun.

3. Water transported to the leaves can be used in photosynthesis

4. Keep cells turgid and to replace water lost by cells. Turgid cells keep the leaves spread out widely to trap sunlight for photosynthesis.

State the advantages and disadvantages of writing.

Advantages

When the leaf folds up, SA that is exposed to sunlight is reduced. This causes the

guard cells to become flacoid and stomata to close. Thus rate of transpiration is

reduced.

Disadvantages

Rate of photosynthesis is reduced because water becomes a limiting factor. As the

stomata are closed, the amount of carbon dioxide diffusing into the leaf reduces.

Carbon dioxide becomes a limiting factor, thereby decreasing the rate of

photosynthesis.

Describe the experiments used to study the rate of transpiration.

The shoot to be used in a potometer is cut underwater and the cut end is immersed in water for few hours before use. This allows the shoot to adjust to conditions in the potometer.

A potometer is used to directly measure the rate of absorption of water by the plant and not the rate of transpiration. The amount of water lost is less than the amount of water absorbed because some water is used for photosynthesis.

Measuring the distance moved by the air bubble or volume of water taken up in a fixed amount of time will indicate the rate of water absorption.

We assume that the rate of water absorption is **proportional** to the rate of transpiration, thus the distance moved by the air bubble or volume of water taken up in a fixed amount of time is the rate of water loss in the shoot.

Define translocation.

It is the transport of manufactured food substances such as sucrose and amino acids in the phloem from leaves to other parts of the plant.

Describe at least one experiment used to study translocation.

Using aphids, the long mouthpart of the aphids penetrate the leaf or stem. The body of the aphid is then cut off, leaving the mouthpart in the plant. The liquid that exudes from the cut end of the mouthpart is analysed and found to contain sucrose and amino acids.

The proboscis of the aphid is actually inserted into the phloem sieve tube. This shows that translocation of sucrose and amino acids occurs in plants.

## Chapter 10: Respiration

Identify on diagrams and name the larynx, trachea, bronchi, bronchioles, alveoli and associated capillaries.

State the characteristics of and describe the role of the exchange surface of the alveoli in gaseous exchange.

* Numerous alveoli to increase surface area to volume ratio to increase rate of gaseous exchange (N/A if the diagram in question, if any, only shows 1 alveolus)
* Alveolus surrounded by rich network of blood capillaries for continuous blood flow to maintain a steep concentration gradient between alveolar air space and blood to increase rate of gaseous exchange. (N/A if diagram in question, if any, only shows a single capillary)
* Blood capillaries are one cell thick for higher rate of diffusion of gases over a short distance.
* Thin film of moisture on inner surface of alveolus to allow oxygen to dissolve and diffuse across alveolar wall.
* Wall of alveolus is one cell thick for oxygen and carbon dioxide to diffuse across a short distance for higher rate of gaseous exchange.
* Air spaces continuously filled with air from inhalation to maintain steep concentration gradient between alveolar air space and blood for higher rate of gaseous exchange.

Describe the removal of carbon dioxide from the lungs including the role of the carbonic anhydrase enzyme.

Carbon dioxide produced by cells during cellular respiration.

Most carbon dioxide diffuses into red blood cell

Carbon dioxide reacts with water in the red blood cell to form carbonic acid, a reaction catalyzed by carbonic anhydrase contained within the red blood cell. Carbonic acid dissociates into bicarbonate ion and hydrogen ion. Haemoglobin binds reversibly with most of hydrogen ions to preventing it from acidifying the blood.

Most of the bicarbonate ion diffuses out of the red blood cell and into the plasma to be carried in bloodstream to lungs.

In the lungs, bicarbonate ion diffuses from plasma to red blood cell combining with hydrogen ion released from the haemoglobin to form carbonic acid. Carbonic acid is then converted back to carbon dioxide and water with the help of carbonic anhydrase. Carbon dioxide diffuses to plasma and interstitial fluid. Carbon dioxide diffuses from the interstitial fluid, through the alveolar wall and dissolves in the thin film of moisture on the inner surface of the alveolar wall. The carbon dioxide then diffuses from the thin film of moisture to the alveolar space to be expelled during exhalation.

Describe the transport of oxygen from the lungs to tissue cells.

Oxygen from the inhaled air present in the lungs, dissolves in the thin film of moisture on the inner surfaces of the alveolar walls. Then oxygen then diffuses through the alveolar walls into the interstitial fluid surrounding the alveolar walls. Then oxygen then diffuses through the endothelium into the red blood cells and combine with haemoglobin reversibly to form oxygen. Capillaries containing oxygenated blood merge to form the pulmonary vein.

Pulmonary vein Left atrium Left ventricle Aorta A arteries Arterioles A capillaries surrounding tissue cells

Oxygen then diffuses out of blood capillaries tissue fluid tissue cells.

Describe the role of cilia, gland cells (in the epithelium of the trachea), diaphragm, ribs and intercostals muscles in breathing.

**Gland cells/ Goblet cells in epithelium of trachea secrete mucus to trap dust and bacteria.**

**Cilia on epithelial cells of trachea sweep mucus containing trapped dust and bacteria, up the trachea towards the pharynx to be swallowed into the esophagus or coughed out. (Note:_Cilia DO NOT TRAP_)

During inhalation,

Internal intercostal muscles relax

**External intercostal muscles contract**

Ribcage and stemum swing outwards and upwards

**Diaphragm contracts and flattens**

**Volume of thoracic cavity increases**

**Atmospheric pressure is higher than pressure in lungs, causing air to rush**into lungs. During exhalation, Diaphragm relaxes and arches upwards Internal intercostal muscles contract External intercostal muscles relax Ribcage and sternum swing inwards and downwards. Volume of thoracic cavity decreases Air pressure in lungs now higher than atmospheric pressure, forcing air out of lungs into the atmosphere. Identify the parts of the respiratory system. - Nasal cavity - Pharynx - Larynx - Trachea - C-shaped cartilage - Ciliated cell - Gland cell (in the epithelium of the trachea) - Bronchus - Bronchule - Alveolus - (External and internal) intercostals muscles - Fib cage - Diaphragm

* [12] Deline and state the equation in words and symbols for aerobic respiration in humans. Aerobic respiration is the oxidation of organic food substances (glucose), releasing a large amount of energy, carbon dioxide and water within the cells or tissues of an organism in the presence of oxygen. Glucose + Oxygen \(\xrightarrow{}\) Large amount of energy + Carbon Dioxide + Water \(C_{6}H_{12}O_{6}+O_{2}\)\(CO_{2}+H_{2}O+\) Large amount of energy

* [13] Describe and state the equation in words only for anaerobic respiration in humans. Anaerobic respiration is the breakdown of food substances (glucose) in the absence of oxygen, releasing-less energy than aerobic respiration. Glucose \(\xrightarrow{}\) Lactic acid + Small amount of energy
* [14] Define and state the equation, in words only, for anaerobic respiration in yeast cell. Glucose \(\xrightarrow{}\) Ethanol + Carbon dioxide + Small amount of energy Describe the effects of tobacco smoke and its major toxic components - nicotine, tar and carbon monoxide on health.

Tobacco **smoke** contains:

Nicotine

1. **Addictive drug**

2. Causes the release of **adrenaline** which increases heart rate and blood pressure

3. Makes Blood: **clot** easily hence blocking the coronary artery and leading to heart attack.

Tar

1. **Accumulates** in lungs

2. Contains cancer-causing (carcinogenic) chemicals which induce **uncontrolled cell division** of epithelium thus blocking the air sacs and reducing rate of gaseous externale.

3. **Paralysis** cilia lining the air passages hence dust particles and **bacteria** trapped in the mucus lining the trachea cannot be removed.

Carbon Monoxide

1. Combines irreversibly with greater affinity to haemoglobin to form

carboxyhaemoglobin which reduces capacity of red blood cells to transport oxygen.

Hence concentration of oxygen carried in blood is decreased.

2. Increases the rate of fatty deposits on **inner** arterial wall which increases risk of atherosclerosis.

3. **Damages lining** of blood vessels thus increasing risk of blood clotting in arteries.

Irritants

1. **Paralyses** cilia lining the air passages hence dust particles and bacteria trapped in the mucus lining the trachea cannot be removed, increasing risk of chronic bronchitis and emphysema.

Chronic Bronchitis

Cilia are paralyzed (due to the tar/rritants in cigarette smoke) and mucus containing dust particles and bacteria cannot be removed.

The epithelium lining the airways for example bronchi becomes inflamed due to bacterial infection.

Excessive mucus is secreted by glands (in attempt to remove the dust and bacteria).

Airways become narrow making breathing difficult

Person has to cough persistently to clear airways to breathe. This increases risk of emphysema.

Emphysema

Persistent and **violent** coughing to remove excess mucus destroys the partition

walls between alveoli.

SA to V ratio for gaseous exchange decreases

Lungs become inflated with air, loses elasticity

Breathing becomes difficult and the person wheezes and suffers severe

breathlessness

Concentration of oxygen in blood decreases as rate of oxygen diffusion decreasesIf person has both chronic bronchitis and emphysema, he suffers from chronic obstructive lung diseases.

Describe the effect of lactic acid in muscles during exercise.

Since there is insufficient oxygen taken in to meet energy demands of vigorous muscular contractions, muscles incur an oxygen debt.

Lactic acid concentration builds up slowly in muscles, eventually becoming high enough to cause fatigue.

During period of rest, breathing rate is still high to provide sufficient oxygen to repay oxygen debt. Lactic acid is removed from muscles and transported to liver to be oxidized to release energy. The energy is then used to convert remaining lactic acid into glucose. When lactic acid is used up, oxygen debt is repaid.

Why oxygen used increases as level of exercise increases?

Muscular contraction increases and becomes more vigorous

Muscles use up energy and raise demand for more energy to sustain vigorous

muscular contractions

**More** oxygen is required and in the presence of more glucose will release more

energy to meet demands by higher rate of respiration.

Rate and depth of ventilation increases and volume of air intake per unit time

increases. [2012 TYS 8d]

Volume of blood delivered to tissues per unit time increases as heart beats faster to

allow more oxygen and glucose to be supplied to muscles to undergo higher rate of

aerobic respiration to release more energy for vigorous muscle contractions. [2010 TYS 1cil]

How exercise & breathing rate affects one another.

**More** oxygen used for respiration and carbon dioxide released in the blood.

Carbon dioxide concentration increases and stimulates breathing rate to increase.

## Chapter 11: Excretion

Define excretion and explain the importance of removing nitrogenous and other compounds from the body.

Excretion is the removal of metabolic waste products and toxic materials such as urea, uric acids and creatinine from the body.

Metabolism includes anabolic (building up) and catabolic (breaking down) reactions. Metabolic reactions produce waste products, which may be harmful if they accumulate in the body. They must either be removed or deposited as harmless.

Insoluble substances:

Excretory products

Excretory organ

Describe the structure of nephrons.

**Afferent Arteriole**: A branch of the renal artery leading to the glomerulus, with a larger lumen diameter than efferent arteriole.

**Efferent Arteriole**: Smaller in diameter than afferent arteriole to create a high hydrostatic blood pressure and force the filtrate out.

**Glomerular capillaries** (Glomerulus): Highly coiled Glomerular capillaries to increase SA to V ratio to have more filtrate formed per unit time. Glomerular capillaries more porous than normal capillaries to allow greater permeability for small ions and molecules to pass through faster.

**Ravavment**: _Analytical_** **Kronak**.

**Bowman's Capsule**: A cup-like structure in the cortex

**Proximal Convoluted Tubule: Highly coiled to increase SA to V ratio to reabsorb**mostmineral salts and all glucose, amino acids and vitamins (via active transport and diffusion) Most water absorbed back by osmosis.

Epithelium made up of cells that resemble that of the intestinal will.

Loop of Henle: The U-shaped portion of the tubule in the medulla.

Distal Convoluted Tubule: The coiled tubule which comes after the Loop of Henle

Collecting Duct: A duct that runs straight through the medulla and eventually opens into the renal pelvis

Outline the function of kidney tubules with reference to ultra filtration and selective

reabsorption in the production of urine.

Ultrafiltration:

1. Efferent arteriole smaller in diameter than afferent arteriole: High hydrostatic blood

pressure to force the filtrate out of blood into Bowman's capsule.

2. Highly coiled glomerular capillaries: Large surface area to volume ratio, to

increase rate of ultrafiltration, allowing more filtrate to be formed per unit time.

3. Glomemular capillaries more porous than normal capillaries: Greater permeability

for very smaller molecules and ions to pass through faster.

After ultrafiltration: ALL small molecules filtered, including useful substances

(glucose, amino acids, water and mineral salts) and waste products (urea, uric acid

and other nitrogenous wastes)

Selective Reabsorption

Proximal convoluted tubule aerosols most of the mineral salts at of glucose, amino,

acids and vitamins (diffusion but mostly active transport); amongst of the water

(osmosis) back into the bloodstream.

Wall of the present is one cell that has an abundance of mitochondria for active

transport, also bears microvilli to increase surface area to volume ratio for higher rate

of absorption of substances.

Loop of Henle: Osmosis of water and active transport of mineral salts.

Distal convoluted tubule: Active transport of mineral salts, little osmosis.

Collecting duct: Osmosis.

Outline the role of anti-diuretic hormone in the regulation of osmotic concentration.

When water potential of blood increases, hypothalamus is stimulated and causes

pituitary gland to release less anti-diuretic hormones (ADH) which makes the cells of

collecting tubules less immediate to water. Hence less water is reabsorbed by

collecting tubules back into bloodstream and more water remains in the urine. (vice

versa)Explain why the volume of urine decreases as external temperature increases?

As external temperature increases, thermoreceptors in the skin are stimulated and heavy/impulses are transmitted to the hypothalamus.

The hypothalamus then sends nerve impulses to the sweatglass in the skin to release more sweat-which contains water. Latent-heat-isost through evaporations of water from sweat.

Water potential of blood is reduced. This stimulates hypothalamus and hence, more ADH is released by pituitary gland which results in more water reabsorbed at the collecting duct as the cells become more permeable to water, therefore lesser volume of urine produced(more concentrated).

Note: ADH is produced by hypothalamus and released from pituitary gland

Outline the mechanism of dialysis in the case of kidney failure.

1. Blood is drawn from a vein (connected to an artery via a fistula) in the patient's arm

2. Blood is pumped through a tubing to the dialysis machine

3. Tubing is bathed in a special dialysis fluid(same as body temperature) and the tubing is partially permeable

4. Small molecules like urea and metabolic waste products diffuse out of the tubing

5. Larger molecules like platelets and blood cells remain in the tubing

6. The filtered blood is returned to vein in the patient's arm

## Chapter 12 Homeostasis

Define homeostasis.

Homeostasis is the maintenance of a constant internal environment, keeping it within a narrow range such as blood glucose concentration, body temperature, water potential of blood.

Explain the basic principles of homeostasis in terms of stimulus resulting from a change in the internal environment, a corrective mechanism and a negative feedback.

There must first be a stimulus, a change in the internal or external environment. The receptor detects the stimulus and brings about a self corrective mechanism which reverses the effect of the stimulus. _Negative feedback, the reverse effect of a stimulus caused by corrective mechanisms that took place, allows the receptors to receive signals and ensure corrective mechanisms proceed until normal conditions in the internal environment are restored._

Identify on a diagram of the skin: hairs, sweat glands, temperature receptors, blood vessels and fatty tissue.

Describe the maintenance of a constant temperature in humans in terms of

insulations and the role of temperature receptors in the skin, sweating, shivering,

blood vessels near the skin surface and the co-ordinating role of the brain.

This changes the body temperature which serves as a negative feedback.

Corrective mechanisms continue until body temperature (increases/decreases) to normal.

-

Able to remain active throughout the day and also throughout the year, irrespective of the environmental temperature.

-

Enzymes work best at a constant optimum temperature, which is around body temperature.

-

Able to live in areas with different climatic conditions

Outline the role of hypothalamus in coordinating temperature regulation.

The hypothalamus receives stimuli about temperature changes in our external environment from the thermoreceptors in the skin. It also monitors the temperature of blood passing through it and receives stimuli about temperature changes in our internal environment.

Describe the maintenance of a constant blood glucose concentration.

When blood glucose concentration rises above normal, the Islets of Langerhans in the pancreas is stimulated and secretes insulin. Insulin stimulates the liver and muscles to convert excess glucose to glycogen. @emaility-of-cell surface'

membrane to glucose increases. Blood glucose concentration decreases until normal. Insulin secretion stops.

When blood glucose concentration drops below normal, the Islets of Langerhans in pancreas is stimulated and secretes glucagon. Glucagon stimulates liver and muscle cells to convert glycogen to glucose. Blood glucose concentration increases until normal. Glucagon secretion stops.

Describe the maintenance of a constant osmotic pressure in the body.

When water potential of the blood increases, the hypothalamus is stimulated and the pituitary gland releases less anti-diuretic hormone (ADH). Lesser ADH decreases permeability of the collecting duct to water for kidney to reabsorb more water into the blood, resulting in more water being excreted in urine. This happens until water potential of blood returns to normal.

When water potential of blood decreases, the hypothalamus is stimulated and the pituitary gland releases more ADH. More ADH increases permeability of the collecting duct to water for kidney to reabsorb more water into the blood, resulting in less water being excreted in urine. This happens until water potential of blood returns to normal.

## Chapter 13 The Nervous System

State the components of the nervous system.

Central Nervous System (CNS) consisting of the brain and the spinal cord.

Peripheral Nervous System (PNS) consisting of cranial nerves from brain and spinal nerves from spinal cord and sense organs

State the relationship between receptors, the central nervous system and the effectors.

Stimulus isgathered by the receptors. The stimulus isconnected into electrical signals called nerve impulses. The nerve impulses are then transmitted by peripheral nerves to the central nervous system - brain and spinal cord. Brain interprets the nerve impulses and initiates nerve impulses that are transmitted to effectors to carry out the interaction.

Outline the functions of sensory neurones, relay neurones, and motor neurones.

Sensoryneurons are neurones that transmitters impulse from the sense organs of receptors to the central nervous system.

Whorne memories are neurones that transmit nerve impulses from the central nervous system to the effectors.

Relay neurons are neurones that transmit nerve impulse from the sensory neurons to the neurotransmitters.

Describe the following reflex actions:

-

Sudden withdrawal of hand on touching a hot object

-

Knee-jerk reflex

-

Pupil Reflex

Sudden withdrawal of hand on touching a hot object

The heat on the object stimulates the innerreceptor and pain receptors in the skin.

electrical impulses are produced and travels along the sensory neurones to the spinal cord. In the spinal cord, impulses are transmitted across a synapse to the motor neurons. Electrical impulses leave the spinal cord along the motor neurons to the effector. The effector is the indispensable which then contracts causing the sudden withdrawal of the hand.

Knee-jerk

Attraction receptors are stimulated and nerve impulses are produced and travels along the sensory neurons to the spinal cord. In the spinal cord, impulses are transmitted directly to the motor neurons across a synapse and electrical impulses leave the spinal cord along the motor neurons to the effector. The effector is the stiffness of which then contracts, causing the lower leg to kick up.

Pupil reflex

A Agilent intensity increases, photoreceptors in retina are stimulated. Nerve impulses are sent via sensory neurons in optic nerve to brain. Sensory neurons can be synapse to relay neurone which connects to motor neurone via another synapse.

Electrical impulses leave the brain along the motor neurons in optic nerve to the its muscles. Circular muscle of iris contracts and radial muscle of iris relaxes to construct pupil to prevent too much light from entering eye.

## Chapter 15 Hormones

Define a hormone.

It is a chemical substance produced by endocrine glands, carried by the blood which alters the activity of one or more specific target organs and is then broken down by the liver.

Explain what is meant by an endocrine gland, with reference to the islets of Langerhans in the pancreas.

Endocrine glands are ductiles and secrete hormones directly into the bloodstream, which then distributes the hormone around the body for them to reach the target organs. The islets of Langerhans secretes insulin or glucagon directly into the bloodstream which travels to the liver and muscle cells to stimulate conversion of excess glucose to glycogen or glycogen to glucose respectively.

State the role of the hormone adrenalaine in boosting blood glucose levels and give examples of situations in which this may occur.

Adrenalaine is produced and released by the adrenal gland, which is stimulated when an individual is afraid, angry, anxious or stressed. Adrenalaine prepares the body for 'fight or flight' or for states of emergency.

Adrenalaine:

Increases blood glucose levels by stimulating the conversion of glycogen to glucose in liver and muscles. The glucose produced is carried by blood to all the vital organs especially the heart and skeletal muscles, leading to increased respiration.

Increases metabolic rate for more energy to be released during tissue respiration.

Increases the rate of heartbeat and causes a rise in blood pressure so that oxygen and glucose are carried faster to the muscles.

Constricts arterioles in skin and digestive system. This causes paleness, thus channeling more blood to the muscles eg. In limbs

Increases rate and depth of ventilation for more oxygen to be available for respiration.

Contracts **hair erector muscles**, producing 'goose pimples'

Increases rate of blood coagulation

Causes pupils to estimate to enhance vision.

Describe the signs, such as an increased blood glucose level and glucose in urine, and the treatment of diabetes mellitus using insulin.

Signs of diabetes

- Persistently high blood glucose level

- Presence of glucose in urine after a meal

- Healing of wounds is slow or difficult

Types of diabetes

a. Type 1, developed early in a person's life. Juvenile/Early-onset diabetes. Islets of Langerhans unable to produce sufficient insulin.

b. Type 2, developed later in a person's life. Late on-set diabetes, target cells (eg. muscle cells) do not respond well to insulin. Overweight people are more likely to develop type 2 diabetes.

Treatment

i. Type 1: Insulin injected into bodies daily.

ii. Type 1: Have to ensure supply of sugary foods such as glucose sweets as their blood glucose concentration may drop too low if used too much insulin

iii. Type 2: Control blood sugar level (regulate carbohydrate content in diet, exercise)

List the differences between endocrine and nervous control.

How nervous system and endocrine system acts

Independently:

- NS: Receptors in skin detect the stimulus, impulses produced from the sensory neurone goes to spinal cord then motor neurone to the effector (muscle)

- HS: Regulation of blood glucose level work independently from nervous system. Endocrine gland detects an increase in blood glucose level and secretes insulin into the bloodstream which is brought to liver and muscle cells.

Nervous system can stimulate endocrine gland to release hormones into bloodstream.

-Fear, anxiety or stress stimulates the hypothalamus.

-Nerve impulses are produced and they travel along the sensory neurone to the spinal cord.

-The motor neurone leaves the spinal cord carrying the nerve impulses to the adrenal gland, stimulating it to release adrenaline.

-Adrenaline is carried in the blood to the heart and lungs, increasing breathing and heart rate to cope with the situation.

## Chapter 16 Reproduction in Plants

Define sexual and asexual reproduction.

Sexual reproduction requires the inclusion of nuclear or one male and one female.

game produced by methods. Genetic variation occurs amongst the offspring and with parents. However asexual reproduction does not involve the fusion of nuclei of gametes. Offspring are genetically identical to parents and to each other and are produced by mitosis.

Identify, know how to label and state the functions of sepsis, petals, carpel, stamen.

Functions

Sepal (All: calyx): They are modified leaves which encloses and protects other parts of the flower during the bud stage

Petals (All: corolla): They are modified leaves. In insect pollinated flowers, petals are brightly coloured to attract insects for pollination and a platform for insects to land on.

Carpel (All: pistil/gynoecium): The carpel is the female part of the flower which consists of an ovary, a style above the ovary and one or more stigmas.

Stamen (All: androecia): The stamen is the male part of the flower consists of an anther and a filament.

Define pollination, self pollination and cross-pollination

Pollination is the transfer of pollen grains from an anfuer to a receptive stigma to bring male and female gametes together.

Self pollination is the transfer of pollen grains from anfuer to stigma of a same flower or to stigma of another flower in the same plant.

Cross pollination is the transfer of pollen grains from anfuer of one flower to stigma of flower in another plant of the same species.

State the advantages and disadvantages of self pollination and cross pollination.

SELF
CROSS

+ Only 1 parent plant required

- 2 parent plants required

+ Beneficial qualities more likely to pass

- Lower probability of pollen grains

+ Does not depend on external factors

- Depends on external factors like wind or insects for pollination

or insects for pollination

+ Less pollen and energy wasted

- More pollen and energy wasted

(compared to self)

+Offspring inherit beneficial qualities

from one parent plant

- Offspring's genes inherited from one

+ Offspring universal beneficial qualities

parent plant which leads to less genetic

variations and hence being less

adaptable to environmental changes.

- Inbreeding occurs and offspring

become weaker, smaller and less

Jool Song Zheng Ying (edited by Mrc Chan) 2013Describe the pollination of insect pollinated and wind pollinated flower. (Clitoria and ischaernum muticum)

Insect polinated flower (Clitoria)

-

Insect lands on petal

-

Follows nectar guide into base of flower to collect nectar

-

Insect forces its way between 2 wing petal and move in to collect nectar

-

Insect's back forces open the keel petal to expose stigma and anther

-

Stigma and anther brush against hairy back of insect and pollen grains from

another stick onto the insect's hairy back

-

At the same time pollen grains on the back of the insect from the anther of another flower which the insect had landed on previously are transferred to the sticky stigma

-

When insect leaves, keel petal spring back to original position and enclose

stamen and stigma

Wind pollinated flower (Ischaernum Muticum)

-

The mature stamens have long pendulous filaments that hang downwards

and can swing freely

-

Filaments hang out of bracts exposing mature anthers to the wind

-

Dust-like pollen grain is shaken free in the wind and carried by wind

-

Mature stigmas project out of the bracts. They are long, extended and

fearhey to provide a large SA to receive any floating pollen.

Compare and contrast between insect pollinated and wind pollinated flowers.

Describe the process of fertilization in flowering plants.

1. Pollen grain lands on stigma

2. Germinates in response to sugary fluid secreted by stigma

3. Pollen tube grows out from each pollen grain

4. Cytoplasm and 2 nuclei (Generative nucleus + Vegetative nucleus) of each pollen grain passes into pollen tube

5. As it grows, pollen tube generates enzymes to penetrate surrounding tissue of stigma and right through the style

6. Along the way,

Generative nucleus: Divides mitotically into 2 male gametes

Vegetative nucleus: Controls growth of tube towards oule and degenerates when it reaches ovule.

7. Pollen tube enters ovule through micropyle (Ovule wall)

8. Upon reaching ovule, tip of tube absorbs sap in ovule and burst to release 2 male gametes

9. fertilization occurs when one male nucleus rises with ovule to form the zygote.

Other male nucleus fuses with definitive nucleus to form endosperm nucleus.

This results in double fertilization.

10. Zygote will divide and develop into embryo in seed

Endosperm will divide and give rise to food storage tissue (endosperm)

Asexual and Sexual Reproduction

Asexual: Missing genetically identical as parent

Lm100N

Self & Cross pollination LEAD TO sexual reproduction. As a result, there is genetic variation.

## Chapter 17 Reproduction in Humans

Identify on diagrams (side and frontal view) the male reproductive system and give the functions of testes, scrotum, sperm ducts, prostate gland, urethra and penis.

### Functions

Tests: Male sex organs which produce sperm (haploid sex cells for reproduction) testosterone (sex hormones)

Scrotum: Sac that holds testis outside body to keep sperms cooler for optimum temperature for sperms (production and to keep them healthy).

Sperm ducts: Connects and transports sperms from testis to urethra

Prostate gland: generates seminal fluid which contains enzymes and nutrients to

nourish and activate sperms to form semen (seminal fluid+ sperms)

Urethra: Passes through penis (passageway for urine and sperms out of the body)

Penis: Has numerous blood capillaries that fill up blood spaces during erection so as

to become erect to be able to ejacate and deposit sperms into vagina.

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:59]

Briefly describe the menstrual cycle with reference to the alternation of menstruation and ovulation, the natural variation in its length, and the fertile and infertile phases of the cycle with reference to the effects of progesterone and oestrogen only.

Day 1

Uterine lining breaks down and lining flows out together with a small amount of blood and unfertilized egg/ova through the vagina -Menstruation

Day 6

Folitics are stimulated to secrete estrogen which should be read repairs during ofuterus to make it spongy tail of capillaries and thick

Day 14

Exclusion occurs due to high level of estrogen and corpus luteumforms from empty follicle.

Corpus luteum secretes progesterone and testosterone. Estrogen further thickens the uterine lining, making it spongy and full of capillaries. progesterone maintains the thickened uterine lining for implantation.

If Fertilization Occurs...

The fertilized egg becomes a zygote and the zygote develops in an embryo through mitosis.

The embryo embeds itself in the uterine lining and secretes at homogene (Human Chorionic Gonodotropin) which prevents. Corpus luteum from breaking down.

Corpus luteum secretes progesterone and estrogen all placenta is completely formed(to take over the secretion) and sufficient progesterone and estrogen is Produced

If Fertilization Does not Occur...

The egg breaks down. Subsequently, the corpus luteum breaks down and progesterone is not secreted. The uterine lining is not maintained and breaks down.

Return to Day 1.

Describe fertilization and early development of the zygote simply in terms of the formation of a ball of cells which becomes implanted in the wall of the uterus.

Cilia lining the oviduct sweep the zygote along the oviduct. Peristaltic movements also help to move the zygote to the uterus. The zygote divides by mitosis to form a hollow ball of cells called the embryo. It takes about 5 days for the embryo to reach the uterus. Eventually the embryo embeds in the uterine lining. This is called implantation which usually occurs 7 days after fertilization.

Outrogan thickens, Progalactropic maintain State the functions of the amniotic sac and amniotic fluid.

Amniotic sac:

1. Encloses the fetus in the amniotic cavity which contains the amniotic fluid

Amniotic fluid:

1. Liquid shock absorber (to distribute any force that may push mother's uterus) to

paracci embryo from mechanicalinity and the vascular pressures from mother's organs.

2. supports and censors fetus.

3. Cannot be compressed therefore protecting fetus from physical injury.

4. Allows embryo to move freely as it grows

5. lubricates and reduces friction in vague during birth.

State the functions of the placenta and umbilical cord in relation to exchange of

dissolved nutrients, gases and excretory products. (Structural details not required)

Placenta

1. Allows nutrients, oxygen and protective antibodies to diffuse from mother's blood

to fetal blood.

2. Allows metabolic wastes like urea and carbon dioxide to diffuse from fetal blood

into mother's blood stream

3. Produces progesterone and estrogen to maintain uterine lining during pregnancy.

Umbilical cord

1.2umbilical arteries that transport deoxygenated blood and metabolic waste

products away from fetus to placenta

2.1umbilical vein that transports oxygenated blood and nutrients from placenta to

fetus.

Discuss the spread of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and methods by which it

may be controlled.

Spread of HIV is caused by:

1. Unprotected Sex

2. Sharing of hypodermic needles with infected person

3. Transmission from mother to fetus as small weight substances

can pass through placenta into-fetus from maternal blood to fetal blood

4. Infection from blood products

HIV attacks lymphocytes and prevents body from protecting against infection.

Reasons why mother's blood and fetus' blood is not continuous.

1. Higher blood pressure of mother's system may kill fetus

2. Fetus and mother may have different-blood groups thus resulting in agglutination.

Differentiate between gene mutation and chromosome mutation. Gene mutation results in new alleles of genes while chromosome mutation results in a difference in chromosome number in the nucleus compared to normal conditions. Gene mutation: Albinism Mutation of a recessive allele. Absence of pigments in the skin, hair and eyes of animals and humans. Requires both parents to pass down the recessive allele _for the offspring_ to be albino. - Has reddish-white skin (easily sunburnt) - Iris does not have any pigment, Choroid does not have black pigments (sensitive to sunlight) Gene mutation: Sickle-cell anemia Change in 1 amino acid that causes the change in the 3D shape of haemoglobin molecule Haemoglobin S (HbS) is produced, making red blood cell sickle-shaped. Normal haemoglobin is Haemoglobin A (HbA). Homozygous recessive have abnormal haemoglobin in blood. Inflexible haemoglobin becomes insoluble - HbS molecules _in rbcs makes rbcs_ clump together, restricting flow of blood as it is inflexible. - Increases blood viscosity and blocks blood vessels. This retards bloodflow to tissues and promotes coagulation causing tissue and organ damage, pain and stroke as they cannot respire without enough oxygen. Fragile, prone to rupture - Haemolytic anaemia (premature destruction of red blood cells) - Interfaces with rbc ability to _transport_ sufficient oxygen to cells - People with this disease usually die at a young age. Heterozygous - People who are heterozygous for the sickle cell trait are more resistant to the malaria pathogen as a small percentage of _rbcs_ are sickle-shaped and the sickle cell rbc cannot contain enough oxygen for malaria respiration, making them more resistant to malaria. - Hence these individuals are most adapted, have better chances of survival and reproduction as compared to normal individuals with 2 normal haemoglobin alleles that code for normal haemoglobin, particularly in malaria prone areas. - Due to this heterozygote advantage that causes them to be naturally selected for, the sickle cell allele continues to occur at high frequency in malaria-stricken populations. Chromosome mutation: Down's Syndrome - Zygote has extra chromosome 21, making the total chromosome count to be 47, unlike the usual 46 chromosomes. - As the copies of chromosome 21 did not split during gamete formation, there is an additional chromosome (the older the mother, the higher the chance).

Name radiation and chemicals as factors (mutagens) which may increase rate of mutation.

Ultraviolet light; Mustard gas; Alpha, beta and gamma radiation; Formaldehyde

Describe the difference between continuous and discontinuous variation and give examples of each.

CONTINUOUS

1. Deals with a wide range of phenotypes.
2. Phenotypes are controlled by many genes.
3. Phenotypes are determined by genes which show additive effect
4. Expression of phenotypes is affected by environmental condition
5. Height, Weight, Intelligence, Skin colour
6. Eye colour, Gender, Blood group

State that variation and competition lead to differential survival of and reproduction by, those organism best fitted to the environment.

Give examples of environmental factors that act as forces of natural selection.

Competition for food and space, predation.

Explain the role of natural selection as a possible mechanism for evolution.

Sexual reproduction, as well as, spontaneous mutation which may cause the phenotype of the organisms to change, produce varieties within the species.

Competition (for food and space etc) occurs among different varieties of organisms resulting in the survival of the fittest.

Natural Selection:

Nature selects those varieties with favourable alleles, which are best adapted under the prevailing conditions.

Others die or decrease in number due to predation or lack of food.

Those that survive past reproductive age, reproduce and pass down favourable alleles to offspring.

+

**Evolution (if needed in question)**:

After many generations, frequency of favourable alleles increase

Resulting in a new breed of organisms which are very different from the original stock, hence we say that a new species has evolved.

Give examples of natural selection (Darwin's Finches)

Darwin Finches

Anecdotal finches have short, straight beaks to crush seeds.

Those present in Galapagos Islands have 6 major types of beaks to suit their particular diet.

3 examples:

**Cactus ground finch:** Long slender beak for collecting nectar from cactus flower.

**Vegetarian tree finch:** Curved parrot-like beak to feed on buds and fruits

**Woodpecker finch:** Large, straight beak to bore holes in tree trunks and uses a stick to poke insects out of holes in woody tree trunk as they feed on insect larvae.

Rabbits

Mutation occurs and nature selects the variation that is best suited to the environment.

Forest: Dark coloured rabbits are selected for as they camouflage well with dark forest, has a small size and crouching position to hide from predators.

Open plain: Light colored fur coat rabbits are selected for as they camouflage well in open plains. Larger in size, longer hind legs to run and escape from predators.

Longer ears to have keener sense of hearing to detect predators.

Give examples of artificial selection such as in the production of economically important plant and animals.

Hybridization: Cross breeding different varieties of plants to produce a new and better variety.

(eg.) Cultivated sugarcane in Java that's rich in sugar that is susceptible to disease and to insect pests is cross-bred with a wild sugarcane that has low sugar content but resistant to disease. Breeders managed to produce plants both high in sugar content and resistant to diseases.

(eg.) Jersey cows known to produce a lot of good milk, but it does not thrive well in warm climates. Brahman breed thrives well in warm climates but are not good producers of milk. Hybridization produced breeds that produce good milk and thrive in warm climates.

Significance of order of bases in a DNA molecule.

A gene is a segment of DNA molecule.

A gene codes for formation of one type of polypeptide and has a specific sequence of nucleotides which results in a specific sequence of bases.

The order of bases determines the sequence of amino acids in a polypeptide which affects the folding of the polypeptide.

Polypeptides are combined to form proteins.

The 3D structure of the polypeptide is important as enzyme or protein function is closely linked to its structure.

These proteins determine the characteristics of an individual.

Explain the process of genetic engineering.

Genetic engineering is the process of transferring genes from one organism to

another. Individual genes are cut off from chromosomes of the cells of one organism

and inserted into the cells of another organism of the same or different species.

A vector is a DNA molecule used to carry genes of one organism to another.

Plasmids from bacteria can be used to transfer genes.

State a specific example of genetic engineering - insulin production in medical biotechnology.

Obtain a human chromosome containing the insulin gene.

Cut 2 ends of the gene using a restriction enzyme to produce 2'sticky ends'

Each sticky end is a single strand of DNA bases.

Obtain a plasmid from bacterium and cut it with the same restriction enzyme to

produce complementary sticky ends.

Insulin gene and plasmid is mixed and attached by complementary base pairing,

DNA ligase is added to join the ends forming a recombinant plasmid.

Recombinant plasmid is mixed with E coli bacteria.

Temporary heat or electric shock is applied to open up pores in the cell surface

membrane of each bacterium for recombinant plasmid to enter.

Transgenic bacterium is placed within nutrient broth in fermenter with optimum

temperature, pH, oxygen supply to multiply rapidly. The gene duplicates and during

cell division, each new bacterium receives a copy of the insulin gene to make insulin.

Local Son Theno Ying (edited by MrC Chan) 2013Compare between selective breeding and genetic engineering.

SELECTIVE BREEDING

1. Plants and animals used for breeding must be closely related or belong to the same species.

GENETIC ENGINEERING

1. Genes from any plant or animal can be inserted into non-related species or different species.

2. Defective genes may be transmitted along with healthy genes to the offspring.

2. Genes are carefully selected before transferring into the organism, reducing risk of genetic defects being passed on to offspring.

3. Slow process involving breeding over several generations. Requires a large amount of land for raising large number of organisms.

4. Less efficient. Organisms grow more slowly and require more food.

4. More efficient. Transgenic salmon grows faster and requires less food than ordinary salmon.

5. More expensive (due to 3 & 4)

5. Cheaper (due to 3 & 4)

Benefits of genetic engineering.

Low cost production of medicine

-GE of important drugs like human insulin has reduced the cost of medicine. Thus more patients can afford them and get treated.

Production of crops that grow in **extreme conditions** (eg. High salt environments)

- Drought resistant crops/Salt tolerant crops/Crops that make more efficient use of nitrogen and other nutrients.

-Allows farmers to grow crops even when soil conditions are not suitable for cultivating crops.

Development of crops that produce toxins that kill pest-resistant crops

- Use of costly pesticides that damage the environment is reduced

- Bt (Bacillus thurigensis) gene from a certain bacterium can be inserted into plant cells to produce toxins that can kill insect/pests.

Development of food designed to meet specific nutritional goals

- Improved nutritional quality of food. For example rice with high vitamin A content.

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:73]

Discuss the social and ethical implications/issues of genetic engineering with reference to a named example.

Environmental Hazards

- Crops that have been genetically engineered to produce insect toxins result in death of insects feeding on GM crops
- loss of biodiversity in long term. (Ch22)

- Natural selection takes place when varieties (referring to insects) which are resistant to toxins survive and reproduce and pass down favourable alleles to offsprings. Resulting in more insects attacking crops.

- Herbicide-resistant plants may cross breed with weeds to create'superweeds'

_when pollen grains of the crops land on the stigma of the weeds._

Economic Hazards

- Biotechnology companies use terminator technology and engineer crop plants such that the plants produce seeds which cannot germinate. Farmers are therefore forced to buy special seeds after each harvest from these companies posing as a serious problem to poorer societies.

Health Hazards

- Genetic Engineering could introduce allergens into food, causing a reaction from our immune system to the body. Eg. Lectin found in beans is an effective pest control against aphids thus the gene for lectin is transferred to potatoes. People who are allergic to lectin may unknowingly eat the transgenic potatoes and react badly to the lectin present.

- Modifying a single gene in plant cells may alter some metabolic processes within the plant, resulting in **production of toxins** which were not initially found in the plant. Consumption of these plants or products by the plants by humans can pose serious health problems. Consumption by insects can lead to loss of biodiversity.

- Genes that code for antibiotic resistance may be accidentally incorporated into bacteria that cause diseases to humans. Thus rendering antibiotics ineffective in killing the bacteria.

Social Hazards

- Genetic engineering may result in **class distinctions**. Individuals with the financial means can afford certain gene technologies while the poorer communities suffer.

Ethical Hazards

- Some **religion** do not approve of GE as it may not be appropriate to alter the natural genetic make-up of organisms.

-There are objections to consuming animal genes in plants and vice versa. For example, vegetarians may object to the transfer of animal genes into crop plants.

## Chapter 21 Ecology

Describe the non-cyclical nature of energy flow.

The ultimate source of energy is the Sun, producers convert light energy into chemical energy via photosynthesis. Energy in the producers is passed from one trophic level to another by feeding.

Energy lost as heat to the environment cannot be recycled and there is a progressive loss of energy by Heat during respiration, _Excreatory waste products like urea, Uneaten body parts like bones left to be decomposed, Undigested matter (faeces) - loss of energy in the form of organic matter along_ food chains. Hence light energy from the Sun has to be constantly supplied to the ecosystem as organisms cannot use heat energy to do work, they can only use light and chemical energy.

Explain the terms producer, consumer in the context of food chains and food webs.

Producers are organisms which utilize chlorophyll (or other photosynthetic pigments) to trap and convert light energy to chemical energy to manufacture, glucose during photosynthesis.

"Significance: Producers provide a continuous flow of energy into the food chain which can be passed through each trophic level through conversion of light energy to chemical energy.

Consumers are organisms which obtains chemical energy directly or indirectly by feeding on plants or other organisms and they cannot make their own food by photosynthesis.

Explain the term trophic level in the context of food chains and food webs.

A food chain is a series of organisms through which energy is transferred in the form of food. Each trophic level is a stage in a food chain.

Describe the role of decomposers in an ecosystem.

Decomposers obtain some energy by breaking down dead organisms, faeces and excretory products, releasing the rest of the energy to the environment. When the dead organisms and waste matter are broken down, inorganic nutrients, carbon and nitrogen compounds, return to the physical environment and are used again by green plants.

Explain how energy losses occur along food chains and discuss the efficiency of energy transfer between trophic levels.

Only 10% of energy is transferred from one trophic level to another as energy is lost as...

Heat during respiration

Excretery waste products excreted by consumers like urea

Uneaten body parts like bones and left to be decomposed

Undigested matter, as in faeces, loses energy in the form of organic matter.

Therefore energy available for 4th or 5th stage of the food chain is insufficient to sustain organisms _for survival_.

\begin{tabular}{|p{284.5pt}|} \hline Understand how pyramids of numbers, biomass and energy are constructed. \\ \hline Numbers \\ Graphical representation of the number of organisms present in each trophic level at a particular time. \\ Most are upright pyramid-shaped with 2 exceptions: \\ a. A lot of small animals feeding on a large plant \\ b. An animal has a large number of small parasites feeding on it \\ \hline Biomass \\ Graphical representation of the total amount of living material present by comparing the dry mass of organisms present in each trophic level at a particular time. \\ - Pyramid of biomass is in dynamic state. When organisms die, food value on that trophic level can still be maintained by rapid replacement of newborn organisms. \\ \hline Most are pyramid shaped and upright except: \\ a. When producer is a small organism that multiplies very rapidly. \\ \hline In that case, total biomass of producers present at any one time may be less than \\ total biomass of primary consumers, this making the pyramid inverted. \\ \hline \end{tabular}

Energy

Pyramids of energy tell us how much energy is contained in the tissue of organisms at each trophic level in a food chain, allowing us to compare the total energy in each trophic level over a period of time.

Takes account the inedible part of organisms, which is not reflected in pyramids of biomass.

The ultimate source of energy is the sun and energy lost as heat to the environment does not return to the same system or organisms that produced it. It can't be recycled, unlike materials like nutrients. Approximately 10% of energy is transferred from one trophic to another.

Always pyramid-shaped, with no exceptions to this rule.

Describe how carbon is cycled within an ecosystem.

Carbon is constantly removed from and released into the environment in the form of carbon dioxide, thus CO\({}_{2}\) concentration remains relatively constant at 0.03%.

1. During photosynthesis, green plants absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and use it to manufacture carbohydrates, such as glucose.

2. Glucose is changed into other organic compounds such as fats, amino acids and proteins.

3. Carbon can either become part of the bodies of animals that feed on green plants, or are preserved in fossil fuels such as coal, natural gas and oil.

4. The carbon dioxide released when organisms decompose or when organisms respire is then absorbed back into plants during photosynthesis.

Describe how carbon in a glucose molecule is recycled in the carbon cycle.

Glucose releases its carbon to the environment when it is oxidized during

**respiration** to become carbon dioxide gas.

The carbon dioxide gas becomes incorporated into plants as starch during

**photosynthesis**,

when consumed by animals becomes glucose again upon hydrolysis of the

carbohydrates or even absorbed and assimilated and stored as glycogen in the liver

and muscle cells.

**Decomposers** helps to release the remaining trapped carbon in a dead animal by

feeding on them and breaking them down and releases carbon dioxide into the

environment.

Understand and appreciate the importance of the carbon cycle.

It ensures a continuous supply of inorganic CO\({}_{2}\) for plants to photosynthesize, an

important process that converts solar energy to chemical energy, which other non-

photosynthetic organisms can use to stay alive.

It enables a one-way flow of energy through ecosystem in the form of food along

food chains. Carbon compounds carry the trapped solar energy from organism to

organism in the food chains of an ecosystem.

Define a carbon sink.

A carbon sink is an area that stores carbon compounds for an indefinite period.

It stores more carbon than it releases.\({}^{\ast}\)

Describe oceans as carbon sinks

Oceans are the largest carbon sinks on Earth.

The carbon dioxide that dissolves in the ocean's water is absorbed and used by phytoplankton and algae in photosynthesis.

A portion of the carbon compounds found in oceans is buried in the seabed and is in the form of fossil fuels such as natural gas and oil.

Describe forests as carbon sinks

Forests are also important carbon sinks.

Atmospheric carbon dioxide is absorbed by the plants and used in photosynthesis.

A large amount of carbon compounds is stored in trees.

Remains of dead trees form coal - a fossil fuel.

Water reclamation plants reduce water pollution by using bacteria to digest organic pollutants in sewage and convert it into harmless soluble substances.

1. Used water is channeled into water reclamation plants and first enters the **primary settling tank**. Heavy solids in the used water settle to the bottom of the tank and is removed as sludge (compact form).
2. Partially treated water drained into aeration tank and mixed with bacteria. The bacteria secretes enzymes to digest organic pollutants in the used water into harmless soluble substances and carbon dioxide.
3. Liquid from the aeration tank sent to final settling tank where microorganisms are removed from the water before being discharged into the sea.
4. Sludge is treated in anaerobic digesters. (Breaking down the organic pollutants releases methane and methane is used as a fuel to provide electricity.)
5. Treated sludge is dewatered and disposed of as a soil container.

Discuss the reasons for conservation of species in the management of fisheries and management of timber production. Reasons for Conservation in Management of Fisheries

It is to eliminate the pollution of rivers and seas. Fishing grounds and fisheries must be managed to prevent over-fishing and indiscriminate fishing.

Methods:

- Banning the use of drift nets which indiscriminately trap all forms of marine life.

- Using nets with certain mesh size so that young fish are not caught.

- Regulating entry of ships into fishing grounds

- Limiting the period of fishing in fishing grounds

Reasons for Conservation in Management of Timber Production

Forests are a major source of oxygen, they help moderate the weather, provide shade and protection for the soil. Must be managed to conserve forests and reduce pollution ('Slash and burn' practices release large amounts of carbon dioxide, contributing to global warming).

Methods:

- Reforestation

- Ensures that young trees are not felled

- Trees felled for timber are cut down at a regulated rate

- Designated land as forest reservesDiscuss the reasons for conservation of species with reference to the maintenance of biodiversity. Tropical plants are of great economic importance as they are a source of raw material for industries, medicinal drugs, insecticides and food. Industries Rattan make furniture Rubber from latex of rubber trees make tires Fibres from cotton plants make cloth Fibre from coconut husks make ropes Medical drugs Quinine, an anti malarial drug from bark of Cinchona. Morphine, a pain suppressing drug derived from the sap of poppy plant. Chemicals in the Madagascar rosy periwnlike is used to treat leukemia. Insecticide Pyrethrum in chrysanthemum used in insecticide industry. Food Tropical rainforests provide food like rice, pineapple, banana Suggest reasons for conservation. 1. To maintain a large gene pool as many wild plants and animals possess favourable genes that can be used for cross-breeding so as to improve agricultural produce. We can have plants with resistance to bacteria or drought by doing cross breeding. 2. To maintain biodiversity as many tropical plants are of great economic importance as they are a source of raw material for industries, medicinal drugs, insecticides and food. 3. For scientific value as the study of wildlife provides useful information to humans eg. Study of evolution 4. To maintain a stable and balanced ecosystem to prevent disruption of natural cycles such as water and carbon cycles and prevents global warming. 5. To prevent extinction of plant and animal species 6. To ensure conservation of marine life as they are a major source of food for humans. 7. Preserve natural scenery and wildlife for people to appreciate and to maintain natural resources for outdoor recreational activities like fishing, hiking.
