A Relative Atomic Mass (A\({}_{r}\))

At the end of this section, you should be able to:

_Define relative atomic mass, A\({}_{r}\)._

Definition:

The relative atomic mass (\(A_{r}\)) of an atom is the **average** mass of one atom of that element compared to \(\frac{1}{12}\) of the mass of one carbon-12 atom.

For example:

Chlorine consists of 2 isotopes \(\supset\) Cl-35 (75%) and Cl-37 (25%)

A\({}_{r}\) of each chlorine atom = \(\frac{(75\,x\,35)+(25\,x\,37)}{100}=35.5\)

###### Abstract

The relative molecular mass of a compound is the average mass of one molecule of that element of compound compared to \(\frac{\mathbf{1}}{\mathbf{12}}\) of the mass of one carbon-12 atom.

For example:

\begin{tabular}{|c|} \hline Ammonium Carbonate (NH\({}_{4}\))\({}_{2}\)CO\({}_{3}\) \\ \hline \end{tabular}

Name the different elements present in this compound, and write down the relative atomic mass, A\({}_{r}\), of each element

\begin{tabular}{|c|} \hline Element: N \\ A\({}_{r}\): 14 \\ \hline \end{tabular}

How many atoms of each of these elements does it contain?

What is the relative molecular mass, M\({}_{r}\), of this compound?

\begin{tabular}{|c|} \hline M\({}_{r}=\) (2 x 14) + (8 x 1) + (1 x 12) + (3 x 16) \\ \(=\) 96.0 \\ \hline \end{tabular}

\begin{tabular}{|l|} \hline At the end of this section, you should be able to:- \\ \(\bullet\) _Calculate the concentration of solutions_ \\ \(\bullet\) _Apply the concept of solution concentration (mol/ dm\({}^{3}\) or g/ dm\({}^{3}\)) to solve simple problems_ \\ \hline \end{tabular}

#### Concentration

- Concentration of a solution is given by **the amount of a solute (in g or mol) dissolved in a unit volume (dm\({}^{3}\)) of a solvent.**

- It can be expressed in **g/dm\({}^{3}\)** or mol/dm\({}^{3}\)

\(\circ\) For example:

* 50 g/dm\({}^{3}\) of sodium chloride solution means 50 g of NaCl in 1 dm\({}^{3}\) of water. Therefore, in 4 dm\({}^{3}\), there are 200 g of sodium chloride
* 3 mol/dm\({}^{3}\) of sodium chloride solution means 3 mol of NaCl in 1 dm\({}^{3}\) of water. Therefore, in 5 dm\({}^{3}\), there are 15 mol of sodium chloride

### Concentration of a Solution

\[\text{Concentration in g/dm}^{3}=\frac{mass\ of\ solute\ (g)}{volume\ of\ solvent\ (dm^{3})}\]

\[\text{Concentration in mol/dm}^{3}=\frac{number\ of\ moles\ of\ solute\ (mol)}{volume\ of\ solvent\ (dm^{3})}\]

Example 1:

Calculate the concentration of hydrochloric acid solution in mol/dm\({}^{3}\) if 400 cm\({}^{3}\) of the solution contains 0.25 mole of HCl.

\[\text{Concentration}=\frac{0.25}{400/1000}=0.625\ mol/dm^{3}\]

Example 2:

Calculate the number of moles of sodium hydroxide contained in 150 cm\({}^{3}\) of 2.0 mol/dm\({}^{3}\) solution of sodium hydroxide.

Number of moles = \(\frac{150}{1000}\ x\ 2=0.300\ mol\)Example 3:

A solution of sodium hydroxide contains 9.6 g of sodium hydroxide in 100 cm\({}^{3}\) of solution.

Find the concentration of the solution in

**(a)**: g/dm\({}^{3}\),

**(b)**: mol/dm\({}^{3}\)

(a) Concentration in g/dm\({}^{3}\) = 9.6 / \({}^{\frac{1000}{100}}_{100}\) = 96 g/dm\({}^{3}\)

(b) Concentration in mol/dm\({}^{3}\) = \(\frac{96}{40}\) =2.4 mol/dm\({}^{3}\)

This recipe is used to make 1 chicken and ham burger, how many slices of ham and chicken patty must we prepare to make 5 burgers?

Slices of ham required:2 x 5 =10

Slices of chicken patty required:1 x 5 = 5

A chemical equation is like a recipe, which tells us

- What substances react together (the reactants)

- What substances are produced in the reaction (the products)

- How much of each substances requiredFor example:

From this chemical equation,

\(2\)H\({}_{2}\) + O\({}_{2}\)\(\rightarrow\)\(2\)H\({}_{2}\)O

What does it tell you?

I need 2 mol of hydrogen gas and 1 mol of oxygen gas to produce 2 mol of water

**So if**

- **I** have 4 moles of hydrogen and 2 moles of oxygen, I would get 4 mol of water.

- **I** have 3 moles of oxygen, I would get 6 mol of water.

- **I** want 0.5 moles of water, I would need **0.25** mol of oxygen.

Example 1:

\(2\)H\({}_{2}\) + O\({}_{2}\)\(\rightarrow\)\(2\)H\({}_{2}\)O

Amount of hydrogen gas = \(\frac{0.5}{2}\) = 0.250 _mol_

\(2\)H\({}_{2}\)\(\equiv\)2H\({}_{2}\)O (ratio is 1:1)

Amount of water = 0.25 mol

Mass of water = 0.25 x 18 = 4.50g

Example 2:

Magnesium reacts with hydrogen chloride according to the equation:

Mg + 2HCl \(\rightarrow\) MgCl\({}_{2}\) + H\({}_{2}\)

2HCl\(\equiv\) MgCl\({}_{2}\) (ratio is 2:1)

Amount of HCl = 0.2105 x 2 = 0.421 mol

Mass of HCl = 0.421 x 36.5 = 15.4 g Example 3:

At the end of this section, you should be able to:-

* _Perform calculations involving the idea of limiting reactants_

**Let's consider making a chicken sandwich:**

But 1000 meat patties and 2500 slices of bread was given to the production line.

Consider:

\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|c|} \hline Before (B) & 2500 & 1000 & 0 \\ \hline Change (C) & -2000 & -1000 & +1000 \\ \hline After (A) & 500 & 0 & 1000 \\ \hline \end{tabular}

When would the production stop? When the meat patties are used up.

Which ingredient determine the amount of sandwic formed? Meat patties

Similarly, in a chemical reaction, the reactant that is used up **first** will determine the amount of product formed. And the reactant that is used up first is known as the **limiting reagent**.

Example 1:

If 8 g of copper was mixed with 4 g of sulfur, find the mass of copper(I) sulfide formed.

2 Cu (s) + S (s) \(\rightarrow\) Cu\({}_{2}\)S (s)

amt of Cu = 8/64 = 0.125 mol

amt of S = 4/32 = 0.125 mol

Assume Cu is the limiting reagent, 0.125 mol of Cu will be used up and 0.0625 mol of S will be required for reaction.

Therefore S is in excess (since there is 0.125 mol initially) and Cu is the limiting reagent.

2Cu \(\equiv\) Cu\({}_{2}\)S

amt of Cu\({}_{2}\)S = 0.125 / 2 = 0.0625 mol

mass of Cu\({}_{2}\)S = 0.0625 x 160 = 10.0g

Example 2:

A sample of 50 cm\({}^{3}\) of propane was burnt in 50 cm\({}^{3}\) of oxygen gas.

C\({}_{3}\)H\({}_{8}\) (g) + 5 O\({}_{2}\) (g) \(\rightarrow\) 3 CO\({}_{2}\) (g) + 4 H\({}_{2}\)O (g)

(a) Find the volume of carbon dioxide gas produced.

(b) Find the volume of excess reactant left.

Assume that propane is the limiting reagent, 50 cm\({}^{3}\) of propane will be used up and 250 cm\({}^{3}\) of oxygen will be required.

Therefore oxygen is the limiting reagent instead (as there is only 50cm\({}^{3}\) initially) and propane is in excess.

(a) 3 CO\({}_{2}\)\(\equiv\) 5 O\({}_{2}\)

Volume of carbon dioxide = \(\frac{3}{5}x50\) = 30\(cm^{3}\)

(b) 50 cm\({}^{3}\) of oxygen will used up 10 cm\({}^{3}\) of propane.

Volume of propane left = 50 - 10 = 40 cm\({}^{3}\).

**Check Point 8**

1 If 7.2 g of iron(ll) oxide was mixed with 0.4 dm\({}^{3}\) of oxygen gas, according to this equation:

4 FeO + O\({}_{2}\)\(\rightarrow\) 2 Fe\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{3}\)

(a) find the mass of iron(ll) oxide formed.

(b) find the mass of excess reactant left.

Amount of FeO = 7.2/(56+16) = 0.1 mol

Amount of oxygen = 0.4/24 = 0.01667 mol

Assume that oxygen is the limiting reagent, 0.01667 mol of oxygen will be used up and 0.006667 mol of FeO will be required. FeO will be in excess (since there is 0.1 mol initially) and oxygen is the limiting reagent.

2 Fe\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{3}\) \(\equiv\) O\({}_{2}\)

Amt of Fe\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{3}\) = 0.01667 x 2 = 0.03334 mol

1. mass of iron(ll) oxide formed = 0.03334 x (56+56+16+16+16) = 5.33g
2. amt of excess FeO = 0.1 - 0.06667 = 0.03333 mol

mass of excess FeO = 0.03333 x 72 = 2.40 g

2 A mixture of 30 cm\({}^{3}\) of hydrogen and 20 cm\({}^{3}\) of oxygen is exploded, find:

1. the mass of steam formed.
2. the volume of excess reactant gas left.

2H\({}_{2}\) + O\({}_{2}\)\(\rightarrow\) 2H\({}_{2}\)O

Assume that hydrogen is the limiting reagent, 30 cm\({}^{3}\) of hydrogen will be used up and 15 cm\({}^{3}\) of oxygen will be required. Oxygen is in excess (as there is 20 cm\({}^{3}\) initially) and hydrogen is the limiting reagent.

2H\({}_{2}\) \(\equiv\) 2H\({}_{2}\)O

1. mass of stream = 30 cm\({}^{3}\)
2. vol of excess reactant = 20-15 = 5 cm* 3Ammonia burns in oxygen according to the following equation: 4 NH3 (g) + 3O2 (g) > 2 N2 (g) + 6 H2O (I) If 40.0 cm3 of ammonia is burnt in 50.0 cm3 of oxygen, what will be the volume of the gases after the combustion, assuming all the volumes are measured at r.t.p.? Assume that ammonia is the limiting reagent, 40 cm3 of ammonia will be used up and 30 cm3 of oxygen will be required. Oxygen is in excess (as there is 50 cm3 initially) and ammonia is the limiting reagent. 40cm3 of ammonia will react with 30cm3 of oxygen and produced 20cm3 of nitrogen gas.

### Percentage Yield and Purity

At the end of this section, you should be able to:- * _Understand that percentage yield in an experiment cannot be 100%_ * _Calculate percentage purity based on theory and experimental results_

### Percentage Yield

- The amount of product formed in a reaction is known as the **yield**.
- The **theoretical yield** of a reaction is the calculated amount of products that would be obtained if the reaction is completed.
- The **actual yield** is the amount of pure products that is actually produced in the experiment.
- The actual yield is usually **lesser** the theoretical yield.

\[\begin{array}{c}\mbox{Percentage yield}=\frac{actual\ yield}{theoretical\ yield}x100\%\\ \end{array}\]

Example 1: When 1.92 g of magnesium was heated in excess oxygen, 3.0 g of magnesium oxide was obtained. Calculate the percentage yield of magnesium oxide.

2 Mg + O2 > 2MgO Amount of Mg = 1.92 / 24 = 0.08 mol Mg=MgO Theoretical amount of MgO formed = 0.08mol Theoretical mass of MgO formed = 0.08 x 40 = 3.2g (theoretical yield) % yield = \(\frac{3}{3.2}x100\%=93.8\%\)

### Percentage Purity

- gives the indication of the amount of substance present in a mixture (impure substance)

\begin{tabular}{||c||} \hline Percentage purity = \(\frac{\text{\it mass of pure substance in sample}}{\text{\it mass of sample}}\) \(\text{\it x100\%}\) \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}

Example 2:

3.2 g of copper was heated in air. 3.8 g of copper(II) oxide was formed. What is the percentage purity of copper?

2Cu + O\({}_{2}\) \(\xrightarrow{}\) 2CuO

Amount of CuO = \(\frac{3.8}{80}=0.0475\)\(\mathit{mol}\)

Cu \(\equiv\) CuO

Amount of pure Cu = \(0.0475\)\(\mathit{mol}\)

Mass of pure Cu = \(0.0475\) x 56 = \(3.04\)g

% purity = \(\frac{3.04}{3.2}\)\(\text{\it x100\%}=95.0\)%

### Check Point 9

1 In an experiment, 30 g of ethanoic acid (CH\({}_{3}\)COOH) were obtained from the oxidation of 69 g of ethanol (C\({}_{2}\)H\({}_{5}\)OH). Calculate the percentage yield in the reaction.

C\({}_{2}\)H\({}_{5}\)OH + 2 [O] \(\xrightarrow{}\) CH\({}_{3}\)COOH + H\({}_{2}\)O

Amount of ethanol = 69/46 = \(1.5\) mol

C\({}_{2}\)H\({}_{5}\)OH \(\equiv\) CH\({}_{3}\)COOH

Theoretical amount of CH\({}_{3}\)COOH = \(1.5\) mol

Theoretical mass of CH\({}_{3}\)COOH = \(1.5\) x 60 = \(90\) g (theoretical yield)

% yield = \(30/90\) x \(100\%\) = \(33.3\%\)3.21 g sample of impure copper(II) carbonate was reacted with excess hydrochloric acid. It was found that 480 cm\({}^{3}\) of carbon dioxide gas measured at r.t.p. was given off. What is the percentage purity of the copper(II) carbonate in the given sample?

\(CuCO_{3}+2HCI\)\(\supset\)\(CuCl_{2}+CO_{2}+H_{2}O\)

Amount of \(CO_{2}=0.48/24=0.02\) mol

\(CuCO_{3}\equiv CO_{2}\)

Amount of pure \(CuCO_{3}=0.02\) mol

Mass of pure \(CuCO_{3}=0.02\times 124=2.48\) g

% purity = \(\frac{2.48}{3.21}x100\%=77.3\%\)

### **Crustration**_Calculations_

At the end of this section, you should be able to:-

_Perform calculation based on data obtained from titration results._

Example 1:

Aqueous sodium sulfate can be prepared by titrating dilute sulfuric acid with aqueous sodium hydroxide. The equation for the reaction is:

\(H_{2}SO_{4}\) (aq) + 2 NaOH (aq) \(\supset\) Na\({}_{2}\)SO\({}_{4}\) (aq) + 2 \(H_{2}O\) (_I_)

In the titration, 25.0 cm\({}^{3}\) of 2.0 mol/dm\({}^{3}\) sulfuric acid was used.

(a) Calculate the volume of 0.5 mol/dm\({}^{3}\) sodium hydroxide used in the reaction.

(b) Calculate the mass in grams, of sodium sulfate produced in the reaction.

Amount of sulfuric acid = \(\frac{25}{1000}x2=0.05\ mol\)

\(H_{2}SO_{4}\) (aq) \(\equiv\) 2NaOH

Amount of NaOH = 0.05 x 2 = 0.1 mol

1. Volume of NaOH = \(\frac{0.1}{0.5}=0.200\ dm^{3}\)
2. \(H_{2}SO_{4}\equiv Na_{2}SO_{4}\)

Amt of Na\({}_{2}\)SO\({}_{4}\) = 0.05 mol

Mass of Na\({}_{2}\)SO\({}_{4}\) = 0.05 x 142 = 7.10gExample 2:

A concentrated acid has a concentration of 12 mol/ dm\({}^{3}\). What volume of concentrated acid would be needed to make 1 dm\({}^{3}\) of dilute acid with a concentration of 1 mol/ dm\({}^{3}\).

T to introduce C\({}_{1}\)V\({}_{1}\) = C\({}_{2}\)V\({}_{2}\)

12 x V\({}_{?}\) = 1 x 1

V\({}_{?}\) = 1/12 = 0.0833dm\({}^{3}\)

Practice Worksheet 9D

Answer the following questions on writing paper.

1 28.0 g of nitrogen reacted with 8.0 g of hydrogen to form 5.1 g of ammonia.

(a) Which reactant is in excess?

(b) What is the percentage yield of ammonia?

Amount of nitrogen = 28/28 = 1 mol

Amount of hydrogen = 8/2 = 4 mol

N\({}_{2}\) + 3H\({}_{2}\) \(\rightarrow\) 2NH\({}_{3}\)

Assume nitrogen is the limiting reagent, 1 mole of nitrogen will be used up and 3 moles of hydrogen will be required. Hydrogen will be in excess (as there is 4 moles initially). Therefore nitrogen is the limiting reagent.

(a) hydrogen is in excess.

(b) N\({}_{2}\) \(\equiv\) 2NH\({}_{3}\)

Theoretical amt of ammonia produced = 2 mol

Theoretical mass of ammonia produced = 2 x 17 = 34g (theoretical yield)

%yield = \(\frac{5.1}{34}x\) 100% = 15.0%

2 In the fermentation process, glucose (C\({}_{6}\)H\({}_{12}\)O\({}_{6}\)) is converted into ethanol (C\({}_{2}\)H\({}_{5}\)OH) by yeast in the following reaction:

C\({}_{6}\)H\({}_{12}\)O\({}_{6}\)\(\rightarrow\) 2 C\({}_{2}\)H\({}_{5}\)OH + 2 CO\({}_{2}\)

Find the mass of ethanol that can be obtained from 45 g of glucose assuming 60% conversion of

glucose into ethanol.

Means 60% of 45g is used for the conversion

Mass of glucose used = 60/100 x 45 = 27 g

Amount of glucose used = \(\frac{27}{180}=0.15\) \(mol\)

C\({}_{6}\)H\({}_{12}\)O\({}_{6}\) \(\equiv\) 2 C\({}_{2}\)H\({}_{5}\)OH

Amount of ethanol formed = 0.15 x 2 = 0.3 mol

Mass of ethanol formed = 0.3 x 46 = 13.8 g From 200 tonnes of propene (C\({}_{3}\)H\({}_{6}\)), the manufacturer obtained 150 tonnes of propan-2-ol (C\({}_{3}\)H\({}_{6}\)O).

Calculate the percentage yield.

\(\rm C_{3}H_{6}+H_{2}O\to C_{3}H_{6}O\)

1 tonne = 1000kg = 1x10\({}^{6}\) g

Amt of propene = 200000 / 42 = 4761.9 mol

\(\rm C_{3}H_{6}\equiv C_{3}H_{6}O\)

Theoretical Amt of propanol = 4761.9 mol

Theoretical mass of propanol = 4761.9 x 60 = 285714 g

% yield = \(\rm\frac{{}^{150000}}{{}^{285714}}\) x 100% = 35.0%

A 10 g sample of impure ammonium sulfate was heated with excess sodium hydroxide. Ammonia gas and water were produced. The ammonia gas liberated was measured to be 2.4 dm\({}^{3}\). Calculate the percentage purity of ammonium sulfate in the sample.

(NH\({}_{4}\))\({}_{2}\)SO\({}_{4}\) + 2NaOH \(\rightarrow\) 2NH\({}_{3}\) + 2H\({}_{2}\)O + Na\({}_{2}\)SO\({}_{4}\)

Amt of ammonia = 2.4 / 24 = 0.1 mol

(NH\({}_{4}\))\({}_{2}\)SO\({}_{4}\equiv\) 2NH\({}_{3}\)

Amt of pure (NH\({}_{4}\))\({}_{2}\)SO\({}_{4}\) = 0.1 / 2 = 0.05 mol

Mass of pure (NH\({}_{4}\))\({}_{2}\)SO\({}_{4}\) = 0.05 x 132 = 6.6g

% purity = 6.6 / 10 x 100% = 66.0%

What volume (in cm\({}^{3}\)) of 0.2 mol/dm\({}^{3}\) hydrochloric acid is required to react completely with 25cm\({}^{3}\) of 0.2 mol/dm\({}^{3}\) aqueous sodium carbonate?

2HCl + Na\({}_{2}\)CO\({}_{3}\) + 2NaCl + CO\({}_{2}\) + 2H\({}_{2}\)O

Amount of Na\({}_{2}\)CO\({}_{3}\) = \(\rm\frac{{}^{25}}{{}^{1000}}\)x0.2 = 0.005 \(mol\)

2HCl \(\equiv\) Na\({}_{2}\)CO\({}_{3}\)

Amt of HCl = 0.005 x 2 = 0.01 mol

Volume of HCl = 0.01 / 0.2 = 0.05 dm\({}^{3}\) = 50.0 cm\({}^{3}\)

6 A 300mg sample of acetylsalicylic acid (Mr = 180) is dissolved in some water. This acetylsalicylic acid solution requires 16.70 cm\({}^{3}\) of 0.100 mol/dm\({}^{3}\) aqueous sodium hydroxide for complete neutralization.

Calculate the number of moles of acetylsalicylic acid required to react with one mole of aqueous sodium hydroxide.

Amount of NaOH = 16.7/1000 x 0.1 = 0.00167 mol

Amount of acid = 300 x 10\({}^{3}\) / 180 = 0.001666 mol

0.001666 mol of acid reacts with 0.00167 mol of NaOH.

Therefore 1 mol of acid reacts with 1 mol of NaOH.

* 7. 18.0 cm\({}^{3}\) of 0.2 mol/dm\({}^{3}\) H\({}_{2}\)SO\({}_{4}\) reacts with 24.0 cm\({}^{3}\) of KOH solution. Calculate the conc. of KOH in (a) mol/dm\({}^{3}\) (b) g/dm\({}^{3}\) (a) H\({}_{2}\)SO\({}_{4}\) + 2KOH \(\rightarrow\) K\({}_{2}\)SO\({}_{4}\) + 2H\({}_{2}\)O  Amount of H\({}_{2}\)SO\({}_{4}\)= 18/1000 x 0.2 = 0.0036 mol  H\({}_{2}\)SO\({}_{4}\) \(\equiv\) 2KOH  Amount of KOH=0.0036 x 2 = 0.00720 mol  Concentration of KOH = 0.0072 x \(\frac{1000}{24}\) = 0.300 \(mol/dm^{3}\) (b) Concentration of KOH in g/dm\({}^{3}\) = 0.300 x (\(39+16+1\)) = 16.8 \(mol/dm^{3}\)
