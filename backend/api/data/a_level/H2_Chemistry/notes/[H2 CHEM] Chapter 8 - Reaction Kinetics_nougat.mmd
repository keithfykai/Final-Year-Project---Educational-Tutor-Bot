RATE CONSTANT

Rate Constant (\(\mathbf{\delta}\)) is the constant of proportionality in the reaction. It is affected by both temperature and catalyst.

The larger the k, the faster the reaction.

RATE-DETERMINING STEP

It is the slowest step in the reaction mechanism.

SINGLE-STEP REACTION

A reaction that only consist of one elementary step

The reaction mechanism only have one step, which the rate-determining step

The rate equation is identical to the stoichiometric equation

MULTIPLE-STEP REACTION

A reaction that take place by two or more steps

The reaction mechanism consist of two or more elementary steps

The rate equation is not identical to the stoichiometric equation

The rate equation is obtained from the rate-determining step, the slowest step in the reaction mechanism with the highest \(E_{n}\)

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:17]

**Step 1 - If the question did not specify which step is the slow step, try to make Step 1 in the reaction mechanism as the slow step using the rate equation**

**Step 2 - Subtract the reactants in the slow step from the stoichiometric equation to get the reactants and intermediates required for the remaining fast step**

**Step 3 - Write out the equation with reference to the products from the stoichiometric equation**

## Collision Theory

A chemical reaction only occurs if _(1)_ particles collide _(2)_ the collision occur with sufficient energy to overcome \(E_{s}\) (3)_ collision must be at the correct orientation -- **Effective Collision**

The **more finely divided** the reactant is -- the **greater** its surface area -- the **number of collision sites** increase -- the frequency of collision increase -- the frequency of effective collision increase -- rate increase -- the frequency of effective collision increase -- rate increase -- Note: this applies for solids

When **concentration** increase, the **number of reactant particles per unit volume increase** -- the number of sites for collision increase -- the **frequency of collision** increase -- the **frequency of effective collision** increase -- rate increase** -- Note: for liquids, and the order of reaction w.r.t the reactant is **NOT** zero. When **pressure** increase, the **number of gaseous reactant particles per unit volume increase** -- the number of sites for collision increase -- the **frequency of effective collision** increase -- rate increase** -- Note: for gases

**FACTOR 3: Temperature**

When temperature increase, the average kinetic energy of reactant particles increase hence increases the fraction of particles with energy \(z\)\(E_{s}\) -- the frequency of collision also increase -- the frequency of effective collision increase -- rate increase

_Note: a change in temperature usually increases the rate of reaction significantly, as temperature also affects the rate constant._

**Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution curve:**

_Things to note when drawing the Maxwell-Boltzmann curve:_

_The peak shift right as temperature increase and shift left as temperature decrease_

_The distribution curve broadens when there is a greater spread of kinetic energies as temperature increase_

_Shaded area = fraction of particles with energy \(z\)\(E_{s}\)_

**Properties of a Catalyst:**

1. Remained unchanged in quantity at the end of the reaction
2. Just a small amount is usually sufficient to bring about a rapid increase in the rate of reaction
3. Increases the rate constant
4. It alters the reaction mechanism and hence the order and rate equation

_Note: catalyst never appear in the stoichiometric equation, but they may appear in the rate equation if they take part in the rate determining step_

**FACTOR 4: Catalyst Types of Catalyst:**

1. Homogeneous Catalyst - catalyst and reactants are of the same phase

2. Heterogeneous Catalyst - catalyst and reactants are of different phase

3. Auto-Catalyst - product of the reaction act as the catalyst

4. Enzymes - proteins in a biological system

**FACTOR 4: Catalyst - Homogeneous Catalyst**

**Mode of Action:**

Step 1 - It takes part in the chemical reaction by converting into an intermediate

Step 2 - The intermediate then undergoes the reaction to form the products and the catalyst is regenerated**

**Mode of Action:**

**Step 1 - The reactants adsorbed onto the active site on the surface of the catalyst.**

**Asorption is facilitated by the formation of weak bonds between the active sites of the catalysts and the reactants**

**Step 2 - Reaction between the reactants at the surface of the catalyst.**

**The adsorption of the reactants to the catalyst surface weakens the covalent bonds within the reactant molecules.**

**This decreases the activation energy required for the reaction as lower amount of energy is now required to overcome the chemical bonds within the reactants.**

**Asorption of the reactants to the catalyst surface also increases the local concentration of reactants.**

**Step 3 - The products (and remaining reactants) then described from the surface of the catalyst.**

**Mode of Action:**

The product acts as the catalyst.

Initially the reaction will be slow as it is not catalysed (no products formed)

As products formed, they act as the catalyst hence increasing the rate of reaction.

Towards the end of the reaction, although a lot of product (catalys) are present, the concentration of the reactants has decreased and hence the rate of reaction decrease.

**Racettion**

**FACTOR 4: Catalyst - Enzymes**

**Mode of Action:**

Step 1 - Substrates bind to the **active site** of the enzyme, forming an enzyme-substrate complex

Only substrates of the **correct shape** can bind to the enzyme

Step 2 - Reaction occur within the enzyme-substrate complex

Similar to homogeneous catalyst, the **bonds within the reactant molecules are weaken during the formation of the enzyme-substrate complex

Step 3 - The products then leave the enzyme

As the **products** formed have a **different shape**, they are now unable to bind to the active sites of the enzymes, breaking the enzyme-substrate complex

The enzyme is now free to accept another substrate for another reaction* Graph is a straight line initially \(\sim\) At low [substrate] not all active sites of the enzymes are occupied, hence reaction is 1st order w.r.t substrate Graph plateaus off \(\sim\) At high [substrate] all active sites of the enzymes are occupied, hence any changes in [substrate] will not affect the rate and thus is zero order w.r.t substrate
* **Concentration of Enzyme** As [enzyme] is usually very small as compared to [substrate], rate of reaction is usually 1st order w.r.t enzyme
* **Temperature** Enzymes operate at an optimum temperature. Any temperature that is too high or too low will lower the rate.
* **pH** Enzymes only work well over a narrow pH range. Enzymes will be denatured outside the range of pH values.
* **Presence of inhibitors** Certain compounds have similar shape as the substrates hence they might compete with the substrate to bind to the active site of the enzymes
