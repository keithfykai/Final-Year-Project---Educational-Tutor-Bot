## 6 Real Gas Law

IDEAI GAS

An ideal gas is a hypothetical gas that obeys the ideal gas equation under all conditions of temperature and pressure.

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:13]

## 6 Pressure

* At low Pressure:
* At low pressure, the gas particles are far apart and can be considered to have negligible volume compared to the volume of the container (linked to assumption 1)
* At low pressure, the intermolecular attractive forces between the widely spaced apart gaseous particles are negligible (linked to assumption 2)
* At high Pressure:
* At high pressure, the gas particles are packed closer together and hence occupies a significant volume as compared to the volume of the container (linked to assumption 1)
* At high pressure, the gas particles are closer together hence the intermolecular attractive forces between the closely spaced gaseous particles are significant (linked to assumption 2)INTERMOLECULAR FORCES OF ATTRACTION

## DALTON'S LAW OF PARTIAL PRESSURE

In a mixture of **non-reacting gases**, the **total pressure** of the mixture is equal to the **sum** of the partial pressures of all the individual gases in the mixture. For a mixture containing gases A, B and C:

\[\begin{array}{l}\mbox{$\mathsf{p_{total}}$}=\mbox{$\mathsf{P_{A}}$}+\mbox{$ \mathsf{p_{B}}$}+\mbox{$\mathsf{P_{C}}$}\\ \end{array}\]

Using Ideal Gas Equation

\(\mbox{$\mathsf{p}$}\vee=\mbox{$\mathsf{nRT}$}\)

\(\mbox{$\mathsf{n_{T}}$}\frac{\mbox{$\mathsf{RT}$}}{\mbox{$\mathsf{v}$}}=\mbox{$ \mathsf{n_{A}}$}\frac{\mbox{$\mathsf{RT}$}}{\mbox{$\mathsf{v}$}}+\mbox{$\mathsf{ n_{B}}$}\frac{\mbox{$\mathsf{RT}$}}{\mbox{$\mathsf{v}$}}+\mbox{$\mathsf{n_{C}}$}\frac{ \mbox{$\mathsf{RT}$}}{\mbox{$\mathsf{v}$}}\\ \mbox{$\mathsf{n_{T}}$}=\mbox{$\mathsf{n_{A}}$}+\mbox{$\mathsf{n_{B}}$}+\mbox{$ \mathsf{n_{C}}$}\end{array}\)

Therefore, the **total number of moles** of the non-reacting mixture is equal to the **sum** of the individual number of **moles** of gases in the mixture.

\[\mbox{$\mathsf{p_{A}}$}=\frac{\mbox{$\mathsf{n_{A}}$}}{\mbox{$\mathsf{n_{total }}$}}\times\mbox{$\mathsf{p_{total}}$}\]

Question: A 6.0 dm\({}^{3}\) of sample at 25\({}^{o}\)C and 2.00 atm of pressure contains 0.5 mol of a gas. If an additional 0.25 mol of gas at the same pressure and temperature are added, what is the final total volume of the gas?

_Answer: 9.00 dm\({}^{3}\)_

Question: A 20 L cylinder contains 6 atm of gas at 27\({}^{o}\)C. What would the pressure of the gas be if the gas was heated to 77 \({}^{o}\)C?

_Answer: 7 atm_

Question: A sealed balloon was filled with 100 cm\({}^{3}\) of helium at sea level with a pressure of 1.01 x 10\({}^{8}\) Pa and a temperature of 27\({}^{o}\)C. if was brought to the top of a mountain where the atmospheric pressure is 8.0 x 10\({}^{4}\)Pa and the ambient temperature is -10\({}^{o}\)C. what would be the volume of the balloon at the top of the mountain?

Question: A weather balloon filled with helium gas has a volume of 2.00 x 10\({}^{3}\) m\({}^{3}\) at ground level where the atmospheric pressure is 1.00 atm and the temperature is 27\({}^{o}\)C. After the balloon rises high above the earth to apoint where the atmospheric pressure is 0.400 atm, its volume increases to 4.00 x 10\({}^{3}\) m\({}^{3}\). What is the temperature of the atmosphere at this altitude?

_Answer:_ -33\({}^{o}\)C

Question: A glass of cola is fizzy because the carbon dioxide has been dissolved in it under pressure. When the cola is poured out of the can, the carbon dioxide is gradually released as bubbles of gas. The cola will eventually go flat, as the concentration of dissolved carbon dioxide decreases to its saturation level. A 500 cm\({}^{3}\) can of cola has 2.0 g of carbon dioxide dissolved in it under pressure. Calculate the volume of carbon dioxide that it released to the atmosphere as it goes flat.

_Answer:_ 683\({}^{o}\)

Question: 4 g of methane occupies a volume of 6.25 dm\({}^{3}\) at a particular temperature and pressure. Calculate the volume of the same mass of hydrogen under the same conditions.

_Answer:_ 0.05 m\({}^{3}\)
