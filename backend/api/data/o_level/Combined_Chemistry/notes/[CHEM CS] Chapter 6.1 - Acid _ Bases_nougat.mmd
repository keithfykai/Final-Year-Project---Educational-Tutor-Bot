## 3 CHEMICAL REACTIONS

For example.

1) ACID + METAL \(>\) SALT + HYDROGEN GAS

2) ACID + BASE \(>\) SALT + WATER

3) ACID + CARBONATE \(>\) SALT + WATER + CARBON DIOXIDE GAS

For example.

\(\text{H}_{5}\text{O}_{+}\)MgO \(>\) MgSO\({}_{+}\)H\({}_{2}\)

In order to test for hydrogen gas, use a lighted spint, it should extinguish with pop' sound.

For example.

\(\text{H}_{5}\text{O}_{+}\)MgO \(>\) MgSO\({}_{+}\)H\({}_{2}\)

This is also known as a **neutralisation** reaction.

\(\text{3}\text{ACID}_{+}\)METAL

For example.

\(\text{H}_{5}\text{O}_{+}\)MgO \(>\) MgSO\({}_{+}\)H\({}_{2}\)O + CO\({}_{2}\)

In order to test for carbon dioxide gas, bubble the carbon dioxide gas into timeweater, Ca(H)H\({}_{2}\) a white precipitate will be formed.

### 6.1 The PH scale

The PH scale is a quantitative measure of the extent of acidity or alkalinity. The pH scale ranges from 0 to 14. pH actually stands for,

\[\text{pH}=-\log\left[\text{H}+\right]\]

To simplify, means that if pH values change by a factor of 1, the concentration is changed by a factor of 10.

pH 1 is 10 times more acidic than pH 2.

Importance of pH

Food preservatives

Food decompose when it is attacked by bacteria.

Edible acids added and are used as preservatives as bacteria cannot grow well in acidic solutions.

_For example._

ethanic acid (integer): to preserve vegetables like kimchi

pH levels in soil

If the soil is too acidic, limestone, also known as calcium carbonate CaCO\({}_{y}\) can be added to neutralise the acidity.

Quick lime (CaO) or slaked lime, Ca(OH\({}_{2}\)) can be used too.

pH in human body

Gastric juices in the stomach are acidic due to hydrochloric acid, with a pH of 1.5-2.0.

Fluids in the small intestine are alkaline with a pH of 8+.

Blood is slightly alkaline with a pH in the range of above 7.
