* **Mutually exclusive events** are events that **cannot happen at the same time**. If \(A\) and \(B\) are mutually exclusive, then: \[P(A\,or\,B)=P(A)\,+\,P(B)\] EXAMPLE

A fair die is rolled. The probability of getting \(\alpha\)\(2[P(A)]\) is \(\frac{1}{6}\), and the probability of getting \(\alpha\)\(5[P(B)]\) is \(\frac{1}{6}\). Since getting \(\alpha\)\(2\) and getting \(\alpha\)\(5\) is mutually exclusive: \[P(A\,or\,B)=\frac{1}{6}+\frac{1}{6}=\frac{2}{6}\] \[P(A\,or\,B)=\frac{1}{3}\]

* **Independent events** are events where the occurrence of one event does **not affect the probability of the other**. If \(A\) and \(B\) are independent, then: \[P(A\,and\,B)=P(A)\times P(B)\]

You flip \(\alpha\) fair coin and roll \(\alpha\) fair die. The probability of getting heads \([P(A)]\) is \(\frac{1}{2}\), and the probability of rolling \(\alpha\)\(6[P(B)]\) is \(\frac{1}{6}\), \[P(A\,and\,B)=\frac{1}{2}\times\frac{1}{6}=\frac{1}{12}\]

* **If two events **can** happen at the same time, we use: \[P(A\,or\,B)=P(A)\,+\,P(B)\,-\,P(A\,and\,B)\] EXAMPLE

A card is drawn from \(\alpha\) deck. Let \(A\) be the event of drawing \(\alpha\) heart \(\left[P(A)=\frac{13}{52}\right]\) and B be the event of drawing \(\alpha\) face card \(\left[P(B)=\frac{12}{52}\right]\). Since 3 of these face cards are also hearts, \[P(A\,and\,B)=\frac{3}{52}\] \[P(A\,or\,B)=\frac{13}{52}+\frac{12}{52}-\frac{3}{52}=\frac{22}{52}\] \[P(A\,or\,B)=\frac{11}{26}\]
