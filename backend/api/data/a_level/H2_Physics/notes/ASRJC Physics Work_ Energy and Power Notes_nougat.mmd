The _work done by a force_ is _negative_ if the applied force has a component in a direction opposite to the displacement. e.g. work done by friction.

When the displacement of the object is perpendicular to the line of action of the force, the work done on an object is zero.

**Example 1**

A boy pulls a 70 kg crate 40 m along a horizontal floor with a constant force of 100 N, which acts at an angle of 37\({}^{\circ}\) as shown below. The floor is rough and exerts a frictional force of 50 N.

Thinking Process:

What are the all the forces acting on the crate? Are there additional forces present that are not stated by the question?

Is the question asking for **net work done** or **work done by **each force?**

Is net force / each force / parallel to displacement?

If net force / each force is not parallel to displacement, what do we need to do to find work done?
## Appendix A Appendix

### Graphical Method for Determining Work Done by a Varying Force

Work done by a Force

Under

When the force varies with respect to the displacement, the work done is represented by the area enclosed under the _Force-displacement_ graph.

Recall, from the topic Forces, the _Force-extension_ diagram for an elastic object that obeys Hooke's Law.

* The elastic potential energy stored in the elastic object is a result of work done by the force and is given by area under the graph.
* In this case, the work done, or elastic potential energy stored, is Work done = \(\%\)\(F_{1}\)\(x_{1}\)\(=\)\(\gamma_{2}\)\((k\,x_{1})\)\(x_{1}\) = \(\gamma_{2}\)\(k\,{x_{1}}^{2}\) where \(k\) is the spring constant.
* In the case where the force applied is constant, and in the direction of the displacement, the work done is simply \(F\)s.

Notes

### Potential Energy

Potential energy is defined as the stored energy of an object to do work as a result of its position or shape.

Potential energy is a property of the _system_, not the _object_.

(A _system_ is a collection of objects or particles interacting via forces or processes that are internal to the system)

We will learn about three types of potential energy (PE):

1. Elastic potential energy or strain energy is the stored ability of object to do work as a result of its shape. It is the potential energy stored in a material as a result of deformation of an elastic object, such as the stretching or compression of a spring, stretching a bow.
2. Electric potential energy is the stored ability of object to do work as a result of its charge and position. It is due to interaction between charges. The forces involved can be attractive or repulsive. Like charges repel; unlike charges attract. Consider a system consisting of a small positive charge located at some distance from a positively charged sphere. If you push the small positive charge closer to the sphere, you will need to do work to overcome the force of repulsion between them. Work done on the small charge by this external force results it to gain PE. We call the energy that the system gain as electric PE.
3. Gravitational potential energy (GPE) is the stored ability of an object to do work as a result of its mass and position. It is due to the interaction between masses. The forces involved are attractive in nature.

Gravitational Potential Energy Near the Surface of Earth

For an object above the ground near the surface of the earth, the change in gravitational potential energy \(\Delta U\) stored in the object relative to the around is given by

\[\Delta U=mgh\]

where \(m=\) mass of the object, \(h=\) height of the object above the earth's surface, \(g=\) gravitational acceleration = 9.81 m s\({}^{-2}\) near the earth's surface.

**ANDERSON SERANGOON JUNIOR COLEGE**

**PHYSICS 9749**

Derivation of \(\Delta U=mqh\)

* Consider an object of mass \(m\) in a uniform gravitational field being lifted up by a force \(F\) to height \(h\) above the ground with constant velocity.
* From the definition of work, work done by the force \(F\) is the product of the force and the displacement in the direction of the force \(\therefore Work done,\ W\) = Force \(\mathbf{x}\) displacement = \(F\mathbf{x}\)\(h\)
* Since magnitude of force \(F\) = weight of object (as object moves at constant velocity) Hence, \(W\) = weight of object \(\mathbf{x}\)\(h\) = \(mgh\)
* The gravitational potential energy **gained** is equal to the **work done by the force \(F\) to **move the object to height \(h\)**.
* Therefore, change in gravitational potential energy, \(\Delta U=W=mgh\)
* GPE is a relative and not an absolute measure. It tells us the amount of work needed to move an object from some arbitrarily chosen reference point (for instance, the ground) to the position it is presently in.
* The ground is **usually** assigned to be the "zero gravitational potential energy level".
* If the tabletop is assigned as the zero GPE level, then the potential energy of an object is based upon its height relative to the tabletop, i.e. the object would be assigned positive GPE if positioned above the tabletop and negative if below the tabletop.
* This formula assumes that \(g\) is constant throughout the height \(h\). Near the earth's surface, \(g\) is fairly constant.

## Appendix C Conservation of Energy

In everyday usage, 'conservation' means saving. In physics, 'conservation' is applied to a quantity that remains strictly constant.

### C.1 Principle of Conservation of Mechanical Energy

The Principle of Conservation of Mechanical Energy is a special case of the more general Principle of Conservation of Energy, when dissipative forces such as friction is negligible.

Mathematically,

Kinetic Energy, KE + Potential Energy, PE = Total Energy, \(E\) of which \(E\) is constant.

Conservation of mechanical energy also means that

Total initial KE and PE = Total final KE and PE

\(OR\)

Loss in PE = Gain in KE

### Example 4

A metal ball suspended from a rope 1.00 m swings from point A to the point B (the bottom of its arc). Air resistance is negligible.

(a) Calculate the difference in height, \(h\), from A to B.

(b) Determine the speed of the ball when it is at the position B if the ball has an initial speed of 1.20 m s\({}^{-1}\) at position A.

### In the Presence of Dissipative Forces

* In the presence of dissipative forces (e.g. friction) in a closed system, mechanical energy is not conserved.
* Some of the total mechanical energy of the system is lost as work done against dissipative forces: \[\text{KE}_{i}+\text{PE}_{i}=\text{KE}_{i}+\text{PE}_{i}+\text{Work done against dissipative forces}\]
* Total energy in the system is still conserved as the "lost" mechanical energy is converted into _internal energy_ of the system.

### Example 5

A truck tows a 500 kg storage container at constant speed from level ground to a warehouse on a slope, inclined at 25\({}^{\text{o}}\) to the horizontal as shown below. The force experienced in the tow bar is 4000 N. The warehouse is 200 m above ground level.

### Example 6

## Appendix D Power and Efficiency

### Definition of Power

* Power is a scalar quantity.

**Definition:** Power is the work done per unit time.

* Power is also interpreted as the rate of transfer of energy, \(E\). Hence, \[\text{Power}=\frac{dE}{dt}\ =\ \frac{dW}{dt}\] where \(W\) can also be the _energy_ converted or _expended_.
* The SI unit for power is the _Watt_ (_W_) or _Joules_ per second (_J_ s_-1_).

### Derive Power as the product of _Force_ and _velocity_

* Consider a _constant driving force_ \(F\) exerted on a body that moves with _constant velocity_ \(v\).

* Work done by \(F\) in moving the body through a distance _dx_ is given by _dW_ = \(F\) dx
* Hence, power \(P\) delivered by \(F\), \[P=\frac{\text{d}W}{\text{d}t}=\frac{F\text{d}x}{\text{d}t}=F\nu\] \[P=F\nu\] Power = _Force_ **x** _velocity_
* If the direction of the force required by the question is opposite to \(v\) (e.g. friction), the expression then gives the rate at which the required force removes energy from the system.

### Average Power

* When a quantity of work \(\Delta W\)is done during a time interval \(\Delta t\), average power, \(<P>\) = \(\frac{\text{total work done}}{\text{total time taken}}\) = \(\frac{\Delta W}{\Delta t}\)
* If a constant force \(F\) acts through a distance \(\Delta x\) for a time \(\Delta t\), then average power, \(<P>\) = \(\frac{\text{total work done by }F}{\text{total time}}\) = \(\frac{\Delta W}{\Delta t}\) = \(\frac{F\Delta x}{\Delta t}\) = \(F<\nu>\)
* Thus, average power = Force \(\times\) average velocity \(<P>\) = \(F<\nu>\)
* Note that \(\nu\) need not be constant to use the above expression for average power.

### Instantaneous Power

* As \(\Delta t\to 0\), instantaneous power \(P=\frac{\text{d}W}{\text{d}t}\) = \(\frac{F\text{d}x}{\text{d}t}\) = \(F\nu\)
* instantaneous power = instantaneous Force \(\times\) instantaneous velocity.
* Instantaneous power at a specific time \(t\) can be determined from the gradient of energy-time graph at the time \(t\).

### Check Your Understanding 3

What is the maximum power generated at any instant during these first 5 seconds?

**Solution**

### Efficiency

* In machines, due to inevitable work done against frictional forces, the energy conversion can never be 100%.
* Using the Principle of Conservation of Energy, energy input = useful energy output + energy wasted
* The efficiency of a machine in its conversion of energy from one form to another is defined as: \[\begin{array}{c}\text{efficiency, }\eta\ =\ \frac{\text{useful energy output}}{\text{total energy input}}\times 100\%\\ \end{array}\]
* Alternatively, in terms of power, \[\begin{array}{c}\text{efficiency, }\eta\ =\ \frac{\text{useful power output}}{\text{total power input}}\times 100\%\\ \end{array}\]

(b) The mass flow rate in this generator is 1.2 \(\mathbf{x}\)\(10^{6}\) kg s\({}^{-1}\). Determine the height that the water is falling from.

**Solution**

- what information are we given in the question that would help with calculating the input power?

- how is the height of water falling from related to energy/power?

What concept has to be applied to relate the two quantities?

### Energy costs

* The kilowatt hour is another unit for energy.
* 1 kWh is the amount of energy used when 1 kW of energy is used for 1 hour.
* Hence, 1 kWh = 1000 W x 1 hr = 1000 W x 3600 s = 3, 600, 000 J
* The use of electricity is usually charged by kWh.

**Example 10**

An electric cooker has a power rating of 5000 W

* How much energy is used in 30 min? Express your answer in kWh.
* How much will it cost to run the cooker for 30 mins if electrical energy costs 16 cents per kWh?
