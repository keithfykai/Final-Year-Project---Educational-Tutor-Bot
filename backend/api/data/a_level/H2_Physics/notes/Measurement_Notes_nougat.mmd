## 1 Importance of Measurement

Scientific knowledge is powerful because it is not just untested theory and hypotheses. Scientists demand that the theories be supported with empirical evidence or measurements. For example, Einstein's General Relativity theory suggested that gravity can bend the path of light but our ultimate confidence in the theory is whether the bending can be measured and checked against the amount predicted by the theory.

Measurement is about quantifying things and the ability to quantify things allows calculations, analyses and deductions which in turn lead to new knowledge or theories. Once a theory is well supported by empirical data, it then can be used for predicting outcomes or results. To understand what the big deal about prediction is, let's just consider the construction of a high rise building which costs millions of dollars. An architect will carry out calculations to make sure the designed building can withstand the expected loading and maybe possible earthquake. Those calculations are done using theoretical formulae that have been verified with prior measurements!

## 2 SI System of Quantities & Units

For measurements to be useful, they need to be expressed in terms of appropriate units which are internationally accepted.

All other quantities are called derived quantities as they are ultimately defined in terms of the 7 base quantities using defining equations. The same equations are also used to work out the corresponding derived units.** \\ \end{tabular}

In the SI system, the same set of equations is used to express derived quantities or units in terms of the base quantities or units.

Note also that _quantities_ are always defined in terms of _quantities_ and _units_ are always defined in terms of _units_ i.e. quantities and units are _different_ entities. Hence it would be wrong to define _speed_(a quantity) as 'the _distance_(a quantity) travelled per _second_(a unit)'.

Another example is the use of mega-watt or MW when referring to power output of power stations. \\ \hline \multicolumn{2}{|c|}{**Examples of Non-SI units \& Conversion Factors**} \\ \hline Length & - inch (") & 1 " = 0.0254 m or 2.54 cm \\ Speed & - knot (kn) & 1 kn = 0.514444 m s\({}^{-1}\) \\ Energy & - electronvolt (eV) & 1 eV = \(1.6\times 10^{-19}\) J \\ Pressure & - bar (bar) & 1 bar = \(10^{5}\) Pa \\ Time & - minutes (min or ') & 1 min = 60 s \\ Time & - hour (h or hr) & 1 h = 3600 s \\ Volume & - litre (L or l) & 1 L = \(10^{3}\) m\({}^{3}\) or 1000 cm\({}^{3}\) \\ \hline \end{tabular}

Why are units important?

Without one, a measurement value is a pure number that does not tell us how much of what quantity we have and thus is a useless number. In addition, failure to pay attention to the kind of units used is a very common reason for students getting wrong values in calculations. Some people paid dearly for such mistakes. In 1999, NASA's Mars orbiter smashed into the planet's atmosphere because their engineers failed to convert English bound of force into SI newton in their calculations.

How to handle units in equations?

Rule 1: All _terms_ in an equation must have the same units. _Terms_ refer to quantities forming a group by multiplication or division and each group is separated from others by + - or = sign. For example, _s = ut_ + _% a_f_f is made up of three terms s, _ut_ and _% a_f_f and if s is to be in cm, then numerical values substituted must yield cm for both terms _ut_ and _% a_f_f_.

* Attention must be paid to the conversion factors when _multiples_ or _submultiples_ of base units or when _non-SI units_ are used in calculations so that all terms will have consistent units. In contrast, using _only SI base_ and _SI derived_ units does not introduce any numerical factor into the equations. Examples: The net force required to give a 2 kg mass an acceleration of 3 m s\({}^{2}\) is calculated by _Fnet_ = _mA_ = 2(3) = 6 N but the net force required to give a 2 kg mass an acceleration of 3 cm s\({}^{2}\) is definitely not calculated by _Fnet_ = _mA_ = 2(3) = 6 N. The latter case's numerical value of 6 is not 6 N of force but should be 6 kg cm s\({}^{2}\) of force and 1 N is not the same as 1 kg cm s\({}^{2}\). Given a particle of mass 1.7 \(\times\) 10\({}^{27}\) kg with KE 3 eV and desiring to find the speed in m s\({}^{-1}\) using _KE_ = _% mV_, one must convert eV into J using the appropriate conversion factor.

## 3 Errors and Uncertainties

Definitions

Measurement error = Measured value - True value

In the majority of cases, the true value is unknown. However, many reference values have been established through careful measurements so that engineers and scientists can compare their measured values against these reference values instead. Measurement error is made up of two components: Systematic and Random. Measurement error = Systematic error + Random error

Systematic error is one which is constant or varies in a predictable way when the measurement is repeated.

Random error is one which varies in unpredictable manner when the measurement is repeated. Relationship between one particular measured value, true value and the two component errors:

For calculations using numerical values in _multiples_ or _submultiples_ of _units_ and _non-SI units_, their conversion factors should be used to make the units on both sides of the equation the same.

Origins of random error could be:

1. Apparatus have unpredictable fluctuations which in turn may be due to random fluctuations in environmental conditions. e.g. vibrations, fluctuating temperature, pressure, electric and magnetic fields.
2. Experimenter's randomness in interpreting reading or carrying out procedures. e.g. reaction time in using stopwatch, not placing load at exactly the same spot as required, not measuring length from exact same point perhaps due to difficulty in placing ruler right next to it.
3. Property to be measured has random nature. e.g. radioactive decay, voltage inherently fluctuates due to fluctuating environmental conditions, diameter of wire varies along wire.

Origins of systematic error could be:

1. Apparatus have predictable errors. e.g zero error, a fixed extension of string for a given load, faulty stopwatch which consistently runs fast, calibration markings which are closer than what they should be, electrical circuit heats up after prolonged usage.
2. Experimenter may interpret reading or carry out procedure with a consistent error. e.g. measuring length of pendulum from suspension point to the tip instead of centre of bob, marking out a wrong height on a ramp to release a ball, leaving a mercury thermometer bulb at the bottom of a beaker close to the heat source and not stirring.

### Handling Measurement Errors

Understanding how the errors arise allows us to better manage them. As seen above, each type of error can have a number of contributing factors. In principle, the total systematic error can be eliminated if we can identify all the causes. The problem is that they are difficult to detect especially if true or reference values are not available.

On the other hand, total random error cannot be completely eliminated but only reduced. Some contributions such as experimenter's inconsistent way of carrying out the steps or the poor set up of equipment might be eliminated or reduced with better technique. For example, parallax error when a ruler is not placed right next to the start and end points but separated by a gap. The gap causes the experimenter to estimate the start and end points on the ruler, thereby causing random error. When all that can be done has been done, the component of random error that cannot be removed would be the error that is due to the interpolation between scale markings.

For a single measurement without a true value for reference, we can never know the amount of random error except the contribution linked to the smallest scale marking. With repeated measurements, we get a better idea of the amount of random error. With many measured values, the individual random errors will follow a normal distribution as shown above. The _representative random error_ or _uncertainty_ is taken to be the _standard deviation \(\sigma\) of the errors_. As calculation of \(\sigma\) is not required at 'A' level, it is enough to know that \(\sigma\) varies as \(1/\sqrt{N-1}\) which means that the larger the number of readings \(N\) the smaller the _uncertainty \(\sigma\)_. For 'A' level, it is enough to _estimate \(\sigma\) based on the amount of fluctuation from the mean_.

The table shows 6 pairs of measurements of some length, average values and deviations \(\Delta L\) from the means. Ideally more repeated measurements is better but minimum expectation for 'A' level is to repeat once. Even then, the \(\Delta L\) can still give a very rough idea of \(\sigma\):We see that _aL_ is from 0.15 to 0.35, pointing to random error contributions besides the 0.1 cm associated with the ruler's smallest division. Estimation of \(a\) is about 0.25 or 0.3 cm. To conclude, when repeated measurements are available, we take the mean value to be a representative or reliable value of the measured quantity and _\(\sigma\)_ to be the uncertainty; where _\(\sigma\)_ is like the mean of the random errors.

Note that the uncertainty _\(\sigma\)_ is not exact; hence there is no sense in quoting its value with more than 1 significant figure (s.f.). Thus knowing the uncertainty allows us to record the value of our measured quantity with a meaningful number of s.f. For example, the measured quantity in row 1 is represented by the mean value 4.85 cm but since the error _\(\sigma\)_ is 0.3, the digit 8 is uncertain. The digit 5 has place value of 0.01 compared to place value 0.1 for digit 8. Digit 5 is thus less significant than 8. With digit 8 being uncertain, we should only record the final measurement as 4.9 \(\pm\) 0.3 cm.

## 4 Precision Vs Accuracy

Precision is a measure of the closeness of measured values when a measurement is repeated.

The word precision is used to describe _measured values_ as well as the _instrument_. A higher precision corresponds to a smaller spread of values about the mean i.e. smaller random errors or _\(\sigma\)_.

Accuracy is a measure of the closeness of a measured value to the true value or reference value.

Accuracy is thus poor if the systematic error is large.

Measure measured value in **A** is more accurate than in **B** but equally precise 

## 5 Propagation of Random Errors in Calculations

Measured values are often called raw data. Assuming that systematic errors have been eliminated, there are still random errors that are impossible to eliminate, and we would expect the uncertainty to propagate to the calculated values. So how do uncertainties propagate in calculations? The answer is that it depends on the type of mathematical operations involved.

There are two basic types of math operations (\(\Delta a\), \(\Delta b\), \(\Delta c\) are uncertainties of the raw data and \(R\) is the calculated result):

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:7]

## 7 Estimation of Quantities

Estimating the value of a quantity in a given situation is very useful for quickly spotting mistakes in calculations.

Example:

A student is told that a sealed container of volume 0.25 m\({}^{3}\) contains 10 mol or 6.02 \(\times\) 10\({}^{22}\) molecules. He tried to calculate the diameter of each molecule as follows.

Volume occupied by each molecule \(4\pi r^{2}/3=0.25/(6.02\times 10^{22})\) radius \(r=10\times 10^{-9}\) m diameter = \(2.0\times 10^{-8}\) m

If he had known that the typical size of an atom is about 10\({}^{10}\) m, then the calculated answer will immediately look wrong as it is 200 times bigger than 10\({}^{-10}\) m.

No typical values specified by the syllabus but some suggested values are:

\begin{tabular}{|l|c|} \hline Quantity & Typical value \\ \hline Size of atom & 10\({}^{-10}\) m \\ Height of Mt. Everest & 8 km \\ Time for a human to sprint 100 m & 10 s \\ Mass of a car & 1000 - 2000 kg \\ Density of water & 1 g cm\({}^{-3}\) \\ Atmospheric pressure at sea level & 10\({}^{5}\) Pa \\ Power of kettle & 1 - 2 kW \\ Power consumption of filament bulb and LED & 60 W, 50 mW \\ Household socket maximum current & 13 A \\ Accelerating voltage in X-ray machine & 10 kV \\ Visible light wavelength & 400 - 800 nm \\ \hline \end{tabular}

You can estimate some quantities indirectly if you know how they are related to other quantities. For example, the height of a HDB block is the number of storeys \(\times\) height of each storey which can be estimated more easily. The mass of water in a 1 m\({}^{3}\) container = 10\({}^{6}\) cm\({}^{3}\times\) 1 g cm\({}^{3}\) = 10\({}^{6}\) g or 1000 kg.

## 8 Scalars and Vectors

A scalar is a quantity which only has a magnitude but no direction

A vector is a quantity which has a magnitude and a direction.

Note that a vector cannot be specified with just a number, because a single number cannot tell us its direction. There are many ways to specify or describe a vector. Some examples are:

1. Add a description to a number e.g. 5 N pointing North, 2 m s\({}^{-1}\) with bearing 120\({}^{\circ}\), 6 m s\({}^{-1}\) at an angle of 60\({}^{\circ}\) with respect to the horizontal.
2. Draw an arrow whose length tells us the magnitude and the direction is as indicated by the arrow.
3. If the vectors are all either pointing one way or directly opposite, then + and - sign can be used to indicate the two opposite directions. For example, if + 5 m displacement is to the right then - 5 m is to the left.

Drawing accurate arrows on paper is a neat way to specify a vector. A well-drawn scale diagram can help us find the result of addition or subtraction of vectors. If only a rough sketch is drawn, it is still very useful as it allows us to make use of trigonometric functions, sine rule and cosine rule and Pythogoras Theorem to calculate the result of addition or subtraction.

### Vector Subtraction

At 'A' level, there will be frequent encounters of vector subtraction because some common quantities are defined in terms of change of vectors. For example, acceleration is defined as rate of change of velocity \(\frac{\Delta\vec{V}}{\Delta t}\). It is also very frequent that students wrongly subtract vectors as if they are just magnitudes. Since the _direction_ associated with vectors cannot be subtracted numerically, the correct way is to use a vector diagram to keep track of the subtraction of both magnitude and direction. Vector subtraction is built upon the following two concepts:

1. negative of a vector
2. vector addition

Example of Vector Subtraction

A ball approaches a slanted wall with a horizontal velocity of 30 m s\({}^{-1}\). After hitting the wall, it rebounds with a velocity of 20 m s\({}^{-1}\) in a direction at an angle of 60\({}^{\circ}\) with the horizontal. Find the change in velocity.

By definition \(\Delta\vec{V}=\vec{\nu}_{f}-\vec{\nu}_{i}\)

\(\Delta\vec{\nu}=\vec{\nu}_{f}+\vec{x}\)   where \(\vec{x}=-\vec{\nu}_{i}\)

Using the vector diagram, the magnitude of \(\Delta\vec{V}\) can be found using cosine rule:

\(\left|\Delta\vec{\nu}\right|^{2}=30^{2}+20^{2}-2(30)(20)\cos 120^{\circ}\)

\(\left|\Delta\vec{\nu}\right|^{2}=43.6\,\mathrm{m}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}\)

To find \(\theta\) so that the direction of \(\Delta\vec{\nu}\) can be specified, sine rule can be used:

\(\frac{\sin\theta}{20}=\frac{\sin 120^{\circ}}{\left|\Delta\vec{\nu}\right|}\)

\(\theta=23^{\circ}\)

\(\therefore\) change in velocity is 44 m s\({}^{-1}\), at an angle of 23\({}^{\circ}\) with the horizontal.

Resolution of a Vector

_Resolution_ of a 2D vector \(\vec{R}\) refers to finding a pair of vectors which when added will produce the vector \(\vec{R}\). There are actually an infinite number of pairs of vectors that when added will give \(\vec{R}\). However, a particular kind that is most useful in Physics is a perpendicular pair.

For example, the force \(\vec{F}\) acting on a block on a slope can be _resolved_ into _components_\(\bar{\bar{a}}_{i}\) & \(\bar{\bar{a}}_{i}\) or into the pair \(\bar{b}_{i}\) & \(\bar{b}_{i}\) or any other pair according to the _purpose_ of resolution.

The reason for choosing perpendicular components is because they are _independent_, which allows analysis and calculations to be done for a specific direction involving only the relevant components. A simple example is the force \(\vec{F}\) on the block above. The acceleration along the slope is only affected by the component \(\bar{\bar{h}}_{i}\) and not \(\bar{\bar{b}}_{i}\).

The magnitude of a component is frequently needed in terms of the magnitude \(R\) of the original vector. The components' magnitudes can be found using the definitions of sine and cosine.
