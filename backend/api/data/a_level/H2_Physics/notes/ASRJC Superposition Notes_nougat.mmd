## Appendix A Principle of Superposition

In this topic we are concerned with the interaction between two or more waves. What happens when two or more waves meet?

The Principle of Superposition states that when two waves meet at a point, the resultant displacement is equal to the vector sum of the individual displacements.

The waves must be of the same type (ie. light and sound wave cannot superpose but light and x-rays can) and if they are transverse waves, the direction of their polarisation must be the same.

## Appendix B Two-Source Interference

### _Key Term: Interference_

When two or more waves overlap and interact, we say they interfere with each other.

**Interference** is an effect that occurs when two or more waves **overlap** to produce a new wave pattern, i.e. a change in amplitude.

#### **B.1.1 General patterns using water waves - Mapping path differences**

Fig. 1 below shows a time-freeze diagram of waves from two sources, S\({}_{1}\) and S\({}_{2}\). The two sources are _coherent_, and are in phase (phase difference = 0).

**Key term: Coherence**

Coherent sources are sources which produce waves of the **same frequency** with a **constant phase difference**. Waves produced by coherent sources are therefore coherent.

**Coherence** is used to indicate two waves that have a **constant phase difference**.

\begin{tabular}{c c}  & **Note that it is** \\  & **incorrect to** \\  & **use "same** \\  & **phase** \\  & **difference"** \\  & **to describe** \\  & **coherent** \\  & **sources** \\  & **which has** \\  & **"constant** \\  & phase \\  & difference". \\ \end{tabular}

Wavefronts connecting crests and troughs of waves from each source are drawn. When two waves travel along paths of unequal length to meet at a point (eg. Point C), there is a _path difference_ between the waves from their respective sources to that point.

**Key term: Path difference**

Path length is the distance travelled by a wave from its source to a point.

When waves from two sources meet at a point, the _difference_ in their respective path lengths is called **path difference**.

In the figure above, the path difference for the waves to meet at C is 6A - 4A = 2A.

At which points in Fig. 1 are the path differences 0, \(\forall\)A, \(\lambda\), 3/2 A or 2A?

This path difference can be used to tell the _phase difference_ of the waves when they arrive at the point.

**Key term: Phase difference**

* A measure of how much one wave is out of step with another. A phase difference of one cycle corresponds to 360\({}^{\circ}\) or 2\(\pi\) radians
* Two waves are said to meet in phase when they have a phase difference of 2\(\pi\)n, where n = 0, 1, 2,...

**ANDERSON SEARONON JUNIOR COLEGEG**

**WITSICS 9749**

* Two waves are said to meet in antiphase when they have a phase difference of (2n+1)\(\pi\), where n = 0, 1, 2,...
* Phase difference is related to path difference: \[\text{phase difference}=\frac{\text{path difference}}{\text{wavelength}} \times 2\pi(\text{+ phase difference between sources})\] The phase difference when waves meet at point C is hence 4\(\pi\), which means they meet in phase. At which points in Fig. 1 are the phase differences 0, \(\pi\), 2\(\pi\), 3\(\pi\), or 4\(\pi\)? At which of these points do the waves meet in phase, or antiphase?

The phase difference between waves when they meet at a point will determine _how they interfere_ with each other.

**Key term: Constructive interference**

When waves from two or more sources arrive at a point in phase, they reinforce each other: The amplitude of the resultant wave is the _sum_ of the amplitudes of the individual waves, giving rise to a maximum resultant amplitude. This is called **constructive interference**.

\[\begin{array}{c}\text{two waves meet in phase}\\ \end{array}\]

\[\begin{array}{c}\text{resultant wave}\\ \end{array}\]

Therefore, at point C where the waves meet in phase, constructive interference occurs, resulting in a maximum resultant amplitude. At which other points in Fig.1 do constructive interference occur?

**Key term: Destructive interference**

When waves from two or more sources arrive at a point exactly a half-cycle out of phase: The amplitude of the resultant wave is the _difference_ of the amplitudes of the individual waves, giving rise to a minimum resultant amplitude. This is called **destructive interference**.

\[\begin{array}{c}\text{two waves meet out of phase}\\ \end{array}\]

\[\begin{array}{c}\text{resultant wave}\\ \end{array}\]

\[\begin{array}{c}\text{at which points in Fig.1 do destructive interference occur?}\\ \end{array}\]

## Appendix B Appendix

### General conditions for two-source interference

Note: Two waves must always meet in phase for constructive interference to occur, irrespective of the phase difference difference between the two sources.

**For steady observable interference**

Two waves must always must always meet in appearance of the phase difference between the two sources.

**For steady and observable interference patterns, the following conditions must be met: interference to occur, irrespective of the phase difference between the two sources.**

**For steady and observable interference patterns, the following conditions must be met: interference to occur, irrespective of the phase difference between the two sources.**

**For transverse waves, they must either be unpolarized, or polarized in the same plane.**

**Examples of coherent sources include: a single laser beam passing through 2 slits; 2 speakers fed by the same source; and 2 dippers attached to one oscillator.**

### Application to Microwaves (wavelength ~1 mm - 1 m)

**Example 1**

**Two coherent microwave sources A and B are in phase with one another. They emit waves of equal amplitude and of wavelength 30 mm. They are placed 140 mm apart and a distance 810 mm from a line along which a detector is moved.**

**(a)**: Determine if the intensity of microwaves received by the detector at P is high or low. **(b)**: Determine the number of locations where high intensities will be detected as the detector moves from P to Q, a point directly opposite source B. **(a)**: **Step 1: Calculate distance AP, BP and the path difference**: **Step 2: Express the path difference in terms of multiples of wavelength**: **Step 3: Use the table on page 10 to conclude whether constructive or destructive interference has taken place and hence whether intensity will be a maximum or minimum.**

Physics 9749

that coincide with nodal lines are points where destructive interference took place, resulting in minimum intensity or dark fringes. The explanation for constructive and destructive interference in pages 7 and 8 are applicable, as they are for all cases of two-source interference.

The bright and dark fringes alternate with one another, much like how antinodal and nodal lines alternate.

* When the distance from the slits to the screen (\(D\)) is much larger than the slit separation (\(a\)), i.e. \(a<<D\), the fringes are evenly spaced and fringe separation \(x\) is approximately where \(x=\frac{\lambda D}{a}\) where \(x=\) fringe separation i.e. distance between 2 adjacent bright fringes (or 2 dark fringes) \(a=\) slit separation \(D=\) the distance from the double slits to the screen \(\lambda=\) wavelength of the light (of the order of 10\({}^{-7}\) m for visible light) _The derivation of this equation is not required by the syllabus, and can be found in the appendix._
* An example of typical dimensions used for such an experiment would be \(a=1\) mm, \(D\approx 3\) m. When light of \(\lambda=630\) nm is used, it results in x = 2 mm.
* This equation is valid for any type of two-source interference, provided \(a<<D\).

Purpose of double slit

The double slit plays an important role - the interference pattern would not be observed if two identical laser sources were to be used in place of the double slits to provide for two-source interference.

* Light is emitted from sources as a series of pulses or packets of energy, each lasting for a very short time, about a nanosecond (10\({}^{-9}\) s). Between each pulse there is an abrupt change in the phase of the waves in a random manner. Waves from two separate light sources may be in phase in one instant, but out of phase in the next. Hence, separate light sources, even of the same frequency, produce incoherent waves.
* When a single laser beam enters a double slit, waves emitted from the two slits will always be in phase, so the two slits act as coherent sources.
* As waves spread after passing through each slits (more on this in the next Section), this spreading allows waves from the two slits to overlap and undergo interference.

\begin{tabular}{c c}  & Coherent: \\  & Constant phase difference between 2 waves \\  & & Coherent: \\  & Phase difference between random wave is \\  & constant. \\  & & Incoherent: \\  & The phase difference is different as the \\  & sources are independent of each other. \\ \end{tabular}

#### b.4.2 Young's double slit experiment using filament lamp

When a white light source such as a filament lamp is used, a single slit is required to be placed between the light source and the double slit.

Light from this source is diffracted (spread) at the single slit, producing wavefronts that reach both slits of the double slit.

This ensures the double slit act as coherent sources, thus creating a sustained and observable interference pattern.

_Nature of Science_

_Physicists have long debated and proposed different models of light, such as the wave model proposed by Christian Huygens in 1690 and the particle model proposed by Isaac Newton in 1704. The first experimental evidence came from Thomas Young who in 1803 (a hundred years later) conducted an experiment that is now named after him, showing that light behaved as waves by undergoing interference. The wave theory thus became the dominant theory, although later in 1905 (another hundred years later), Albert Einstein showed that new evidence demonstrated light could behave as a particle tool More of that in the topic Quantum Physics to be taught next year._

_This is an example how science is an evidence-based, model-building enterprise concerned with the natural world. Scientists require the use of both logic and creativity in proposing new models and testing them against their predictions. Also, scientific knowledge is reliable - able to provide accurate predictions that can be tested, yet subject to revision in the light of new evidence._

**Example 2**

In a Young's double slit experiment, a coherent monochromatic blue light of wavelength 4.0 x 10\({}^{7}\) m illuminates two narrow parallel slits separated by 0.50 mm. A white screen is placed 2.0 m away from the slits, as shown below.

* When light beam of wavelength \(\lambda\) passes through a single slit of width \(b\), the angle \(\theta\) between the perpendicular to the slit and a line from the center of the slit to the first minimum is given by \[\sin\theta=\frac{\lambda}{b}\]
* The general condition for destructive interference for single slit diffraction is given by \[\text{b sin }\theta=\text{m}\lambda\text{ where m }=\pm\text{1, }\pm\text{2, }\pm\text{3... }\text{ (order of minima)}\]

Like in two-source interference, we can use superposition to explain the positions of the minima in the single slit diffraction pattern. But, in two-source interference, there are two sources producing waves that can interfere and undergo superposition. How can a wave produced by a single slit undergo superposition?

To appreciate how this can work out, you need to be introduced to Huygens' Principle (not in syllabus). According to Huygen's Principle, every point along a wavefront acts as a point source that produces waves coherently with other point sources along the same wavefront. For a single slit of a finite width, we can see it as having many point sources along the width of the slit.

The waves from these point sources overlap and, when they meet on the screen with phase differences that cancels out each other's individual displacements, destructive interference occurs, resulting in minimum intensity.

You may refer to the appendix for a detailed derivation of the equation above. This derivation is not required by the syllabus.

### Example 3

A laser light of wavelength 650 nm is passed normally through a narrow slit. A screen placed parallel to the slit 5.8 m away from the slit. An interference pattern is formed on the screen. The distance between the centers of the first minima outside the central bright fringe is 27 mm.

Determine the width of the slit.

**ANDERSON SEARANGOON JUNIOR COLLEGE**

**PHYSICS 9749**

#### c.1.2 Variation of the single-slit diffraction pattern with slit width

From the equation \(\sin\,\theta=\frac{\lambda}{b}\), it is clear that as slit width decreases, the angle of the 1st order minimum increases.

The diagrams below show the intensity of the wave detected for varying slit sizes. (Intensities are not drawn to scale.)

 Note that the degree of spreading of the wave as it passes through the slit is larger when the wavelength gets closer to the slit width.

Also, the maximum intensity decreases with decreasing slit width.

**Example 4**

[MISSING_PAGE_POST]

## Appendix C.2 Diffraction is a general wave phenomenon

In the previous section you learnt that when a wave passes through a single slit, a diffraction pattern is formed. This is really surprising and unintuitive - if we hadn't learnt this topic, we would expect the wave to pass through without spreading, and form a bright image on the screen that is exactly the same size as the slit. Except it does not happen.

This behaviour is called _diffraction_, and is a general wave phenomenon.

### Key Term: Diffraction

_Diffraction_ is the **spreading of waves** when they pass through an opening or round an obstacle. Diffraction effects are the greatest when the **width of the opening** is **comparable with the wavelength of the waves**.

* The **speed, frequency and wavelength** of the waves **remain unchanged** after diffraction.
* Diffraction is an important characteristic of waves. It is **one of the defining characteristics of a wave**.

### Resolving Power and Rayleigh Criterion

Diffraction has far-reaching implications for image formation by optical instruments, since light waves will diffract when they pass through a slit (eg. camera aperture or pupil of the eye) and form a diffraction pattern on the screen (eg. film/sensor of camera or retina of the eye). When we have two point objects, their images are not two points, but two diffraction patterns. The size of the central maximum of the diffraction pattern thus imposes a limit on resolution.

* When the objects are sufficiently spaced apart, the central maximum of their diffraction patterns do not overlap, so their images can be distinguished from each other, as illustrated below.

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:20]

## Anderson Serangoon Junior College

Physics 9749

### Improving Resolution

* Resolution is said to improve when \(9\) decreases (less diffraction, narrower central maximum) as that means that the angular separation between the \(2\) objects can be smaller, but yet the images can still be resolved.
* Since \(0\approx\lambda/b\), resolution improves: (i) With shorter wavelengths E.g. Ultraviolet microscopes have higher resolution than visible-light microscopes; (ii) With larger aperture sizes E.g. In a human's eye, the maximum pupil diameter is about \(5\) mm; in an eagle's eye it is about \(9\) mm. For distant point sources,: \(\frac{b_{\text{eagle}}}{b_{\text{human}}}=\frac{9}{5}\) \(\frac{9_{\text{eagle}}}{b_{\text{human}}}=\frac{5}{9}\), i.e. better resolution of images on the eagle's eye

**ANDERSON SEARANGOON JUNIOR COLEGEG**

**WITSICS 9749**

**Example 5**

Under certain lighting conditions, the diameter of the pupil of a student's eye is 4.0 mm. With one eye, she is able to just resolve the images of two small light sources of wavelength 640 nm which are placed 3.0 mm apart at one end of a large assembly hall.

**(a)** Determine the maximum distance from which the student can just resolve the images of the two sources.

**(b)** The sources are then replaced by another pair of sources, separated by the same distance but emitting light of wavelength appreciably less than 640 nm. Determine the direction the student should move so that she can again just resolve the images of the two sources.

### Interference of light waves (Revisited!) - intensity of the double slit interference pattern

* In section C.1.1, we learnt that when a light wave passes through a single slit whose width is of the order of the wavelength of the light wave, a single slit diffraction pattern is observed, as shown below. We let the peak intensity of the central bright fringe be \(I_{0}\).
* Now we pass a light wave through two of such slits (a double slit), where the slit separation is small compared to the distance from the slits to the screen. The double slit diffraction pattern is shown right below the single slit diffraction pattern for ease of comparison. What do you observe in terms of the positions of the dark fringes of the single slit diffraction pattern? **Intensity of single slit diffraction pattern**

### Intensity of double slit interference pattern

* As the intensity of the single slit diffraction pattern decreases from the central maximum towards the first minimum, the intensity of maxima of the double slit interference pattern decreases accordingly.
* there is an absence of bright fringes at those positions. We can use the principle of superposition to explain the features of the intensity graph, as given below.
* At the **central bright fringe**, waves from the two slits arrive in phase and interfere constructively. If both waves have amplitude A, the resultant wave will have amplitude A + A = 2 A.

anderson Serangoon Junior College

Physics 9749

Intensity is proportional to the square of amplitude of the wave. Hence, at the central bright fringe, the intensity of the resultant fringe is four times that of the individual waves, ie \(A\ I_{0}\).

B. When wavefronts arrive in antiphase and interfere destructively, the resultant amplitude is zero. Hence, this gives rise to zero intensity at the dark fringes.

C. Due to single slit diffraction pattern, these are positions where the wave from each slit will arrive and interfere destructively to result in zero amplitude (ie. minima in single slit diffraction pattern). Hence, regardless of the path difference of the two waves from the double slits, the resultant amplitude at these positions is always zero. This gives rise to dark regions due to diffraction pattern.

**Note:**_Interference_ and _diffraction_ are both _superposition_ effects, in that they result from the combining of waves with different phases at a given point. If the combining waves originate from a finite number of elementary sources, the process is called interference. If the combining waves originate in a single wavefront, the process is called diffraction. This distinction between interference and diffraction is a convenient one; both are superposition effects and usually both are present simultaneously.

Hence, when there are two or more slits, the intensity pattern on the screen is due to the combination of both the diffraction and interference effects.

Recall from earlier section (sin\(\theta\) = \(\lambda\) / \(b\)), when the width of slits is decreased, the central bright fringe of the single-slit diffraction pattern broadens. When this happens for both slits, the interference fringes will be of approximately equal intensity.

## 5 Anderson Serangoon Junior College

Physics 9749

### Diffraction of water waves

You learnt in previous sections that a wave undergoes diffraction when it passes through a slit. This effect can be demonstrated using by observing water waves in a ripple tank.

* A straight dipper produces plane waves, which can be observed on the screen below the ripple tank.
* When plane water waves pass through a gap of width a much larger than their wavelength \(\lambda\), there is no observable diffraction effect. As the width \(b\) starts to decrease, the ends of the emerging waves become rounded out at the ends. When \(b\) is made about the same size as the \(\lambda\), the emerging waves are much more spread out and rounded. Hence, for observable diffraction effort, \(b\approx\lambda\).
* For a more detail explanation of the spreading of waves as it passes through an aperture, refer to Appendix. *

Notes 9749

### Diffraction of White Light

* Since \(d\sin\ \theta_{n}=n\lambda\), for the same order \(n\), waves with longer wavelength \(\lambda\) will be diffracted more than waves with a shorter wavelength. Thus red light (with \(\lambda\) = 700nm) will have a larger diffraction angle compared to blue light (with \(\lambda\) = 400nm).
* White light is a combination of light of different colours. When white light passes through a diffraction grating, a spectrum of all seven colours is obtained for each order, except at the zeroth order.
* Consecutive higher-order spectra can also overlap.

### Example 8

In the spectrum of white light obtained using a certain diffraction grating, the second order and third orders partially overlap. What wavelength in the third-order spectrum will appear at the angle corresponding to a wavelength of 650 nm in the second-order spectrum?

**ANDERSON SEARARSOON JUNIOR COLLEGE**

**PHYSICS 9749**

**Relating Science and Society**

_In this Section, we learnt that if we pass light of a known wavelength through a grating of unknown grating spacing, we can gain knowledge of the unknown grating's structure (grating spacing) by analysing the diffraction pattern (angles of diffracted rays) and applying the known relationship between wavelength of light, diffraction pattern and structure of the grating._

_Similarly, one could pass X-ray of known wavelength through molecules of unknown structure, and gain knowledge of its structure by studying the diffraction pattern of the X-ray. This was done by Rosalind Franklin in 1953 on DNA molecules, thus making a ground-breaking first evidence of the helical structure of the DNA molecule. X-ray diffraction went on to play an important role in the subsequent advances in molecular genetics._

## Appendix E Stationary Waves

* these waves formed are called stationary waves or standing waves.
* The wave is termed "stationary" because although the particles still oscillate, the wave profile does not seem to propagate.
* Energy is stored rather than transmitted along the wave.

### **Formation of Stationary Waves**

* A stationary wave is formed when 2 identical progressive waves (same amplitude, frequency and speed) travelling in opposite directions towards each another superpose, resulting in the formation of maxima (antinodes) and minima (nodes).

### Reflection of Waves at a Boundary

* We learnt that a stationary wave is formed when 2 identical progressive waves (same amplitude, frequency and speed) travelling in opposite directions towards each another superpose. How can we produce 2 such identical progressive waves?
* One possible way for this to occur is when a wave is reflected at a boundary.
* When a progressive wave encounters a boundary, reflection occurs.
* The reflected wave has the same frequency, speed and amplitude as the incident wave and travels in a direction opposite to that of the incident wave.
* Depending on the nature of the boundary, the reflected wave is either in phase or in antiphase when compared to the incident wave.
* Upon hitting a fixed and rigid boundary, the reflected wave is 180\({}^{\circ}\) out of phase with the incident wave.
* Upon hitting an open boundary, the reflected wave is in phase with the incident wave.

In the next section, we shall look at how stationary waves can be formed using microwaves, strings and air columns through reflection of a progressive wave at a boundary.

#### 5.6.1 Demonstration of Stationary Waves using Microwaves, String Waves and Air Columns

#### Microwaves

The experimental set up is as shown below.

* As the detector moves along the path, the strength of the received signal will fluctuate between a series of maxima (antinodes) and minima (nodes).
* Measure the average distance between pairs of minima (two 'lows' of radiation or nodes).
* The wavelength of the microwave is twice the distance between adjacent minima.

Sound waves travelling in an air column can be reflected off its ends. The incoming and reflected waves can form stationary waves within the air column. The experimental set up is as shown below.

* The speaker driven by a function generator produces a single frequency sound wave.
* The plunger that can be slid back and forth to vary the effective length of the column of air in the tube (to form a one-end open, one end closed pipe) or be completely removed (to form a both-ends open pipe).
* The frequency of the sound wave can be increased from a low value until it reaches the resonant frequency. A stationary wave will then form, and a loud sound will be heard. This is called the fundamental mode of vibration.
* Similarly, if the frequency is further increased, stationary waves can also be formed at higher frequencies.

_Note: A node forms at the closed end of the pipe, as there can be no vibration of air molecules. An antinode forms at the open end of the pipe, as the amplitude of vibration of air molecules is a maximum._

* Consider a stationary sound wave (a longitudinal wave) being set up in a pipe with one end closed.
* When a stationary wave is formed in a pipe, we learnt earlier that a **loud sound would be heard/detected outside the pipe** as resonance has occurred.
* If a microphone is placed **within the pipe*
* and moved along the air column, the strength of the received signal will fluctuate between a series of maxima and minima.
* At the displacement node, the air molecules will be alternately squeezing that point during part of the cycle, and expanding away from it in another part of the cycle.
* The pressure variation at that point is the greatest, so a displacement node is also a pressure antinode.
* At the displacement antinode, the air molecules in the region will be moving with maximum displacement in the same direction with surrounding molecules, and are not changing their separation relative to the surrounding molecules.
* The pressure variation at that point is the smallest, so a displacement antinode is also a pressure node.
* Microphones work by detecting pressure variation in the air, instead of displacements of air molecules. The larger the pressure variation, the larger the signal detected. Thus, the maxima and minima detected by the microphone correspond to pressure antinodes and pressure nodes respectively.

Considering A to be a point of constructive interference,

path difference between the two rays of light from \(\mathsf{S}_{1}\) and \(\mathsf{S}_{2}\) to A on the screen,

\(\mathsf{S}_{2}\) A - \(\mathsf{S}_{1}\) A = \(\lambda\) = \(\mathsf{S}_{2}\)B

If angle \(\mathsf{S}_{2}\)S,B = \(\theta\), then \(\sin\theta=\frac{\mathsf{S}_{2}\mathsf{B}}{\mathsf{S}_{1}\mathsf{S}_{2}}= \frac{\lambda}{\theta}\)

But the diagram shows that \(\sin\theta=\frac{\mathsf{AO}}{\mathsf{AP}}\).

Since \(\theta\) is very small (in practice AO is about 2 mm while OP is about 1 m) AP \(\approx\) OP,

\(\sin\theta=\frac{\mathsf{AO}}{\mathsf{OP}}\).

Since OP = \(D\) and AO = \(x\), then \(\frac{\lambda}{\theta}=\frac{x}{\mathsf{OP}}=\frac{x}{D}\).

Hence

\(x=\frac{\lambda D}{\theta}\)

Where \(x\) = the distance between 2 adjacent bright fringes (or 2 dark fringes) (m) \(a\) = slit separation (m) \(D\) = distance from the double slits to the screen (m) \(\lambda\) = wavelength of the light (m)

## Appendix B: Derivation of the 1st order minimum of a single slit

Derivation of 1st order minimum of a single slit

* When monochromatic light passes through a single slit of width \(b\),
* At the slit, according to Huygens's principle, each portion of the slit will act as a source of light waves. These sources will cause an interference pattern.
* For simplicity, we are drawing 6 points, 3 in the upper half of the slit and 3 in the lower half of the slope.
* When the screen is very far away from the single slit, the light from the point sources may be considered to be parallel to each other.
* If we consider two points which are a distance of \(\dfrac{b}{2}\) as indicated by the black dots, At the first minimum where destructive interference occurs, the waves from these two sources must have a path difference of \(\dfrac{\lambda}{2}\).
* Path difference = AB = \(\dfrac{\lambda}{2}\)
* Since sin \(\theta\) = \(\dfrac{AB}{AC}\), we have sin \(\theta\) = \(\dfrac{\dfrac{\lambda}{2}}{b}\), Therefore, the expression given is

where \(b\) = slit width

\(\lambda\) = wavelength of monochromatic light

\(\theta\) = angle between the 1st order minima and the normal to the slit.

## Appendix C: Diffraction

In representing progressive waves, a wavefront diagram is often used.

direction of energy transfer

The figure above is an example of a plane progressive wave. The lines representing the wavefronts show locations where all particles along the wavefront are in phase. Usually for ease of thinking, the wavefronts show the crest (or trough) of the wave. The distance between each wavefront is the wavelength \(\lambda\).

According to Huygen's Principle, every point along the wavefront acts as a source of secondary wavelets (in other words every point along a wavefront acts as a point source), giving rise to their own outward-spreading circular wavelets. All these wavelets spread and _superpose_ to produce the resulting wavefront. Figure (a) below is an example of imagining multiple point sources along the wavefront. (There should be an infinite number of point sources but 7 is sufficient to see the effect.)

Figure (b) above shows the effect of drawing how each point source sends the waves out radially (as seen by the circle), it is not difficult to see that the point sources still causes a tangential line whereby all points along that point are in phase. This means that the combined effect of the point sources will still be planar.

However, when the plane waves path is blocked by a slit of width \(b\), we will notice that in this case, the spreading of the wavefronts will occur. The curvature arises as a result of the missing contributions which are now blocked by the walls of the slit. The wave is now spread out by the restriction imposed by the slit. This spreading effect is known as diffraction.

## Appendix D: Diffraction Grating

For maximum intensity, path difference BC must be an integral number of wavelengths.

Since \(\sin\theta=\frac{BC}{AB}\), we have \(\sin\theta=\frac{n\lambda}{d}\)

* A parallel beam of monochromatic light, after emerging from the collimator, is incident normally on the diffraction grating. As a result, bright fringes are produced at various angular positions.
* The telescope is first rotated such that the \(n^{\mathrm{th}}\)-order bright fringe is at the centre of the crosswire and its angular position \(\theta_{i}\) is noted. It is then positioned on the opposite side of the normal to the grating and its angular position \(\theta_{2}\) is noted.
* The average diffraction angular position of the \(n^{\mathrm{th}}\)-order bright fringe can then be obtained to a greater precision and accuracy.

Refer to the section on

**resolving power** in page 19 of

the lecture notes.

When viewed at a distance, the

two patterns in this page look

identical, but as you approach

them, there is a point at which

you can barely resolve the lines

and tell the difference between

the two images. From this

distance L, you can calculate

the angular resolution of your

eyes.

Or, just have fun, compare

distance L with that of your

peers or family members, and

see the effects of diffraction

come to life. \(\copyright\) Just remember,

you learnt it in the topic of

Superposition! :D
