**Average speed** is the total distance travelled over a period of time.

Formula:

**Average speed = Total Distance / Total Time**

**Instantaneous speed** is the speed at a specific point in time.

**Total Distance = Area under graph**

\(=(\texttt{b}\times\texttt{2}\times\texttt{10})+(\texttt{4}\times\texttt{10})+( \texttt{b}\times\texttt{2}\times\texttt{10})+(\texttt{b}\times\texttt{4}\times \texttt{10})\)

**= 80m**

**Average speed = 80m** / 12s

**= 6.67 ms**

***Area of graph in negative region is in the reverse direction**

**What is the average velocity of the car at 1s is 5 ms**

**.**

**Acceleration**

**Acceleration is the rate of change of velocity with respect to time.**

**What is the acceleration of the car in the first 2 seconds?**

**Acceleration = change in velocity / time**

**What is the acceleration of the car between 2s - 6s?**

**The car is travelling at constant velocity, hence there is no acceleration.**

**Describe what is happening to the car from 6s to 12s.**

**From 6s to 8s, the car starts to decelerate, reducing its velocity from 10ms\({}^{+}\) to 0ms\({}^{+}\).**

**At the 8s mark, the car is at rest momentarily before moving in the opposite direction. As it is reversing, it speeds up to reach -10ms\({}^{+}\).**

**At 10s, the car slows down while traveling in the opposite direction before coming to rest at 12s.**The formulas below are very helpful when it comes to solving certain questions. Which formula to use depends on what variable is provided by the question.

\begin{tabular}{c} \(\nu=u+at\) \\ s = \(\nu=2\) (\(\nu+yt\) \\ \(\nu=u+2as\) \\ \(s=ut+1/2at^{2}\) \\ \end{tabular}

Alternatively, if this is too complicated, questions can still be solved by drawing the graph and working out the solution accordingly.

But as you can see in the example later, the graphical method is more tedious and can get complicated.

\begin{tabular}{c} \(\nu=u+at\) \\ s = \(\nu=u+at\) \\ \(\nu=u+2as\) \\ \(s=ut+1/2at^{2}\) \\ \end{tabular}

## Appendix A Air Resistance

Air resistance is a frictional force that opposes the motion of moving objects due to collision with air particles present in the air.

Air resistance increases with the speed/surface area of the object.

### Terminal Velocity

Air resistance increases when velocity increases. Therefore when an object falls through a long distance in air, eventually **the air resistance will be equal to the weight of the object.**

The **resultant force on the body is zero and there will be no acceleration**. (F=ma)

The object will then continue its fall at constant velocity. This constant velocity is also known as **terminal velocity**.
