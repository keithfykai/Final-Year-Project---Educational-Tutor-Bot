absorption of oxygen

1. The alveolar air contains a higher concentration of oxygen than the blood, **oxygen dissolves in the moisture lining the alveolar walls** and then diffuses into the blood capillaries.
2. Oxygen combines with the **haemoglobin** in red blood cells to form **oxyhaemoglobin**.
3. This reaction is **reversible** depending on the amount of oxygen in the surroundings.
4. When the blood passes through oxygen-poor tissues, the **oxyhaemoglobin releases oxygen**, which will then diffuse through the walls of the blood capillaries into the cells of the tissues.

oxygen + haemoglobin -> oxyhaemoglobin

## 1 Introduction

The carbon dioxide produced by tissue cells due to respiration diffuses into blood plasma and then enters into red blood cells.

The carbon dioxide produced by tissue cells due to respiration diffuses into blood plasma and then enters into red blood cells.

In RBC, carbon dioxide reacts with water to give carbonic acid, catalysed by carbonic anhydrase.

Carbonic acid then dissociates into hydrogen carbonate ions/bicarbonate ions and hydrogen ions.

The hydrogen carbonate ions diffuse out of red blood cells, into the plasma. Carbon dioxide is mainly transported in the blood plasma.

A small amount of carbon dioxide is also carried and dissolved in the red blood cells.

## 2 The lungs

(e) Hydrogen carbonate ions diffuse back into red blood cells where they combine with hydrogen ions to form carbonic acid, then into water and carbon dioxide.

(f) The **carbon dioxide diffuses out of the blood into the alveolar space** where it is expelled during exhalation.

effect of smoking on health

## 5 Chronic Broochitis

* Chronic bronchitis is the inflammation of respiratory lining of the airways, caused by irritation
* Prolonged exposure to **tar and irritant particles** leads to **excessive mucus is secreted** by the epithelium.
* The cilia on the epithelium are paralysed thus **mucus and dust particles cannot be removed.**
* The **air passages become blocked**, making breathing difficult.
* **Persistent coughing** is needed to clear air passages, in order to breathe. This increases the risk of getting lung infections.

## 6 Emphysema

* **Persistent and violent coughing** due to bronchitis may lead to emphysema.
* **alveolar walls break down** due to persistent and violent coughing.
* This **decreased surface area** for gaseous exchange.
* Lungs lose their elasticity and reduce ability to expel air, causing severe breathlessness result.

## 7 Living Cancer

* Risk of lung cancer increases when a person smokes tobacco due to **carcinogens (tar) present**
* Cancer is the uncontrolled division of cells producing tumour.

**Key Concept**

**Aerobic Respiration**

**Anaerobic Respiration**

**aerobic respiration**

Word equation

_Glucose + Oxygen \(\longrightarrow\) Carbon Dioxide + Water + Energy_

Chemical equation

\(C_{6}H_{12}O_{6}+6O_{2}\longrightarrow 6CO_{2}+6H_{2}O+Energy\)

**in the presence of oxygen,** aerobic respiration can produce a large amount of energy

Site of aerobic respiration is **mitochondria**

Energy is needed

Synthesis complex molecules from simpler molecules i.e. proteins from amino acids

Synthesis of new protoplasm and genetic material for cell growth and division

Muscular contraction

Active transport

Transmission of nerve impulses

Maintenance of constant body temperature as heat is released during respiration

** anaerobic respiration**

**in yeast**

In yeast

_Glucose Ethanol + Carbon Dioxide + Energy (small amount) \(C_{6}H_{12}O_{6}\longrightarrow 2C_{2}H_{5}OH+2CO_{2}+Energy\) (small amount)_

* in contrast to aerobic respiration, anaerobic respiration occurs in the absence of oxygen and can only **produce a small amount of energy**
* does not require mitochondria
