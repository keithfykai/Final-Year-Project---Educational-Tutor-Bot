**Cell and Nuclear Division**

There are two different types of cell cycles: mitotic and meiotic. Cell cycles are tightly regulated at various checkpoints. The mitotic cell cycle is necessary for growth and repair while the meiotic cell cycle is necessary to generate gametes. Meiosis gives rise to genetic variation between gametes through crossing over of homologous chromosomes and the independent assortment of bivalents.

**Learning Outcomes**

Candidates should be able to:

* describe the events that occur during the mitotic cell cycle and the main stages of mitosis (including the behaviour of chromosomes, nuclear envelope, cell surface membrane and centrioles).
* explain the significance of the mitotic cell cycle (including growth, repair and asexual reproduction) and the need to regulate it tightly (knowledge that dysregulation of checkpoints of cell division can result in uncontrolled cell division and cancer is required, but details of the mechanism are not required)
* describe the events that occur during the meiotic cell cycle and the main stages of meiosis (including the behaviour of chromosomes, nuclear envelope, cell surface membrane and centrioles) (names of the main stages are expected, but not the sub-divisions of probleme).
* explain the significance of the meiotic cell cycle (including how meiosis and random fertilisation can lead to variation)

## 1 Cell and Nuclear Division

The basic unit of structure and function in living organisms is the **cell**. Cell division hence enables the **continuity of life** based on the production of cells.

In unicellular organisms, the cell division of one cell reproduces an entire organism. This is known as **asexual reproduction**.

In multicellular organisms, cell division enables **sexually reproducing** organisms to **grow and develop** from a single cell - the fertilised egg or zygote. After an organism is fully grown, cell division continues to function in **renewal and repair**, replacing cells that die from normal wear and tear. (**Fig.1**)

### Cell division

consists of:

1. **Nuclear division** * The process of separating **nuclear DNA** to daughter cells. * There are two types of nuclear division: (i) Mitosis which leads to the production of two identical cells (ii) Meiosis which leads to the production of gametes e.g. sperm and egg
2. **Cytoplasmic division (cytokinesis)** * The process of separating **cytokasm** and **organelles** to daughter cells.

Figure 1: Cell division results in the production of cells.

### Chromosome Number

The chromosome number is the number of chromosomes in **each cell** of an organism.

A karyogram (**Fig. 3**) shows all the chromosomes in a cell (in this case, a human male's somatic cell).

The chromosomes are sorted according to their sizes. We can observe that:

* there are **two sets** of chromosomes (maternal and paternal sets)
* chromosomes arranged in **homologous pairs**
* there are 22 pairs of **autosomes** and 1 pair of **sex chromosomes**

In human females, the **two sex chromosomes** are alike and known as **X chromosomes**. In males, there is **one X chromosome and one Y chromosome**.

Figure 3: Karyogram of a human male.

Figure 2: Chromosome number in organisms.

**Ploidy** refers to the **number of sets of chromosomes** within the nucleus of a cell.

**Haploid** cells, such as gametes/sex cells, have only **one** set of chromosomes, abbreviated as **n**.

**Diploid** cells have **two** sets of chromosomes in the nucleus. Human beings, most animals and many plants are diploid organisms since all the cells in the body are diploid except for their gametes.

In human, the common representation is: 2n = 46,

where:

* **n** is the **number of chromosomes in a set** (23 for humans)
* The **number written before n** indicates the **ploidy level** i.e. the number of sets. For humans, there are 2 sets of chromosomes where one set comes from the mother, the other set from the father.

Organisms with more than 2 sets of chromosomes are termed **polploid**. For example, triploid = 3n and tetraploid = 4n.

**Exercise**

Fill in the table below:

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|} \hline genetic & ploidy & number of sets of & number of chromosomes \\ \cline{2-3} representation & level & chromosomes & per set (n) & total \\ \hline n = 6 & & & \\ \hline
2n = 4 & & & \\ \hline
4n = 8 & & & \\ \hline
2n = 42 & & & \\ \hline
2n = 38 & & & \\ \hline
3n = 81 & & & \\ \hline \end{tabular}

### Human Life Cycle

The human life cycle begins when the **haploid sperm** from the father fuses with the **haploid ovum** from the mother. The union of gametes results in fusion of the nuclei called **fertilisation**. The resulting zygote (or fertilised egg) is now **diploid** because it contains two sets of chromosomes, one set from the father and the other set from the mother (**Fig. 4**).

### Human somatic cells

* **All somatic cells** are generated by **mitosis**.
* Each somatic cell has **2 sets** of chromosomes, one set originating from the father and the other from the mother.
* Hence somatic cells are **diploid (2n)**.
* Each set contains 23 chromosomes (n = 23).
* There will be **46 chromosomes** (2n = 2 x 23 = 46) in **total**.
* Somatic cells will thus have **23 homologous pairs** of chromosomes.

### Human reproductive cells

* **Gametes** (such as spermatozoa or ova) are produced only by **meiosis**.
* Gametes have only **1** set of chromosomes.
* Hence are **haploid (n)**.
* Each gamete carries 23 chromosomes (n = 23).
* This is to **maintain a constant number of chromosomes and prevent chromosomal doubling** in the next generation.

**9. Microtubules**: are **components of the cytoskeleton**. They are rigid hollow rods (also known as spindle fibre)
* Microtubules are dynamic structures made up of **globular proteins** known as **tubulin**.
* (FYI) Tubulin dimers polymerise to form microtubules, which generally consist of 13 linear protofilaments assembled around a hollow core and continual assembly and disassembly of the tubulins allow for microtubule formation. (Fig. 11)

An **organised system of microtubules** that **attaches to the centromeres** of duplicated chromosomes and **pulls them to** opposite **poles** of the cell during eukaryotic cell division (**Fig. 12**).

There are 3 types of microtubules that can be distinguished in mitotic animal cells:

1. **Astral microtubules / asters** * Radiate from the centriole towards the peripheral regions of the cells. * Only present in cells that contain centrioles. * Serve as a support for the functioning of the microtubules.
2. **Kinetochore microtubules** * Fibres attached to the **kinetochore**, which forms on the centromere of each chromatid. * Serve to attach the chromosomes to the spindle fiber. * Pull the sister chromatids towards the opposite poles of the cell during anaphase.
3. **Polar microtubules** * Fibres running from pole to pole **overlapping at the equator** of the spindle. * Responsible for elongating the whole cell along the polar axis during anaphase.

Fig. 11: (FYI) Dimers of \(\alpha\)- and \(\beta\)-tubulin polymerise to form microtubules, which are composed of 13 protofilaments assembled around a hollow core.

Fig. 12: **The mitotic spindle at metaphase. The kinetochores of a chromosomeâ€™s two sister chromatids face in opposite direction. Here, each kinetochore is actually attached to a cluster of kinetochore microtubules extending from the nearest chromosome. Polar microtubules overlap at the metaphase plate.**

## 3 The Cell Cycle

During growth, eukaryotic cells continually progress through the four stages of the **cell cycle** (**Fig. 13**), generating new daughter cells. It is the sequence of **growth**, **DNA replication**, **growth and cell division** that all cells go through in order to form genetically identical cells.

The **cell cycle** consists of:

1. **Interphase** which is divided into **G\({}_{1}\)**, **S** and **G\({}_{2}\)**.
2. **Mitosis** which is subdivided into **probase**, **metaphase**, **anaphase** and **telophase**.
3. **Cytokinesis** which is the division of the cytoplasm to form two daughter cells, which usually occurs simultaneously with telophase.

When cells are non-dividing or quiescent, they are said to be in the **G\({}_{0}\) phase** of the cell cycle. The cell cycle is very tightly controlled and is regulated by proteins known as **cyclins** (_KIV: Molecular Basis of Cancer_).

### Interphase

Interphase often accounts for about 90% of the length of the cell cycle. It is the **longest** phase of the cell cycle and hence most cells observed are in interphase (**Fig. 14**). Interphase is divided into three sub-phases, **G\({}_{1}\)**, **S** and **G\({}_{2}\)** and is a period of **intense metabolic activity** of the nucleus.

Figure 14: The process of interphase. It is the longest stage of the cell cycle and occurs prior to mitosis.

During all three sub-phases, the cell grows by replicating DNA, producing proteins and cytoplasmic organelles such as mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum. There is a clear purpose for each phase:

\begin{tabular}{p{34.1pt} p{284.5pt}} \hline
**G\({}_{1}\) PHASE** & * Begins after cytokinesis of the previous cell division - cells are thus small in size and low in ATP. * Hence, cells **increase in size** and **acquire ATP** during this phase. * Intensive cellular **gene expression** and **synthesis of appropriate organelles and proteins**. \\ \hline
**S PHASE** & * Each DNA molecule undergoes **semi-conservative DNA replication**, resulting in the production of two identical DNA molecules. * Histone proteins are synthesised and associate with each DNA molecule. * After the DNA have replicated in S phase, they remain fully extended and uncoiled. \\ \hline
**G\({}_{2}\) PHASE** & * Since the formation of new DNA is an energy-consuming process, the cell undergoes a **second growth** and **energy acquisition** stage. * Cells **increase in size** and **acquire ATP** during this phase. * Further synthesis of appropriate organelles and proteins occurs. * **Centrioles** replicate and the **mitotic spindle** begins to form. \\ \hline \end{tabular}

## 4 Nuclear Division - Mitosis

Mitosis involves the **nuclear division** of one nucleus into two genetically identical nuclei. Following cytokinesis, it produces **two daughter cells** that are **genetically identical** to each other and to the original parent cell.

The main stages of mitosis are: **probase**, **metaphase**, **anaphase** and **telophase**.

Mitosis occurs in **somatic cells**. It allows daughter nuclei to receive precisely the **same number of chromosomes** as the parental nucleus. Hence, the **diploid (2n)** condition is maintained from one generation of cells to the next.

Passing **identical genetic material** to daughter cells is **a crucial function of cell division**. Changes in the genetic material of the daughter cells, such as having a different number of chromosomes from their parent cell, may lead to cancerous cells.

### Stages of Mitosis

**Propase**

This is the **longest stage** of mitosis. During probleme, changes occur in both the nucleus and cytoplasm.

In the nucleus

**Nuclear envelope disintegrates** into small vesicles, which disperse.

**Nucleolus gradually **disappears**.

Chromatin **become more tightly coiled** (i.e. shorten and thicken) and **condense into discrete chromosomes** observable under a light microscope (**Fig. 16**).

In the cytoplasm

In animal cells, **controle pairs migrate to opposite poles of the cell**.

(Note that **plant cells do not possess centrioles** but are able to assemble the spindle apparatus nonetheless.)

The spindle fibre that began to form in G2 phase of interphase **continues to develop**.

### 4.4 Significance of Mitosis

#### Genetic stability

* Mitosis produces two daughter cells which have the **same number of chromosomes**.
* **Semi-conservative DNA replication** during S phase of interphase gives rise to **genetically identical** daughter DNA molecules.
* **Daughter chromosomes** are subsequently **distributed equally** to the daughter cells.
* There is **no variation** in genetic information during mitosis.
* Hence daughter cells are **genetically identical** to the parent cell.
* The production of genetically identical cells ensures the **preservation of genetic stability** across generations of cells and hence, in the organism.

#### Growth, repair, and regeneration

* **If a tissue is to grow**, it is important that the new cells formed are **genetically identical** to the existing cells in order to carry out the **same functions**.

#### Repair

* Damaged cells are **replaced** by exact copies of the original, thus allowing for a tissue to be restored to its former condition.

#### Regeneration

* Mitosis also allows for the **regeneration** of missing parts, such as legs in crustacean, and cell replacement occurs, to varying degree, in multicellular organisms.

#### 4.4.1 Asexual reproduction

* Many animal and plant series are propagated by **asexual reproduction** involving the mitotic division of cells. The offspring is **identical** to i.e. a clone, of their parents.
* Unicellular eukaryotic organism e.g. amoeba divides and forms duplicate offspring, the division of one cell **reproduces an entire organism**. This form of asexual reproduction involves mitotic cell division.
* The offspring cells are **genetically identical** to the original parent organism, thus ensuring the **preservation of favourable traits from generation to generation**.
* Another example of asexual reproduction is **vegetative propagation** of plants.

## 5 Nuclear Division - Meiosis

Meiosis occurs only in specialized cells within the gonads or sex organs of sexually reproducing organisms. In humans and most animals, the male gonads are the testes, while the female gonads are the ovaries. During meiosis, specialised reproductive or sex cells called **gametes** are produced, as shown in **Fig. 27 and Fig. 28**.

Gametes are **haploid cells (n)** and cannot be generated from **diploid (2n)** precursor cells by mitosis.

Meiosis is preceded by an interphase where **semi-conservative DNA replication** occurs.

* This process of replication is similar to the semi-conservative DNA replication preceding mitosis. For each chromosome, the result is two **genetically identical** sister chromatids, which remain attached at their centromeres.
* The chromosomes **only replicate once**.

The pair of **centrioles also replicates** during interphase.

Meiosis involves **two successive** nuclear divisions, named **meiosis I** and **meiosis II**.

The two nuclear divisions result in the production **four** haploid daughter cells. This is to ensure that at the end of meiosis, each daughter cell contains only **half the original complement of chromosomes** of the original parent cell.

### 5.1 Stages of Meiosis I

**Prophase I**

**Prophase I of meiosis lasts longer and is more complex than prophase of mitosis.**

**Prophase I of meiosis is similar to prophase of mitosis. The following events are also observed in prophase I of meiosis (Fig. 29).**

\(\bullet\) **The nucleolus disappears and the nuclear membrane disintegrates.**

\(\bullet\) **The chromatin condenses (i.e. shortens and thickens) until the chromosomes become discrete.**

However, there are events that are **unique** to prophase I of meiosis.

\(\bullet\) **Homologous chromosomes pair up to form a bivalent. The four chromatids in each bivalent are collectively known as a tetrad.**

\(\bullet\) **This physical pairing process is known as synapsis (unique to prophase I of meiosis), where the homologues are bridged by the synaptonemal complex consisting of proteins and RNA (Fig. 30). The process is precise and brings the genes on each chromosome into precise alignment.**

\(\bullet\) **The pairing of homologous chromosomes is essential for the exchange of alleles during crossing over in prophase I of meiosis.**

**Metaphase II** & **Chromosomes align singly at the metaphase plate.** & **Co ensure **equal distribution** of chromosomes to each daughter cell.** \\ \hline \end{tabular}

## 11 Sexual reproduction (production of gametes)

* Meiosis results in the production of gametes with **half the number of chromosomes** in the parent cell in all organisms carrying out sexual reproduction (**Fig. 40**).
* If this does not occur, the fusion of gametes during subsequent fertilisation will result in a **doubling of chromosome number** for each successive generation.
* Meiosis, therefore, **stabilises** and **maintains a constant chromosome number** in every generation of a species.

## 2 Genetic variation

Meiosis also allows for **new combinations of alleles** in gametes. This leads to **genetic variation** in the **genotype** and **phenotype** of the offspring produced by the fusion of gametes.

### Crossing over at **prophase I** of meiosis

* During **prob phase I of meiosis I**, **synapsis** occurs and homologues pairs up along their lengths to form **bivalents**.
* This facilitates **chiasmata** formation and **crossing over** between non-sister chromatids of homologous chromosomes, resulting in **recombination** of segments of non-sister chromatids between homologous chromosomes (**Fig. 41**).
* This leads to the formation of **new combinations of alleles** on the chromosomes of gametes. The resultant **recombinant sister chromatids** will then carry alleles different from those carried on the non-recombinant sister chromatids.
* Gamete cells that contain the recombinant chromosomes are called **recombinant gametes**, while those that contain the non-recombinant chromosomes are called parental gametes.

Figure 41: Stages of meiosis I and II.

Figure 40: Meiosis and **ploidy.**

**(b) Independent assortment** of homologous chromosomes at metaphase I of meiosis and metaphase II of meiosis II

* At **metaphase I of meiosis**, each pair of homologous chromosomes aligns at the metaphase plate.
* The orientation of the bivalents with respect to the poles is **random**. There is hence a 50% chance that a daughter cell gets a paternal chromosome or a maternal chromosome.
* As the **orientation of one bivalent is independent of another**, the first meiotic division results in random assortment of paternal and maternal chromosomes between nuclei of daughter cells. This is termed **independent assortment**, which is illustrated in **Fig. 42** below.
* Likewise, at metaphase II of meiosis, chromosomes randomly align singly at the metaphase plate. The orientation of one non-sister chromatid (due to crossing over) is independent of the other.

Number of possible combinations of chromosomes in gametes due to independent assortment

\(=\underline{2^{n}}\) for a diploid organism,

where n = number of pairs of homologous chromosomes.

In humans, the possible number of combinations of chromosomes in gametes produced by one person would then be \(\mathbf{2^{23}}\) or about **8 million**!

Random fertilisation of gametes carrying different combinations of chromosomes adds to genetic variation of the zygote formed.

Figure 42: Independent assortment.

## 4 Comparing Mitosis and Meiosis

**Similarities**

1. **Interphase** and **semi-conservative DNA replication** precedes both processes.
2. In both processes, microtubules attach to the kinetochore to separate chromosomes.
3. At the end of both processes, cytokinesis takes place.
