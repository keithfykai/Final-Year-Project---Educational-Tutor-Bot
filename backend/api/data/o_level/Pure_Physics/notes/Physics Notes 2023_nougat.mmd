Period: Time taken for one complete oscillation

**Precision vs Accuracy:**

Accuracy of measurement

Precision of measurement

Accuracy refers to the closeness of a measured value to a standard or known value.

Example:

You obtain a mass measurement of 3.2kg for a given substance, but the actual (known)

mass is 10 kg, then your measurement is not accurate.

Example:

If you measure the mass of a given substance five times, and get 3.2 kg each time, then your measurement is very precise.

\begin{tabular}{l l} accurate and & accurate and & not accurate and \\ precise & not precise & precise \\ \end{tabular}

**Errors:**

Random Error

Systematic Error

It occurs in all measurements.

It occurs when an observer estimates

the last figure of a reading on an

instrument.

Causes:

Human reaction time

Background noise

Mechanical vibrations

Causes:

Zero error of an instrument: Any

indication that a measuring system

gives a false reading when the true

value of a measured quantity is zero

It can be eliminated if we know the

sources of the errors.

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:8]

**Tip to Tail Method:**

**Newton's Law of Motion:**

1. **1st Law:** In the absence of a net force acting on it a stationary object remains stationary, whereas a moving object continues moving at constant speed in the same direction.
2. **2nd Law:** When a net force, Fnet, acts on an object of a constant mass, the direction of the acceleration of the object is the same as the direction of the net force. The product of the mass and acceleration of the object gives the resultant force.
3. **3rd Law:** For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. * If one object exerts a force on a second object, the second object exerts a force on the first object. These two forces have equal magnitudes and opposite directions.

**Free Body Diagram:**

Include all forces acting on the **object** in its free-body diagram.

1. A force is represented by a straight arrow.
2. The **larger magnitude** of the force, the **longer the **arrow**.
3. The direction of the force is the **same** as the **direction** of the arrow.
4. If the object is not represented by a point, each **arrow** is **drawn from the **location** where the **force** is **applied**.

* **Weight**: Arrow is drawn from the **centre of gravity**.
* **Normal contact force**: Arrow is drawn from the **contact surface** and is **perpendicular** to it.
* **Tension**: Arrow is drawn from the point where the **string** is **attached** to the object and points **parallel** to the string.
* **Friction**: Arrow drawn from the **contact surface** and is **parallel** to it.

**Friction:**

Friction is a contact force that opposes relative motion between two objects that are in contact with one another.

Friction is the result of irregularities of the surfaces that are in contact.

**Positive and Negative Effects of Friction:**

\begin{tabular}{|p{142.3pt}|p{142.3pt}|} \hline Positive Effects of Friction & Negative Effects of Friction \\ \hline (a) Prevents food from slipping when gripping food between chopsticks & (a) When engines operate, friction causes some input energy to be converted into sound or thermal energy. The useful output energy is less than the total input energy. Overheating may be dangerous. \\ (b) Friction between rubber tires and tar roads allows car to grip the roads properly. & (b) Causes wear and tear of moving parts of shoes, engines, motors and machines. \\ (c) To enhance this positive effect, car tyres have grooves that channel water under the tyre away. This helps prevent skidding. & (b) Causes wear and tear of moving parts of shoes, engines, motors and machines. \\ (d) Rock climbers use chalk powder that absorbs sweat on their palms. This improves their grip of the rock surface. & (e) Rubbing of hands during cold weather or rubbing two pieces of wood to start a fire. \\ \hline \end{tabular}

Reducing the Negative Effects of Friction

\begin{tabular}{|p{142.3pt}|} \hline  & Reducing the Negative Effects of Friction \\ \hline (a) Polishing surfaces to make them smooth reduces friction, e.g. the pistons and cylinders of an engine are made of highly polished steel or aluminium \\ (b) Lubricants like oil or grease are applied to moving parts to prevent wear and tear. They help smooth over surface irregularities. & (b) Lubricants like oil or grease are applied to moving parts to prevent wear and tear. They help smooth over surface irregularities. & (c) Ball bearings placed between two moving parts ensure the machines do not rub against each other. They can be found in the wheels of cars, bicycles, skates. & (d) The layer of air in an air cushion between moving surfaces reduces friction, e.g. hovercrafts and magnetic levitation (Maglev) trains float slightly above the surface so that they can move faster. \\ \hline \end{tabular}

**Free Fall:**

If the only force acting on an object is its weight, it is said to be undergoing free fall.

This is regardless of which direction the object is moving

e.g. In a vacuum on earth, a ball that is moving upwards just after being thrown is still undergoing free fall.

An object undergoing free fall experiences a downward acceleration that equals the gravitational field strength,

Since at free fall F=W,

F=ma

mg = ma

g = a

**Air Resistance and Terminal Velocity:**

An object moving through a fluid experiences a drag force. If the fluid is air, the drag force is called air resistance.

When an object moves through air, air resistance is a force that acts opposite of direction in which the object is moving.

The greater the speed of the object, the greater the magnitude of air resistance.

The greater the surface area of the object, the greater the magnitude of air resistance.

The greater the density of the air, the greater the magnitude of air resistance.

When the forces on an object are balanced, the object experiences zero acceleration. Thus, its velocity remains constant (Newton's first law).

Thus, when the air resistance balances the weight of a falling object, its velocity no longer changes. This is its terminal velocity.

**Density:**

Density is defined as mass per unit volume.

When an insoluble solid is placed in a liquid, the solid will

(a) float if its (average) density is less than that of the liquid.

(b) sink if its (average) density is greater than that of the liquid.

(c) be suspended if its (average) density is equal to that of the liquid.

## 4. Turning Effect of Forces

Formulas:

Moment [Nm] \(M=Fd_{\perp}\)

Moments:

Moment of a force (torque, Nm): The product of the force F and the perpendicular distance from the pivot to the line of action of the force.

Principle of Moments:

When an object is balanced, it is in a state of equilibrium

When an object is in equilibrium,

1. the resultant force must be zero (Translational Equilibrium)

2. the resultant moment must be zero (Rotational Equilibrium)

The Principle of Moments states that when an object is in equilibrium, the sum of clockwise moments is equal to the sum of anticlockwise moments about any axis.

Centre of Gravity:

The centre of gravity of an object is defined as the point through which its weight appears to act through.

Stability:

The stability of an object is essentially related to 2 factors:

\(\bullet\) The base area of the object,

\(\bullet\) The position of the centre of gravity of the object

To increase the stability of an object,

1. Keep the base area of the object as large as possible;

2. Keep the centre of gravity of the object as low as possible.

## Chapter 3 Pressure

### 3.1 Pressure

Pressure is defined as the force acting per unit area.

### 3.2 Pascal's Principle:

When pressure is applied to an enclosed incompressible liquid, the pressure is transmitted equally to all other parts of the liquid.

### 3.3 Hydraulic Press:

[1.5cm] (a) A force \(F_{\mathrm{x}}\) is exerted on piston 1. The pressure exerted at point X is \(p_{\mathrm{x}}\approx\frac{F_{\mathrm{x}}}{A_{\mathrm{x}}}\). (b) This pressure is transmitted equally to every part of the liquid, including to point Y. (c) A force, \(F_{\mathrm{x}}\), is applied onto the base of piston 2. (d) Thus, (f) Since the liquid is incompressible, the volume displaced at point X is equal to the volume displaced at point Y. (g) Since \(A_{\mathrm{x}}<A_{\mathrm{Y}}\), \(d_{\mathrm{X}}<d_{\mathrm{Y}}\).

### Pressure Due to a Liquid Column [Fluid Pressure]:

Refer to formula

#### Barometer:

(a) **Atmospheric pressure**, \(P_{0}\), acts on the surface of the mercury in the **vacuum** exerts no pressure on the mercury in the **tube**.

(c) The thick glass tube, which is about 1 m long, contains mercury.

At point X, which is at the **same level** as the surface of the trough, the **mercury** exerts a **pressure**, \(p_{\infty}\), that **equals atmospheric pressure**, \(P_{\infty}\).

(d) The **distance**\(h\) of between the mercury levels in the tube and in the trough is measured with a metre rule.

#### Mercury:

1m Hg (one meter of mercury) = 136000Pa

Density of mercury = 13600kg/m\({}^{3}\)

**Types of Energy:**

1. Kinetic energy: * Is the energy of an object due to its motion. It can be used to do work. E.g. The kinetic energy of moving air (wind) can be used to turn turbines, which converts the kinetic energy to electrical energy.
2. Potential energy: * Is the stored energy in a system, due to the position, shape or state of the system. In general, there are gravitational potential energy, elastic potential energy, and chemical potential energy.
3. Electrical energy: * Is the energy of an electrical charge due to its motion and position.
4. Light energy: * Is a form of electromagnetic wave that is visible to the eye. It is made up of oscillating electric and magnetic fields, and it is a part of the electromagnetic spectrum.
5. Thermal energy: * Is the energy stored in a body due to its thermal properties. The thermal energy of a body represents the total internal kinetic energy of the atoms or molecules in the body.
6. Nuclear energy: * Is the energy released during a nuclear reaction, of which there are two types: (a) Nuclear fission and (b) Nuclear fusion.

**Conservation of Energy:**

The Principle of Conservation of Energy states that energy cannot be created or destroyed but can be converted from one form to another. The total energy in an isolated system is constant.

**Efficiency:**

Refer to formula

**Work Done:**

Work done by a constant force on an object is the product of the force and the distance moved by the object in the direction of the force.

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:18]

**Brownian Motion:**

The air (fluid) is made up of small, invisible particles that undergo continuous and random motion.

The air molecules (fluid particles) collide with the smoke particles (suspended particles) continuously, randomly and from all directions.

This results in Brownian motion. Brownian motion is the continuous and random motion of particles that are suspended in a fluid (e.g. air, water).

**Motion of molecules vs temperature:**

The average kinetic energy of the gas particles is directly proportional to the absolute temperature of the gas.

**KE\({}_{\text{av}}\), particles \(\propto\)\(T\)**

**Gas Pressure [Motion of molecules]:**

How does a gas exert a pressure?

Gas particles move about randomly, continuously and in all directions

They collide with the inner walls of the container and exert a force on them.

The average force exerted per unit area is the gas pressure.

## Chapter 6 Transfer of Thermal Energy

**Thermal Energy Movement:**

Thermal energy always flows from a region of higher temperature to a region of lower temperature.

A net flow of thermal energy in the form of heat occurs only when there is a difference in temperature.

Thermal energy is transferred through three different processes.

There is no net heat flow between two regions they reach the same temperature.

**Conduction:**

Conduction is the transfer of thermal energy through a medium from one particle to another particle.

Conduction takes place in all states of matter - fastest in solids, followed by liquids and gases.

1. Particles at the heated end gain kinetic energy and vibrate vigorously.
2. They collide with neighbouring particles, causing them to vibrate more vigorously as well.
3. This process continues until the particles at the cooler end are also set into vigorous vibration.

In metals, electrons at the heated end gain kinetic energy and move more rapidly.

They then collide atoms in the cooler parts of the metal and transfer their kinetic energy in the process.

This continues until the particles at the cooler end are also set into vigorous vibration.

**Convection:**

Convection is the transfer of thermal energy by means of convection currents in a fluid, due to a difference in density.

Convection only takes place in fluids (liquids and gases) and not solids.

1. When the water at the bottom of the flask is heated, it expands, becomes less dense than the surrounding water and rises.
2. The upper region of water is cooler, denser, and sinks to the bottom of the flask.
3. The process repeats and sets up a convection current due to the difference in the densities of water in the different regions until thermal equilibrium is reached.

#### 10.1.4 Specific Heat Capacity:

The heat capacity of an object depends on its mass and material of the object.

The specific heat capacity ( c ) is the amount of thermal energy required toincrease the temperature of a unit mass of a substance by 1 K or 1\({}^{\text{o}}\)C.

### Melting and Freezing:

When a solid is heated, its temperature rises until it starts to melt.

The temperature at which the solid changes its state from a solid to liquid is called the melting point.

During melting, the temperature of the object remains constant as the thermal energy supplied is used to overcome the intermolecular forces of attraction.

The energy that is absorbed during melting is called latent heat of fusion.

The same thermal energy is released in the reverse process called solidification or freezing.

The melting point of a substance is also its freezing point.

### Boiling and Condensation:

When a liquid is heated, its temperature rises until it starts to boil.

The temperature at which the liquid changes its state from a liquid to gas is called the boiling point.

During boiling, the temperature of the object remains constant as the thermal energy supplied is used to

1. overcome the intermolecular forces of attraction, and
2. do work against the surrounding atmosphere - this is due to the large increase in volume when a liquid turns into a gas.

The energy that is absorbed during boiling is called latent heat of vaporisation.

The same thermal energy is released in the reverse process called condensation.

The boiling point of a substance is also its condensation point.

### **Boiling VS Evaporation:**

\begin{tabular}{|p{142.3pt}|p{142.3pt}|} \hline
**Boiling** & **Evaporation** \\ \hline Occurs only at boiling point. & Occurs at any temperature. \\ \hline Relatively fast. & Relatively slow. \\ \hline Takes place throughout the liquid. & Takes place only at the surface. \\ \hline Temperature remains constant. & Temperature usually decreases. \\ \hline Bubbles formed in the liquid. & No bubbles formed in the liquid. \\ \hline External thermal energy source needed. & External thermal energy source not needed. \\ \hline \end{tabular}

### **Latent Heat:**

Latent heat ( L ) is the amount of energy absorbed or released by a substance during a change in state, without a change in temperature.

Latent heat of fusion ( Lf ) is the amount of thermal energy required to change a substance from solid state to liquid state, without a change in temperature. This applies to melting and freezing/solidification.

Latent heat of vaporisation ( Lv ) is the amount of thermal energy required to change a substance from liquid state to gaseous state, without a change in temperature. This applies to boiling and condensation.

### **Specific Latent Heat:**

As latent heat depends on the mass and material of a substance, it is fairer to compare the latent heat per 1kg of different substances. This is formally known as the specific latent heat (of fusion or vaporisation).

**Evaporation:**

1. Particles in a liquid are always moving randomly at different velocities.
2. The more energetic liquid particles at the surface overcomes the attractive forces of the other liquid particles and atmospheric pressure and escapes into the surrounding atmosphere.
3. The particles with lower kinetic energies are left behind. This causes the average kinetic energy of the liquid particles to decrease and the average temperature to decrease as well.

**Factors affecting the rate of evaporation:**

\begin{tabular}{|c l|c l|} \hline \(\checkmark\) & temperature of the evaporating liquid & \(\checkmark\) & atmospheric pressure \\ \(\checkmark\) & surface area of the evaporating liquid & \(\checkmark\) & humidity of surrounding air \\ \(\checkmark\) & movement of surrounding air & \(\checkmark\) & boiling point of the evaporating liquid \\ \hline \end{tabular}

### Refraction of Waves:

The wavefronts are more closely spaced.

The wave bends towards the normal.

The angle of refraction, r, is smaller than the angle of incidence, i.

* The **point of incidence P** is the point where the incident ray, reflected ray and the normal meet.
* The **angle of incidence** (_1_) is the angle between the incident ray and the normal.
* The **angle of reflection** (_r_) is the angle between the reflected ray and the normal.

### Angle of incidence = Angle of reflection

#### Angle of Incidence and Angle of Refraction:

#### Speed at which light travels:

Light travels at a speed of 3.0 x 10\({}^{8}\) m/s in a vacuum.

### Principle of Reversibility of Light:

#### 3.1.1 Refractive Index:

Ratio of speed of light in vacuum to the speed of light in medium.

#### 3.1.2 Critical Angle:

The angle of incidence in an optically denser medium for which the angle of refraction is perpendicular to the plane.

#### 3.1.3 Total Internal Reflection:

The complete reflection of a light ray inside an optically denser medium at its boundary with an optically less dense medium.

**Both** these conditions must be satisfied for **total internal reflection (TIR)** to occur:

1. The incident ray must travel from an optically denser medium to an optically less dense medium.
2. The **angle of incidence** must be greater than **critical angle**, i.e. _i > c._

#### 3.1.4 Characteristics of an Image formed by a Plane Mirror:

2. It is the same shape and same size as the object.
3. It is upright.
4. It is virtual.
5. Its image distance from the mirror is the same as the object distance from the mirror.

**How to Draw Light Path Reflecting from a Mirror:**

**Step 1**

Draw a **dotted line** from object O that is **perpendicular** to the mirror.

**Step 2**

Label image I, such that

object distance = image distance.

The virtual ray and the reflected ray lie along the same straight line.

**Step 3(i)**

Using a **dotted** line, draw the **virtual ray** from image I to the point of incidence

**Step 3(ii)**

Using a **solid** line with an **arrowhead**, draw the **reflected ray** from the point of incidence to the eye.

**Step 4**

Using a **solid** line with an **arrowhead**, draw the **incident ray** from object O to the point of incidence.

You may verify that

angle of incidence = angle of reflection

\(i=r\)

To the brain, the rays reflecting off the

points of incidence _seem to_ be coming

from image I.

Drawing of Ray Diagrams:

## Chapter 16 Electromagnetic System

### 16. Electromagnetic System

**Properties of Electromagnetic Waves:**

1. They are transverse waves. They made up of electric and magnetic fields that oscillate perpendicular to each other.
2. They carry no electric charge, i.e. they are neither positively nor negatively charged.
3. They transfer energy from one place to another.
4. They do not require a medium to travel.
5. They travel at the speed of light in vacuum (3.0 x 10\({}^{8}\) m/s), but they slow down while travelling through other mediums like water or glass.
6. They obey the wave equation, v = f \(\lambda\).
7. They obey the laws of reflection and refraction.
8. Their frequencies remain unchanged when they travel from one medium to another. Wave frequency depends only upon the source of the wave, while wave speed and wavelength changes when the wave enters a different medium.
9. The higher the frequency of an electromagnetic wave, the more energetic it is.

### Electromagnetic Spectrum:

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:40]

**Ionising Radiation:**

1. Ionising radiation is radiation that has the energy to ionize atoms or molecules (including those in living matter) by removing electrons from them.
2. High energy electromagnetic waves like ultraviolet radiation, X-rays and gamma rays can ionize atoms and molecules.
3. Exposure to ionising radiation can damage biological molecules (e.g. proteins, nucleic acids). This can lead to: 1. abnormal cell division 2. deformities in a developing foetus 3. cancers, e.g. leukaemia 4. premature ageing 5. shortening of lifespan.

**Production of sound by vibrating sources:**

**Pongs:**

The vibrating bell causes layers of air particles around it to be displaced. This causes a series of alternate compressions and rarefactions that travel outwards through air and reach the ear of the person.

## Pressure-distance Graph:

### Displacement-distance Graph:

### Displacement-time Graph:

Figure 1: The amplitude \(A\) of a sound wave is the wave is the distance between the centres of two consecutive compressions or rarefactions.

## Speed of Sound in Different Mediums:

\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|c|c|c|} \hline
**Medium** & **Air** & **Water** & **Glass** & **Iron** & **Aluminium** \\ \hline
**Approximate speed of** & 300 & 1500 & 4540 & 5000 & 6320 \\
**sound / m/s** & & & & & \\ \hline \end{tabular}

Briefly describe the differences.

* It travels at different speeds in different media.
* Speed of sound in solid \(\stackrel{{\raisebox{-0.86pt}{\scalebox{0.86}{$>$}}}}{{ \ldots}}\). Speed of sound in liquid \(\stackrel{{\raisebox{-0.86pt}{\scalebox{0.86}{$>$}}}}{{ \ldots}}\). Speed of sound in gas

In denser mediums, the particles are much closer together, and they can quickly transfer kinetic energy from one particle to the next.

When temperature increases, the speed of sound increases. At a higher temperature, particles have more kinetic energy and vibrate faster. Thus, sound waves can travel faster.

Increasing humidity increases the moisture (concentration of water vapour) in the air and the density of the medium. Thus, sound waves can travel faster.

## How to calculate speed of sound:

Total distance/Total time required to hear echo

## Pitch

The pitch of a note depends on its frequency.

The higher the frequency, the higher the pitch of the sound.

## Loudness

The loudness of sound depends on its amplitude.

The greater the amplitude, the louder is the sound.

## Ultrasound:

Ultrasound and infrasound are sounds with frequencies higher than the upper limit and below the lower limit of the human range of audibility respectively. Ultrasound waves are sound waves with frequencies greater than 20 kHz. They are inaudible to humans.

### Uses of Ultrasound: Quality Control

### Prenatal Scanning

When the source vibrates, body tissues are pushed and pulled repetitively to form regions of compression and rarefaction (longitudinal wave).

When the sound wave is incident on the denser body tissues, it is reflected through the body tissues and detected by the receiver.

The time taken for the ultrasound waves to be reflected is used to determine the depth of the reflecting surface within the body.

### Why X-rays>Ultrasound:

X-rays during pregnancy don't increase the risk of miscarriage or cause problems in the foetus, such as birth defects and physical or mental development problems. However, repeated exposure to the high energy radiation can damage the body's cells, which can increase the risk of cancer developing in the foetus.

**Charge:**

The SI unit of electric charge is the coulomb (C).

The amount of charge carried by an electron is 1.6 x 10\({}^{\text{-}19}\) C.

**Electric Field:**

1. An electric field is a region in which an electric charge experiences an electric force.
2. An electric force is the attractive or repulsive force that electric charges exert on one another.
3. The direction of an electric field is represented by the direction of the electric force that would act on a small positive test charge.
4. Lines always go from positive to negative

## Charging by Friction:

Before rubbing, the glass rod and the piece of silk are electrically neutral.

As different materials have different affinities (extent of attraction) for electrons, when the glass rod and the piece of silk are rubbed together, the atoms at their surfaces are disturbed and some electrons from the atoms at the surface of the glass rod are transferred to the piece of silk.

As the glass rod loses electrons, it becomes positively charged.

As the piece of silk gains electrons, it becomes negatively charged.

Charging by Induction:

**Method 1: Charging two metal (conducting) spheres by induction**

1. Two metal spheres (conductors), A & B, on insulating stands are placed side by side, touching each other.
2. A negatively-charged rod is brought near, but not touching, sphere A.
3. Electrons in both spheres A and B are repelled to the far end of sphere B.
4. Sphere A has excess positive charges, while sphere B has excess negative charges.
5. While holding the negatively charged rod in place (near sphere A), move sphere B away from sphere A.
6. The charged rod is removed making sphere A positively charged and sphere B negatively charged.

Note: If charged rod is removed before the 2 spheres move apart, electrons will be redistributed and sphere A & B will be neutral again.

**Method 2: Charging a single conductor by induction**

1. A positively-charged rod is brought near, but not touching, a metal conductor on insulating stand.
2. The electrons in the conductor are attracted towards the end near the positively-charged rod.
3. Without removing the positively-charged rod, the positively-charged end of the conductor is neutralised by touching it with a person's hand.
4. Free electrons move from earth to the conductor through the person, neutralising the positive charges on that end of the conductor.
5. With the positively-charged rod still in place, the person's hand is removed, stopping the earthing process
6. The positively-charged rod is removed, and the electrons in the conductor redistribute throughout the conductor.

Note: If the charged rod is removed before the earthing process is stopped, then excess electrons will flow to the earth and discharging occurs. The rod will then become electrically neutral.

**Neutralising/ Discharging a Charged Insulator:**

**Method 1: Discharging through heating**

1. The heat from the flame ionises the surrounding air particles.
2. For a positively-charged glass rod, the ions neutralise the excess charges on the glass rod.

**Method 2: Discharging through humid conditions**

1. Water molecules in air are electrical conductors.
2. For a negatively charged insulator, excess charges are transferred to the water molecule.

**Neutralising/ Discharging a Charged Conductor:**

1. A charged conductor can be discharged by earthing.
2. When we earth a charged conductor, we provide a path (usually lower resistance and connected to the earth) for: 1. excess electrons to flow away from the charged conductor, or 2. electrons to flow to the charged conductor if it has excess positive charges.

**Hazards of Electrostatics:**

1. **Lightning** 1. The clouds are charged by friction between water molecules in the clouds and air molecules in the atmosphere. 2. Negative charges accumulate at the bottom of the clouds. 3. These repel the electrons near the surface of the Earth, causing the surface of the Earth to be positively charged. 4. When the accumulation of charges is large, the air particles nearby are ionised. 5. The ionised air particles provide a conducting path for the electrons in the clouds to reach the Earth. 6. When the electrons travel down the conducting path to the Earth, lightning forms.
2. **Electrostatic Discharge** 1. Excessive charges may build up on objects due to friction. 2. Electronic equipment, such as computer boards and hard drives, can be easily damaged by electrostatic discharge. 3. Such equipment is usually packed in antistatic packaging.
3. **Electrostatic Discharge of Vehicles** 1. Electric charges can accumulate on trucks due to friction between 1. The road and the rotating types of the truck. 2. The moving air molecules and the body of the truck 2. When a sudden discharge occurs, this may cause sparks and ignite any flammable items that the truck may be carrying. 3. Gas tankers are equipped with a metal chain at the rear end hanging touching/ near to the ground to provide an earthing path for excess charges. 4. During refueling, the gas tankers are also connected to an earth source to prevent static charges from accumulating on the body of the gas or fuel tanker.

**Applications of Electrostatics:**

* The metal drum inside the photocopier is coated with selenium, a light sensitive semiconductor (photoconductor).
* It only conducts electricity in the presence of light.
* When no light shines on the selenium, it is a good insulator.
* The drum's surface is charged positively by a charged wire.
* The original image to be photocopied is placed on a sheet of clear glass above the drum and an intense light beam is shone onto the image.
* The darker areas of the image reflect less light and therefore, the corresponding regions on the drum remain positively charged.
* The regions on the drum corresponding to the lighter areas of become conductive.
* Electrons from the surroundings, which are attracted to these regions, discharge them.
* The drum continues turning, and the positively-charged image on the drum attracts the negatively-charged toner powder.
* A positively-charged sheet of paper is passed over the drum's surface.
* The paper attracts the negatively-charged toner and the image is formed on the paper.
* The paper is heated and pressed to fuse the toner powder to the paper permanently.

Note: Water molecules are present in abundance in humid air, and they can neutralise excess charges quickly. Printing quality may be reduced.

## 2 Electrostatic Precipitator

* The fly ash is passed through a negatively charged wire grid making the particles to become negatively charged.
* The negatively charged particles are passed through positively charged or earthed plates which attract the negatively charged particles.
* Hence, air emitted into the atmosphere is cleaner.
* The fly ash are collected and used in making cement.

## 3 Spray Painting

* As the paint leaves the nozzle, the droplets are charged by friction.
* These made all the paint droplets to have the same charge and repel each other.
* Hence, they spread evenly. Less paint is needed because the charged droplets are all attracted to the object.

**Thermistor, Semiconductor diode & Filament Lamp:**

A thermistor is a type of resistor whereby its resistance decreases as the temperature of the thermistor increases. Used in air conditioners and fire alarm.

As the current increases, the temperature rises and the resistance of the filament lamp increases.

A semiconductor diode allows current to flow in one direction.

#### Potential Divider:

A line of resistors connected in series. Used to provide a fraction of the voltage of a source to another part of the circuit.

#### Input Transducers:

**Heating Effect:**

Most household appliances that convert electrical energy to thermal energy have heating elements that are made of nichrome.

Nichrome is used because it has high resistivity and can withstand high temperatures.

Iron-chromium-aluminium alloys can also be used as heating elements.

When an electric current passes through these heating elements, electrical energy is converted into thermal energy rapidly.

**Measuring Electricity Consumption:**

The rating labelled as "240 V, 1200 W" means that when 240 V is supplied across the electric kettle, 1200 J of electrical energy is supplied to the kettle per second and converted into thermal energy.

**Hazards of Electricity:**

1. **Damaged insulation** 1. It may cause a short circuit if an exposed live wire touches an exposed neutral wire, causing a large amount of current to flow through, producing a lot of heat which may start a fire. 2. The exposed live wire may cause an electric shock if someone accidentally touches it.
2. **Overheating of cables** 1. Causes a large current to flow through, producing a lot of heat which may start a fire.
3. **Damp environment** 1. Impure or contaminated water conducts electricity. When water gets into electrical appliances, the water conducts electricity from the electrical element to the human body. This will cause an electrocution to the human using it.

**Circuit Breakers:**

Switch off energy supply when large current flows.

Can be reset without being replaced.

Fault can be located easily without having to inspect each plug.

**Fuses:**

Prevents excessive current flow.

Must be replaced after tripping.

Thin short wire in a casing (low resistance) blows when a large current passes through to open the circuit.

Slightly higher rated value than normal current.

Connected to live wire.

Casing will be disconnected from live wire, no current flows through person.

If on Neutral: Live wire causes metal casing to have high voltage as it is still connected to the metal casing, hence a person will get an electric shock if he touches the casing and a large current flows through him to the earth.

Mains should be switched off before replacingCommon fuse ratings: 1A, 2A, 5A, 7A, 10A, 13A, 15A.

**Double Insulation:**

\(\bullet\) Metal casing is at high potential (open circuit).

\(\bullet\) When a person touches the casing, circuit is complete and a large current flows through the person.

\(\bullet\) Person gets an electric shock

2. With earthing

\(\bullet\) Electrical fault results in live wire touching metal casing.

\(\bullet\) Large current flows to the ground through earth wire which has much lower resistance than the person, hence person does not suffer electric shock.

\(\bullet\) Large current exceeds rated value of fuse, hence fuse blows

Letting the hot demagnetized material cool in the east-west direction ensures that the magnetic domains do not re-align due to Earth's magnetic field.
2. **Hitting** 1. Hammering a magnet in the east-west direction randomizes the alignment of the magnetic domains, causing the magnet to lose its magnetism
3. **Electrical Method** 1. Place the magnet inside the solenoid with an alternating current (a.c.) along the east-west direction. (The alternating magnetic field due to the alternating current randomizes the alignment of the magnetic domains.) 2. Gradually reduce the alternating current to zero or with the alternating current still flowing, slowly pull the demagnetized material out of the solenoid until it is far from the solenoid.

**Preventing Demagnetisation: Magnetic Keopers**

**Right-Hand Grip Rule:**

(i) Grip the solenoid using the right hand. (ii) Curl the fingers in the direction of the current flowing through the solenoid. (iii) The thumb points in the same direction as the induced north pole.

**Magnetic Fields:**

The region surrounding a magnet in which a body of magnetic material experiences a magnetic force.

Plotted with sprinkling iron filings/compass.

Closer lines = Stronger Magnetic Force.

Earth's geographical North is a magnetic South.

**Plotting Magnetic Fields with Compass:**

Plotting the magnetic field pattern with a plotting compass

1. Place the bar magnet at the centre of a piece of paper.
2. Ensure its N pole points to the Earth's N pole.
3. Place the compass at X and mark the S and N ends of the compass needle.
4. Move the compass to Y and repeat.
5. Repeat the process of marking the points until the S pole is reached.
6. Join the dots with a single line.
7. Repeat the process by starting from different points near the N pole until several lines are drawn.

**Factors affecting Magnetic Field Strength of a Solenoid:**

1. Increase the magnitude of the current
2. Increase the number of turns per unit length of the solenoid
3. Placing a soft iron core within the solenoid

**Applications of Magnetic Effect of Current in Daily Life:**

**Electric Bell**

1. When the switch is pushed, the circuit is closed and current flow through the coils.
2. The soft iron cores becomes magnetized and the soft iron armature is attracted to the electromagnet.
3. The striker will then hit the gong.
4. When soft iron armature is attracted to the electromagnet, it breaks the contact and cuts off the current flow.
5. Hence, the soft iron cores lose their magnetism and the soft iron armature is not attracted to the iron core.
6. The spring allows the armature to return to its original position touching the contacts.

### Circuit Breakers

Normal Condition
* Terminal T1 and T2 are connected to the live and neutral wires.
* When the current is within the limit (normal condition) the magnetic field produced by the solenoid is not strong enough to make the electromagnet to attract the soft iron latch.
* The circuit remains closed and current flows normally in the circuit.

### Excessive Current Flow
* A current surge may occur due to overloading or short circuit.
* The magnetic field produced by the solenoid is stronger due to the larger current and make the electromagnet stronger.
* Hence, the electromagnet is strong enough to attract the soft iron latch.
* The latch releases the spring which causes the safety bar to move outwards.
* The circuit is open and no current flows in the circuit.
* The circuit breaker can be reset by pushing the button of the safety bar

**Fleming's Left-Hand Rule:**

**Force on a Moving Charge in a Magnetic Field:**

Thinking process to answer:

1. Find the electron flow [If its positive charge, electron flow is opposite of the way the positive charge goes]
2. Magnetic Field direction
3. Apply Fleming's Left Hand Rule to find the Force
4. Particle will eventually U-turn/go in a circular motion [Usually draw U-turn is enough].

**DC Motor:**

A d.c. motor converts electrical energy into mechanical energy.

A d.c. motor consists of the following components:

1. Rectangular coil connected in series to a battery and rheostat
2. Permanent magnets
3. Split-ring commutator

\(\bullet\) The ends of the coil are fixed to the split-ring commutator (X and Y). The commutator rotates with the coil.
4. Two carbon brushes

\(\bullet\) The carbon brushes rub against the commutator and keep the coil connected to the battery.

1. When the switch is closed, current will flow through the (rectangular) conducting coil.
2. The sides of the coil lie in between two permanent magnet.
3. Forces are produced on the current-carrying wires of the coil by the magnetic field (apply Fleming's left-hand rule), which cause the coil to rotate about its axle (along dotted line).
4. The ends of the rotating coil are connected to two halves of a copper ring (XY) known as the split ring commutator and they rotate together with the coil.
5. Electric current is passed from the circuit to the two halves of the copper ring via two separate carbon brushes.
6. The rheostat is used to control the amount of current in the coil, which affects the strength of magnetic forces produced on the sides of the coil (i.e. the rotating torque) and hence the rotational speed of the coil.
7. When an electric current flows through the coil ABCD, a downward force is produced on side AB and an upward force on side CD (using Fleming's left-hand rule).
8. This causes the coil to rotate anticlockwise about axis PQ.

But when the rotating coil reaches a **vertical position**, the split ring commutator (X and Y) **loses contact with the carbon brushes**, causing the current to be **cut off** and the forces to **disappear**.

However, the **inertia** of the rotating coil keeps it rotating and the commutator to make contact with the brushes again but in the reverse manner.

9. This reverses the current direction in the coil, and consequently side AB now gets an upward force while CD gets a downward force.

10. This allows the coil to continue rotating in the same anticlockwise direction.

**The rotation speed (turning effect) of the coil (i.e. motor) can be increased by 1. Increasing the magnitude of the current in the coil 2. Increasing the number of turns per unit length of the coil 3. Inserting a soft iron core or cylinder into the coil 4. Using a stronger magnet.**

**Lenz's Law:**

The direction of the induced electromotive force (e.m.f.) (and hence the direction of the induced current in a closed circuit) is such that its magnetic effect opposes the change producing it.

**Faraday's Law of EMI:**

The magnitude of the electromotive force (e.m.f.) induced in a circuit is directly proportional to the rate of change of the magnetic flux linkage through the area bounded by the circuit.

(a) The magnetic flux through an area is the product of the area, A, and the magnetic field, B, passing perpendicular through this area.

The magnetic flux linkage of a solenoid with N identical turns is N times the magnetic flux through each coil of the solenoid.

(b) In diagrams, the magnetic flux through an area is directly proportional to the number of magnetic field lines passing through that area.

Thus, the magnitude of the electromotive force (e.m.f.) induced in a conductor is directly proportional to the rate at which magnetic field lines cut the conductor.

**Factors affecting the magnitude of the induced e.m.f:**

\begin{tabular}{|p{142.3pt}|p{142.3pt}|} \hline The magnet is moved faster toward/away from the solenoid & The magnitude of the induced e.m.f. is greater (because rate at which magnetic field lines cut the conductor is greater). \\ \hline A stronger magnet is used & The magnitude of the induced e.m.f. is greater (because rate at which magnetic field lines cut the conductor is greater). \\ \hline A solenoid with more coils is used & The magnitude of the induced e.m.f. is greater. \\ \hline \end{tabular}

**Steps to finding where the galvanometer points:**

1. Find whether to magnet is moving towards or away from the solenoid
2. Find which poles is moving in or out.

\(\bullet\) If N pole moving in, N pole induced

\(\bullet\) If S pole moving in, S pole induced

\(\bullet\) If N pole moving out, S pole induced

\(\bullet\) If S pole moving out, N pole induced
3. Find the induced pole on the solenoid on the side the magnet moves
4. Galvanometer always points to the induced N pole of the solenoid.

**Fleming's Right Hand Rule:**

\begin{tabular}{l} direction of the \\ motion (thumb) \\ \end{tabular}

direction of the induced \\ \(\bullet\).m.f. (from - toward +) \\ \(\cdot\).OR \\ \(\cdot\).direction of the induced \\ \(\cdot\).conventional current (if part \\ \(\cdot\).of a closed circuit) \\ \end{tabular}

### AC Generator:

An a.c. generator converts mechanical energy to electrical energy

#### Function of the 2 slip rings

The 2 slip rings maintain constant electrical contact with the carbon brushes as the coil rotates, ensuring that the induced current flows through the closed circuit.

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:75]

The amplitude of the induced e.m.f. of an a.c. generator can be increased by increasing the rate at which the coil cuts the magnetic field lines, e.g. by

1. Increasing the number of turns of the coil
2. Increasing the magnetic field strength (e.g. stronger magnets)
3. Increasing the speed of rotation of the coil
4. Winding the coil on a soft iron core (to strengthen the magnetic field passing through the coil)

The amplitude of the induced current can be increased by increasing the induced e.m.f. or by decreasing the resistance of the coil.

**Cathode Ray Oscilloscope:**

A cathode ray oscilloscope (CRO) is an electronic device that uses electron beam deflection to detect and show how voltages vary with time.

**A c.r.o. has a cathode ray tube which has 3 main parts.**

1. Electron gun

* The electron gun emits a beam of electrons (thermionic emission) which is produced by the cathode.
2. Deflecting system

* The deflecting system consists of two pairs of deflecting plates, X plates and Y plates.
* Voltage can be applied across the deflecting plates.
* The extent of deflection of the spot is proportional to the voltage applied.
* X plates can make the electron beam to deflect horizontally.
* Y plates can make the electron beam to deflect vertically.
3. Fluorescent screen

* A bright spot is produced on the screen when the electron beam hits it.
* The larger the number of electrons striking the screen, the brighter the spot.

### Using a C.R.O.

The Y-plates is connected to the Y-input terminals.

The external source of voltage to be measured is connected across the Y-input terminals.

\begin{tabular}{|l|} \hline _X-shift and Y-shift_ \\ \hline The X-shift and the Y-shift knobs are used to **move** \\ **the trace over the screen** in the X (horizontal) and \\ Y (vertical) direction respectively. \\ \end{tabular}

\begin{tabular}{|l|} \hline _Y-gain_ \\ \hline The Y-gain knob is used to control the **amplification** \\ **(magnification) of the Y-deflection (vertical** \\ **movement)**. \\ \hline The vertical axis is calibrated in **V/cm** or V/division. \\ \hline If the Y-gain control is set at 5.0 V/cm (or 5.0 V/division), it means that the spot is deflected 1 cm \\ (or 1 division) vertically for every 5.0 V across the Y- \\ input terminal. \\ \end{tabular}

### Time base

The time base knob is used to control the speed at which the spot move across the screen in the horizontal (X) direction.

The horizontal axis is calibrated in ms/cm or ms/division

If the time base control is set at 10 ms/cm (or 10 ms/division), it means that the spot takes 10 ms to move 1 cm (or 1 division) horizontally.

The time base is connected to an internal circuit in the c.r.o..

The time base controls the voltage of this internal circuit which applies voltage across the X-plates.

**Transformer:**

A transformer is a device that can change a high alternating voltage (at low current) to a low alternating voltage (at high current), and vice versa.

**Closed Core Transformer**

A closed core transformer consists of two coils of wire (primary and secondary coil) which are wound round a laminated soft iron core.

The soft iron core is an electrical conductor. Hence, the changing magnetic field will induce current (eddy current) in it.

**Eddy currents flow in little circles in a solid iron core which cause heating in the core.**

**The laminated soft iron core is made up of thin sheets of soft iron insulated from each other.**

**The lamination reduces heat loss due to induced eddy current in the soft iron core.**At the primary coil, the applied alternating voltage ( Vp ) will drive an alternating current in the primary coil.

When an alternating current flows in the primary coil, it causes a changing (alternating) magnetic field in the soft iron core.

This changing magnetic field in the soft iron core cuts the secondary coil and induces an e.m.f. in the secondary coil.

Transformer will not work on direct current (d.c.).

Uses of transformers
1. Electrical power transmission from power station to households and factories
2. Regulating voltages in electrical appliances for proper operation

The transformer operates by having different number of turns in the primary and secondary coils.

\begin{tabular}{|c|} \hline
**Transformer** \\ \hline secondary output voltage = \(\dfrac{\text{number of turns in secondary coil}}{\text{primary input voltage}}\) \\ \(\dfrac{V_{\text{S}}}{V_{\text{P}}}=\dfrac{N_{\text{S}}}{N_{\text{P}}}\) \\ \(\dfrac{\text{turns ratio}}{\text{turns ratio}}=\dfrac{N_{\text{S}}}{N_{\text{P}}}\) \\ \hline \end{tabular}

\begin{tabular}{|c|} \hline
**Step-up Transformer** \\ \hline The **secondary coil** has **more turns** \\ than the primary coil. \\ \(N_{\text{S}}>N_{\text{P}}\) \\ \(\dfrac{N_{\text{S}}}{N_{\text{P}}}\) \\ \(\dfrac{\text{more than primary input voltage}}{\text{V}_{\text{S}}}>V_{\text{P}}\) \\ \(\dfrac{I_{\text{S}}}{<I_{\text{P}}}\) \\ \hline \end{tabular}

Power transmission in a transformer:

Ideal Transformer

For an ideal transformer, its efficiency is 100%.

The power supplied to the primary coil is fully transferred to the secondary coil.

\begin{tabular}{|c|} \hline Based on the **Principle of Conservation of Energy**, for an **Ideal transformer** \\ power in primary coil = power is secondary coil \\ \(V_{\text{P}}\)\(I_{\text{P}}=V_{\text{s}}\)\(I_{\text{s}}\) \\ \hline \end{tabular}

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:82]

Where the electricity is to be used, there is a series of step-down transformers to reduce the voltage to values suitable for use in factories and homes.

**Planning:**

Candidates are required to analyse a practical problem and produce an appropriate procedure for the investigation.

Candidates should be able to:

\(\bullet\) identify key variables for a given question / problem

\(\bullet\) outline an experimental procedure to investigate the question / problem

\(\bullet\) describe how the data should be used in order to reach a conclusion

\(\bullet\) identify the risks of the experiment and state precautions that should be taken to keep risks to a minimum

Key Variables

There are 3 types of key variables which need to be identified when planning an investigation.

**1. Independent Variables**

\(\bullet\) They are physical factors that would affect the outcome(s) of the investigation.

\(\bullet\) In a typical scientific investigation, there should only be ONE chosen independent variable.

\(\bullet\) The chosen independent variable must be:

\(\bullet\) relevant to the objective of the investigation

\(\bullet\) a physical quantity - it must be measurable

**2. Dependent Variables**

\(\bullet\) They are physical factors that will be affected by the chosen independent variable.

\(\bullet\) In a typical scientific investigation, there should only be ONE chosen dependent variable.

\(\bullet\) variable.

\(\bullet\) The chosen independent variable must be:

\(\bullet\) relevant to the objective of the investigation

\(\bullet\) a physical quantity - it must be measurable

**3. Quantities to be kept constant**

\(\bullet\) They are physical factors that would affect the outcome(s) of the investigation.

\(\bullet\) They have to be monitored and kept constant throughout the entire investigation.

**Relationship Between Independent Variables and Dependent**

One of the key purposes of the investigation is to establish a relationship between the independent variable ( x ) and the dependent variable ( y ).

\(\bullet\) Typically, a linear mathematical relationship connecting both variables is established ( e.g. y = mx + c ).

\(\bullet\) When a relationship (i.e. equation) is given in the investigation, examine and identify the appropriate independent variable and dependent variable before proceeding with the experimental design and setup. In some cases, you may need to manipulate the equation to simplify it further.

- e.g. 2y / m = 2x can be manipulated into the form y = mx.

* List down all the apparatus required for the investigation.
* Use only common laboratory apparatus are allowed.

Procedure
* Write down the procedure clearly in a series of step-by-step procedure.
* Make sure to include clear instructions on how to vary the independent variable, and how the dependent variable is being observed and measured (e.g. specify the measuring instrument) and recorded.
* [OPTIONAL] Include diagram(s) of the experiment set-up to help clarify the procedure.
* Describe how the recorded data should be processed (e.g. calculation, tabulation) to interpret the correlation between the chosen independent and dependent variables. It usually involves the plotting of a (linear) graph and determination of its gradient and vertical intercept.

**EXAMPLE PLANNING TASK**

**Title:** Bending of a straw by an applied force

**Task:** It is suggested that the following relationship applies to a horizontal straw supporting a load at its mid-point.

L = k(mg)\({}^{2}\)

where

\(\bullet\) L is the length of the straw (in m),

\(\bullet\) m is the mass of the load (in kg) hanging on the straw that causes it to bend,

\(\bullet\) g is the acceleration due to gravity (in m/s\({}^{2}\)),

\(\bullet\) k is an unknown constant.

Plan an experiment to investigate the relationship between L and m.

Your plan should include:

\(\bullet\) the quantities that you should keep constant,

\(\bullet\) a detailed description of how you will perform the experiment,

\(\bullet\) a suitable table in which to display your measurements and calculated values (you do not need to enter any data into the table),

\(\bullet\) a statement of the graph that you would plot to test the relationship,

\(\bullet\) a sketch of the graph that you would obtain if the suggested relationship is correct,

\(\bullet\) and explanation of how you would obtain a value of the constants k from your graph.

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:87]

**Procedure:**

1. Set up the experiment as shown in Fig. 1.1.

2. Using a 30-cm rule, measure that the length of straw (being suspended) L is 10.0 cm.

3. Ensure that the string supporting the mass hanger is placed at the midpoint of the straw (i.e. middle of L).

4. Place a slotted mass of 10 g onto the mass hanger and check if the straw is bent.

5. Repeat step 4 by adding another slotted mass of 10 g. Continue doing so until the straw becomes bent. Record the total mass m supported by the straw before it becomes bent.

6. Calculate and record m\({}^{2}\).

7. Repeat steps 2 to 6 for 4 further lengths of the straw L at 12.0 cm, 14.0 cm, 16.0 cm and 18.0 cm.

8. Record all the results for L, m and m\({}^{2}\) in a suitable table.

\begin{tabular}{|p{142.3pt}|p{142.3pt}|} \hline L/m & m/kg & m\({}^{2}\)/kg\({}^{2}\) \\ \hline \hline
9. Plot a graph of m\({}^{2}\)/kg\({}^{2}\) against L/m.

10. If the suggested relationship is correct, a linear graph will be obtained as shown.

\(m^{2}\) / kg\({}^{2}\) \\ \hline \end{tabular}

The value of k can be determined from the gradient of the graph.

L = k(mg)\({}^{2}\)

m\({}^{2}\) = L/(kg\({}^{2}\))

Gradient = 1/(k x g\({}^{2}\))

k = 1/(Gradient x g\({}^{2}\))

**Graph Plotting:**

**Axis**

1. Highest value - Lowest value
2. Divide it by no. of big squares
3. Divide it by 10
4. Divide it by 2
5. Round of to nearest nice number (1,2,5,10,25,50)
6. That will be the precision of the axis
7. x10 of that to find range for 1 big square

**Points**

Can circle 1 outlier

Do not cross bigger than 1 small square

**Line**

Best fit line = same amount of points above and below
