## Topic synopsis

Core Idea 1 - The Cell and Biomolecules of Life - entails the study of cells, which are the basic units of life.

The following questions should help you frame your learning:

* Why is a cell the basic unit of life and how does it promote continuity of life?
* How is the basic unit crucial in understanding life?
* How are the structures of biomolecules related to their functions?
* How do cells regulate the movement of substances into and out of themselves, and what are the implications of such movements?
* What are the differences between cells of prokaryotes and eukaryotes, between cells of plants and animals, and between cells of unicellular and multicellular organisms?
* In what ways do viruses not fit the cell model?

### Sub-cellular structures provide the means to drive cellular processes

Knowing how cellular structures facilitate specific cellular processes is fundamental to explaining how life 'works'. The cell theory states that the cell is the smallest and most basic unit of life and that cells grow from existing cells. Understanding the role of cellular organelles (such as the nucleus, ribosome, chloroplast and mitochondrion) and cellular structures (for example, the cytoskeleton) will help in understanding the concept of how structure relates to function.

There are significant differences between cells of prokaryotes and eukaryotes. Using bacteria as a model, the nucleoid is not enclosed by any membrane. Plasmids may be present as extra-chromosomal DNA. Membrane-bound organelles, such as mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum, are absent. Prokaryotic ribosomes are different from eukaryotic ribosomes. Some bacterial cells have cell walls that comprise peptidoglycan rather than cellulose. Within the eukary domain, the cell model of plants is also different from that of animals. Unlike unicellular organisms which merely undergo cellular division, cells of multicellular organisms undergo division and differentiation to allow them to carry out their specific functions.

Biomolecules make up cells and cells regulate many cellular processes, including the movement of substances into and out of themselves, through membranes

The different classes of biomolecules (sugars, lipids, proteins and nucleic acids) function as molecular building blocks for macromolecules to be assembled. Nucleic acids, which include DNA and RNA, are made from monomers known as nucleotides. Phospholipids, cholesterol, carbohydrates and proteins are important components in biological membranes.

Cells need to regulate the movement of substances into and out of themselves. Substances such as water, oxygen, glucose and minerals are important in the synthesis of new molecules and important cellular processes.

According to the fluid mosaic model, cell membranes are selectively permeable due to the nature of the phospholipids and proteins from which they are made. The movement of different molecules depends on the nature of the substances through transport processes such as osmosis, diffusion and active transport. Membranes allow cells to create and maintain internal environments that are different from external environments.

Eukaryotic cells also contain internal membrane structures that partition the cell into specialised compartments so that cellular processes can occur with optimal activity e.g. chloroplasts and mitochondria. The endmembrane system, consisting of rough and smooth endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus, is responsible for protein processing and vesicular transport within the cell.

Prokaryotes generally lack such membrane-bound organelles and endomembrane systems; yet they survive and reproduce. In the endosymbiotic theory, organelles like mitochondria and chloroplasts represent formerly free-living prokaryotes that were taken inside another cell, and this could explain the link between the two domains in the tree of life.

In contrast to eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells, viruses lack several of those cellular structures. They rely on eukaryotes and prokaryotes to reproduce. In this regard, viruses are considered obligate parasites and there is debate as to whether viruses are living or non-living organisms.

## Learning Outcomes

## 1 Overview of Cells

### The Cell Theory

* The term 'cell' was coined by Robert Hooke in 1665 when he looked at thin slices of cork (a type of wood) under his microscope (Fig. 1) and discovered that cork comprised many regular box-like structures (dead cells).
* i.e. 'cells only come from other cells'.
* The 'Cell Theory' contradicted the earlier theory of 'Spontaneous Generation' which stated that living forms can be generated from non-living matter, because of observations of living organisms arising'spontaneously' from decaying matter (e.g. maggots on rotting meat).
* Many arguments went back and forth to try to disprove the 'Cell Theory', until a definitive experiment (Fig 2) by Louis Pasteur in 1859 convinced the scientific world of the presence of airborne microorganisms.

* The unique swan-neck feature of the flasks used in Pasteur's experiment allowed air to enter the flask but prevented the entry of bacterial and fungal spores.
* Pasteur's experiment consisted of two parts. In the first part, the broth in the flask was boiled to sterilize it. When this broth was cooled, it remained free of contamination. In the second part of the experiment, the flask was boiled and then the neck was broken off. The broth in this flask became contaminated.

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:7]

* Cells are extremely small and can be seen only with a microscope. The approximate diameters of cells and their components are as shown (Table 1): 

* When appropriately stained, the following structures can be clearly visible under a light microscope:
* Starch grain
* Cell membrane
* Cell wall

Which of the following is **NOT** one of the main components of the cell theory?

* cells must contain DNA
* all living things are made of cells
* cells can only come from other cells
* cells are the basic unit of life

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|} \hline
**Cells and their components** & **Diameter** \\ \hline Plant cell & 40 \(\mu\)m \\ \hline Animal cell & 20 \(\mu\)m \\ \hline
**Nucleus** & 10 \(\mu\)m to 20 \(\mu\)m \\ \hline Bacterium & 1 \(\mu\)m \\ \hline
**Mitochondrion** & 0.5 \(\mu\)m to 1.5 \(\mu\)m \\ \hline
**Lysosome** & 0.2 \(\mu\)m to 0.5 \(\mu\)m \\ \hline Cilium and flagellum & 0.2 \(\mu\)m \\ \hline Microtubule & 24 nm \\ \hline

1 nanometer (nm) = 10\({}^{-3}\)\(\mu\)m & \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 1: Approximate diameters of cells and their components _(FYI)_.

### 1.2 Cell fractionation

* To study the anatomy and components of the cell, it needs to be first broken up / **homogenized**. This can be done by using a blender (Fig. 1.4), chemicals or ultrasonic waves, while suspending the cells in an isotonic solution.
* During homogenization, most organelles stay intact, except the endoplasmic reticulum which is broken into small pieces (due to its extensive membrane). These small pieces of membrane tend to reseal into vesicles known as microsomes.
* After homogenization, **cell fractionation** techniques can then be used to separate the various cell components, while preserving their individual functions so that they can be studied.
* The most common fractionation method is **centrifugation** (Fig. 1.5), which spins homogenised samples at very high speeds, thus subjecting them to centrifugal force and separating organelles **based on their size and/or density**.
* The **larger** or **denser** the organelle/molecule, the **faster** it **sinks** to the bottom of the centrifuge tube to form a pellet (sediment).
* E.g. **Differential centrifugation** (separation by size) (Fig. 1.5):
* the cell homogenate is subjected to centrifugation with **progressively higher speeds**, thus isolating organelles of progressively smaller sizes after each round of centrifugation.

Figure 1.5: Centrifugation is done by increasing the speed progressively, which isolates increasingly smaller components of the cell.

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:11]

Animal and plant cells share many structures and organelles. Structures present in the cells of plants but not animals include the cell wall and the chloroplasts. Plants do not have centrioles. Note that the electron micrographs are two-dimensional "slices," whereas cells are three-dimensional.

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:14]

## 2.1 What are the organelles and structures that eukaryotic cells possess?

* All eukaryotic cells have the **same basic set of structures and organelles**, which may be membrane-bound or non-membrane-bound.
* The **cell surface membrane** of eukaryotic cells surrounds the cell cytoplasm and separates the cell content from the external environment.
* The **internal membrane system** separates the organelles from the cytosol to allow compartmentalization of organelles for specialized functions.

#### Cell Surface Membrane / Plasma Membrane

_(To be covered in detail under Topic 2: Cellular Transport)_

* At the boundary of every cell, the cell surface membrane functions as a **selective barrier** that allows passage of enough oxygen, nutrients and wastes to meet the metabolic needs of the entire cell.
* The cell surface membrane comprises **phospholipids** arranged in a **bilayer** with the **hydrophobic fatty acid tails** facing inwards and the **hydrophilic phosphate heads** facing the aqueous environment. (Fig. 3a).

* This bilayer is approximately **7 to 10 nm** in width.

Figure 3a: An electron micrograph and diagram of a phospholipid bilayer* It exists as a **stable boundary** between two aqueous compartments due to the molecular arrangement sheltering the hydrophobic fatty acid tails of the phospholipids from water while exposing the hydrophilic phosphate heads to water.
* Phospholipids and most other membrane constituents are **amphipathic** molecules, which have both hydrophobic regions and hydrophilic regions. The phospholipid bilayer is stabilized by **hydrophobic and hydrophilic interactions**.
* The amphipathic property of phospholipids allows the membrane to **re-seal** itself when the bilayer is disrupted.
* The bilayer is **dynamic** and its components (such as proteins and cholesterol) are constantly in motion (Fig. 2.3a). Hence the term **"fluid mosaic model"** is used to describe the structure of membranes.
* Functions of the cell surface membrane: _(Refer to Topic 2)_

#### Nucleus (plural: Nuclei)

_Link to Topic 4: The cell cycle & 5: DNA replication and Gene expression_

* It is found in **all eukaryotic cells** except in mature red blood cells in mammals and in sieve tubes in plants.
* Cells may be uninucleated, binucleated or multinucleated.
* A nucleus (Fig. 2.3b): \(\circ\) is usually **spherical** or **ovoid** \(\circ\) is about 10-20 \(\upmu\)m in diameter
* It also contains: \(\circ\)**A nuclear envelope**, which is a double membrane (i.e. 2 phospholipid bilayers) and perforated by **nuclear pores** \(\circ\)**Nucleoplasm** \(\circ\)**Nucleolus / nucleoli (plural)** \(\circ\)**Genetic material (DNA)** which controls all cellular activities, including cell division and protein synthesis. \(\circ\) A **nuclear matrix** (framework of fibres) which extends throughout the nucleus \(\circ\)**Nuclear lamina**, a network array of protein filaments lining the inner surface of the nuclear envelope to mechanically support the nucleus 

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:17]

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:18]

d) Chromatin/Chromosomes
* A chromatin thread consists of **a molecule of DNA coiled around proteins known as histones**. [Note: eukaryotic DNA is _linear_.]
* In resting/non-dividing cells, the chromatin is not visible under the light microscope as they are too fine and highly elongated.
* There are 2 types of chromatin (Fig. 3e) \(\circ\) **Euchromatin** (lightly stained). Loosely coiled regions, where genes are **transcriptionally active**. \(\circ\) **Heterochromatin** (densely stained). Tightly coiled regions, where genes are **transcriptionally inactive.
* During nuclear division, chromatin threads undergo **condensation** to become **chromosomes** (Fig. 3f), which are visible under light microscope.
* Chromosome number and size are characteristic to each species.

Figure 3: A chromosome is visible under the light microscope.

Figure 2: Schematic and heterochromatin in a nucleus

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:20]

#### Ribosomes

* A ribosome is a **complex** of **ribosomal RNA (rRNA)** and **proteins** and **does** **not** have a **membrane**.
* It functions as the **site of protein synthesis**.
* Each ribosome is made up of a **large subunit** and a **small subunit**. In eukaryotic cells, **rRNA complexes with ribosomal proteins to form each subunit in the **nucleolus**.
* The **large and small subunits then assemble together in the cytosol to form a functional ribosome** during translation. (Fig. 2.3g).
* There are two types of ribosomes (Fig. 2.3g):
* **70S ribosomes**, which are found in prokaryotes, chloroplasts and mitochondria.
* **80S ribosomes**, which are found in eukaryotes as **free ribosomes*
* in the cytosol and **bound ribosomes*
* attached to the rough ER. Free and bound ribosomes are structurally identical and can alternate between the two roles (Fig. 2.3h).
* Free ribosomes synthesize:
* proteins that are released in the cytosol and used within cell
* e.g. cytosolic proteins, glycolytic enzymes involved in cellular respiration, histone proteins in nucleus, enzymes in mitochondria & chloroplasts
* Bound ribosomes synthesize:
* **membrane-anchored proteins*
* (usually extracellular side e.g. hormone receptors)
* **proteins destined for secretion*
* (e.g. insulin hormone)

Fig. 2.3g: The components that comprise the prokaryotic 70S ribosome and the eukaryotic 80S ribosome* Many ribosomes are often found to be attached to a single mRNA molecule during translation. This complex of mRNA and the ribosomes are called **polypisosomes** or **polysomes** (Fig. 2.3i).

Figure 2.3i: A drawing and an electron micrograph of a polysome. Arrow on the micrograph indicates entry of ribosome to mRNA. Note the growing polypeptide chain as the ribosomes move along the mRNA

Figure 2.3h: An electron micrograph of free and bound ribosomes

Key Concept4:
* Different organelles work together to accomplish the functions of life.
* The endomembrane system comprises the nuclear envelope, endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, lysosomes and vesicles.
* The endomembrane system regulates protein traffic and performs metabolic functions in the cell.

#### 2.1.4 Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER)

* ER is a **single membrane-bound** organelle consisting of a system of **sacs** called **cisernae** (plural) (singular: cisterna).
* The ER is continuous with the outer nuclear membrane.
* The ER membrane separates the internal compartment of the ER, called **ER lumen**, from the cytosol.
* There are 2 types of ER: the **rough ER** and the **smooth ER** (Fig. 2.3), each of which has a different role in the synthesis and packaging of proteins and lipids respectively.

#### 2.1.5 Rough Endoplasmic Reticulum

* Cisternae are **flattened** sacs, which are **interconnected** with each other and are continuous with the outer membrane of the nuclear envelope.
* It bears **ribosomes** on the surface for **protein synthesis.**
* Functions of the rough ER include:
* Bound by **ribosomes*
* which are the sites for **protein synthesis*
* (Fig. 2.3k, l).
* Polypeptide chains **enter the rER lumen**, where they **fold*
* into its 3D conformation and undergo **biochemical modification**. An example of biochemical modification is **glycosylation*
* (addition of oligosaccharides to proteins) to form glycoproteins.
* **ER / transport vesicles** are formed from the ER to transport proteins to the Golgi apparatus for further modification.

Figure 2.3: The structural difference between the rough and smooth ER

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:24]

**b)**: **Smooth Endoplasmic Reticulum** (Fig. 2.3j, Fig. 2.3m)
* The smooth ER lacks ribosomes.
* It consists of **tubular** **cisternae**.
* It has a different set of membrane-bound proteins (eg. enzymes).
* Functions of the smooth ER include:
* **Synthesis and transport of lipids*
* (e.g. oils, steroids, phospholipids).
* The sER membrane contains enzymes that make membrane phospholipids (assembled from their precursors in the cytosol). This contributes to the **replenishment** and increase in surface area of the **phospholipid bilayer of the cell surface membrane**.
* **Metabolism of carbohydrates** e.g. synthesis of glycogen in liver cells
* **Detoxification of drugs and poisons** in liver cells. This usually involves adding hydroxyl groups to drug molecules, making them more soluble and easier to flush from the body.
* **Storage of Ca\({}^{2+}\)**e.g. in muscle cells, where calcium ions act as signaling molecules to trigger muscle contraction.

Figure 2.3m: A diagram and an electron micrograph of the sER and fER

#### Golgi Apparatus (GA) / Golgi body

* The GA is made up of **a stack of flattened** and **curved single membrane-bound sacs** called **cisternae** (Fig. 2.3n).
* Compared to the ER, the GA has a slight curvature, with its _cis_ face usually being nearer to the nucleus, and the _trans_ face pointing away from the nucleus.
* At the _cis_ face or the outer convex face, new cisternae are constantly formed by the **fusion of vesicles** from the rough ER and smooth ER.
* As the products of the ER move from the _cis_ face to the _trans_ face of the GA by **repeated budding and fusing of vesicles**, the products undergo **biochemical modification**. Different cisternae contain unique teams of enzymes to catalyse these reactions.
* At the _trans_ face or the inner concave face, various vesicles **bud off*
* from the Golgi Apparatus. Depending on their content and function, these vesicles could be:
* Primary lysosomes,
* Secretory vesicles (containing products destined for secretion out of the cell), or
* Other kinds of **Golgi vesicles**. _cis_ face ("receiving" side of Golgi apparatus)
* The functions of the Golgi apparatus include:
* At the _cis_ face, it receives products (proteins and lipids) from the ER and **further biochemically modifies*
* them as they travel through the GA through repeated fusion and budding of vesicles. Depending on the cell type, this modification may vary:
* For example in phagocytes, which are white blood cells that help the body fight infections, the GA modifies large amounts of hydrolytic enzymes to be packaged in primary lysosomes.
* One example of modification is **glycosylation*
* to form glycoproteins and glycolipids in cells. Glycoprotein and glycolipids formed in the ER have their carbohydrates modified in GA to produce a larger variety of carbohydrates.
* The GA in many fibroblast cells also function to add hydroxyl groups (**hydroxylation**) to collagen polypeptide chains, which is crucial for collagen assembly (See _topic 2: Biomolecules of life_).

Fig. 2.3: A diagram (left) and electron micrograph (right) of the Golgi apparatus

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:27]

#### Lysosomes

* 0.5um in diameter, formed from the GA.
* It is bound by a **single membrane**.
* It contains **hydrolytic enzymes (acid hydrolases)** that **digest all the major classes of macromolecules**, e.g. proteases, carbohydrates, lipases and nucleases.
* It also serves as a storage vesicle to **keep the enzymes apart** from the rest of the cell, hence preventing it from destroying the cell.
* Its contents are **acidic**; the enzymes have an optimal pH of about 5. The acidic internal pH of lysosomes is maintained by a **proton (H+ ions) pump** on the lysosomal membrane, which actively transports protons from the cytosol into the lysosome.
* There are 2 types of lysosomes:
* **Primary lysosomes*
* are those that bud off from the Golgi Apparatus.
* **Secondary lysosomes** arise from the fusion of the primary lysosomes with the endocytic vesicles/endosomes such as food vacuole, or phagocytic vesicle/phagosome, or pinocytic vesicles.
* Functions of lysosomes include:
* **Intracellular digestion*
* (digestion of materials taken into the cell) (Fig. 2.3p-f)
* Enables the cell to digest food materials taken in _via_**endocytosis**, which includes **phagocytosis*
* (solid particles), **pinocytosis*
* (fluid particles) and **receptor-mediated endocytosis*
* _[See topic 2: Cellular transport]_.
* Primary lysosomes fuse with the phagocytic/food/pinocytic vesicles so that the digestive enzymes could mix with the contents and carry out digestion.
* The useful products (e.g. amino acids, sugars, nucleotides) are released into the cytosol for reuse, while residues are discharged by exocytosis.

* (Fig. 2.3p-r)
* **Destruction of worn-out organelles.*
* Primary lysosomes **fuse*
* with vesicles containing worn-out organelles to form **secondary lysosomes**. The digested products are returned to the cytosol for re-use.

* **Self-destruction of the cell*
* by the release of the lysosomal contents within the cell.
* For example, transformation of tadpoles into frogs involves autolysis of cells making up the tail muscles of the tadpoles.

4. The diagram below shows part of the endomembrane system in a cell.

#### Mitochondrion (plural: mitochondria)

(Fig. 2.3s-t)

_Link to Topic 3: Respiration_

The mitochondrion is \(1.5-10\)\(\upmu\)m in length and \(0.25\) - \(1.00\)\(\upmu\)m in width.

It is a **double membrane-bound** organelle found in _all_**eukaryotic cells**.

The **outer membrane** is smooth and is permeable to small molecules of molecular mass \(<\) 21000 daltons.

The **inner membrane** is selectively permeable and extensively folded into shelf-like **crisate (plural)** [singular: crista]. This increases the surface area for enzyme attachment needed for the electron transport chain and oxidative phosphorylation during **cellular respiration**. Cellular respiration generates energy in the form of ATP, by extracting energy from sugars, fats, and other fuels

The outer and inner membranes enclose the **intermembrane space**, which holds **high concentration of protons (H+)** for the establishment of a **proton gradient**, required for oxidative phosphorylation during cellular respiration _[See topic: Respiration]_.

The **mitochondrial matrix** is semi-fluid and finely granular. It contains:

A mixture of proteins and lipids.

**Circular DNA** of the mitochondria, which carries **genes** that encode enzymes and proteins that are responsible for cellular respiration.

**70S ribosomes**, which synthesizes proteins (eg. enzymes) required in the mitochondria.

RNA and enzymes that control the Kreb's cycle and fatty acid oxidation.

* **Stalked particles** are present on the inner membrane on the side facing the matrix. Each particle contains a head piece, stalk and base. The head piece (F\({}_{1}\) portion) contains **ATP synthase** for adenosine triphosphate (ATP) synthesis.
* **Functions of the mitochondrion include:*
* Site of **synthesis of ATP*
* (cellular energy) for all cellular functions.
* **Lipid metabolism**. Fatty acids are broken down to acetyl CoA in the matrix and on the inner membrane of the mitochondrion.
* **Lipid synthesis**. Synthesis of fatty acids from acetyl-CoA precursors by fatty acid synthases in mitochondria
* **Apoptosis**. Release of certain mitochondrial proteins into the cytosol can initiate programmed cell death.
* The organelle moves by **cytoplasmic streaming** (circular flow of cytoplasm within cells) to areas where more ATP is required.

Fig. 2.3: Sub-structures of a mitochondrion.

#### Chloroplast (Fig. 2.3u)

_Link to Topic 3: Photosynthesis_

* This organelle is found in photosynthetic organisms such as plants.
* 10 \(\upmu\)m in length
* It has 3 membranes: Outer membrane, inner membrane and thylakoid membranes
* A **double membrane** (outer membrane and inner membrane) encloses the **intermembrane-space**.
* Inside the chloroplast is a system of **flattened, interconnected sacs** known as **thylakoids**. **Stacks of thylakoids** are called **granum (singular)** or **grana (plural)**. Protein complexes embedded on the thylakoid membrane are involved in the conversion of light energy to chemical energy during the light-dependent stage of photosynthesis.
* The fluid surrounding the thylakoid membrane is the **stroma**. It contains:
* **Circular DNA*
* of the chloroplast, which contains **genes that code for enzymes and proteins*
* responsible for photosynthesis.
* **70S ribosomes**, which synthesizes proteins (eg. enzymes) required in the chloroplast.
* Proteins/enzymes involved in photosynthesis.
* Starch grains/granules.
* Functions of the chloroplast include:
* The chloroplasts are the **sites of photosynthesis**. The light-dependent reactions of photosynthesis occur at the thylakoid membrane while the light-independent reactions occur in the stroma.

Figure 2.3u: A drawing (left) and an electron micrograph (right) of a chloroplast.

**Important: Endosymbiotic theory (Origin of mitochondria and chloroplasts)**

Evolutionary studies suggest that both **mitochondria** and **chloroplasts** were once free living bacteria, which gets engulfed by an ancestral eukaryotic cell, and eventually became part of it (i.e. became an endosymbiont, a cell living within another cell).

Over the course of evolution, the host cell and its endosymbiont merged into a single organism. This gives rise to the modern eukaryotic cell with a mitochondrion (and chloroplast - for plant cells) (Fig. 14).

Evidence that support the endosymbiotic theory are:

1. Presence of \(\underline{\phantom{\rule{0.0pt}{1.0pt}}}\) in prokaryotic cells and these two organelles, while eukaryotic DNA are **linear** in nature.
2. Presence of \(\underline{\phantom{\rule{0.0pt}{1.0pt}}}\) in prokaryotic cells and these two organelles, while cytosolic free ribosomes and ER-bound ribosomes in eukaryotic cells are **805** in nature.
3. These two organelles are enclosed by **double-membrane** - the ancestor eukaryotic cells engulfed bacteria by phagocytosis/endocytosis, and the bacteria eventually become the mitochondria or chloroplast. The outer membrane is derived from the ancestral eukaryotic cell's plasma membrane and the inner membrane from the bacteria.
4. Both organelles undergo **binary fission** (mitochondria and chloroplast are able to divide independently) - eukaryotic cells undergo nuclear division while prokaryotic cells undergo binary fission.

Figure 15: Illustration of the Endosymbiotic theory.

The electron micrograph shows a section of a plant cell in which several organelles contain both DNA and RNA.

Which statements correctly describe the activities of the labelled regions of the cell?

1 Both P and Q contain DNA which can be transcribed into messenger RNA (mRNA).

2 Both P and Q contain ribosomal RNA (rRNA) and can translate mRNA.

#### 2.1.10 Cytoskeleton

* The cytoskeleton is a network of fibres extending throughout the cytoplasm to maintain cell shape, organise structures and activities in the cell.
* It is composed of three types of molecular structures:
* **Microtubules**, which form major structures in the cell such as centrioles, spindle fibres _(Topic 4: The Cell Cycle)_, cilia and flagella
* Actin filaments
* Intermediate filaments
* Functions of the different cytoskeletal structures:

\begin{tabular}{l|c|c|c|c} \hline  & **Microtubules** & **Actin filaments** & **Intermediate filaments** \\ \hline Main functions & \(\bullet\) Maintain cell shape & \(\bullet\) Maintain cell shape & \(\bullet\) Maintain cell shape & \(\bullet\) Maintain cell shape \\  & \(\bullet\) Forms centrioles & \(\bullet\) Changes cell shape & \(\bullet\) Anchor nucleus and \\  & Chromosome & (e.g. for muscle & & certain organelles \\  & movements in cell & contraction) & \(\bullet\) Formation of nuclear \\  & division _(Topic 4: Cell division)_ & \(\bullet\) Cytoplasmic & & lamina \\  & \(\bullet\) Cell motility (as in cilia & \(\bullet\) Cell motility (as in & \\  & or flagella for & & pseudopodia _(Topic & \\  & locomotion) & _2: Transport_) & \\  & \(\bullet\) Provide tracks for cell organelles and vesicles & & Cell division & \\  & movement & & (cleavage of furrow & \\ \hline Fluorescence micrographs & & & & \\ \hline \end{tabular}

#### Plant Cell Wall

(Fig. 3x)

* The plant cell has an extracellular structure, the cell wall, which distinguishes it from an animal cell.
* It comprises three types of **polysaccharides**: (1) cellulose microfibrils, (2) pectin, and (3) hemicelluloses (Fig. 3x).
* Synthesis of cell wall
* **Pectin and hemicelluloses** are synthesized in the **Golgi apparatus** and transported via Golgi vesicles to the cell surface, where the cell wall is formed (See section 4)
* On the other hand, **cellulose microfibrils** are synthesized directly on the **plasma membrane**, at the side facing the exterior, using \(\beta\)-glucose in the cytosol. **Cellulose synthases** embedded in the cell membrane catalyse the reaction (Fig 3y).

* Function of plant cell wall:
* Provide tensile strength
* Maintain plant cell shape and structure
* Protect plant cells against mechanical and osmotic stress

Figure 3: Cellulose synthase complex on the plasma membrane is responsible for the synthesis of cellulose microfibrils.

### 2.2 Functional relationship between different organelles 2.1.1 to 2.1.6 (Fig 2.4)

1. DNA in the **nucleus** serves as a template to synthesize mRNA, which is then transported out of the **nuclear pore** into the **cytosol**.
2. The mRNA can either be bound by a **free ribosome in cytosol** (if the protein is to be used within the cell) or by a **ribosome on rough ER** (if the protein is to be secreted or membrane-anchored) to form the mRNA-ribosome complex. Protein synthesis begins.
3. The polypeptide chain synthesized enters the ER lumen and **folds** into its tertiary/quaternary structure (3D conformation). The protein may undergo **biochemical modification (e.g. glycosylation).**
4. **ER vesicles** carrying the protein **bud off** from the ER, and travel towards the **cis-face of Golgi apparatus**.
5. ER vesicles **fuse** with the membrane of the Golgi apparatus.
6. As the protein travels through the Golgi apparatus through **repeated budding and fusion of vesicles**, it undergoes further biochemical modification.
7. At the _trans_ face of the Golgi apparatus, the modified protein is **sorted** and **packaged** into a **Golgi vesicle**, which **buds off** from the Golgi apparatus.
8. Depending on the type of protein that the Golgi vesicle carries, the Golgi vesicle may travel to different parts of the cell. For example: 1. A **secretory vesicle** that is carrying a **secretory protein** (e.g. insulin in Islet of Langerhans cells of the pancreas) moves towards the cell surface membrane and fuse with it to **secrete** its content out of the cell via **exocytosis**. This is known as the **secretory pathway**.
9. A Golgi vesicle with an embedded **transmembrane protein** in its membrane moves towards the cell surface membrane and fuses with it. The transmembrane protein then gets **embedded into the cell surface membrane**.
10. Golgi vesicle that is carrying hydrolytic enzymes (e.g. in phagocytic white blood cells) would become a **primary lysosome**.

## 3 Prokaryotic Cells

_Key Concept 5:_

* Prokaryotic cells lack membrane-bound organelles.
* All bacteria contain cytoplasm, ribosomes, plasma membrane, nucleoid and almost all bacteria have peptidoglycan cell wall

### What are Prokaryotes?

Link to Topic 10: Organisation of Genome & Control of

Gene Expression in Prokaryotes

* A prokaryote is a small, single-celled organism (unicellular) that lacks a membrane-bound nucleus _(Greek: karyon)_ and other membrane-bound organelles
* The main type of prokaryotes is bacteria.
* Bacteria reproduce by binary fission.

### What are the structures of a bacterial cell?

* Dimension of bacteria:

* diameter of ~1 \(\upmu\)m, length of \(\mathbf{0.1-10\ \upmu}\)m, as compared to eukaryotic cells (diameter of 10-100 \(\upmu\)m)
* Bacterial cells have a variety of shapes, the three most common of which are spheres (cocci), rods (bacilli), and spirals (Fig. 3.1)

* Bacteria do not have a nucleus; they have a nucleoid region (i.e. not membrane-bound)
* The nucleoid region contains one circular double-stranded bacterial chromosome.
* Smaller circular double-stranded DNA known as plasmids (Fig. 3.2) can also be found in some bacteria.
* Most bacterial cell walls contain peptidoglycan to give shape of the bacteria and prevent lysis due to osmosis. (Fig 3.3 & 3.4)

Fig 3.1: Common shapes of bacteriaFigure 3.4: Peptidoglycan is a polymer composed of modified sugars (N-acetylglucosamine and N-acetylmuramic acid) cross-linked by short polypeptides. _(Note: Details of the cell wall are not required.)_

Figure 3.3: Most bacterial cell walls contain peptidoglycanvan which is complexed with other components to give the cell wall its rigidity. _(Note: Details of the cell wall are not required.)_

### _What are viruses?_ Link to Topic 9: Organisation & Inheritance of Viral Genomes

* Viruses are the simplest biological systems which _lack_ the structures and metabolic enzymes and organelles found in cells.
* They are considered as **infectious particles**, as they are capable of causing a wide variety of diseases and can be spread between organisms.
* Viruses range from about **20 nm to 400 nm*
* (Fig. 4.1) in length.
* The tiniest viruses are only 20nm in diameter, smaller than a ribosome.
* They can only be observed under the electron microscope but not light microscope.
* They can pass through the small pores of filters. These filters are able to retain bacteria but not virus.
* Some uses of viruses: a) They serve as **models*
* for the study of DNA replication, transcription and translation.
* Their unique genetic mechanisms help explain their **pathogenicity*
* (ability to produce an infectious disease in an organism).
* Their replication mechanisms promote the development of **genetic engineering*

Fig 4.1: Relative sizes of various viruses compared to a bacterial cell and human red blood cell.

### What are the structural components of viruses?

* Viruses generally consist of: (Fig 4.2)
* **nucleic acid (viral genome)*
* enclosed within a
* **protein coat (capsid)
* **and in some cases, a membranous envelope (viral envelope)**.
* [The combined structure of the viral genome and capsid is known as a **nucleocapsid**.]
* They **lack cellular organisation** (e.g. no cytoplasm and cellular organelles like ribosomes).
* The **viral nucleic acid / genome** may be DNA or RNA, single or double-stranded, and codes for only a few structural proteins (e.g. capsid proteins and viral glycoproteins) and non-structural/regulatory proteins involved in viral reproduction.
* The **viral capsid** is a hollow protein shell which is built from large number of protein subunits known as **capsomeres**.
* The capsid functions to:
* Enclose and **protect the viral genome*
* from digestion by enzymes.
* Contain **proteins*
* on its surface that aid in the attachment to and penetration of the host cell.
* Carry viral **enzymes*
* involved in viral replication.

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:50]

### How to classify viruses?

* Viruses can be grouped according to:
* and **chemical composition*
* of the **genome*
* (i.e. DNA or RNA viruses)
* Most effective form of classification as viruses with the same genetic material usually behave in a similar manner.
* **Presence or absence*
* of the **viral envelope**.
* **Shape of capsid**, which may be: (Fig. 4.4)
* - Capsid is a **hollow tube*
* with a protein wall shaped like a **rod*
* or a **hollow cylinder*
* which may be either rigid or flexible. (E.g. tobacco mosaic virus)
* - Capsid is a **regular polyhedron*
* consisting of 20 equilateral triangular faces and 12 vertices which appears spherical. (E.g. adenovirus)
* - Capsid has a **symmetry*
* that is **neither purely icosahedral nor helical*
* but is usually a complicated shaped structure with specialized function. (E.g. bacteriophage)

Figure 4.4: (a) Tobacco mosaic virus with a helical capsid. (b) Adenovirus with a icosahedral capsid. (c) Influenza viruses have an envelope studded with glycoprotein spikes. (d) Bacteriophage T4 has a complex capsid consisting of an icosahedral head and a tail apparatus.

### Are viruses living or non-living?

\begin{tabular}{|l|} \hline Recap \\ \hline \(\bullet\) & The **Cell Theory** attempts to define what is considered living, and suggests that: \\ \(\circ\) & A cell is the **smallest, basic unit of life**. \\ \(\circ\) & All living organisms are made up of one (**unicellular** organism) or more (**multicellular** organism) cells. \\ \(\circ\) & All cells arise from pre-existing cells by **cell division**. \\ \(\circ\) & Cells contain **genetic material** which is passed from parent cells to daughter cells. \\ \(\circ\) & All **metabolic processes** occur within cells. \\ \hline \end{tabular}

\(\bullet\) Viruses are called **obligate intracellular parasites** (parasites that can only reproduce within a host). Examples of obligate parasites include some bacteria (eg. Chlamydia) and protozoa (eg. Plasmodium).

\(\bullet\) Viruses exhibit **BOTH living and non-living characteristics**, so they challenge the cell theory and the concept of what is considered living.

\(\circ\) Arguments for viruses being **living organisms**:

\(\bullet\) Viruses **possess genetic material** (DNA or RNA).

\(\bullet\) Viruses are capable of **reproducing themselves within host cells.**

\(\bullet\) Viruses can **adapt** to changing environmental conditions (E.g. mutate).

\(\circ\) Arguments for viruses being **non-living organisms**:

\(\bullet\) Viruses **do not have cellular organization** - contain no cytoplasm or cellular organelles.

\(\bullet\) Viruses **cannot carry out metabolic processes on their own**, due to the lack of metabolic enzymes and organelles (E.g. Viruses lack ribosomes, hence, cannot synthesize proteins for survival).

\(\bullet\) They **cannot reproduce independently by cell division** from pre-existing viruses.
