## 1 IntroductionMAGNETIC SEPARATION

Magnetic Materials

Nickel Magnetic separation is used to separate magnetic material from a mixture with other non-magnetic materials. (Scrapeyard)

S t' Nics girls are pretty right? Know a Nicholas that is handsome? Are you attracted? That's right, magnetic material.

## EVAPORATION TO DRYNESS

For this method, the solution is heated until all the **water** is **evaporated** completely, **leaving behind only the solid**.

However, a **limitation** to this method is that it **cannot be used for solids that decompose on heating**.

For example, sugar decomposes upon heating, salt however does not.

*A saturated solution contains the maximum amount of solute that can be dissolved in the solvent at a particular temperature.

Crystallisation is different from evaporation to dryness.

The aim of crystallisation aim is not to evaporate ALL of the water, but rather it focuses on heating it till saturation. After which, it is left to cool in order to obtain the crystals.

This is used for crystals that decompose upon heating to be collected. (ie: sugar)

Steps:

1) Heat the solution till saturation.

2) Allow the saturated solution to cool and pure solid crystals will form slowly.

3) Filter to collect the crystals.

4) Wash the crystals with cold distilled water and dry between sheets of filter paper.

Ultimately, what it boils down to the nature of the salt.

The critical question to ask is:

Will the solute **decompose under heating**?

If yes, use crystallisation.

If not, use evaporation to dryness.

Example:

Sugar decomposes under heat, crystallisation is the correct choice.

Salt has high melting & boiling point, evaporation to dryness will get the job done.

**SIMPLE DISTILLATION**

1) Heat the solution in a round-bottomed flask for even heat distribution. Boiling chips are added to prevent vigorous movement of liquid which ensure smooth boiling.

2) The water boils and water vapour rises and enters the condenser. The water vapour cools down in the condenser and is collected as a distillate.

3) The **distillate** is collected in a conical flask to prevent spillage.

**FRACTIONAL DISTILLATION**

1) Heat the mixture. The liquid with the lowest boiling point will be the first to be vaporised.

2) Its vapour will rise up to the top of the

fractionating column, cooled as it passes through

the condenser and be collected as the distillate.

Ensure the temperature remains the same until

all of first vapour has condensed.

3) Collect the distillate in the conical flask.

4) Repeat the process and collect the different

substances that were in the mixture.

So in which situations is simple distillation used and which situations do we use fractional distillation?

## Chapter 11 CHROMATOGARDHY

Chromatography is used to separate and identify miscible solutes that are dissolved together. (Food substances, dye etc...)

The different components can be identified by comparing their **Rf values (retention factor)**.

Chromatography works under this principle: the rate at which a particular solute moves

relative to the solvent is fixed.
