## 1 X-ray Spectra

### Set-up

The key parts of the x-ray tube are shown in Fig. 1.1. The heated cathode emits electrons which are accelerated by a high voltage of tens to hundreds of kV. A _small_ portion (-1%) of the electrons' kinetic energies is converted to x-rays when they collide with the tungsten atoms. The bulk of the kinetic energies become heat that is conducted away by a good conductor or with the use of circulating cooling liquid.

An electron reaching the tungsten target gained KE at the expense of electric PE lost,

\[\frac{1}{2}\,m_{\mathrm{e}}v^{2}=eV_{a}\]

where \(V_{a}\) is the accelerating p.d, \(m_{\mathrm{e}}\) and \(e\) are the electron mass and charge respectively.

The resulting x-ray spectrum is made up of two parts - a continuous spectrum and a discrete spectrum.

The high speeds of the electrons allow them to penetrate the target atoms. The size of an atom is \(\sim\) 10\({}^{\text{-10}}\) m while the size of a nucleus is \(\sim\) 10\({}^{\text{-15}}\) m and the electron is even smaller. If the nucleus were 1 mm in size, then the atom would be about 100 m across. However, in the vast empty space inside the atom, the electric field of the nucleus attracts an incoming electron and curves it around. The _strong_ force and therefore acceleration(centripetal plus linear) results in radiation of an _energetic_ x-ray photon, slowing down the electron in the process.

Figure 1.2:

Figure 1.3:

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:2]

Figure 1.8 shows that when accelerating p.d. is too low, the incoming electrons do not have enough energy to knock out the innermost electrons and so the spectrum only has the continuous part without the discrete contribution known as the _characteristic_ x-rays. At a high enough p.d. of 25 kV, the characteristic spikes are present. The _characteristic_ radiation is so called because the exact wavelengths and spacing of the lines or spikes are characteristic of the specific kind of target atoms.

The key difference between Fig. 1.8 and Fig. 1.9 is that the horizontal axis is photon _wavelength_ and _energy_ respectively. Fig. 1.9 is similar to a plot against frequency (_E = ht_).

Figure 1.9:

A potential well or barrier need not be concrete and visible. For example, Fig. 2.4 shows the potential energy between a nucleus and an electron in an isolated atom for variable electron position \(x\). An electron with negative total energy is thus trapped in a potential energy well of the same shape as the plotted graph.

## 3 Wave and Probability Density Functions

Recall that de Broglie came up with the relation \(\lambda=h/p\) for the wavelength of particles. The waves of particles with mass are called _matter_ waves. In 1926, Schrodinger developed an equation(\(\dot{n}\frac{\partial\varphi}{\partial t}=-\frac{h^{2}}{2m}\frac{ \partial^{2}\psi}{\partial x^{2}}+U(x)\psi\) ) for these matter waves. \(\Psi\) is a mathematical function which describes how the values of \(\Psi\) vary with spatial coordinates and time just like those displacement-time and displacement-distance equations or functions in the topic Waves. Thus \(\Psi\) is called a _wave function_ as it represents a waveform which may progress in time. If we want to highlight its spatial(3D) and time dependence we would write it as \(\Psi(x,y,z,t)\).

Just as a quadratic equation has solutions which are some _numbers_, the Schrodinger equation has solutions but they are mathematical _functions_. For example, \(x^{2}-x-2=0\) is \((x+1)(x-2)=0\) and has solutions \(x=-1\), \(2\) while the solutions of the 1D Schrodinger equation looks like \(\Psi(x,t)=\zeta[\cos(\alpha x-\omega t)+\sin(\alpha x-\omega t)]\) where \(C\), \(k\) & \(\omega\) are constants & \(i=\sqrt{-1}\).

The last two paragraphs are not needed for exams but just to provide some sense of how the wave function comes about. The important thing is regarding the interpretation of the wave function. In the same year that Schrodinger published his equation, Max Born provided the _probability interpretation_ of the wave function \(\Psi\):

The square of the absolute value of the wave function gives the _probability density function_\(P(x,t)=|\Psi(x,t)|^{2}\). For 1-dimensional case, \(P(x,t)\) tells us the probability per unit length for finding a particle at \(x\) at time \(t\).

The wave function \(\Psi\) itself _does not_ correspond to any measurable physical quantity. Only \(|\Psi|^{2}\) has a physical meaning. In the Schrodinger equation, \(U(x)\) is a function that describes the potential energy just like in Fig. 2.2 or 2.4. To better understand the wave function and probability density function, we will look at an example involving an 'infinite potential well'.

Figure 2.5: Why do you need to take the square of the _absolute_ value and not just simply square the wave function? The reason is that in most cases, the wave function turns out to be a _complex_ quantity containing \(i(-\sqrt{-1})\). For a _real_ quantity \(x\), \(x^{2}=|x|^{2}\) but for a _complex_ quantity \(z\), \(x^{2}=|x|^{2}\).

Figure 2.4:

Consider a particle trapped inside a PE well that is infinitely deep and take the bottom of the well to be at zero energy. Mathematically,

\[U(x)=\left\{\begin{array}{ll}\infty&\text{for}\quad x<0\\ 0&\text{for}\quad 0\leq x\leq d\\ \infty&\text{for}\quad d<x\end{array}\right.\]

The Schrodinger equation with the above \(U(x)\) will produce a set of wave function solutions \(\Psi(x,t)=\psi_{x}(x)\psi_{\Gamma}(t)\). \(\psi_{x}(x)\) is the spatial part shown in Fig. 3.1 while \(\psi_{\Gamma}(t)\) is a time varying part which in this case causes \(\psi_{x}(x)\) to change periodically giving rise to standing waves (Fig. 3.2).

Thus each \(\Psi(x,t)\) describes a stationary wave mode corresponding to an allowed kinetic energy. The first 3 allowed KE and \(\psi_{x}(x)\) are shown in Fig.3.1.

Considering a given moment in time when \(\Psi=\psi_{x}(x)\), Fig. 3.3 to 3.5 show how squaring the magnitude of the wave functions \(\Psi\) lead to their corresponding _probability density functions_.

Here, \(|\Psi|^{2}\) gives the probability _per unit length_ along \(x\). In Fig. 3.3, the probability of finding the particle at \(x=d/2\) within the _tiny_ segment \(\Delta x\) is given by the value \(|\Psi(d/2)|^{2}\Delta x\) or \(\rho\Delta x\) i.e. the probability is the shaded area. The total area is 1 since the particle has to be somewhere within the well.

The trapped particle can be found in _one_ of the allowed energy levels and each level has a different probability density distribution function. It can be seen that the probability of finding the particle around \(x=d/4\) is greater when the particle has \(KE_{2}\) (Fig. 3.4) than when it has \(KE_{2}\) (Fig. 3.3). We can also see that the particle has zero probability of being found in the regions \(x<0\) and \(x>d\) which is no surprise since we expect the particle to be 'trapped' inside the well.

Figure 3.3:

Figure 3.2:

The particle trapped in an infinite potential well is quite similar to an electron trapped in an atom except that the potential well of an atom does not have the same shape and is not infinitely deep. In both cases, there are allowed energy levels or quantisation of energy associated with the formation of standing matter waves due to confinement by the well.

## 4 Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle

\(\Delta p_{x}dx\geq\hbar/2\)

In 1927 Wemer Karl Heisenberg arrived at the uncertainty relation:

The more precisely the _position_ of a system is determined, the less precisely the _momentum_ can be known _simultaneously_, and vice versa.

Quantitatively, \(\Delta p_{x}dx\geq\hbar/2\) where \(\hbar=h/2\pi\).

When we say 'position of a system is _determined_', we do not necessarily mean using a measuring instrument to 'find out' the position as a reading. It can also mean setting up the apparatus such that we 'know' the position of a system. Consider the double slit set-up (Fig. 4.1) from Quantum I.

Zooming in on one of the slits as in Fig. 4.2, the slit width's effect is to 'determine' the x-position of the passing particle with an uncertainty of \(\Delta x\). According to the uncertainty relation, the particle must simultaneously have _minimum_ uncertainty of \(\Delta p_{x}\) in the x-component momentum \(p_{x}\) whereby \(\Delta p_{x}=\hbar/2\Delta x\). Since \(\Delta p_{x}=m\omega_{x}\) this means that the particle will not necessarily go to M but could reach anywhere between L and R. Treating the particle as a matter wave would have led to the same outcome since waves diffract after passing through the slit.

If instead of the slit above, we have two instruments or set-ups for measuring the particle's momentum and position. Let's say we have very good instruments such that _individually_ or _separately_, each has best limiting precision \(\Delta p_{x}\)' and \(\Delta x\)' respectively. It is theoretically possible that the product \(\Delta p_{x}\)'\(\Delta x\)' is smaller than \(\hbar/2\). However, the uncertainty principle or nature would dictate that _simultaneously_ it is not possible for the instruments to yield measurements with uncertainties of \(\Delta p_{x}\)' and \(\Delta x\)'. In other words, \(\Delta p_{x}\) and \(\Delta x\) in the uncertainty principle are not the limiting precisions of instruments. \(\Delta p_{x}\) and \(\Delta x\) are more like the _inherent_ limits of our knowledge of the momentum and position.

The reason for the inherent limits was explained by Heisenberg using a 'thought experiment'. In this experiment, the position of an electron is to be determined by bouncing light off it into a microscope. As in all measurement processes, the measuring instrument has to interact with the system to be measured and thus inevitably change the system. To minimise the disturbance on the electron, imagine only one photon is bounced off the electron. It turns out that the shorter the wavelength, the more precise the position measurement. However, the shorter the wavelength, the greater the momentum of the photon (\(p=\hbar/\lambda\)) and the greater the disturbance. Therefore, nature sets ultimate limits on the precisions of simultaneous measurements of position and momentum. Furthermore there are other similar pairs of quantities (\(a\), b) which follow the uncertainty relation \(\Delta a\Delta b\geq\hbar/2\).

Figure 4.1:

Figure 4.2:

\(\Delta\Delta t\geq\hbar\)/2

Another uncertainty relation involves the energy and time pair - \(\Delta\Delta t\geq\hbar\)/2. The \(E\), \(t\) pair is not quite like the previous \(p\), \(x\) pair. Here \(\Delta t\) is not the uncertainty in measuring or determining \(t\). The interpretation of \(\Delta\)E & \(\Delta t\) is dependent on context. Below are just two example scenarios:

\begin{tabular}{c c} Scenario 1 - Decay of Excited State & \\ \end{tabular}

An excited state could be that of an atom. Excited states are unstable. If an atom stays in the excited state for 10\({}^{\text{-}10}\) s before emitting a photon, 10\({}^{\text{-}10}\) s would be the _lifetime_ of the excited state. The energy-time uncertainty relation then says that the energy of the excited state will have an _inherent_ uncertainty \(\Delta E\) = \(\hbar\)/2(10\({}^{\text{-}10}\)). This means that the energy level is not a sharp line but has a small spread.

This inherent uncertainty cannot be reduced by using better equipment or procedures. There are other sources of uncertainties from measuring instruments and the motion of the atom but these can theoretically be reduced with better instruments or set-ups.

Another example of an excited state is found in some nuclear processes in which a virtual particle with very short lifetime is created. Thereafter, it decays to other particles. It has been found that the shorter the _lifetime_\(\Delta t\) of the virtual particle, the greater the inherent uncertainty \(\Delta E\) of the energy of the particle.

\begin{tabular}{c c} Scenario 2 - Wave Pulse & \\ \end{tabular}

A laser is able to produce a light beam with very precise frequency and hence photons of very uniform energy. However if the laser is fired in pulses of _duration_\(\Delta t\), the energy and thus frequency of the photons (\(E=\hbar t\)) will no longer be as uniform as before. Now there will be a range of photon energies \(\Delta E\) and frequencies \(\Delta t\) such that \(\Delta E\Delta t\geq\hbar\)/2.

A continuous wave of a single frequency has spectrum as shown in Fig. 4.4. In contrast, a wave pulse can be constructed by superposing waves of a range of frequencies, leading to a spectrum as shown in Fig. 4.5. Again, the uncertainties represent _inherent_ limits of nature that has nothing to do with precision of measuring instruments

\begin{tabular}{c c} \(\Delta\Delta t\geq\hbar\)/2 & \\ \end{tabular}

The \(\Delta\Delta t\geq\hbar\)/2 uncertainty relation has different interpretations in different situations.

When applied to the decay of an excited state \(\Delta t\) is the _lifetime_ of the excited state while \(\Delta E\) is the _uncertainty_ in the energy of the state.

\begin{tabular}{c c} \(\Delta\Delta t\geq\hbar\)/2 & \\ \end{tabular}

When applied to the decay of an excited state \(\Delta t\) is the _lifetime_ of the excited state while \(\Delta E\) is the uncertainty in the energy of the state.

\begin{tabular}{c c} \(\Delta\Delta t\geq\hbar\)/2 & \\ \end{tabular}

When applied to a wave pulse, \(\Delta t\) is the _duration_ of the pulse \(\Delta E\) is the _energy_ of the component \(\Delta t\) is the _energies_ of the component \(\Delta t\) was \\ \end{tabular}

In Fig 5.1, a ball between 2 hills is released from rest at point A with total energy \(E\) (KE = 0 and GPE = \(E\)). Assuming no energy loss, the ball can only roll back and forth between A and B. It is impossible for the ball to appear at C or D without further intervention. However at microscopic scale, a particle such as an electron with energy \(E\) lower than \(U\) can in fact be found at the other sides of the barriers at C or D! This is a quantum phenomenon, called _quantum tunnelling_ that cannot happen according to classical physics.

In section 3, it was explained that in Schrodinger's equation \(i\hbar\frac{\partial\Psi}{\partial t}-\frac{\hbar^{2}}{2m}\frac{\partial^{2} \Psi^{2}}{\partial x^{2}}+U(x)\Psi\), \(U(x)\) is a mathematical function which describes the shape of the potential energy between a particle of mass \(m\) and its environment. By using the appropriate \(U(x)\) for a given situation, the equation can be solved. The solutions are wave functions \(\Psi\)s whose magnitudes squared give the probability per unit length \(P(x,t)=|\Psi(x,t)|^{2}\) of finding the particle at each position \(x\). It turns out that at the microscopic scale, \(\Psi\) (\(\because P\)) is not zero inside and beyond the potential barrier as shown in Fig. 5.2 for a rectangular barrier. That means that the particle can be found inside and beyond the barrier i.e. particle can _tunnel_ through the barrier.

Thus, shorter wavelength of matter wave corresponds to greater particle KE. Fig. 5.2 shows the same wavelength and thus KE before and after tunnelling. Quantum tunnelling is definitely not like a bullet tunnelling through a wall as the bullet will have lesser KE upon emerging from the other side.

Referring to Fig. 5.2, the probability that a particle of mass \(m\) can tunnel through a barrier of width \(d\) and potential energy \(U\) is given by:

\[\begin{array}{|c|}\hline T\approx e^{-2\pi d}&\mbox{where }\;k=\sqrt{\frac{ \beta\pi^{2}m(U-E)}{\hbar^{2}}}\\ T+R=1&\mbox{where }\;k=\sqrt{\frac{\beta\pi^{2}m(U-E)}{\hbar^{2}}}\\ \hline\end{array}\]

\(T\) - _transmission coefficient_ or _probability_. \(R\) - _reflection probability_.

Notice the following intuitively reasonable features of the formula:

1. As the barrier gets thicker (\(d\) larger), \(T\) gets smaller.
2. As the mass \(m\) increases, \(T\) gets smaller.
3. As the barrier gets higher (larger \(U\)), \(T\) gets smaller.
4. As \(E\) increases (\(E\) < \(U\)), \(T\) increases.

In a second mode, the STM tip is moved across the surface while keeping the tunnelling current constant by moving the tip up or down (Fig. 4.4d). The variation of the tip's height with position reveals the surface profile (Fig. 4.4e)
