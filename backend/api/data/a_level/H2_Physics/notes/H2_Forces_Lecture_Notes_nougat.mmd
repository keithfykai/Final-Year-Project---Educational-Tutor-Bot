## Contact Forces

### Normal Contact Force (a.k.a. normal reaction)

The normal contact force is the force that the one body exerts on another body that are physically in contact. It is always perpendicular (normal) to the surfaces in contact.

### Frictional Force

A frictional force arises when the surfaces in contact are rough to resist motion or tendency of motion.

The direction of the frictional force on a body is always in the direction opposite to its motion or impending motion, parallel to the rough surface.

Note:

1. Static friction is the frictional force when there is no relative motion between the two surfaces. The magnitude of static friction is self-adjusting such that it is just sufficient to prevent motion, but only up to a maximum value or the limiting static friction.
2. Kinetic friction is the frictional force when the two surfaces slide against each other. When the bodies just begin to move against each other, the kinetic friction between the surfaces is smaller than the static friction just before they begin to move.
3. Frictional force depends on the (a) nature of the surface (b) magnitude of the normal contact force.

### Viscous Force

Viscous (drag) force is a resistive force that opposes relative motion. It is present when a body moves through a fluid (i.e. liquid or gas). Air resistance is a common example of viscous force.

Note:

1. The direction of viscous force is always opposite to the direction of motion of the body relative to the fluid.
2. Viscous force depends on the (a) speed of the body moving through the fluid (b) the fluid (c) the shape and size of the body.

## Lift

Lift is the force that acts on a body such as an airplane wing or a helicopter rotor. Lift acts perpendicular to airplane wings or helicopter rotor.

When an airplane is climbing, descending or banking in a turn, the lift is tilted with respect to the vertical.

## Thrust

Thrust occurs when a system expels or accelerates mass in one direction. Thrust is the reaction force exerted by the expelled or accelerated mass on that system.

When a jet engine of an airplane expels hot gas, the jet engine exerts a force on the hot gas during the expulsion. By Newton's Third Law of Motion, the hot gas exerts a force that is equal in magnitude but opposite in direction called thrust on the jet engine, propelling the airplane forward.

**Example 2**: A sample is placed in a tensile testing machine. It is extended by known amounts and the tension is measured, as shown in the figure below.

Determine the work done on the sample when it is given a total extension of 9 mm.

\(E_{i}=\) Area under tension-extension graph

\(E_{2}=\) Area under tension-extension graph

\(=\frac{1}{2}\big{(}5.0\times 10^{-3}\big{)}(60)\)

\(=0.15\) J

\(E=E_{i}+E_{2}\)

\(=0.15+0.28\)

\(=0.43\) J

**Example 3**: The graph below shows the variation with extension x of the load \(F\) on a certain spring.

A load of 6.0 N is placed on the spring. Determine the additional elastic potential energy that will be stored in the spring if it is then extended further by 0.010 m.

\(\Delta E=\) area under the graph from \(x=0.030\) m to \(x=0.040\) m

\(=\frac{1}{2}\big{(}6.0+8.0\big{)}\big{(}0.040-0.030\big{)}\)

\(=0.070\) J

### Fluid Pressure

Pressure is the normal force per unit area.

It is a scalar quantity and its SI unit is pascal (Pa).

Consider a point at a depth \(h\) below the surface of a fluid, the pressure due to the fluid at that point is due to the weight of the column of fluid above it.

For a plane surface of area \(A\), the weight of the fluid column above it is given by

\(W=mg\)

\(=\left(V\rho\right)g\)\(\left(\because\rho=\frac{m}{V}\right)\)

\(=\left(Ah\right)\rho g\)\(\left(\because V=Ah\right)\)

where \(\rho\) is the density of fluid.

Hence the fluid pressure, \(\rho\), at this point is given by

\(p=\frac{F}{A}\)

\(=\frac{W}{A}\)

\(=\frac{Ah\rho g}{A}\)

\(=h\rho g\)

The absolute pressure at this depth includes the pressure due to other fluids above it, such as that of the air i.e. atmospheric pressure \(p_{0}\),

\(p_{\text{absolute}}=\rho_{0}+h\rho g\)

Note:

1. Pressure acts in all directions, and does not depend on the area \(A\).

2. All points at the same depth \(h\) within the fluid are at the same pressure.

### Example 4

A long narrow tube is filled with water of density 1020 kg m\({}^{-3}\) to a depth of 1.00 m. The tube is then inclined at 30\({}^{\circ}\) to the horizontal as shown below. If atmospheric pressure is 100 kPa, determine the pressure at point X inside the tube.

\(p_{\text{X}}=\rho_{0}+h\rho g\)

\(=100\times 10^{3}+\left(1.00\sin 30^{\circ}\right)\left(1020\right)\left(9.81\right)\)

\(=1.05\times 10^{5}\) Pa

**Example 5**: A sealed U-tube contains nitrogen in one arm and helium at pressure \(P\) in the other arm. The gases are separated by mercury of density \(\rho\) with dimensions as shown in the diagram. The acceleration of free fall is \(g\). Determine the pressure of the nitrogen.

Pressure at the same horizontal level is the same.

\[\begin{array}{l}\rho_{h_{1}}=\rho_{h_{2}}+h_{3}\rho_{h_{3}}g\\ =P+x\rho g\end{array}\]

### Upthrust

Upthrust is the upward force exerted by a fluid on a submerged or floating object. It arises due to the difference in pressure between the upper and lower surfaces of the object.

Consider a cylindrical object of cross-sectional area \(A\) and height \(h\) submerged in a fluid of density \(\rho_{r}\)

Pressure at the upper surface of object, \(\rho_{1}=h_{2}\rho_{r}g\)

Force exerted by fluid on upper surface of object, \(F_{1}\), \(F_{1}=\rho_{1}A\)

Pressure at the lower surface of object, \(\rho_{2}=h_{2}\rho_{r}g\)

Force exerted by fluid on lower surface of object, \(F_{2}\), \(F_{2}=\rho_{2}A\)

\(=\left(h_{2}\rho_{r}g\right)A\)

As \(h_{2}>h_{r}\), the upward force, \(F_{2}\), is greater than the downward force, \(F_{t}\). This net upward force is called upthrust.

Upthrust exerted by fluid on object, \(U\),\[U =F_{2}-F_{1}\] \[=h_{2}\rho_{i}gA-h_{i}\rho_{i}gA\] \[=\left(h_{2}-h_{1}\right)\rho_{i}gA\] \[=h\rho_{i}gA\] \[=V\rho_{i}g\qquad\left(\because V=Ah\right)\]

where \(V\) is the volume of object submerged in the fluid which is also equal to the volume of fluid displaced by the object, \(V_{r}\) Therefore,

\[U =V_{r}\rho_{i}g\] \[=m_{i}g\quad\left(\because\rho=\frac{m}{V}\right)\]

i.e. the magnitude of the upthrust exerted by a fluid on a submerged or floating object is equal to the weight of fluid displaced by the object.

Archimedes' Principle states that for an object immersed in a fluid, the magnitude of the upthrust is equal to the weight of the fluid displaced.

Note:

1. Archimedes' Principle can be applied to objects of any shape.
2. Uphrust is also known as buoyant force.
3. Uphrust acts at the centre of mass of the displaced fluid, known as the centre of buoyancy (the centre of buoyancy need not coincide with the centre of mass of the object).
4. Uphrust is not viscous force. Viscous force will only be exerted by the fluid on an object if the object moves through the fluid. On the contrary, upthrust is always present as long as the object is submerged or floating in the fluid (even when there is no relative motion between them).

For an object floating in equilibrium, the net force on the object is zero.

\[F_{net} =0\] \[U-W =0\] \[U =W\]

Hence the upthrust exerted on the floating object must be equal to its weight.

Principle of Flotation states that when an object floats in equilibrium, upthrust is equal to the weight of the object.

**Example 6**

A water droplet in a cloud is falling through air and is in equilibrium. Three forces act on it, its weight \(W\), upthrust \(U\) and air resistance \(R\). Which diagram, showing these three forces to scale, is correct?

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:10]

From Archimedes' Principle, upthrust experienced by object is equal to the weight of water displaced i.e. \(U=Z\) By N3L, the force exerted by object on water is equal and opposite to the force exerted by water on the object (upthrust). Considering beaker of water,

\[\begin{array}{l}\text{Force exerted by balance on}\\ \text{beaker of water, }N\end{array}\]

Since beaker of water is in equilibrium,

\(F_{net}=0\)

\(N=X+Z\)

**Example 9**

A cuboid with dimensions 25 cm \(\times\) 20 cm \(\times\) 15 cm has mass 4.0 kg and is floating in water of density 1000 kg m\({}^{-3}\) so that its largest faces are horizontal as shown in the figure below.

\begin{tabular}{l l} Calculate & \\ (i) & the upthrust on the cuboid, \\ & As the cuboid is floating in equilibrium \\ & \(U=W\) \\ & \(=4.0(9.81)\) \\ & \(=39\) N \\ \end{tabular}
2. the fraction of the cuboid which is beneath the water surface,

Using \(U=V_{i}\rho_{i}g\),

\(U=(Ah)\rho_{i}g\)

\(h=\dfrac{U}{A\rho_{i}g}\)

\(=\dfrac{39}{\big{(}25\times 10^{-2}\big{)}\big{(}20\times 10^{-2}\big{)}\big{(}1000 \big{)}(9.81)}\)

\(=0.080\) m

### Torque of a Couple

A couple is a pair of equal in magnitude but opposite in direction forces whose lines of action do not coincide.

A couple produces only a turning effect and no translational effect. Diagram below shows a couple.

The torque of a couple is the product of one of the forces and the perpendicular distance between the forces.

Torque of the couple in the diagram above is _Fd._

**Example 13**: Which is not true of the two forces that give rise to a couple?

AThey act in opposite directions.

BThey both act at the same point.

CThey both act on the same body.

DThey both have the same magnitude.

Answer: B

**Example 14**: A ruler of length 0.30 m is pivoted at its centre. Equal and opposite forces of magnitude 2.0 N are applied to the ends of the ruler, creating a couple as shown. Calculate the magnitude of the torque of the couple on the ruler when it is in the position shown. \(\tau=Fd_{\perp}\)\(=2.0(0.30\sin 50^{\circ})\)\(=0.46\) N m

**Equilibrium**

A body is in equilibrium if the

1. net force is zero

2. net moment about any point is zero.

Condition 1 ensures that the body is in **translational equilibrium**. If there are more than two forces acting on a body in equilibrium, the vector diagram will be a closed polygon.

Forces \(F_{1}\), \(F_{2}\), and \(F_{3}\) act on a body, the three forces must form a closed triangle.

Condition 2 for equilibrium ensures that the body is in **rotational equilibrium**. This is also known as the Principle of Moments.

Principle of moments states that for a body in equilibrium, the sum of clockwise moments about any point is equal to the sum of anti-clockwise moments about the same point.

Note: For an object in equilibrium acted on by three non-parallel coplanar forces, the forces must pass through a common point.

**Problem Solving Skill Set (PS\({}^{3}\))**

1. Apply \(\sum F_{x}=0\) and \(\sum F_{y}=0\).

2. Apply \(\sum\tau=0\) about a point in which the largest number of unknown forces passes through.

**Example 15**: A light rod is acted upon by three forces, P, Q and R. Which diagram shows the position and direction of each of the forces when the rod is in equilibrium?

**Example 16**: A ladder of weight \(W\) rests against a vertical wall. Friction between the ladder and the ground, and also between the ladder and the wall, prevents the ladder from slipping.

Which diagram shows the directions of the forces on the ladder?Answer: C

**Example 17**: An aircraft in level flight is moving with constant velocity relative to the ground. The resultant force acting on the aircraft is equal to

**A**: the weight of the aircraft.
**B**: the resultant of the air resistance and the thrust of the engines.
**C**: the resultant of the air resistance and the weight of the aircraft.
**D**: zero.
**Answer: D**:

**Example 18**: A body is acted on by two forces, \(P\) and \(Q\). A frictional force \(F\) holds the body in equilibrium. Which vector triangle could represent the relationship between these forces?

As the body is in equilibrium, the vector diagram must a closed polygon (triangle) Answer: C

**Example 19**: A small ball of weight \(W\) is suspended by a light thread. When a strong wind blows horizontally, exerting a constant force \(F\) on the ball, the thread makes an angle _\(\theta\)_to the vertical as shown.

Which equation correctly relates _\(\theta\), F_ and _W_?
**A**: \(\cos\theta=\frac{F}{W}\)**B**: \(\sin\theta=\frac{F}{W}\)**C**: \(\tan\theta=\frac{F}{W}\)**D**: \(\cos\theta=\frac{W}{F}\)

Considering horizontal forces,

\(T\sin\theta=F\)... (1)

Considering vertical forces,

\(T\cos\theta=W\)... (2)Dividing (1) by (2),

\[\tan\theta=\frac{F}{W}\]

Answer: C

**Example 20**: A student pulls a book by its top corner from a shelf, holding it between its forefinger and thumb. The book has weight \(W\) and dimensions \(x\) and \(y\) as shown.

What moment must the student provide at the corner of the book to stop it from rotating as it leaves the shelf?

**A**: \(\frac{Wy}{2}\), anti-clockwise
**B**: \(\frac{Wx}{2}\), anti-clockwise
**C**: \(\frac{W\left(y-x\right)}{2}\), clockwise
**D**: \(Wx\), anti-clockwise

As the book is still in equilibrium,

sum of clockwise moments about A = sum of anti-clockwise moments about A

\[M =W\left(\frac{x}{2}\right)\] \[=\frac{W\times x}{2}\]

Moment the student must provide is \(\frac{W\times x}{2}\), anti-clockwise.

Answer: B

**Example 21**: A uniform beam in a roof structure has a weight of 180 N. It is supported in two places X and Y, a distance 3.0 m apart. A load is placed on the beam a distance of 0.80 m from X. The support provided by Y is 220 N.

Determine the value of the load.

Taking moments about X,

\[F\big{(}0.80\big{)}+180\bigg{(}\frac{3.0}{2}\bigg{)} =220(3.0)\] \[F =490\ \text{N}\]

**Example 22**: A uniform cube (5.0 cm by 5.0 cm by 5.0 cm) of mass 1.0 kg rests on a rough surface. The maximum static friction between the cube and surface is 6.0 N and the kinetic friction is 4.5 N. An increasing horizontal force \(F\) (steadily increased from 0 N), is applied to the cube at a height of 4.0 cm above the surface. Determine whether the cube will topple or slide first.

When \(F\) is 6.0 N, taking moment of force about A,

\[M_{F} =Fd\] \[=6.0\big{(}4.0\times 10^{-2}\big{)}\] \[=0.24\ \text{N m}\]

Moment of weight about A,

\[M_{w} =W\bigg{(}\frac{x}{2}\bigg{)}\] \[=\big{(}1.0\times 9.81\big{)}\bigg{(}\frac{5.0\times 10^{-2}}{2} \bigg{)}\] \[=0.24525\ \text{N m}\]

Since \(M_{w}>M_{p}\) block does not topple. Hence, the cube will slide first.

## Appendix: FLIPPING ICEBERGS - Capsizing icebergs may release as much energy as a bomb

_Source: [https://www.sciencenewsforstudents.org/article/flipping-icebergs_](https://www.sciencenewsforstudents.org/article/flipping-icebergs_)"Large icebergs break off glaciers and then they flip," says Burton. If an iceberg flips close enough to the glacier or some other solid surface, it may shake the ground hard enough to be detected as an earthquake. The force of gravity makes an iceberg flip. When an iceberg forms and plunges into the water, the block of ice may be unstable, or prone to move. A dropped ball is unstable and falls toward the ground; once it stops moving, it becomes stable. A balloon submerged in a pool of water is unstable and quickly floats to the surface. A person swishing down a waterslide is unstable and doesn't stop moving until she reaches the bottom. In each of these cases, gravity causes an object to shift from instability to stability.

Burton and his colleagues built a model of an iceberg in their laboratory with a water tank that measured about 8 feet (244 centimeters) long, 11.8 inches (30 cm) wide and 11.8 inches tall. Burton says they initially wanted to use real ice to build their floating 'bergs, but the ice melted too quickly. Instead, they used a type of plastic that had the same density as the ice in icebergs. Density is a measure of the mass within a certain amount of space. Burton's team floated their plastic icebergs in the water tank, flipped them over, and then measured the waves.

Physicists already knew how to measure the energy released when gravity causes an unstable object to become stable. Burton and his colleagues used those same ideas to calculate the energy released by a flipping iceberg. Some of that energy is used to make the iceberg turn, but about 85 percent is simply released into the water.
