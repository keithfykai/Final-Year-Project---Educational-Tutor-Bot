Science Curriculum Framework

The Science Curriculum Framework is derived from the _Policy Framework for the Teaching and Learning of Science_. It encapsulates the thrust of science education in Singapore to prepare our students to be sufficiently adept as effective citizens, able to function in and contribute to an increasingly technologically-driven world.

Central to the curriculum framework is the inculcation of the spirit of scientific inquiry. The conduct of inquiry is founded on three integral domains of (a) Knowledge, Understanding and Application, (b) Skills and Processes and (c) Ethics and Attitudes. These domains are essential to the practice of science. The curriculum design seeks to enable students to view the pursuit of science as meaningful and useful. inquiry is thus grounded in knowledge, issues and questions that relate to the roles played by science in daily life, society and the environment.

The science curriculum seeks to nurture the student as an inquirer. The starting point is that children are curious about and want to explore the things around them. The science curriculum leverages on and seeks to fuel this spirit of curiosity. The end goal is students who enjoy science and value science as an important tool in helping them explore their natural and physical world.

The teacher is the leader of inquiry in the science classroom. Teachers of science impart the excitement and value of science to their students. They are facilitators and role models of the inquiry process in the classrooms. The teacher creates a learning environment that will encourage and challenge students to develop their sense of inquiry. Teaching and learning approaches centre around the student as an inquirer.

The following table shows the description of each domain which frames the practice of science:

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|} \hline
**Knowledge, Understanding** & **Skills and Processes** & **Ethics and Attitudes** \\
**and Application** & & \\ \hline \(\bullet\) Scientific phenomena, facts, concepts and principles & Skills & \(\bullet\) Curiosity \\ \(\bullet\) Scientific and principles & Observing & Creativity \\ \(\bullet\) Scientific and development of science & Comparing & Integrity \\ \(\bullet\) Scientific & Using apparatus & Objectivity \\ \(\bullet\) Vocabulary, terminology and conventions & \(\bullet\) Using apparatus & Open-mindedness \\ \(\bullet\) Scientific instruments and apparatus & \(\bullet\) Predicting & \\ \(\bullet\) including techniques and aspects of safety & Evaluating & \\ \(\bullet\) Scientific and technological applications & Creative problem solving & \\ \(\bullet\) Decision-making & Investigation & \\ \hline \end{tabular}

The domains are contextually linked to the roles played by science to establish its relevance and relationship to modern-day living:

## 21 \({}^{\tt ST}\) century competencies and scientific literacy

### The 21\({}^{\tt ST}\) Century Competencies

The 21\({}^{\tt ST}\)_Century Competencies Framework_ encapsulates the thrust of education for the future, to prepare our students to be confident people, self-directed learners, concerned citizens, and active contributors - outcomes of individuals able to thrive in and contribute to a world where change is the only constant.

The competency domains gaining prominence in the 21st century are Civic Literacy, Global Awareness and Cross-cultural Skills, Critical and Inventive Thinking, and Information and Communication Skills. The competencies encompassed in these domains have been termed the _21st Century Competencies_.

### Scientific Literacy

Science education for the future involves teaching students more than just the basic concepts of science. Students need to be equipped with the _skills_ to be able to use scientific knowledge to identify questions, and to draw evidence-based conclusions in order to understand and make decisions about the natural world and the changes made to it through human activity. They also need to _understand_ the characteristic features of science as a form of human knowledge and inquiry, and be aware of how science and technology shape our material, intellectual and cultural environments. Lastly, they need to be equipped with _ethics and attitudes_ to engage in science-related issues as a reflective citizen1.

Footnote 1: Adapted from Assessing Scientific, Reading and Mathematical Literacy, a Framework for PISA 2006, OECD.

A strong foundation in scientific knowledge and methodologies will include the development of reasoning and analytical skills, decision and problem solving skills, flexibility to respond to different contexts and possessing an open and inquiring mind that is willing to explore new territories and learn new things. These are skills and habits of mind that are aligned to the desired 21st century competencies.

Syllabus Framework

The Primary Science Syllabus comprises:

The knowledge, skills and attitudes that all students should acquire.

The freed up curriculum time, known as the white space, to enable teachers to use more engaging teaching and learning approaches, and/or to implement customised school-based programmes as long as the aims of the syllabus are met. This enables teachers to make learning more meaningful and enjoyable for their students.

#### 3.1.1 Knowledge, Understanding and Application

The approach in this revised syllabus towards the learning of science is based on themes that students can relate to in their everyday experiences, and to the commonly observed phenomena in nature. The aim is to enable students to appreciate the links between different themes/topics and thus allow the integration of scientific ideas. The five themes chosen are: _Diversity, Cycles, Systems, Energy and Interactions_. These themes encompass a core body of concepts in both the life and physical sciences. This body of concepts has been chosen because it provides a broad based understanding of the environment, and it will help build a foundation upon which students can rely on for further study.

Although the content of the syllabus is organised into 5 themes, the topics under each theme are not to be viewed as compartmentalised blocks of knowledge. In general, there are no clear boundaries between these themes. There may be topics common to different themes. Hence, a conscious effort is needed to demonstrate the relationship between themes whenever possible. To help teachers and students appreciate and understand the themes, essential takeaways and key inquiry questions 2 are included for each theme. These essential takeaways and questions can guide teachers and engage students in uncovering the important ideas at the heart of each theme. They can also use these questions to raise more specific questions for the respective topics under each theme.

Footnote 2: Reference: Wiggins, J and Mctighe, J. (1998). _Understanding by Design_. Alexandria, Va.: Association for Supervision and Curriculum Development.

Another feature of the syllabus is the spiral approach. This is characterised by the revisiting of concepts and skills at different levels and with increasing depth. The spiral approach allows the learning of scientific concepts and skills to match students' cognitive development. It therefore helps students build upon their existing understanding of concepts and facilitates the gradual mastery of skills.

#### 3.1.2 Diversity

There is a great variety of living and non-living things in the world. Man seeks to organise this great variety of living and non-living things to better understand the world in which he lives. There are common threads that connect all living things and unifying factors in the diversity of non-living things that help Man to classify them. This theme brings across the importance of maintaining diversity. The essential takeaways and key inquiry questions for "Diversity" are:

### _Cycles_

There are repeated patterns of change in nature. Examples of these cycles are the life cycles of living things and the water cycle. Understanding these cycles helps Man to predict events and processes and to appreciate the Earth as a self-sustaining system. The essential takeaways and key inquiry questions for "Cycles" are:

\begin{tabular}{c|c} \hline Essential Takeaways & Key Inquiry Questions \\ \hline _There are repeated patterns of change around us._ & \(\bullet\) _What makes a cycle?_ \\ _Observing cycles helps us to make predictions and understand things around us._ & \(\bullet\) _Why are cycles important to life?_ \\ \hline \end{tabular}

### _Systems_

A system is a whole consisting of parts that work together to perform a function(s). There are systems in nature as well as man-made systems. Examples of systems in nature are the digestive and respiratory systems. Examples of man-made systems are electrical systems. Understanding these systems allows Man to understand how they operate and how parts influence and interact with one another to perform a function. The essential takeaways and key inquiry questions for "Systems" are:

\begin{tabular}{c|c} \hline Essential Takeaways & Key Inquiry Questions \\ \hline _A system is made of different parts. Each part has its own unique function._ & \(\bullet\) _What is a system?_ \\ _Different parts / systems interact to perform function(s)._ & \(\bullet\) _How do parts / systems interact to perform function(s)?_ \\ \hline \end{tabular}

### _Interactions_

Studying the interactions between and within systems enhances understanding of the environment and Man's role in it. Interactions occur within an organism, between organisms as well as between organisms and the environment. The interaction of Man with the environment drives the development of Science and Technology. At the same time, Science and Technology influences the way Man interacts with the environment. By understanding the interactions between Man and the environment, students can better appreciate the consequences of their actions and be responsible for their actions. The essential takeaways and key inquiry questions for "Interactions" are:

\begin{tabular}{c|c} \hline Essential Takeaways & Key Inquiry Questions \\ \hline _There are interactions among Man, living and non-living things in the environment._ & \(\bullet\) _How does Man better understand the environment?_ \\ \hline _Man can interact with the environment and make positive or negative impacts._ & \(\bullet\) _What are the consequences of Man's interactions with the environment?_ \\ \hline _Man plays an important role in conservation to ensure continuity of life and availability of resources._ & \(\bullet\) _What are the consequences of Man's interactions with the environment and make positive or negative impacts._ \\ \hline \end{tabular}

Energy

Energy makes changes and movement possible in everyday life. Man uses various forms of energy for many different purposes. Man is not the only animal that needs energy; all living things obtain energy and use it to carry out life processes. Understanding this theme will allow students to appreciate the importance and uses of energy and the need to conserve it. The essential takeaways and key inquiry questions for "Energy" are:

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|} \hline Essential Takeaways & Key Inquiry Questions \\ \hline \(\bullet\) Energy is required to enable & \(\bullet\) Why is energy important? \\ things to work or move. & \(\bullet\) How is energy used in \\ There are different forms of & everyday life? \\ energy and they can be & \(\bullet\) Why is it important to \\ converted from one form to & \(\bullet\) conserve energy? \\ another. & \(\bullet\) Some sources of energy can \\ be depleted and Man plays an & \\ important role in energy & \\ conservation. & \\ \hline \end{tabular}

### Skills and Processes

In this syllabus, teachers are encouraged to provide opportunities for students to use concepts and integrate skills and processes to inquire things and phenomena around them.

The skill sets identified are aligned to that of Lower Secondary Science and the essential features of inquiry as shown in the table below.

* **Formulating hypothesis** This is the skill of making a general explanation for a related set of observations or events. It is an extension of inferring.
* **Generating possibilities** This is the skill of exploring all the alternatives, possibilities and choices beyond the obvious or preferred one.
* **Predicting** This is the skill of assessing the likelihood of an outcome based on prior knowledge of how things usually turn out.

Collecting and presenting evidence through:
* **Observing** This is the skill of using our senses to gather information about objects or events. This also includes the use of instruments to extend the range of our senses.
* **Using apparatus and equipment** This is the skill of knowing the functions and limitations of various apparatus, and developing the ability to select and handle them appropriately for various tasks.

* **Comparing** This is the skill of identifying the similarities and differences between two or more objects, concepts or processes.
* **Classifying** This is the skill of grouping objects or events based on common characteristics.
* **Inferring** This is the skill of interpreting or explaining observations or pieces of data or information.
* **Analysing** This is the skill of identifying the parts of objects, information or processes, and the patterns and relationships between these parts.
* **Evaluating** This is the skill of assessing the reasonableness, accuracy, and quality of information, processes or ideas. This is also the skill of assessing the quality and feasibility of objects.

Communicating:

This is the skill of transmitting and receiving information presented in various forms - written, verbal, pictorial, tabular or graphical.

Processes

Processes are complex operations which call upon the use of several skills. At the primary level, the processes expected of students are:

* **Creative Problem Solving** This is a process of analysing a problem and choosing an innovative and relevant solution in order to remedy or alter a problem situation.
* **Decision-Making** Decision-making is the process of establishing and applying criteria to select from among seemingly equal alternatives. The process of establishing criteria involves consideration of the consequences and values.
* **Investigation** This involves formulating questions or hypotheses, devising fair methods and carrying out those methods to find out answers to the questions or to verify the hypotheses.

It must be pointed out that there is also no one definite sequence of priority among the skills and processes listed above. For example, observation may lead to hypothesising but at other times a hypothesis can lead to observation. All the skills and processes listed above are seen as part of the total process of scientific inquiry. In science teaching and learning, effort should initially be directed at teaching explicitly each of the skills through the use of appropriate activities. Later, effort should be directed to helping students integrate some of all of the skills in scientific inquiry.

The skills and processes can be introduced from primary three in an age-appropriate manner. Once introduced, these skills and processes should continue to be developed at the higher levels.

### 4 Attitudes and Ethics

In all scientific inquiry, the adoption of certain mental attitudes such as _Curiosity_, _Creativity_, _Integrity_, _Objectivity_, _Open-mindedness_, _Perseverance and Responsibility_ is advocated.

* **Curiosity** Desire to explore the environment and question what they find.
* **Creativity** Suggest innovative and relevant ways to solve problems.
* **Integrity** Handle and communicate data and information with integrity.
* **Objectivity** Seek data and information to validate observations and explanations objectively.
* **Open-mindedness** Accept all knowledge as tentative and willing to change their view if the evidence is convincing.
* **Perseverance** Pursue a problem until a satisfactory solution is found.
* **Responsibility** Show care and concern for living things and awareness of the responsibility they have for the quality of the environment.

Opportunities should be provided in the classroom for students to ask questions. Students should be encouraged to ask both closed and open questions. From the type of questions asked by the students, teachers could gather information on their 'frame of mind' and the quality of their understanding.

## Teaching and Learning Through Inquiry

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:26]

TE:13][ENDFOOTNOTE]

## 4 Teaching and Learning Through Inquiry

_What is scientific inquiry?_

_Scientific inquiry_ may be defined as the activities and processes which scientists and students engage in to study the natural and physical world around us. In its simplest form, scientific inquiry may be seen as consisting of two critical aspects: the _what_ (content) and the _how_ (process) of understanding the world we live in1.

Footnote 1: Reference: Chiappetta, E.L., Koballa, T., Collette, A.T. (2002). _Science Instruction in the Middle and Secondary schools_. Upper Saddle River, NJ: Merril/Prentice Hall.

Teaching science as inquiry must therefore go beyond merely presenting the facts and the outcomes of scientific investigations. Students need to be shown how the products of scientific investigations were derived by scientists and be provided opportunities to: ask questions about knowledge and issues that relate to their daily lives, society and the environment; be actively engaged in the collection and use of evidence; formulate and communicate explanations based on scientific knowledge.

Through inquiry learning, students will be able to acquire knowledge and understanding of their natural and physical world based on investigations, apply the skills and processes of inquiry and develop attitudes and values that are essential to the practice of science.

_What are some characteristics of teaching and learning of science as inquiry?_

Inquiry-based learning may be characterised by the degree of responsibility students have in posing and responding to questions, designing investigations, and evaluating and communicating their learning (_student-directed inquiry_) compared to the degree of involvement the teacher takes (_teacher-guided inquiry_). Students will best benefit from experiences that vary between these two inquiry approaches.

_What are some strategies for conducting inquiry-based learning and teaching?_

A primary purpose for inquiry-based instruction is for students to learn fundamental science concepts, principles, and theories as well as to develop science process skills and attitudes that are essential for scientific inquiry. Science teachers are already using a variety of teaching strategies in their lessons.

To further emphasise the learning of science as inquiry, teachers can incorporate in these strategies the essential features of _Question, Evidence, Explanation, Connections_ and _Communication_ and provide students with experiences that varies between guided (partial) and open (full) inquiry.

To meet the learning styles of students offering Foundation Science, teachers should carry out the inquiry-based approach through hands-on learning, from concrete to abstract. Hands-on learning experiences should also be situated in realistic contexts so that students can make connections with their own lives and the environment in which they live. In this way, students become engaged and excited about what they are studying and they then become motivated to learn.

Teachers are also encouraged to use a variety of strategies to facilitate the inquiry process. Selected strategies are highlighted below to help teachers plan and deliver lessons that will engage students in meaningful learning experiences and cultivate their interest and curiosity in science. These strategies can be mixed and matched. A brief description of each of these strategies is given on the next page:C**Concept Cartoon**

In concept cartoons, minimal language is used. Visual images are utilised to present concepts or questions relating to one central idea or word.

Concept Mapping

Concept mapping is a strategy to present meaningful relationships among concepts. Concept maps are useful in organising and linking concepts or ideas.

Cooperative Learning

In cooperative learning, activities are structured such that each student assumes certain responsibilities and contributes to the completion of tasks. In working with others, students are exposed to different points of views and solutions in accomplishing a common goal.

Demonstration

Demonstration is commonly used to scaffold the learning process. This approach is recommended when the learning activity is not safe or too complex for students to set up on their own.

Field Trip

A field trip is any learning activity outside the school. It provides opportunities for students to explore, discover and experience science in everyday life.

Games

Games engage students in play or simulations for the learning of concepts or skills. This is useful in helping students to visualise or illustrate objects or processes in the real world.

Investigation

In scientific investigation, students engage in activities that mirror how scientists think and what they do in a decision making process, such as asking or posing questions and planning or designing investigations.

Problem Solving

Problem solving engages students in finding solutions to problems by applying scientific knowledge and skills.

Projects

Projects are learning activities that require students to find out about an object, event, process or phenomenon over a few weeks.

Questioning

Questions are useful tools in the scientific inquiry process. Both teachers and students should engage in cycles of questions-answers-questions throughout the learning process.

Role Play, Drama, Dance and Movement

Role play, drama, dance and movement allow students to express their understanding of scientific concepts and processes in a creative way.

Stories

Stories of science in everyday life and of scientists can capture students' interest and engage them in talking about science. Either the teacher or students can be the story creator or teller.

Strategies for Active and Independent Learning (SAIL)

The SAIL approach emphasises learning as a formative and developmental process in which instruction and assessment point the way for students to continuously learn and improve. Learning expectations and rubrics are used to describe what students should know and be able to do. This would help students know where they are in the learning process and how they can improve.

Teachers are also encouraged to leverage on the planned learning activities to infuse Information Technology and National Education.

Information and Communication Technologies

ICT supports the inquiry process and also facilitates student collaboration and self-directed learning. For example, online collaborative tools allow students to share and discuss their ideas or findings within the school, and also extend their learning through consulting field experts. Internet-enabled devices could be used to facilitate data collection and analysis in situated learning. Students can also explore and visualise abstract concepts using simulations tools to manipulate the variables to deduce a relationship between the variables.

National Education

National Education is infused into the curriculum to allow students to see how scientific phenomena and developments can contribute to or affect the nation.

Where appropriate, students should have opportunities to develop attitudes which are relevant to the study of science. Teachers are also encouraged to incorporate the ethical aspect of science wherever possible throughout the syllabus.

An Ethics and Attitudes

In scientific inquiry, the adoption of certain mental attitudes such as Curiosity, Creativity, Objectivity, Integrity, Open-mindedness, Perseverance and Responsibility is advocated. Students can also discuss the ethical implications of science and technology.

#### What are some resources of an inquiry classroom?

An inquiry classroom is visibly different from a traditional classroom in the following ways:

\begin{tabular}{|p{113.8pt}|p{113.8pt}|} \hline
**Traditional** & **Inquiry** \\ \hline Students often work alone & Students often work in groups \\ \hline Emphasis on mastery of facts & Emphasis on understanding of concepts \\ \hline Follows a fixed curriculum closely & Allows for pursuit of student questions \\ \hline Activities rely mainly on textbooks and workbook materials & Activities rely on a variety of sources \\ \hline Students are viewed as "blank slates" & Students are viewed as thinkers with their own theories about the world \\ \hline Teachers tend to disseminate information to students & Teachers facilitate an interactive learning environment \\ \hline Teachers tend to seek correct answers & Teachers seek to understand student learning \\ \hline Assessment tends to be separate from teaching & Assessment is interwoven with teaching \\ \hline \end{tabular}

Adapted from _In Search of Understanding: The Case for Constructist Classrooms, Brooks & Brooks (1993)._What are some misconceptions about inquiry-based learning and teaching?_

1: _All science subject matter should be taught through student-directed inquiry._

Whereas student-directed inquiry will provide the best opportunities for cognitive development and scientific reasoning, teacher-guided inquiry can best focus learning on the development of particular science concepts. Thus, students will best benefit from experiences that vary between these two inquiry approaches.

_2: Inquiry cannot be carried out by students effectively as they will not be able to discover anything worthwhile._

Although it is important that students are provided with opportunities to pursue their own questions and discover some things for themselves, scientists and students often engage in inquiry to solve problems or understand events by reading relevant materials (print and online resources) and seeking advice from experts in the specific field. They may be engaged in inquiry without actually making their own discoveries.

3: _Inquiry teaching occurs whenever students are provided with hands-on activities._

Although participation by students in hands-on activities is desirable, it is equally important that they are mentally engaged with scientific reasoning and methods. Research indicates that science process skills are best learnt when used to understand specific scientific content. Understanding content without process or vice versa is insufficient to nurture students as inquirers.

## 5 Assessing Teaching and Learning

Assessment is an integral part of the teaching and learning process. It involves gathering information through various assessment techniques and making sound decisions. Assessment provides information to the teacher about students' achievement in relation to the learning objectives. With this information, the teacher makes informed decisions about what should be done to enhance the learning of the students and to improve teaching methods.

### Why Assess?

Assessment measures the extent to which desired knowledge, skills and attitudes are attained by students. While it complements the teaching and learning process, it also provides formative and summative feedback to students, teachers, schools and parents.

Assessment provides feedback to _students_, allows them to understand their strengths and weaknesses. Through assessment, students can monitor their own performance and progress. It also points them in the direction they should go to improve further.

Assessment provides feedback to _teachers_, enables them to understand the strengths and weaknesses of their students. It provides information about students' achievement of learning outcomes as well as the effectiveness of their teaching.

Assessment provides feedback to _schools_. The information gathered facilitates the placement of students in the appropriate stream or course, and the promotion of students from one level to the next. It also allows the schools to review the effectiveness of their instructional programme.

Assessment provides feedback to _parents_, allows them to monitor their children's progress and achievement through the information obtained.

### What to Assess?

The aims of the Primary Science Syllabus are the acquisition of knowledge, understanding and application of the science concepts, the ability to use process skills, and the development of attitudes important to the practice of science. The assessment objectives of the syllab are aligned to the three domains in the curriculum framework as shown below:

1. Assessment of Knowledge, Understanding and Application of Science Concepts
2. Assessment of Skills and Process
3. Assessment of Ethics and Attitudes

### How to Assesss?

Assessment measures the extent to which desired knowledge, skills and attitudes are attained by students. As it serves many purposes, it is important to match the type of assessment to the specific purpose for which it is intended. Before making an assessment about a certain aspect of students' performance, the teacher should ensure that the assessment mode used will generate information that reflect accurately the particular aspect of performance the teacher intends to assess.

In an inquiry-based classroom, the assessment can take many forms. In addition to the written tests, teachers can also conduct performance-based assessment using the following modes:

* Practicals
* Projects
* Teacher observations
* Checklists
* Reflections / Journals
* Model-making
* Posters
* Games and quizzes
* Debates
* Drama / Show and Tell
* Learning Trails

Teachers can also assess students through the use of portfolio. It is a systematic collection of students' work and provides a comprehensive picture of their achievement. The work collected provides a continuous record of the students' development and progress in the acquisition of knowledge, understanding of scientific concepts, application of process skills, and development of attitudes. It also provides opportunity for the students to have self-evaluation and reflections by revisiting their own portfolio.

The assessment modes listed above are by no means exhaustive. Adopting a variety of assessment modes enables the teachers to assess different aspects of teaching and learning.

## 6 SYLLABUS CONTENT (P3 and P4)

**About Diversity:**

There is a great variety of living and non-living things in the world. Man seeks to organise this great variety of living and non-living things to better understand the world in which he lives. There are common threads that connect all living things and unifying factors in the diversity of non-living things that help him to classify them. This theme brings across the importance of maintaining diversity.

**Note:**: **Lower Block**

**Upper Block**

**Lessential Takeaways:**

_There is a great variety of living and non-living things around us._

_Man can classify living and non-living things based on their similarities and differences to better understand them._

_Maintaining the diversity of living things around us ensures their continual survival._

**Key Inquiry Questions:**

_What can we find around us?_

_How can we classify the great variety of living and non-living things?_

_Why is it important to maintain diversity?_

**Introducing the theme Diversity:**

**Things Around Us:**

Based on the story of Carl Linnaeus and his classification as well as field trips to the school garden, students can observe and classify the diversity of living things and non-living things around them. Students can also be encouraged to give reasons and criteria for their groupings. Students can appreciate the importance of grouping when they are looking for a particular item in the supermarket or a certain resource in the library.

**Idea from Mother Nature:**

Based on the story of how George de Mestral and his dog's nature hike led to the invention of hook and loop fasteners, students can appreciate how careful observation and curiosity can lead to the invention of products, making use of properties of different materials.

**Selzing the Opportunity:**

Based on the invention of sticky note pads, students can appreciate how scientists have creatively turned weak adhesives into making useful paper products.

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:41]

**Abstract**

There are repeated patterns of change in nature. Examples of these cycles are the life cycles of living things and the water cycle. Understanding these cycles helps Man to predict events and processes and to appreciate the Earth as a self-sustaining system.

**About Systems:**

A system is a whole consisting of parts that work together to perform a function(s). There are systems in nature as well as man-made systems. Examples of systems in nature are the digestive and respiratory systems. Examples of man-made systems are electrical systems. Understanding these systems allows Man to understand how they operate and how parts influence and interact with one another to perform a function.

**About Interactions:**

Studying the interactions between and within systems enhances understanding of the environment and Man's role in it. Interactions occur within an organism, between organisms as well as between organisms and the environment. The interaction of Man with the environment drives the development of Science and Technology. At the same time, Science and Technology influences the way Man interacts with the environment. By understanding the interactions between Man and the environment, students can better appreciate the consequences of their actions and be responsible for their actions.
