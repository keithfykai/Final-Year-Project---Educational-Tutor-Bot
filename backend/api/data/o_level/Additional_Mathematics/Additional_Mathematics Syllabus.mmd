## Introduction

The syllabus prepares students adequately for A-Level H2 Mathematics, where a strong foundation in algebraic manipulation skills and mathematical reasoning skills are required. The content is organised into three strands, namely, Algebra, Geometry and Trigonometry, and Calculus. Besides conceptual understanding and skill proficiency explicated in the content strands, important mathematical processes such as reasoning, communication and application (including the use of models) are also emphasised and assessed. The O-Level Additional Mathematics syllabus assumes knowledge of O-Level Mathematics.

### Aims

The O-Level Additional Mathematics syllabus aims to enable students who have an aptitude and interest in mathematics to:

* acquire mathematical concepts and skills for higher studies in mathematics and to support learning in the other subjects, with emphasis in the sciences, but not limited to the sciences
* develop thinking, reasoning, communication, application and metacognitive skills through a mathematical approach to problem-solving
* connect ideas within mathematics and between mathematics and the sciences through applications of mathematics; and
* appreciate the abstract nature and power of mathematics.

## Assessment objectives

The assessment will test candidates' abilities to:

* **Use and apply standard techniques*
* recall and use facts, terminology and notation
* read and use information directly from tables, graphs, diagrams and texts
* carry out routine mathematical procedures
* **Solve problems in a variety of contexts*
* interpret information to identify the relevant mathematics concept, rule or formula to use
* translate information from one form to another
* make and use connections across topics/subtopics
* formulate problems into mathematical terms
* analyse and select relevant information and apply appropriate mathematical techniques to solve
* interpret results in the context of a given problem
* **Reason and communicate mathematically*
* justify mathematical statements
* provide explanation in the context of a given problem
* write mathematical arguments and proofs

Approximate weightings for the assessment objectives are as follows:
