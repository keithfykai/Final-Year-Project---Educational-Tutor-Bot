### Structure of Benzene

* The molecular formula of benzene is C\({}_{6}\)H\({}_{6}\).
* The six carbon atoms of benzene are arranged in a hexagonal ring. Each carbon atom of the benzene molecule is sp\({}^{2}\) hybridised and uses two of the three sp\({}^{2}\) hybrid orbitals to form \(\alpha\) bonds with the sp\({}^{2}\) hybrid orbitals of the adjacent carbon atoms. The remaining sp\({}^{2}\) hybrid orbital overlaps with the 1s orbital of hydrogen atom to form a C-H \(\alpha\) bond.
* Each carbon atom in benzene has an unhybridised 2p orbital that is perpendicular to the hexagonal plane of carbon atoms. Since these six 2p orbitals are parallel to one another, each of the 2p orbital can overlap sideways and equally with the adjacent two 2p orbitals to form \(\pi\) bonds. Each of the six 2p unhybridised orbital contains an electron. Hence, the sideways overlap of the 2p orbitals results in a doughnut-shaped delocalised \(\pi\) electron cloud above and below the hexagonal plane of carbon atoms.
* Due to delocalisation of the \(\pi\) electrons, benzene molecule exists as a **resonance hybrid** of the resonance structures (I) and (II). Note: resonance structures (I) and (II) do **not** exist. The structural formula of benzene is shown below. The hexagon represents the six carbon atoms arranged in a hexagonal ring and the circle represents the delocalised six \(\pi\) electrons.
* The delocalisation of the \(\pi\) electrons conferred **extra stability** to the benzene structure which is said to be **resonance-stabilised**.

## 2 Physical Properties of Arenes

* Arenes are liquids or low melting point solids with characteristic 'aromatic' odours. Their vapours are toxic and should avoid inhaling them. Note: Benzene is a colourless liquid (boiling point 80 \({}^{\circ}\)C, melting point 5.5 \({}^{\circ}\)C) and continued inhalation of its vapour can induce anaemia and even leukaemia. Methylbenzene is also a colourless liquid (with a higher boiling point 111 \({}^{\circ}\)C).
* Arenes are **soluble** in organic solvents such as CC\(l_{4}\). Note: Both benzene and methylbenzene are useful solvents themselves. Since the fumes of methylbenzene are considerably less toxic than those of benzene, it is preferable, whenever possible, to use it instead of benzene.
* Arenes are **insoluble** in polar solvents such as water and are less dense than water.
* Boiling points of arenes **increase** with increase in relative molecular mass due to **increase in number of electrons** leading to **stronger instantaneous dipole-induced dipole interactions** that require **more energy** to overcome. However, their melting point trend is irregular as it depends on molecular symmetry.
* Arenes are **non-conductors** of electricity.
* Arenes burn with a **smoky** and **luminous** flame, owing to their relatively high carbon content (i.e. C:H ratio is **close to one**).

### Preparation (For information only)

* Fusion of sodium salt of benzoic acid with soda lime (decarboxylation).

**You are now ready to attempt Tutorial Question 3.**

#### 3.2.2 Nitration

Candidates should be able to:

(b) describe the chemistry of the benzene ring as exemplified by the following reactions of benzene and methylbenzene:

(ii) nitration with concentrated nitric acid (recognise concentrated sulfuric acid as a Br\(\beta\)nsted-Lowry acid catalyst)

Reagents and conditions:

concentrated HNO\({}_{3}\), concentrated H\({}_{2}\)SO\({}_{4}\) catalyst, heat at 55-60 \({}^{\circ}\)C (under reflux)

**Note:**

The reflux apparatus is shown.

The purpose of the condenser is to prevent escape of volatile organic compounds through vaporisation, thus increasing the yield of the product obtained.

Nitrobenzene is a pale yellow liquid with an almond smell.

Temperature for this reaction needs to be carefully controlled as high temperatures (100 \({}^{\circ}\)C or above) will lead to formation of the di-substituted product or tri-substituted product.

_Mechanism_:

Step 1: H\({}_{2}\)SO\({}_{4}\) catalyst acts as a **Brinsted-Lowry acid** by **donating a proton**, which leads to generation of the **strong electrophile**, **NO\({}_{2}\)\({}^{*}\)**.

Step 2: Strong electrophile, **NO\({}_{2}\)\({}^{*}\)**, attacks benzene to form resonance-stabilised carbocation.

Step 3: HSO\({}_{4}\)- abstracts H\({}^{+}\) from carbocation to yield substitution product. H\({}_{2}\)SO\({}_{4}\) catalyst is regenerated at the end of the reaction.

**Exercise [N2002/l/21]**

Which is a correct statement about the intermediate complex, [C\({}_{6}\)H\({}_{6}\)NO\({}_{2}\)]\({}^{*}\), formed during the mononitration of benzene?

**A**: It is planar.

**B**: It contains a chiral centre.

**C**: It can exist in either a _cis_ or a _trans_ form.

**D**: It contains only one tetrahedrally-bonded carbon atom.

**Exercise** (J1997/Ill/22; N2001/Ill/23)

Deuterium, D, is a heavy isotope of hydrogen. Deuteriobenzene is reacted with a mixture of nitric acid and sulfuric acid under controlled conditions, so that only mononitration takes place.

Assuming that the carbon-deuterium bond is broken as easily as a carbon-hydrogen bond, which proportion of the nitrated products will be 3-nitrodeuteriobenzene?

#### 3.2.3 Friedel-Crafts Alkylation

Candidates should be able to:

describe the chemistry of the benzene ring as exemplified by the following reactions of benzene and methylbenzene:

Friedel-Crafts alkylation with halogenalkanes (recognise the use of Lewis acid as catalysts)

Reagents and conditions:

RX (RC/ or RBr), **anhydrous** A/C\(l_{3}\) or A/Br\({}_{3}\) or BF\({}_{3}\) or FeC\(l_{3}\) or FeBr\({}_{3}\) as Lewis acid catalyst, **excess benzene**

A/C\(l_{3}\) or A/Br\({}_{3}\) or BF\({}_{3}\) or FeC\(l_{3}\) or FeBr\({}_{3}\) are able to accept electron pairs as they are **electron-deficient** molecules. They must be **anhydrous** to prevent hydrolysis (refer to Periodic Table notes) from taking place.

**Note:**

Further alkylation occurs even more readily. Hence, it is necessary to start with **excess benzene** to prevent further alkylation.

This reaction is used to synthesise homologues of benzene.

_Mechanism_:

Step 1: A/C\(l_{3}\) catalyst acts as a **Lewis acid** by **accepting a lone pair of electrons** from C\(l\) in CH\({}_{3}\)C\(l\), thereby generating a **strong electrophile**, CH\({}_{3}\)**.

* Strong electrophile, CH\({}_{3}\)+, attacks benzene to form resonance-stabilised carbocation.
* Loss of proton, formation of substitution product and regeneration of A/C/\(l_{3}\) catalyst at the end of the reaction.

### Addition of Hydrogen Reaction (Reduction)

* Unlike alkenes, benzene typically does **not** undergo addition reactions as addition results in the destruction of the resonance-stabilised ring system in benzene.

Exception: Addition of hydrogen (reduction)

## 4 Methylbenzene

### Structure of Methylbenzene

* Methylbenzene, as its name suggests, consists of one methyl group bonded to the benzene ring. The structural formula of methylbenzene is C\({}_{6}\)H\({}_{5}\)CH\({}_{3}\), and it is commonly known as toluene.
* Formation of \(\alpha\) bonds in methylbenzene C\({}_{1}\)-C\({}_{2}\)\(\sigma\) bond: **head-on** overlap of sp\({}^{2}\) hybrid orbital of C\({}_{2}\) with sp\({}^{3}\) hybrid orbital of C\({}_{1}\) C\({}_{2}\)\(\sigma\) bond: **head-on** overlap of sp\({}^{2}\) hybrid orbital of C\({}_{2}\) with sp\({}^{2}\) hybrid orbital of C\({}_{3}\) C\({}_{1}\)\(\sigma\) bond: **head-on** overlap of sp\({}^{3}\) hybrid orbital of C\({}_{1}\) with 1s orbital of H C\({}_{3}\)\(\sigma\) bond: **head-on** overlap of sp\({}^{2}\) hybrid orbital of C\({}_{3}\) with 1s orbital of H
* Formation of \(\pi\) electron cloud Similar to benzene, the \(\pi\) electron cloud is formed from the **sideways** overlap of the six p orbitals of benzene C atoms.

Methylbenzene is **planar** with respect to the **carbon atoms only** (as C\({}_{\uparrow}\) is sp\({}^{3}\) hybridised and hence has a tetrahedral shape). The hydrogen atoms on C\({}_{\uparrow}\) are not planar.

### Preparation

* Refer to Friedel-Crafts alkylation of benzene (see section 3.2.3).

### Reactions

#### 4.3.1 Effect of Substituent Groups

* Any substituent group attached to the benzene ring will affect the **reactivity** of the benzene ring and determine the **orientation** (i.e. position) of the substitution.
* _Reactivity_ 1. An **electron-donating*
* substituent group, such as -NH\({}_{2}\), -OH, -R (R = alkyl group) increases the electron density in the benzene ring. Hence, the monosubstituted benzene is **more reactive*
* towards electrophilic substitution, i.e. the benzene ring is **activated*
* towards electrophilic substitution. Thus, the reaction conditions used for electrophilic substitution are **milder**. 2. An **electron-withdrawing*
* substituent group, such as -C\(l\), -CHO, -CO\({}_{2}\)H, decreases the electron density in the benzene ring. Hence, the monosubstituted benzene is **less reactive*
* towards electrophilic substitution, i.e. the benzene ring is **deactivated*
* towards electrophilic substitution. Thus, the reaction conditions used for electrophilic substitution are **harsher**. 3. There are two ways in which electrons can be donated into or withdrawn from the benzene ring, namely **resonance*
* effect and **inductive*
* effect. The **resonance effect*
* is the donation or withdrawal of electrons through the overlap of p orbital on the substituent with a p orbital on the C atom of benzene ring.
* **The **inductive effect*
* is the donation or withdrawal of electrons through a sigma bond due to electronegativity difference between the atoms. 4. Substituents with an **electron-donating resonance effect*
* include -OH, -OCH\({}_{3}\), -NH\({}_{2}\), where the O and N atoms have a **lone pair of electrons*
* (usually in a p orbital) available for donation to the benzene ring. Substituents with an **electron-withdrawing resonance effect*
* include -CN, -NO\({}_{2}\) (**doubly or triply bonded**), where the more electronegative N and O atoms respectively are able to withdraw electrons from the benzene ring. 5. Substituents with an **electron-donating inductive effect*
* include -R, where they inductively donate electrons through the sigma bond linking the substituents to a benzene ring. Substituents with an **electron-withdrawing inductive effect*
* include -C\(l\), -Br, -I, where they inductively withdraw electrons through the sigma bond linking the substituents to a benzene ring.

(e) predict whether halogenation will occur in the side-chain or aromatic nucleus in arenes depending on reaction conditions

Describe the conditions used to produce **A** and **B** respectively.

#### 4.3.5 Oxidation Reaction (side-chain reaction)

Candidates should be able to:

(d) describe the chemistry of the alkyl side-chain of benzene ring as exemplified by the following reactions of methylbenzene:

(ii) complete oxidation to give benzoic acid

Strong oxidising agent 
\begin{tabular}{l l}  & Reagents and conditions: & KMnO\({}_{4}\)(aq), H\({}_{2}\)SO\({}_{4}\)(aq), heat (under reflux) \\ Observations: & Decolourisation of purple solution of acidified KMnO\({}_{4}\)(aq) with formation of white solid. \\ \end{tabular}

Note:

(a) This is a chemical test to distinguish between benzene and methylbenzene. (b) The strong oxidising agents (KMnO\({}_{4}\)(aq), H\({}_{2}\)SO\({}_{4}\)(aq)) are capable of oxidising the longer side chains with a benzylic hydrogen (i.e. at least one H atom bonded to C atom adjacent to the benzene ring) to form benzoic acid (white solid) with effervescence of CO\({}_{2}\). The rest of the side chain is destroyed, forming carbon dioxide and water.

\begin{tabular}{l l}  & E.g. \\  & CH\({}_{2}\)CH\({}_{3}\) \\  & CH\({}_{3}\) \\  & CH\({}_{3}\) \\  & \\ \end{tabular}

(c) **Alkaline KMnO\({}_{4}\)** gives the **salt** of carboxylic acid which must be first **acidified** before solid benzoic acid can be obtained.

\begin{tabular}{l l}  & CH\({}_{3}\) \\  & CH\({}_{3}\) \\  & OH\({}^{\prime}\)(aq) \\  & heat \\ \end{tabular}

(d) Potassium dichromate(VI), K\({}_{2}\)Cr\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{7}\), is **unable** to oxidise the side chain of benzene.
