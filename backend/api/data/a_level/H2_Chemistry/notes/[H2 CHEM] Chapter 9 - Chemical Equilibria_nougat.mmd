POGE refers to the relative proportion of products to reactants in an equilibrium mixture.

LE CHATELER'S PRINCPLLE (LCP)

LCP states that when a system is in equilibrium is subjected to a change in conditions that disturb the equilibrium, the POE shifts in a way to reduce that change to re-establish the equilibrium.

_How to answer questions using LCP_

_1) What is the immediate effect due to the disturbance_

_2) What is the counteract response to the disturbance_

_3) Direction of the shift of POE in response to the disturbance and explanation (4) Effect of the shift of POE_

_Note: Addition of a catalyst will not have an impact on the POE and \(K_{a}\) as it speed up both the forward and backward reaction by the same extent._

**FACTOR 2: Change in total pressure (only for a gaseous system)**

When an **inert gas is added at constant volume**:

(1) Immediate Effect: Total pressure of the system increase.

However, P\({}_{\text{P,OO}}\) and P\({}_{\text{P,OO}}\), remained the same due to a

corresponding decrease in mole fraction of the gas.

(2-4) Counteract Response: The system is not disturbed and the

POE remains unchanged.

**FACTOR 2: Change in total pressure (only for a gaseous system)**

When an **inert gas is added at constant pressure**:

(1) Immediate Effect: \(P_{\text{P,OO}}\) and P\({}_{\text{P,OO}}\) decrease

(2) System will want to increase the pressure

(3) Direction of the shift of POE: POE shift to the left to increase

the total pressure as the forward reaction involves an increase

in the total number of gas molecules (from 1 mol to 2 mol)

(4) Effect of the shift: Therefore P\({}_{\text{P,OO}}\) increase and a new

equilibrium is achieved.

## Applications of LCP

To design an efficient procedure, 3 most important factors to consider are:

1. Rate of reaction: faster the better
2. Yield of product: higher the percentage yield the better
3. Economic Cost: minimise the production cost

### Commonly Test Example: Haber Process

N_1 (g) +3H2 (g) +2NH3 (g). Aft= -92 kJ mol1

According to LCP, **high pressure** favours a high yield of NH3 as the **POE shifts** to the right to reduce the total number of gaseous molecules - However a very high pressure used will incur high **high maintenance** and **operating cost**

According to LCP. **low temperature** favours a high yield of NH3 as the **POE shifts** to the right to produce heat - However a **low temperature** will result in a **slower rate of reaction**

Therefore by taking into consideration all 3 factors and LCP, the optimum conditions used for **Huber** Process are 200 atm, 459C and **iron catalyst**. \(>\) 200 atm: enable a high yield (high K.)

\(>\) 450C and iron catalyst: enable reaction to occur at a faster speed (high k)

Practice Questions

Question: One molecule of haemoglobin can bind up to four molecules of oxygen to form one molecule of oxyhaemoglobin.

1. Experiment have shown that when [O,] = 7.6 x 10\({}^{4}\) mol dm\({}^{3}\). The concentration of haemoglobin and oxyhaemoglobin are equal. Use this information to calculate a value of K.

2. Using your value calculated, calculate the [O,] necessary for 99% of the haemoglobin to be converted to oxyhaemoglobin.

3. Myoglobin has a higher affinity for oxygen as compared to haemoglobin, it binds to oxygen to form oxyhemoglobin. However unlike haemoglobin, it only binds to one oxygen molecule for each myoglobin molecule. Given that the K for this reaction is, calculate the percentage of oxymyoglobin when [O,] = 7.6 x 10\({}^{4}\) mol\({}^{-3}\).

_Ans: 1. 3 x 10\({}^{4}\) mol\({}^{-4}\) dm\({}^{3}\). 2. 4 x 10\({}^{5}\) mol\({}^{-4}\) dm\({}^{3}\). 38.4%_
