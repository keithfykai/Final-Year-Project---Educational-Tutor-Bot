### 5.1 Channel Size

**Energy is absorbed to overcome the attractive forces holding the particles together.**

The amount of energy needed to allow a change in state from solid to liquid is known as **latent heat of fusion.**

### 5.2 Energy is released as molecules lose their molecular potential energy and are pulled closer.

The amount of energy released during a change in state from liquid to solid is known as **latent heat of fusion.**

### 5.3 Rolling

**Energy is absorbed to overcome the attractive forces & separate the molecules to be far apart.**

The amount of energy needed to allow a change in state from liquid to gas is known as **latent heat of vaporisation.**

### 5.4 Conclusions

**Energy is released as molecules lose their molecular potential energy and are pulled closer.**

The amount of energy released during a change in state from gas to liquid is known as **latent heat of vaporisation.**

## Chapter 6 CHANCE IN SAUET

**TAX NOTEI**

**Latent heat of vaporisation is always greater than latent heat of fusion.**

The **bond breaking** from **liquid state to gaseous state** requires a large amount of thermal energy as the **thermoulcular bonds has to be completely broken to allow the particles to be far apart.

Furthermore, **as liquid becomes a gas, the increase in volume** is more substantial and a huge amount of energy is needed to push the atmospheric pressure away to expand in volume.
