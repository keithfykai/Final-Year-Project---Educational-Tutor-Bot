### Notes to All Students

This book is written according to the syllabus of GCE O Level Elementary Mathematics (Subject code: 4016 and 4048) for Year 2016 taken from SEAB website. The purpose in writing this book is to help students break down Mathematics into simpler parts and to achieve a better understanding of the individual concepts. By studying this book solely, you are not guaranteed to get A1 in the O levels. Intensive practise is advised.

Notes written in red emphasises the common mistakes committed by students in the exams. Do make sure that you understand everything that is written. Students are advised to write their units clearly in all workings and final answer. Failure to do so can lead to a loss of marks. Students are also advised to write their workings and statements clearly. Writing the statements alone does not earn you marks but by showing clear statements and workings, it reflects your understanding towards the question. In the event that you did not get the final answer correct, it will be easier for the examiner to allocate marks through the workings.

Even though some of the examples used are adapted from 'N' level ten year series, students taking 'O' levels are still advised to read through them thoroughly and make sure that every concept is understood clearly as similar questions may appear in the O levels paper. Being complacent will lead to nothing but failure. If possible, cover the examples with a paper and attempt it first before looking at the answers.

Students are recommended to contact me at 9232 2940 as soon as possible should they spot any errors during the process of revisions.

Good luck to all of you taking the O and N levels (c)

## N1 Numbers and Four Operations

### Basic Definitions of Mathematical Terms

* Prime number: Number that can only be divided by itself and 1. One is not a prime number. Two is the only even prime number. Example: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11...
* Composite Number: Number that have more than one factor (opposite of prime number). Example: 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 14...
* Integer: Number that is a whole number. An integer can be either positive or negative. Example: -2, -1, 1, 2, 3...
* Rational number: Number that can be expressed as a fraction with the denominator not equal to zero. Recurring decimals are rational numbers. Example: \(\sqrt{4}\), \(\frac{1}{2}\), \(3.56\)
* Irrational number: Number that cannot be expressed as a fraction. Example: \(\pi\), \(\sqrt{3}\)
* Real number: Includes all rational number, irrational number, whole number and fraction
* Natural Number: Positive integer not including 0. Example: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5...
* Perfect square: A number that can be square rooted to give a whole number. Example: 1, 4, 9, 16, 25...
* Perfect cube: A number that can be cube rooted to give a whole number. Example: 1, 8, 27, 64, 125...
* Consecutive number: Numbers that follow each other in order. Example: 3, 4, 5... Therefore, if the smallest consecutive number is \(x\), the next integer will be \(x+1\)
* Consecutive odd number: Odd numbers that follow each other in order Example: 1, 3, 5... Therefore, if the smallest consecutive odd number is \(x\), the next integer will be \(x\) + 2, \(x+4\)...
* Consecutive even numbers: Even numbers that follow each other in order Example: 2, 4, 6... Therefore, if the smallest consecutive odd number is \(x\), the next integer will be \(x+2\), \(x+4\)...
* Negative number: Real number that is less than 0. The bigger the negative number, the smaller the value i.e. -3 is smaller than -2. Example: -1, -2, -3, -4...
* Note: Students usually refer \(\pi\) to \(\frac{22}{7}\), thereby inferring that \(\pi\) is a rational number. However, \(\frac{22}{7}\) is just a estimate of \(\pi\) used in primary schools. It is important to note that \(\pi\) is an irrational number. The accurate form of \(\pi\) is found in the calculator.

### N1.2 Number Line

Number becomes bigger when moving from left to right of the number line. Number becomes smaller when moving from right to left of the number line.

Example: N Level 2013 Paper 1 Question 5

The values of p, q, r and s are \(\frac{8}{5}\), 0.6, \(\frac{5}{9}\), \(\frac{\pi}{2}\). Find p, q, r and s.

\(\frac{8}{5}\) = 1.6

Note: Always convert fractions to decimals first and answer in its original form

Therefore, p = 0.6, q = \(\frac{5}{9}\), r = \(\frac{\pi}{2}\) and s = \(\frac{8}{5}\)

### N1.3 Basic Mathematical Symbols

\(<\): Less than; does not include the number stated

Example: \(x<6\) means 5, 4, 3, 2, 1...

\(>\): More than; does not include the number stated

Example: \(x>6\) means 7, 8, 9, 10, 11...

\(\leq\): Less than or equal to; include the number stated

Example: \(x\leq 6\) means 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1...

\(\geq\): More than or equal to; include the number stated

Example: \(x\geq 6\) means 6, 7, 8, 9, 10...

Example: N Level Paper 2 Question 6 (a)

List all the solutions to -4 \(\leq 2x<8\)

-4 \(\leq 2x<8\)

-2 \(\leq x<4\)

Therefore, the solutions are -2, -1, 0, 1, 2 and 3.

### N1.4 Expressing Recurring Decimals as Fraction

Recurring decimals are rational numbers where it can be converted into fractions.

Example: Express 3.42 as fraction.

3.42= 3.424242424

\(x=3.424242424\)

100x= 342.42424

99x= 342.42424 - 3.42424

99x= 339

\(x=\frac{339}{99}\)

Calculating Mean and Standard Deviation

Example: O Level 2014 Paper 2 Question 10 (a)

Calculate the estimated mean and standard deviation of the times taken by 100 males to

complete a 10 km race.

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|l|l|} \hline Time (t min) & 30 \(\leq\) t \textless{}40 & 40 \(\leq\) t \textless{}50 & 50 \(\leq\) t \textless{}60 & 60 \(\leq\) t \textless{}70 & 70 \(\leq\) t \textless{}80 \\ \hline Frequency & 15 & 32 & 30 & 16 & 7 \\ \hline \end{tabular}

To calculate mean, the estimated mean has to be derived first before the data can be input into the calculator.

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|l|l|} \hline Estimated Time (t min) & 35 & 45 & 55 & 65 & 75 \\ \hline Frequency & 15 & 32 & 30 & 16 & 7 \\ \hline \end{tabular}

Step 1: Before continuing, ensure that your calculator allows you to key in frequency by

following the subsequent steps. DO NOT CONTINUE if this step is not done: Shift > Mode >

Arrow Down > 4 (STAT) > 1 (ON)

Step 2: Press Mode > 2 (STAT) > 1 (1-VAR)

Step 3: Key in the following order:

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|} \hline \(x\) & **v** \\ \hline
35 & 15 \\
45 & 32 \\
55 & 30 \\
65 & 16 \\
75 & 7 \\ \hline \end{tabular}

Step 4: Press (ON)

Step 5: To calculate mean, press Shift > 1 (STAT)> 4 (VAR)> 2 (\(\bar{x}\)) > =

Step 6: Calculator will show 51.8, which is the answer for mean.

Step 7: For standard deviation, press Shift > 1 (STAT) > 4 (VAR) > 3 (\(\alpha x\)) > =

Step 8: Calculator will show 11.21427662 which is the answer for standard deviation. Round

off the answer to 3 s.f.

### N1.6 Approximation and Estimation

When rounding off, do note that the zeros in front is not significant. However, the zeros in the middle or at the end is significant.

Example: Round off 0.0948039 to:

1 significant figure: 0.09 (1 s.f.)
2 decimal place: 0.1 (1 d.p.)
3 significant figures: 0.095 (2 s.f.)
4 decimal places: 0.09 (2 d.p.)
5 significant figures: 0.0948 (3 s.f.)
6 decimal places: 0.095 (3 d.p.)
7 significant figures: 0.0948 (4 s.f.) Note: there must be a 0 at the end
8 4 decimal places: 0.0948 (4 d.p.)

Format required in the exams:

1. Workings: At least 4 significant figures. Preferably 5 significant figures and above.
2. Final Answer (except angles): 3 significant figures (3 s.f.)
3. Angles/ Bearings: 1 decimal place (1 d.p.)
4. Money: round off to the nearest cents (2 d.p.)

Note: Many students tend to round off to the nearest 10 cents (1 decimal place) instead of nearest cents (2 decimal places) when question ask to round off answer to the nearest cents.
5. Other format: Nearest kg, nearest dollar, nearest cubic centimetres etc. means correct to the nearest whole number

Example: N Level 2014 Paper 1 Question 3

By writing each number correct to 1 significant figure, estimate the value of \(\frac{28.19\times 623.1}{0.3285}\). You must show your working.

\(\frac{28.19\times 623.1}{0.3285}\approx\frac{30\times 600}{0.3}\)

= 60 000 (1 s.f)

### N1.7 Finding Highest Common Factor (HCF) and Lowest Common Factor (LCM)

Example: Determine the HCF and LCM of 150 and 126

Step 1: Do prime factorisation of 150 and 126 and express them in the product of prime factors

Step 2: For HCF, take lower power of common factors; do not include uncommon factors

For LCM, take higher power of common factors; include uncommon factors

Finding smallest integer, k, that makes 150k the square of a number

Finding smallest integer, m, that makes 126 the cube of a number

### N1.8 Determining Square Root of Number by Prime Factorisation

Example: Determine \(\sqrt{324}\) by prime factorisation

Step 1: Do prime factorisation and leave the answer in index notation.

Step 2: Divide powers of the factors by 2.

### N1.9 Determining Cube Root of Number by Prime Factorisation

Example: Determine \(\sqrt{216}\) by prime factorisation

Step 1: Do prime factorisation and leave the answer in index notation.

Step 2: Divide powers of the factors by 3.

\end{table}
Table 1: Do prime factorisation and leave the answer in index notation.

### N1.10 Word Problems Involving HCF and LCM

If the word 'greatest number' appear in the question, it is most likely to be a HCF question. If the word 'together' or 'least number' appear in the question, it is most likely to be a LCM question.

Example: O level 2008 Paper 1 Question 17 (b)

The lights of three lightships flash at regular intervals. The first light flashes every 12 seconds, the second every 27 seconds and the third every 90 seconds. The three lights flash together at 0900. At what time do they next flash together?

Step 1: Express all numbers in index notation.

**12** = 2\({}^{2}\) x 3

**27** = 3\({}^{3}\)

**90** = 2 x 3\({}^{2}\) x 5

**LCM** = 2\({}^{2}\) x 3\({}^{3}\) x 5

**= 540**

Step 2: Since question ask for the time that the lights will flash together, LCM is determined.

Time taken = 540 seconds

**= 9 min**

Time taken for the three lights to flash together = 0900 + 9 min

**= 09 09**

Example: There are 300 blue beads, 156 yellow beads and 126 red beads. Given that the beads are distributed equally among the girls with no left over. What is the greatest possible number of girls in the group?

Step 1: Express all numbers in index notation.

**300** = 2\({}^{2}\) x 3 x 5\({}^{2}\)

**156** = 2\({}^{2}\) x 3 x 13

**126** = 2 x 3\({}^{2}\) x 7

Step 2: Since question ask for the greatest possible number of girls, HCF is determined.

HCF = 2 x 3

**= 6**

### N1.11 Standard Form

To express a number in standard form, always ensure that the number is more than 1 and less than 10 i.e. \(1<x<10\). When changing numbers to standard form, if the number becomes bigger, the power will become smaller. When the number becomes smaller, the power will become bigger.

### Prefix for Standard Form

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|} \hline
**Factor** & **Prefix** & **Symbol** \\ \hline \(10^{-1}\) & deci & d \\ \hline \(10^{-2}\) & centi & c \\ \hline \(10^{-3}\) & milli & m \\ \hline \(10^{-6}\) & micro & \(\mu\) \\ \hline \(10^{-9}\) & nano & n \\ \hline \(10^{-12}\) & pico & p \\ \hline \(10^{3}\) & kilo & k \\ \hline \(10^{6}\) & mega & M \\ \hline \(10^{9}\) & giga & G \\ \hline \(10^{12}\) & tetra & T \\ \hline \(10^{6}\) & million & \\ \hline \(10^{9}\) & billion & \\ \hline \(10^{12}\) & trillion & \\ \hline \end{tabular}

Example: N Level 2012 Paper 2 Question 1

The time-keeper in a race sees a starting gun fire 334 nanoseconds after it has been fired.

**(a)**: Write 334 nanoseconds in seconds in standard form.

**334 nanoseconds = 334x \(10^{-9}\) s**: Note: -7 is bigger than -9

 = 3.34x \(10^{-7}\) s**:
**(b)**: The time-keeper hears the gun fire 0.294 seconds after it has been fired. Given that 0.294 seconds = k x 334 nanoseconds, find the value of k. Give your answer in standard form.

**0.294 = k x 3.34 x \(10^{-7}\)**:

 k = \(\frac{0.294}{3.34x10^{-7}}\)

 = 8.80 x \(10^{5}\) (3 s.f.)

### Elementary Mathematics Notes

Example: N level 2014 Paper 1 Question 11

The table shows the population of some countries in 2011.

\begin{tabular}{|p{142.3pt}|p{142.3pt}|} \hline
**Country** & **Population** \\ \hline China & 1.34 billion = 1.34 x 10\({}^{9}\) \\ \hline USA & 3.14 x 10\({}^{8}\) \\ \hline Philippines & 1.04 x 10\({}^{8}\) \\ \hline Germany & 8.13 x 10\({}^{7}\) \\ \hline Ghana & 2.52 x 10\({}^{7}\) \\ \hline \end{tabular}

* The population of China in 2011 was 1.34 billion. Complete the table by writing the population of China in standard form. Shown in purple.
* (2.52 x 10\({}^{7}\)) = 5.61 x 10\({}^{6}\) = 56.1 million
* The population of Finland was approximately one twentieth of the population of the Philippines. Estimate the population of Finland, in millions, correct to one significant figure.
* Population of Finland = \(\frac{1}{20}\) x 1.04 x 10\({}^{8}\) = 0.052 x 10\({}^{8}\) = 5.2 x 10\({}^{6}\) = 5.2 million

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:18]

Example: N Level 2013 Paper 1 Question 15

1. Evaluate 3-2. \(\mathbf{3^{-2}}=\frac{\mathbf{1}}{3^{2}}\) \(=\frac{\mathbf{1}}{9}\) 2. Given that \(16^{\frac{3}{2}}=2^{x}\), find \(x\). \(16^{\frac{3}{2}}=2^{x}\) \((2^{4})^{\frac{3}{2}}=2^{x}\) \(2^{x}=2^{6}\) \(x=6\)

Example: O Level 2013 Paper 1 Question 5

1. Given that \(8\times 16^{\frac{1}{4}}=2^{n}\), find n. \(2^{3}\times(2^{4})^{\frac{1}{4}}=2^{n}\) \(2^{3}\times 2^{1}=2^{n}\) \(2^{3+1}=2^{n}\) \(n=4\) 2. Given that \(\frac{1}{9}=3^{k}\), find k. \(9^{-1}=3^{k}\) \(3^{-2}=3^{k}\) \(k=-2\)

Example: O Level 2014 Paper 1 Question 9

Some bacteria were introduced into a culture. The number of bacteria, B, t hours after being introduced is given by B = 1000 x 3\({}^{t}\)

1. How many bacteria were introduced into the culture? When t = 0, Number of bacteria = 1000 x 3\({}^{0}\) \(=1000\) \(=1000\) \((b)\) Find the percentage increase in the number of bacteria at the end of the first hour. When t = 1, Number of bacteria = 1000 x 3\({}^{1}\) \(=3000\) \(\%\) increase = \(\frac{3000-1000}{1000}\) x 100\(\%\) \(=200\%\)

### Elementary Mathematics Notes

Example: O level 2012 Paper 1 Question 5

The sketch shows the graph of y = ka\({}^{x}\). The points (0, 5) and (6, 320) lie on the graph.

Find the values of k and a.

y = ka\({}^{x}\)

When \(x\) = 0, y = 5,

5 = ka\({}^{0}\)

k = 5

When \(x\) = 6, y = 320, k = 5

320 = 5a\({}^{6}\)

64 = a\({}^{6}\)

2\({}^{6}\) = a\({}^{6}\)

a = 2

Therefore, a = 2 and k = 5.

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:21]

N2.2 Basic Conversion between Length, Area and Volume Conversion Between cm\({}^{2}\) and m\({}^{2}\)

1 m = 100 cm

(1 m)\({}^{2}\) = (100 cm)\({}^{2}\)

1 m\({}^{2}\) = 10 000 cm\({}^{2}\)

10 000 cm\({}^{2}\) = 1 m\({}^{2}\)

1 cm\({}^{2}\) = \(\frac{1}{10\,000}\) m\({}^{2}\)

Note: Common mistake student makes is by assuming 1 m\({}^{2}\) = 100 cm\({}^{2}\). Please note the above proper method for conversion.

### Conversion Between cm\({}^{3}\) and m\({}^{3}\)

1 m = 100 cm

(1 m)\({}^{3}\) = (100 cm)\({}^{3}\)

1 m\({}^{3}\) = 1 0000 000 cm\({}^{3}\)

1 000 000 cm\({}^{3}\) = 1 m\({}^{3}\)

1 cm\({}^{3}\) = \(\frac{1}{1000\,000}\) m\({}^{3}\)

Note: Common mistake student makes is by assuming 1 m\({}^{3}\) = 1000 cm\({}^{3}\). Please note the above proper method for conversion.

### N2.3 Maps and Scales

The representative fraction (R.F.) expresses the linear scale of a map 1: n in the form \(\frac{1}{n}\), noting that the numerator is always 1.

Example: O level 2011 Paper 1 Question 9

A map is drawn to a scale of 1: 25 000

1. This scale can be expressed as 1 cm represents n km. Find n.

1. 25 000

1 cm: 25 000 cm

1 cm: 25 0 m

1 cm: 0.25 km

Therefore, n = 0.25
2. The distance between two towns on the map is 30 cm. Find the actual distance, in kilometres, between the two towns.

1 cm: 0.25 km

30 cm: (0.25 x 30) km

30 cm: 7.5 km

Therefore, the distance between the two towns is 7.5 km.
3. A lake has an actual area of 2.5 km\({}^{2}\). Find the area, in square centimetres, of the lake on the map.

1 cm: 0.25 km

(1 cm)\({}^{2}\): (0.25 km)\({}^{2}\)

1 cm\({}^{2}\): 0.0625 km\({}^{2}\)

0.0625 km\({}^{2}\): 1 cm\({}^{2}\)

1 km\({}^{2}\): \(\frac{1}{0.0625}\) cm\({}^{2}\)

2.5 km\({}^{2}\): \(\frac{1}{0.0625}\) x 2.5) cm\({}^{2}\)

2.5 km\({}^{2}\): 40 cm\({}^{2}\)

Therefore, the area of the lake on the map is 40 cm\({}^{2}\).

Note: When doing area, always make sure the actual area is changed to whatever unit that is required before squaring both sides for easier conversion.

### N2.4 Direct Proportion

When y is directly proportional to \(x\), when \(x\) increases, y increases i.e. y = k\(x\)

If \(x\) and y are in direct proportion, the graph is a straight line which passes through the origin.

An object starts from rest and travels in a straight line. The distance travelled, s metres, is directly proportional to the square of the travelling time, t seconds.

(a) Sketch a distance-time graph for the object

Note: Since it is the square of the travelling time, it will be a curve instead of a straight line

In the first 4 seconds the object travels 36 m.

(b) Find the equation for s in terms of t

S \(\alpha\) t\({}^{2}\)

S = kt\({}^{2}\)

when t = 4 and s = 36,

36 = k(4)\({}^{2}\)

k = 2.25

Therefore, s = 2.25t\({}^{2}\)

(c) Calculate the time taken to travel 20 m.

When s = 20,

20 = 2.25t\({}^{2}\)

t = \(\sqrt{\frac{80}{9}}\)

= 2.98s (3 s.f.)

(Rejected since t > 0)

Therefore, time taken to travel 20 m is 2.98 seconds.

### Elementary Mathematics Notes

#### Example: O level 2008 Paper 1 Question 13

The braking distance of a car is directly proportional to the square of its speed. When the speed is p metres per second, the braking distance is 6 m. When the speed is increased by 300%, find

1. An expression for the speed of the car Speed of the car = p + 3p = 4p m/s Note: The new speed of the car is not 3p as the speed is **INCREASED** by 300%; the speed is not 300%.
2. The braking distance Let the speed of the car be s; the braking distance of the car be d. Note: Make constant the subject of the formula if the actual constant cannot be determined. d \(\alpha\) s\({}^{2}\) d = ks\({}^{2}\) When s = p and d = 6, 6 = kp\({}^{2}\) When s = 4p, d = ks\({}^{2}\) d = \(\frac{6}{\rho^{2}}\) x 16p\({}^{2}\) d = 6 x 16 = 96 m Therefore, the braking distance is 96 m.
3. The percentage increase in the braking distance % increase = \(\frac{\text{distance increased}}{\text{original distance}}\) x 100% = \(\frac{96-6}{6}\) x 100% = 1500%

### N2.5 Inverse Proportion

When y is indirectly proportional to \(x\), when \(x\) increase, y decreases.

\(\forall=\frac{k}{x}\)

If \(x\) and y are in inverse proportion, the graph against \(x\) is part of a curve which is also called the hyperbola.

If \(x\) and y are in inverse proportion, the graph against \(\frac{1}{x}\) is a straight line passing through the origin.

Example: N Level 2008 Paper 1 Question 18 (a)

The time taken to fill a fish tank is inversely proportional to the rate at which the water is flowing through the tap. It takes 4 minutes to fill the fish tank when the water is flowing at a certain rate. How long will it take if the rate is halved?

Let the time taken for to fill the fish tank be t and the rate of the water be r.

Note: Make constant the subject of the formula if the actual constant cannot be determined.

t \(\alpha\frac{1}{r}\)

t = \(\frac{k}{r}\)

when t = 4,

4 = \(\frac{k}{r}\)

k = 4r

When r = \(\frac{1}{2}\) r,

t = \(\frac{4r}{\frac{1}{2}}\)

t = 8 minutes

## N3. Percentage

### N3.1 Conversion between Percentage, Decimal and Fraction

To convert percentage into fraction or decimal, divide the value by 100.

Example: Express 0.88% as a fraction

\[0.88\% =\frac{0.88}{100}\] \[=\frac{11}{1250}\]

Example: Express 1.64% in decimal

\[1.64\% =\frac{1.64}{100}\] \[=0.0164\]

To convert fraction or decimal in percentage, multiply the value by 100.

Example: Express \(\frac{35}{100}\) in percentage

\[\frac{35}{100}\]

x 100% = 35%

Example: Express 0.76 in percentage

\[0.76\]

x 100% = 76%

### N3.2 Expressing One Quantity as a Percentage of Another

Example: O Level 2014 Paper 1 Question 8

Two bottles are geometrically similar. The smaller bottle has a capacity of 1 litre and the larger bottle has a capacity of 2 litres. Calculate the height of the smaller bottle as a percentage of the height of the larger bottle.

Let the height of the smaller bottle be \(h_{1}\) and the larger bottle be \(h_{2}\).

Ratio of the height of the 2 bottles = \(\frac{h_{1}}{h_{2}}\)

Since \((\frac{h_{1}}{h_{2}})^{3}\) = \(\frac{1000}{2000}\)

\(\frac{h_{1}}{h_{2}}\) = \(\sqrt{\frac{1000}{2000}}\)

Therefore, percentage of \(\frac{h_{1}}{h_{2}}\) = \(\sqrt{\frac{1000}{2000}}\) x 100%

= 79.37

= 79.4% (3 s.f.)

### N3.3 Comparing Two Quantities by Percentage

Example: Jug A is sold for $8 at Supermarket A while Jug B is sold for $6.50. During an economic recession, the prices of both jugs were marked up by $0.50 and $0.80 respectively. Determine which jug has a higher percentage increase in price.

Percentage increase in price of Jug A = \(\frac{0.50}{8}\) x 100%

= 6.25%

Percentage increase in price of Jug B = \(\frac{0.80}{6.50}\) x 100%

= 12.3% (3 s.f.)

Therefore, the percentage increase in price of Jug B is higher.

### N3.4 Calculating % Profit or Loss

Basic Formula:

% Profit or Loss = \(\frac{New\;Price-Original\;Price}{Original\;Price}\) x 100%

Example: N Level 2014 Paper 1 Question 16

Daniel owns an electrical shop

**(a)**: The cost of a washing machine was $420. Daniel made a profit of 30% on the cost price when he sold it. Find the selling price

\[\text{Selling price}=\frac{100+30}{100}\;\text{x 420}\]

\[=\$546\]

_ALTERNATIVE WORKING:_

\[\begin{array}{l}100\%\;\geqslant\;\frac{420}{100}\\ 130\%\;\geqslant\;\frac{420}{100}\;\text{x 130}\\ =\$546\end{array}\]
**(b)**: Daniel paid $180 for a vacuum cleaner. He sold it in a sale for $153. Find the loss as a percentage of the cost price.

\[\%\;\text{Loss}=\frac{180-153}{180}\;\text{x 100\%}\\ =15\%\]

### N3.5 Increasing or Decreasing a Quantity by a Given Percentage

Example: N Level 2011 Paper 2 Question 7

In July 2007, Goods and Services Tax (GST) was raised from 5% to 7%.

**(a)**: Before the increase, the price of the television without GST was $850. Calculate the increase in the price of the television due to the increase in GST.

To calculate the price of the television with 5% GST:

100% 850

1% \(\frac{850}{100}\)

105% \(\frac{850}{100}\times 105\)

\(\xi\)892.50

To calculate the price of the television with 7% GST:

107% \(\frac{850}{100}\times 107\)

= $909.50

Increase in price = $909.50 - $892.50

= $17
**(b)**: Before the increase, the price of a washing machine including GST was $630. What was the price of the washing machine after the increase to 7% GST?

To calculate selling price excluding 5% GST:

105% \(\frac{630}{105}\)

100% \(\frac{630}{105}\times 100\)

= $600

To calculate price of the washing machine after the increase to 7% GST

100% \(\frac{600}{100}\)

107% \(\frac{600}{100}\times 107\)

= $642

Therefore, the price of the washing machine was $642.

### N4. Rate and Speed

Average speed = \(\frac{Total\ Distance}{Total\ Time}\)

Note: When calculating average speed, total time includes time stopped at a certain location

### N4.1 Conversion of Units

Example: Convert 30 km/h into m/s

\(\frac{30\ km}{h}=\frac{30\ 000m}{3600s}\)

\(=8\frac{1}{3}\) m/s

Example: Convert 7 m/s into km/h

\(\frac{7\ m}{s}=\frac{0.007\ km}{\frac{1}{3600\ h}}\)

\(=25.2\) km/h

### N4.2 Word Problems Involving Speed

Example: N Level 2011 Paper 1 Question 24

A car is travelling at a constant speed of 72 km/h.

1. Find the distance the car takes to travel in 40 minutes
2. Find how many minutes the car takes to travel 126 km.
3. Another car travels 196 km in 2 hours 27 min.
4.2 hours 27 min = \(2\frac{27}{60}\) h
5. Average speed = \(\frac{Total\ Distance}{Total\ Time}\)

\(=\frac{196\ km}{2\frac{27}{60}\ h}\)

\(=80\) km/h

Written by: Lai Zhi Yin (2016) | Mobile: 9232 2940 | Website: bishantuition.com

### N4.3 Word Problems Involving Rate

Example: If it takes 3 days for 10 workers to finish building one house, how many days will it take 15 workers to finish building 4 houses?

**10** workers 3 days 1 house

**1** worker 30 days 1 house

**15** workers 2 days 1 house

**1** house 2 days

**4** houses 8 days

Example: Tap A can fill up a tank in 5h. Tap B can fill up a tank in 4h. If both the taps are turned on simultaneously, how long would it take to fill the tank?

**Tap A**

**5h 7 1 tank**

**1h 7 5 tank**

**Tap B**

**1h 7 5 + 14 tank**

**=** 9 20 tank**

**9 20 tank 1 h**

**120 tank 1 9 h**

**20 tank 20 9 h**

**=** 2**^2 h

## N5. Algebraic Representation and Formulae

### N5.1 Evaluation of Algebraic Expressions and Formulae

Basic algebraic expression

\(\oplus\)\(\mathrm{ab}=\mathrm{a}\times\mathrm{b}\)

\(\oplus\)\(\frac{a}{b}=\mathrm{a}\div\mathrm{b}\)

\(\oplus\)\(\mathrm{a}^{2}=\mathrm{a}\times\mathrm{a}\)

\(\oplus\)\(\frac{1}{5}x=\frac{x}{5}\)

\(\oplus\)\(-\frac{1}{3}x=\frac{x}{3}=\frac{x}{3}\)

Note: Negative sign can be on the numerator or denominator, but not both.

\(\oplus\)\(\mathrm{ab}^{2}=\mathrm{a}^{2}\mathrm{b}^{2}=\mathrm{a}\times\mathrm{a}\times \mathrm{b}\times\mathrm{b}\)

To solve linear equations, there are a few rules to take note of:

1. Always open the brackets first in the order of (, [ and {. When expanding brackets, do take note of the possible existence of the negative sign. The number in front of the bracket will only affect the numbers inside the bracket.
2. Do multiplication and division next, depending on the order that comes first. Always move from left to right of the equation
3. Lastly, do addition and subtraction. Always move from left to right of the equation

Example: Simplify -2 {a + 2b x 4 - [3(5a - b) - 5(b - 3) + 8] - 5}:

- 3) + 8]
- 5} = -2 {a + 2b x 4
- 3) + 8]
- 5} = -2 {a + 2b x 4
- 5b + 15 + 8]
- 5} = -2 {a + 2b x 4
- 8b + 23]
- 5} = -2 {a + 2b x 4
- 15a + 8b
- 5} = -2 {a + 8b
- 15a + 8b
- 5} = -2 {a + 8b
- 15a + 8b
- 5} = -2 {a + 16b
- 28} = 28a
- 32b + 56

### N5.2 Changing the Subject of the Formula

Put whatever you need on the left hand side, the rest on the right hand side. Cross multiply to obtain a linear equation whereas required. When a square root is involved do no forget to insert your \(\pm\) sign. Failing to do so will cause you to lose a mark from the question.

Example: O level 2014 Paper 2 Question 1 (bii)

It is given that W = \(\frac{1}{2}\) m (v\({}^{2}\) - u\({}^{2}\)). Express u in terms of W, m and v.

W = \(\frac{1}{2}\) m (v\({}^{2}\) - u\({}^{2}\))

2W = m (v\({}^{2}\) - u\({}^{2}\))

\(\frac{2W}{m}\) = v\({}^{2}\) - u\({}^{2}\)

u\({}^{2}\) = v\({}^{2}\) - \(\frac{2W}{m}\)

### N5.3 Addition and Subtraction of Algebraic Expressions

Ensure that the denominators are the same before you combine the fractions. When combining the fractions, do take note of the negative sign before you open the brackets. Note: Denominator need not be expanded when expressing algebraic expressions as single fraction.

Example: Modified from O Level 2012 Paper 1 Question 11 (b)

Write as a single fraction in its simplest form \(\frac{5}{(x-2)^{2}}+\frac{1}{2-x}\).

\(\frac{5}{(x-2)^{2}}+\frac{1}{2-x}\)

\(=\frac{5}{(x-2)^{2}}-\frac{1}{x-2}\)

Note: How the signs are changed

\(=\frac{5}{(x-2)^{2}}-\frac{1}{(x-2)(x-2)}\)

Note: Negative sign when combining fractions

\(=\frac{5-x+2}{(x-2)^{2}}\)

\(=\frac{7-x}{(x-2)^{2}}\)

Written by: Lai Zhi Yin (2016) | Mobile: 9232 2940 | Website: bishantuition.comExample: O Level 2013 Paper 2 Question 1 (c)

Express as a single fraction in its simplest form \(\frac{6}{3-2x}-\frac{4}{2-x}\)

\[\frac{6}{3-2x}-\frac{4}{2-x}\] \[=\frac{6(2-x)}{(3-2x)(2-x)}-\frac{4(3-2x)}{(3-2x)(2-x)}\] \[=\frac{6(2-x)-4(3-2x)}{(3-2x)(2-x)}\] \[=\frac{12-6x-12+8x}{(3-2x)(2-x)}\] \[=\frac{2x}{(3-2x)(2-x)}\]

### N5.4 Multiplication and Division of Algebraic Expressions

Always change the division sign to a multiplication sign before proceeding on. Upon changing the division sign to a multiplication sign, take the reciprocal of the fraction (flip the fraction over)

Example: O Level 2012 Paper 2 Question 1 (c)

\[\text{Simplify}\,\frac{x}{2y}\,\vdots\,\frac{3x^{2}y}{4}\] \[\frac{x}{2y}\,\vdots\,\frac{3x^{2}y}{4}\] \[=\frac{x^{2}y}{2y}\,\mathbf{x}\,\frac{4}{3x^{2}y}.\]

Example: O Level 2011 Paper 1 Question 8 (a)

\[\text{Simplify}\,\frac{5c}{2}\,\vdots\,\frac{20c^{2}}{d}\] \[=\frac{5c}{2}\,\mathbf{x}\,\frac{d}{20c}\] \[=\frac{d}{8c}\]

Example: Simplify \((\frac{3a}{4ab})^{2}+\frac{27a}{2b}\)

\[\begin{array}{l}(\frac{3a}{4ab})^{2}\,\dot{z}\,\frac{27a}{2b}\\ =\frac{\dot{9}a^{2}}{b16\dot{a}b^{2}}\,\mathbf{x}\,\frac{2b}{27a}\\ =\frac{1}{24ab}\end{array}\]

### N5.8 Completing the Square not involving an Equation

\[\begin{array}{l}\text{Example:}\ 2x^{2}-3x-5\\ 2x^{2}-3x-5\\ =2\ (x^{2}-\frac{3}{2}x-\frac{5}{2})\\ =2\ [x^{2}-\frac{3}{2}x+(-\frac{3}{2}+2)^{2}-\frac{5}{2}-(-\frac{3}{2}+2)^{2}]\\ =2\ [(x-\frac{3}{4})^{2}-\frac{49}{16}]\\ =2(x-\frac{3}{4})^{2}-\frac{49}{8}\\ \end{array}\]

Note: Do not put = 0 if the question does that state sol

1. Ensure that \(x^{2}\) is by itself.
2. Divide the consonant in front of \(x\) by 2 and square it. Shown in green.
3. Since it is on the same side of the equation, one of them must be a plus, the other a minus.
4. Multiply the factor in accordingly.

### N5.9 Factorisation of Linear Algebraic and Quadratic Expression

Example: O Level 2012 Paper 1 Question 18 (b)

Factorise fully \(6x^{2}-15x-9\)

Step 1: Factorise out common factors. If the string of numbers is keyed into the calculator, it will not give an equivalent answer as calculator can only give answers in the simplest form.

\(6x^{2}-15x-9\)

\(=3(2x^{2}-5x-3)\)

Step 2: Either key the numbers into the calculator (Refer to Page 7) or draw up format for cross factorisation. For cross factorisation, fill up the boxes according to the format

Step 3: Trial and error is required. Fill up the boxes with possible numbers that may fit the numbers. Note: DO NOT INCLUDE any NEGATIVE SIGNS at this stage.

Step 3: Determine how the number on the right can be obtained. In this case, \(6x\) will have to be negative in order to obtain -5x i.e. \(x-6x=\) -5\(x\). The negative number will be carried to the number directly on its left.

Step 4: Write the answer in its factorised form.

\(6x^{2}-15x-9\)

\(=3(2x^{2}-5x-3)\)

\(=3(2x+1)(x-3)\)

Factories completely \(3xy-6ay-4x+8a\)

\(3xy-6ay-4x+8a\)

\(=3y(x-2a)-4(x-2a)\)

Note: Sign change in red!

\(=(x-2a)(3y-4)\)

Other possible workings:

\(3xy-6ay-4x+8a\)

\(=3xy-4x+8a-6ay\)

\(=x(3y-4)+2a(4-3y)\)

Note: How \((3y-4)\) is changed into \((4-3y)\)

\(=x(3y-4)-2a(3y-4)\)

\(=(x-2a)(3y-4)\)

Example: O Level 2013 Paper 2 Question 1 (b)

a) Factorise completely \(18p^{2}-8\)

\(=2(9p^{2}-4)\)

Note: Check for common factors first

\(=2(3p-2)\) (3p+2)

\(\frac{18p^{2}-8}{6p^{2}-14p-}\)

\(\frac{18p^{2}-8}{6p^{2}-14p-12}\)

Note: Do not key the denominator

into the calculator if the common

factor has not been factorised

\(3p\)\(-2\)\(2p\)

\(-3\)\(-9p\)

### N5.10 Number Patterns

Linear Number Pattern

The difference between the terms will always be constant. Assuming that term 0 exists, determine term 0.

Example 1:-2,5,12,19...

Since the pattern keeps increasing by 7 therefore +7n will be part of the pattern.

Term 0 = -2 - 7

= -9

Therefore, nth term = -9 + 7n

Example 2: 21,18,15,12...

Note that the pattern keeps decreasing by 3, therefore -3n will be part of the pattern.

Term 0 = 21 + 3

= 24

Therefore, nth term = 24 - 3n

Special Number Patterns

Example 1: 1, 4, 9, 16...

nth term: n2

Reason: 1 x 1, 2 x 2, 3 x 3, 4 x 4...

Example 2: 1, 8, 27, 64...

nth term = n3

Reason: 1 x 1 x 1, 2 x 2, 3 x 3 x 3, 4 x 4...

Number Pattern Involving \(\pi^{2}\)

Example 6, 15, 28, 45...

Note that the difference between each terms is not the same. In this case, quadratic formula an2 + bn + c has to be used. The first number that appears in the number pattern is known as term 1.

When n=1, a + b + c = 6

when n= 2, 4a + 2b + c = 15

when n=3, 9a + 3b + c = 28

Solve the above equations using calculator, calculator will show answer as \(x\) = 2, y = 3, z = 1. Refer to page 8 for elaborate steps on calculator skills. Note: The numbers in red will remain the same if the first 3 terms of the number pattern is used. The last column varies according to the numbers given in the question.

Therefore, the nth term is 2n2 + 3n + 1

### N7.3 Solving Quadratic Equation

The three ways to solve quadratic equations not by graphical methods are factorisation, general formula and completing the square.

### Cross Factorisation

When using this method, note that the right hand side must always be zero. If not, bring all variables to the left hand side before proceeding.

Example: N Level 2014 Paper 1 Question 14 (bii)

\[\begin{array}{l}\text{Solve }x^{2}-2x-24=0\\ (x-6)(x+4)=0\\ (x-6)=0\quad\text{or}\quad\quad(x+4)=0\\ x=6\quad\text{or}\quad\quad\quad x=-4\end{array}\]

General Formula

\[\begin{array}{l}\text{x}=\frac{-\text{b}\pm\sqrt{\text{b}^{2}-4\text{ac}}} {2\text{a}}\end{array}\]

Note: Consonant in front of \(x^{2}\) is a, consonant in front of \(x\) is b and the constant term alone is c. Do include negative signs whereas applicable. The right hand side must always be equals to 0.

Example: \(2x^{2}-3x-5=0\)

a = 2, b = -3, c = -5

\[\begin{array}{l}\text{x}=\frac{-(-3)\pm\sqrt{(-3)^{2}-4(2)(-5)}}{2(2)}\\ \text{x}=\frac{3\pm\sqrt{9+40}}{4}\\ \text{x}=\frac{3\pm\sqrt{49}}{4}\\ \text{x}=\frac{3+\sqrt{49}}{4}\\ \text{x}=\frac{3+\sqrt{49}}{4}\text{or}\quad\quad\quad x=\frac{3-\sqrt{49}}{4} \\ \text{x}=2.5\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\text{or}\quad\quad\quad x=-1\end{array}\]
#### Completing the Square

When doing completing the square in an equation, bring the constant term to the right hand side of the equation. Ensure that \(x^{2}\) is doesn't have any constant term.

\[\begin{array}{l}2x^{2}-3x-5=0\\ 2x^{2}-3x=5\\ x^{2}-1.5x=2.5\\ x^{2}-1.5x+\left(\frac{-1.5}{2}\right)^{2}=2.5+\left(\frac{-1.5}{2}\right)^{2} \\ (x-0.75)^{2}=\frac{49}{16}\\ x-0.75=\pm\sqrt{\frac{49}{16}}\\ x-0.75=\frac{7}{4}\\ x=2.5\end{array}\]

or \[x-0.75=\frac{7}{4} x=-1\]

### N7.4 Solving Fractional Equations that can be reduced to Quadratic Equation

Example: O Level 2014 Paper 2 Question 1 (d)

\[\begin{array}{l}\text{Solve the equation}\,\frac{4}{x+3}+\frac{3}{x-2}=1\\ \frac{4}{x+3}+\frac{3}{x-2}=1\\ \frac{4(x-2)}{(x+3)(x-2)}+\frac{3\,(x+3)}{(x-2)(x+3)}=1\\ \frac{4(x-2)+3(x+3)}{(x+3)(x-2)}=\frac{1}{1}\\ 4(x-2)+3(x+3)=(x+3)(x-2)\\ 4x-8+3x+9=x^{2}-2x+3x-6\\ 7x+1=x^{2}+x-6\\ x^{2}-6x-7=0\\ (x-7)(x+1)=0\\ (x-7)=0\quad\text{or}\quad(x+1)=0\\ x=7\quad\text{or}\quad\quad x=-1\\ \end{array}\]

### N7.5 Solving Quadratic Equations Related Problems

Example: O level 2010 Paper 2 Question 6

John and Peter took part in a marathon race. They each ran 42 km.

**(a)**: John ran at a constant speed of \(x\) kilometres per hour. Write down an expression in terms of \(x\), for the number of hours he took.

**Number of hours John took = \(\frac{42}{x}\) hours**
**(b)**: Peter ran a constant speed which was \(\frac{1}{2}\) km/h less than John's speed. Write down an expression, in terms of \(x\), for the number of hours he took.

Speed of Peter = \(x-\frac{1}{2}\)

\(=\frac{2x-1}{2}\) km/h
**Note: Units used in this question**

**(c)**: The difference between their times was 10 minutes. Write down an expression in \(x\) to represent this information, and show that it reduces to \(2x^{2}-x-252=0\)

\(\frac{84}{2x-1}-\frac{42}{x}=\frac{10}{60}\)

**(d)**: Note: When doing speed related quadratic equations, determine who is faster and who is slower. The object that is faster will take a longer time. Thus, to find the difference between the times taken, always take the object take is slower to minus the object that is faster.

Take note of your units. The question can mix dollars and cents together; same goes for hours and minutes.

**(d)**: Solve the equation \(2x^{2}-x-252=0\), giving the answers correct to three decimal places.

\(\begin{array}{l}\mbox{a}=2,\mbox{b}=1,\mbox{c}=-252\\ \mbox{a}=\frac{-b\pm\sqrt{b^{2}-4ac}}{2a}\\ \mbox{x}=\frac{-(-1)\pm\sqrt{(-1)^{2}-4(2)(-252)}}{2(2)}\\ \mbox{ }=\frac{1\pm\sqrt{2017}}{4}\\ \mbox{x}=11.478\qquad\mbox{or}\qquad\mbox{x}=\mbox{-10.978}\,(3\mbox{ d.p})\end{array}\)

Written by: Lai Zhi Yin (2016) | Mobile: 9232 2940 | Website: bishantuition.com* Calculate the time that John took to complete the race, giving your answer in hours, minutes and seconds. Since speed cannot be negative, \(x=11.478\) Time taken for John to complete the race \(=\frac{42}{x}\) \(=\frac{42}{11.47776}\) \(=3.65925\) h \(=3\) h 39 min 33s

Example: O Level 2014 Paper 2 Question 8

Daniel went on a journey of 90 km.

* Daniel took \(x\) minutes to drive the first 40 km at a constant speed. Write down an expression, in terms of \(x\), for his speed in km/h for the first 40 km. \(\text{Speed}=\frac{Distance}{Time}\) \(=\frac{\frac{40}{x}}{60}\) \(=40\div\frac{x}{60}\) \(=40\times\frac{60}{x}\) \(=\frac{2400}{x}\) km/h
* It took Daniel (\(x+15\)) minutes to drive the rest of the distance at a different constant speed. Write down an expression, in terms of \(x\), for his speed in km/h for this part of the journey. Remaining distance = \(90-40\) \(=50\) km \(\text{Speed}=\frac{Distance}{Time}\) \(=\frac{50}{\frac{(x+15)}{60}}\) \(=50\div\frac{x+15}{60}\) \(=50\times\frac{60}{x+15}\) \(=50\times\frac{60}{x+15}\) \(=\frac{3000}{x+15}\) km/h

Written by: Lai Zhi Yin (2016) | Mobile: 9232 2940 | Website: bishantuition.com* Daniel's speed for the first part of the journey was 9 km/h faster than the second part. Write down an equation in \(x\) to represent this information and show that it reduces to \(3x^{2}+245x-12000=0\). \[\frac{2400}{x}-\frac{3000}{x+15}=9\] \[\frac{2400}{x(x+15)-3000x}{x(x+15)}=9\] \[2400x+36000-3000x=9(x^{2}+15x)\] \[-600x+36000=9x^{2}+135x\] \[9x^{2}+735x-36000=0\] \[3x^{2}+245x-12000=0\text{ (shown)}\]
* Solve the equation \(3x^{2}+245x-12000=0\), giving your solutions correct to 2 decimal places. a = 3, b = 245, c = -12000 \[x=\frac{-245\pm\sqrt{245^{2}-4(3)(-1200\ )}}{2(3)}\] \[x=\frac{-24\ \pm\sqrt{240425}}{2(3)}\] \[x=34.449\qquad\qquad\text{or $x=-116.115$}\] \[=34.45\text{ (2 d.p)}\qquad\text{or $x=-116.12$ (2 d.p)}\]
* Calculate Daniel's average speed, in km/h, for the whole journey. Since \(x>0\), \(x=34.449\) min, Average speed for the whole journey \[=\frac{Total\ distance}{Total\ time}\] \[=\frac{90}{\frac{x}{60}+\frac{x+15}{60}}\] \[=90+\frac{2x+15}{60}\] \[=90\ x\frac{60}{2x+15}\] \[=\frac{5400}{2x+15}\] When \(x=34.449\), Average speed \[=\frac{5400}{2\ (34.449)+15}\] \[=64.3647\text{ km/h}\] \[=64.4\text{ km/h (3 s.f.)}\]

### **N8. Set Language and Notation**

**N8.1 Definitions of Set Language and Notation**

\begin{tabular}{|p{142.3pt}|p{142.3pt}|} \hline \(\mathcal{E}\) & Universal set \\ \hline \(\in\) & is an element of \\ \hline \(\notin\) & is not an element of \\ \hline A' & Complement of set A \\ \hline n(A) & Number of elements in set A \\ \hline \(\emptyset\) or \(\{\}\) & Empty or null set \\ \hline \(\subseteq\) & is a subset of \\ \hline \(\notin\) & is not a subset of \\ \hline \(\subset\) & is a proper subset of \\ \hline \(\not\subseteq\) & is not a proper subset of \\ \hline \(\cup\) & Union of A and B \\ \hline \(\cap\) & Intersection of A and B \\ \hline \end{tabular}

A set is a collection of objects. A set can be set to defined specific items required. Example: A = \(\{x\colon x\) is a prime number from \(1<x<20\}\)

The **universal set**, denoted by \(\mathcal{E}\) is the set that contains all elements being considered in a given discussion

\(\mathcal{E}\) = \(\{x\colon x\) is a prime number from \(1<x<20\}\)

\(\mathcal{E}\) = \(\{2\), \(3\), \(5\), \(7\), \(11\), \(13\), \(17\), \(19\}\)

An **element** of a set denoted by the symbol \(\in\) means that it is an object that belongs to the set. For the example above, \(2\) is an element of A or \(2\in\) A. If the object does not belong to the set, we say that it is **not the element** of the set, which is denoted by the symbol \(\notin\). In the above example, \(6\) is not an element of A or \(6\notin\) A.

**A'** is the **complement** of the A. It is the numbers in the universal set that is not in A. In the above example, A' = \(\{4\), \(6\), \(8\), \(9\), \(10\), \(12\), \(14\), \(15\), \(16\), \(18\}\)

An **empty set** or a null set is a set containing no elements. It is denoted by \(\emptyset\) or \(\{\}\). Example A = \(\{x\colon x\) is an even prime number from \(5<x<20\}\). Since none of the numbers are able to fulfil the requirements, A = \(\emptyset\). Note: It is WRONG to write \(\{\emptyset\}\).

Written by: Lai Zhi Yin (2016) | Mobile: 9232 2940 | Website: bishantuition.comIf every element of a set A is also an element of a set B, then A is the **subset** of B, which is denoted by A \(\subseteq\) B. In short, it is A has some or all of the elements that can be found in B. Example: If we have the set B = {2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19}. Possible subsets (A) will be {2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19} (equal set), {2, 3, 5}, {13, 17}, {11}, \(\emptyset\) etc. An equal set can also be a subset of B. If A is **not the subset of B** denoted by A \(\not\subseteq\) B, it contains elements that cannot be found in B. Examples of A \(\not\subseteq\) B is A = {1, 2, 3}. Since 1 is not part of B, A \(\not\subseteq\) B.

Set A is a **proper subset** of B if every element of set A is also an element of set B and set B has more elements than set A (they are not equal). In short, A has only some of the elements that can be found in B. We write A \(\subset\) B to denote A is a proper subset of B. Example: A = {1, 2, 3} and B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}. Since all the elements of A are present in B, it is said that A \(\subset\) B.

### N9. Matrices (Not Tested in N Level)

#### N9.1.1 Order of Matrices

The order of the Matrices is written as a x b, where a denotes the number of rows while b denotes the number of columns.

#### N9.2.1 N9.2 Addition and Subtraction of Matrices

\[\begin{bmatrix}\text{a}&\text{b}\\ \text{c}&\text{d}\end{bmatrix}+\begin{bmatrix}\text{e}&\text{f}\\ \text{g}&\text{h}\end{bmatrix}=\begin{bmatrix}\text{a}+\text{e}&\text{b}+ \text{f}\\ \text{c}+\text{g}&\text{d}+\text{h}\end{bmatrix}\] \[\begin{bmatrix}\text{a}&\text{b}\\ \text{c}&\text{d}\end{bmatrix}-\begin{bmatrix}\text{e}&\text{f}\\ \text{g}&\text{h}\end{bmatrix}=\begin{bmatrix}\text{a}-\text{e}&\text{b}- \text{f}\\ \text{c}-\text{g}&\text{d}-\text{h}\end{bmatrix}\]

#### N9.3 Multiplication of Matrices

\[\begin{bmatrix}\text{b}\\ \text{c}\end{bmatrix}=\begin{bmatrix}\text{ab}\\ \text{ac}\\ \text{ad}\end{bmatrix}\]

When multiplying matrices together, the order of the matrices plays an important role. For example, when multiplying two matrices of order 2 x 3 and 3 x 1 together,

\[\begin{array}{c}\text{2 x 3 and 3 x 1}\end{array}\]

The numbers in purple must be the same before can multiply the matrices together. The numbers in blue will determine the order of the final matrix. In this case the order of the final matrix is 2 x 1. The multiplying of the matrices always goes from left to right, then up to down.

\[\begin{array}{c}\text{Example:}\begin{bmatrix}\text{a}&\text{b}\\ \text{c}&\text{d}\end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}\text{e}&\text{f}\\ \text{g}&\text{h}\end{bmatrix}=\begin{bmatrix}\text{ae}+\text{bg}&\text{af}+ \text{bh}\\ \text{ce}+\text{dg}&\text{cf}+\text{dh}\end{bmatrix}\\ \text{(2 x 2) (2 x 2)}&\text{(2 x 2)}\end{array}\]

In Switzerland, the exchange rate is 1 Swiss Franc = 1.294 Singapore Dollars

Hasim wants to change 500 Singapore Dollars into Swiss Francs. How many more Swiss

Francs will he get by changing his money in Switzerland?

SGD $1 = 0.765 Swiss Francs

SGD $500 = 382.50 Swiss Francs

1 Swiss Franc = $1.294 SGD = 1 Swiss Franc

1 SGD = \(\frac{1}{1.294}\) Swiss Franc

$500 SGD = \(\frac{1}{1.294}\) x 500 Swiss Franc

 = 386.40 Swiss Franc (2 d.p.)

Amount of money he will get more = 386.40 - 382.50

 = 3.90 Swiss Francs

Example: O Level 2012 Paper 2 Question 4 (a)

One day the exchange rate between pounds (\(\boldsymbol{\upvarepsilon}\)) and Singapore dollars (\(\boldsymbol{\upvarepsilon}\)) was \(\boldsymbol{\upvarepsilon}\)1 = $2.10. On the same day, the exchange rate between euros (\(\boldsymbol{\upvarepsilon}\)) and pounds was \(\boldsymbol{\upvarepsilon}\)1 = \(\boldsymbol{\upvarepsilon}\)0.93.

a) Ann changed \(\boldsymbol{\upvarepsilon}\)200 into Singapore dollars. Calculate how many dollars she received.

\(\boldsymbol{\upvarepsilon}\)1 = $2.10

\(\boldsymbol{\upvarepsilon}\)200 = $420

b) Bill converted $500 into euros. Calculate how many euros he received, correct to the nearest euro.

\(\boldsymbol{\upvarepsilon}\)1 = $2.10

\(\boldsymbol{\upvarepsilon}\)2.10 = \(\boldsymbol{\upvarepsilon}\)1

\(\boldsymbol{\upvarepsilon}\)1 = \(\boldsymbol{\upvarepsilon}\)1

\(\boldsymbol{\upvarepsilon}\)238.095 = \(\boldsymbol{\upvarepsilon}\)1

\(\boldsymbol{\upvarepsilon}\)256 (nearest euros)

#### N10.4 Hire Purchase

Example: O level 2014 Paper 1 Question 11

The cash price of a washing machine is $980. The hire purchase price of the washing machine is $1089. The hire purchase price is a deposit of 15% of the cash price plus 12 equal monthly payments.

Calculate one monthly payment.

**Deposit = \(\frac{15}{100}\) x $980**

= $147

Remaining amount = $1089 - $147

= $942

Monthly payment = \(\frac{942}{12}\)

= $78.50

Example: Xiao Ming borrowed a sum of money from the bank. He is due to repay the bank with interest of an amount totalling to $15079.23 within a year. Given that his LAST instalment is $1255.75, how much was his monthly instalments?

**Monthly instalment = \(\frac{15079.23}{12-1}\).75**

= $1256.68

Note: When dealing with money, it can only involves 2 decimal places. That is why for this question, it cannot be 15079.23 + 12 as it will give an answer of 4 decimal places.

### N10.5 Taxation

When doing questions on tax, always determine the chargeable income first.

#### Chargeable income = Total income - Total relief

Example: CASCO 3B Revised Edition (2010) Page 259 Question 32

Mr Ng earns $3250 a month. He has two children and a wife to support. He donates 2% of his monthly salary to charitable organisations. He contributes $7800 towards CPF, pay $600 personal life insurance. Calculate the amount of tax Mr Ng has to pay if he is entitled to the following reliefs: Personal $3000; wife $2000; children, $2000 each

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|} \hline
**Chargeable Income (S)** & **Tax Rate (\%)** & **Tax Payable (\$)** \\ \hline On the first 20 000 & 0 & 0 \\ On the next 10 000 & 3.50 & 350 \\ \hline On the first 30 000 & & 350 \\ On the next 10 000 & 5.50 & 550 \\ \hline \end{tabular}

Annual income = 3250 x 12

= $39 000

Total reliefs = (\(\frac{2}{100}\) x 39000) + 7800 + 600 + 3000 + 2(2000) + 2000

= $18 180

Annual chargeable income = 39000 - 18180

= $20 820

Since first $20000 is tax free,

\begin{tabular}{l} Tax = \(\frac{3.5}{100}\) x (20820 - 20000) \\ = $28.70 \\ \end{tabular}

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:67]

\(\frac{7304.5-x}{x}\) x 100% = 27.6%

\(\frac{7304.5-x}{x}\) = 0.276\(x\)

\(7304.5-x\) = 0.276\(x\)

\(1.276x\) = 7304.5

\(x\) = 5725 GWh (nearest GWh)

_ALTERNATIVE WORKINGS_

### Distance-Time Graph Involving Constant Acceleration

In a distance-time graph, the speed of the graph can be determined by drawing a tangent line since it involves a curve (constant acceleration).

### Conversion of Distance-Time Graph to Speed-Time Graph

For part A of the graph, since the object is travelling at a constant acceleration, the straight line will have a positive gradient. For part B of the graph, since the object is travelling at constant speed, it will be a horizontal line. For part C of the graph, since the object is retarding constantly, a negative gradient is formed.

#### Word Problems Involving Distance-Time Graphs

### Speed-Time Graph

In a speed-time graph, the acceleration of the graph can be determined by finding the gradient of the curve. The distance can be determined by finding the area under the curve.

### Conversion of Speed-Time Graph to Distance-Time Graph

Since part A of the speed-time graph shows constant acceleration, it will be a slow to fast curve on the distance-time graph. Since part B of the speed-time graph shows constant speed, it will be a linear line on the distance-time graph. Since part C of the speed-time graph shows constant retardation, it will be a fast to slow curve on the distance-time graph.

### Distance (m)

### Elementary Mathematics Notes

#### Word Problem Involving Speed-Time Graph

Example: Modified from O Level 2013 Paper 1 Question 24

The diagram shows the speed-time graph for a car journey between two road junctions.

(a) Calculate the acceleration of the car after 5 seconds. Shown in purple.

Acceleration = 0 m/s\({}^{2}\)

(c) Calculate the retardation when t = 30. Shown in grey.

Gradient = \(\frac{16-0}{20-35}\)

= -1.07 m/s\({}^{2}\)(3 s.f.)

\(\therefore\) Retardation = 1.07 m/s\({}^{2}\)

Note: If retardation is written as -1.07 m/s\({}^{2}\), the answer will be wrong as retardation

means negative gradient.

(d) Calculate the total distance travelled between the two road junctions.

Total distance = \(\frac{1}{2}\) x [(20 - 10) + 35] x 16

= 360 m

(e) Calculate the average speed for the whole journey.

Average speed = \(\frac{360}{35}\)

= 10.3 m/s

G2. Congruency and Similarity

G2.1 Enlargement and Reduction of Plane Figure by Scale Factor

Enlargement and reduction of plane figure by scale factor always involve multiplication and division of an integer or fraction. When multiplied by an integer, figure will become bigger. When multiplied by a fraction whereby the numerator is smaller than the denominator, the figure will become smaller. When multiplied by a fraction whereby the denominator is smaller than the numerator, the figure will become bigger. Scale factor is never negative.

Example: N Level 2012 Paper 1 Question 14

Note: Angle does not change even when the size of the figure is changed

### Elementary Mathematics Notes

Example: N Level 2013 Paper 1 Question 6

Enlarge the shaded figure in the grid below by scale factor 3 and draw the enlarged figure within the grid. Answer is shown in pink.

### G2.2 Determining if Two Triangles are Congruent

For two triangles to be congruent, they need to be of the same size and shape. It also means that their corresponding angles are equal and their corresponding sides are equal. The order on how the triangles are written is very important. For example when \(\Delta\)ABC is congruent to \(\Delta\)XYZ, \(\angle\)A must correspond to \(\angle\)X, \(\angle\)B must correspond to \(\angle\)Y and \(\angle\)C must correspond to \(\angle\)Z.

Test for Congruency Between Two Triangles

SSS: Two triangles are congruent if the three sides of one triangle are equal to each other.

SAS: Two triangles are congruent if two sides and the included angle of one triangle are equal to each other

AAS: Two triangles are congruent if two angles and a side of one triangle are equal to each other

ASA: Two triangles are congruent if two angles and the included side of one triangle are equal to one another

RHS: Two triangles are congruent if the hypotenuse and one side of one right angled triangle are equal to one another.

Note: AAA cannot be used to prove for congruent triangles as it is possible for similar triangles to be proven by AAA similarity.

### G2.3 Determining if Two Triangles are Similar

For two triangles to be similar, they need to be of the same shape, but they do not need to be of the same size. If the two triangles are similar, their corresponding angles are equal and their corresponding sides are in the same ratio. The order on how the triangles are written is very important. For example when \(\Delta\)ABC is similar to \(\Delta\)XYZ, \(\angle\)A must correspond to \(\angle\)X, \(\angle\)B must correspond to \(\angle\)Y and \(\angle\)C must correspond to \(\angle\)Z.

Test for Similarity Between Two Triangles

AA: Two triangles are similar if two of the angles are equal

SSS: Two triangle are similar if all three corresponding sides has the same ratio

SAS: Two triangles are similar if two of their sides are proportional and the included angle is equal.

Note: Two reasons are usually sufficient to prove that both triangles are similar. However, if three reasons can be derived, it is better to state all 3 reasons.

Example: N level 2011 Paper 2 Question 2

(a) Explain why angle BAN = angle CAN

\(\angle\)BAC = \(\angle\)ANB = 90\({}^{\circ}\) (Given)

\(\angle\)BAN + \(\angle\)CAN = 90\({}^{\circ}\)

\(\angle\)ACN + \(\angle\)CAN = 90\({}^{\circ}\)

Therefore, \(\angle\)BAN is equal to \(\angle\)CAN. (b) Triangles BAN and CAN are similar. BN = 9 cm and NC = 4 cm. Calculate the length of AN. Show your working.

By similar triangles,

\(\frac{BN}{AN}=\frac{AN}{CN}\)

\(\frac{9}{AN}=\frac{AN}{4}\)

AN\({}^{2}=36\)

AN = 6 cm or AN = - 6 (rejected since length cannot be negative)

Note: It is possible to have the same naming even when two different triangles are involved. Check order if not convinced.

8 CD = 144

CD = 18 cm

(b) Calculate AD.

By similar triangles,

\(\frac{XB}{XD}=\frac{AX}{CX}\)

\(\frac{6}{XD}=\frac{8}{12}\)

72 = 8 XD

XD = 9 cm

AD = 8 + 9

= 17 cm

(c) The area of triangle ABX is 21.3 cm\({}^{2}\). Calculate the area of triangle CDX.

By similar triangles,

\(Area\) of \(\frac{ABX}{Area\) of \(\frac{ABX}{CDX}=(\frac{8}{12})^{2}\)

\(\frac{21.3}{Area\) of \(\frac{4}{CDX}=\frac{4}{9}\)

**G4. Pythagoras' Theorem and Trigonometry**

**G4.1 Pythagoras Theorem**

Pythagoras theorem is used to determine the length of one side of the triangle when given 2 other sides. It is used for right angled triangle only. The hypotenuse of the triangle is the longest side of the triangle. It is also the side of the triangle that is opposite the right angle.

Note: Should the question ask you to prove that the triangle is right angled, start off with: by the CONVERSE of Pythagoras theorem. You cannot start off with by Pythagoras Theorem as the triangle has not been proven to be right angled.

**G4.2 TOA CAH SOH**

This method is used for right angled triangle only. The hypotenuse of the triangle will always be the one opposite the right angle of the triangle and thus it will never change. The adjacent and opposite sides of the triangle must always be done with reference to the angle of interest. TOA CAH SOH is always required for questions on angles of elevation and depression.

Note: If question state to find sin \(\angle\)ABC, do not find the actual angle. Leave the answer in fraction form.

### G4.4 Sine Rule and Cosine Rule

Sine Rule

\[\frac{a}{sin\,A}=\frac{b}{sin\,B}\]

The small letters represents the length and the capital letters represent the angles.

The length of the non-right angled triangle must always be opposite to the angle. For sine rule, it is used to determine the side if given 2 sides and 1 angle or if you are given 2 sides and tasked to find an angle. Total minimum number of sides and angles including unknown required to use this rule is 2 sides and 2 angles.

### Cosine Rule

\[\text{a}^{2}=\text{b}^{2}+\text{c}^{2}-2\text{bc}\text{cos}\text{A}\]

The length of the non-right angled triangle must always be opposite to the angle. For cosine rule, it is used to determine the side when given 3 angles or it is used when you are tasked to find one angle, given 2 sides. Total minimum number of sides and angles including unknown required to use this rule is 3 sides and 1 angle.

When doing trigonometric questions, note that the shortest distance is the perpendicular distance. Other common rules to note is that the angle of elevation is equal to the angle of depression. If a triangle is isosceles or equilateral, the perpendicular from the centre bisects the chord and angle. If the triangle is neither isosceles nor equilateral, do not assume.

Example: O level 2014 Paper 1 Question 4

The sine of an angle is 0.720. Give two possible values for the angle

\(\mathbf{sin\theta}=\mathbf{0.720}\)

\(\mathbf{\theta}=\sin^{\perp}\mathbf{0.720}\)

\(\mathbf{=46.05^{o}}\) (4 s.f.) or \(\mathbf{\theta}=\mathbf{180^{o}}-\mathbf{46.05^{o}}\)

\(\mathbf{=46.1^{o}}\) (1 d.p) \(\mathbf{=133.9^{o}}\) (1 d.p.)

Example: N Level 2012 Paper 1 Question 24

(a) Show that BCD is a right angled triangle.

By the converse of Pythagoras theorem,

\(\mathrm{CD}^{2}+\mathrm{BC}^{2}\)

\(\mathbf{=96^{2}+28^{2}}\)

\(\mathbf{=100^{2}}\)

\(\mathbf{=BD^{2}}\)

Therefore, BCD is a right angled triangle.

(b) Find \(\angle\)CDB.

\(\mathbf{\sin\angle}\)CDB \(\mathbf{=\frac{28}{100}}\)

The diagram shows a company logo, ABCD, in the shape of a trapezium with AB parallel to DC. AB = 62 mm, CD = 55 mm, angle BAD = 34\({}^{\circ}\) and angle BDC = 41\({}^{\circ}\).

(a) Calculate angle ADB

\(\angle\)ABD = 41\({}^{\circ}\) (alt \(\angle\), AB //DC)

\(\angle\)ADB = 180\({}^{\circ}-34^{\circ}-41^{\circ}\)

\(=105^{\circ}\) (\(\angle\) sum of \(\Delta\))

(b) Calculate length BD

By sine rule,

\(\frac{AB}{sin\angle ADB}=\frac{BD}{sin\angle BAD}\)

\(\frac{62}{sin\circ 105}=\frac{BD}{sin\,34}\)

\(62\)Sin34 = BD Sin105

BD = \(\frac{62sin34}{sin\,105}\)

= 35.89 mm (4 s.f.)

= 35.9 mm (3 s.f.)

(c) Calculate the area of trapezium ABCD

Area of trapezium = \(\{\frac{1}{2}\,\mathrm{x}\,62\,\mathrm{x}\,35.89\,\mathrm{x}\,\mathrm{sin}\,41 \}+\{\frac{1}{2}\,\mathrm{x}\,55\,\mathrm{x}\,35.89\,\mathrm{x}\,\mathrm{ sin}\,41\}\)

= 1377.44 mm\({}^{2}\,\mathrm{(6\,\mathrm{s.f.})}\)

= 1380 mm\({}^{2}\,\mathrm{(6\,\mathrm{s.f.})}\)

Note: Since height of the trapezium cannot be determined in this question, the area of the trapezium can be found by finding the area of the two triangles and totalling them together.

cos \(\angle\)AMB = \(\frac{-77.5825}{-98.72}\)

\(\angle\)AMB = cos\({}^{1-77.5825}\)

### Elementary Mathematics Notes

Example: N Level 2008 Paper 1 Question 16

In the diagram, BC = 5 cm, CD = 12 cm, BD = 13 cm and ABC is a straight line.

By the converse of Pythagoras theorem,

BC\({}^{2}\) + CD\({}^{2}\)

= 5\({}^{2}\) + 12\({}^{2}\)

= 25 + 144

= 169

= 13\({}^{2}\)

= BD\({}^{2}\)

Therefore, angle BCD is a right angle.

(b) Express tan \(\angle\)BDC as a fraction

tan \(\angle\)BDC = \(\frac{BC}{CD}\)

= \(\frac{5}{12}\)

Note: Differentiate between tan \(\angle\)BDC and ZBDC. If the question requires tan \(\angle\)BDC, the answer is usually in fraction. If the question requires \(\angle\)BDC, the actual angle corrected to 1 decimal place is required

### G4.6 Bearings

Example: O Level 2011 Paper 2 Question 6

The base, L, of a lighthouse is at sea level. Yatch A is 250 m from L. Yatch B is 400 m due west of Yatch A. Angle LAB = 65\({}^{\circ}\).

**Note:** If Yatch B is due west of Yatch A, it means that A and B lies on a straight line.

[MISSING_PAGE_POST]

 = 52.412o (\(\angle\) sum of \(\Delta\))

Bearing of B from L = 52.412o + 180o

 = 232.4o (1 d.p.)
* (e) The angle of elevation of the top of the lighthouse seen from A is 7o. Calculate the angle of elevation of the top of the lighthouse from B.

 Let h be the height of the lighthouse.

 \(\tan\) 7 = \(\frac{h}{250}\)

 h = 250 tan7

 = 30.696 m (5 s.f.)

 Let \(\theta\) be the angle of elevation of the top of the lighthouse from B.

 \(\tan\) \(\theta\) = \(\frac{h}{BL}\)

 = \(\frac{30.696}{371}\)

 = 4.728o (4 s.f.)

 = 4.7o (1 d.p.)

 Note: Angle of elevation and angle of depression questions always involve right angle triangle.

Area of square = length x length

= \(P\)

Rectangle

Breadth

Length

Perimeter of rectangle = (2 x length) + (2 x breadth)

= 2/ + 2b

Area of rectangle = length x breadth

Volume of Solids

General formula for volume of solid figures = base area x height

General formula for volume of solid figures with pointed end =\(\frac{1}{3}\) x base area x height

Cube

Volume of cube = \(l\) x \(l\) x \(l\)

Surface area of cube = 6 x \(l\) x \(l\)

Cuboid

Volume of cuboid = length x breadth x height

= \(l\) x b x h

Surface area of cuboid = 2(length x base) + 2(length x height) + 2(height x base)

Pyramid

Volume of pyramid =\(\frac{1}{3}\) x base area x height

Surface area of pyramid with square base

(a) Calculate the angle AOB in radians.

Let the angle AOB be \(\theta\)

Perimeter = 50\(\theta\) + 20\(\theta\) + 30 + 30

235 = 70 \(\theta\) + 60

70\(\theta\) = 135

#### Calculation of Frustum

Example: O Level 2011 Paper 2 Q7 (b)

The diagram shows a pot which is part of a circular cone of height 120 cm. The open end of the pot is a circle of radius 36 cm. The base of the pot is a circle of radius 24 cm. The height of the pot is 40 cm. The slant height of the pot is \(x\) cm. [You may ignore any holes in the base of the pot.]

(a) Show that \(x=41.8\), correct to 3 significant figures.

By Pythagoras theorem,

\(y^{2}=24^{2}+80^{2}\)

\(=\sqrt{24^{2}+80^{2}}\)

\(=83.52\) cm (4 s.f.)

\(z^{2}=36^{2}+(40+80)^{2}\)

\(z^{2}=15696\)

\(z=\sqrt{15969}\)

\(z=125.28\) cm (5 s.f.)

\(x=125.28-83.52\)

\(=41.8\) cm (3 s.f.) (Shown)

(b) Calculate the total surface area of the outside of the pot.

Curved surface area = r(36)(125.28) - r(24)(83.52)

= 7871.6 cm\({}^{2}\) (5 s.f.)

Area of circle = r(24)\({}^{2}\)

= 1809.6 cm\({}^{2}\) (5 s.f.)

Total surface area = 7871.6 + 1809.6

= 9680 cm\({}^{2}\) (3 s.f.)

Note: In order to determine the curve surface area of frustum, take curved surface area

of big cone - curve surface area of small cone. There is no formula for direct

determination of frustum.

The cross section of a gold pendant is a quadrilateral with two right angles and a circular hole, as shown. All measurements are in centimetres.

The diameter of the circular hole is 0.8 cm. The uniform thickness of the pendant is 0.3 cm. The mass of 1 cubic centimetre of gold is 19.3 grams. The price of 1 gram of the gold is $69.65. Calculate the value of the gold in the pendant. Give your answer to the nearest cent.

Note: Cut the diagram in half to get 2 congruent triangles

Area of the pendant = (2 x \(\frac{1}{2}\) x base x height) \(-\pi r^{2}\)

\(=(2\times\frac{1}{2}\) x 2.1 x 1) \(-\pi(\frac{0.8}{2})^{2}\)

\(=(2.1-0.16\pi)\)

\(=1.597\) cm\({}^{2}\) (4 s.f.)

Volume of the pendant = base area x height

\(=1.597\times 0.3\)

\(=0.4792\) cm\({}^{3}\)

\(1\) cm\({}^{3}\) = 19.3 x 0.4792 cm\({}^{3}\) = 19.3 x 0.4792

Substitute \(x=8\) into y = \(6-x\),

y = \(6-8\)

= -2

:. A (8, -2)

Substitute \(x=8\) into \(2\)y = \(3x+2\),

\(2\)y = \(3(8)+2\)

(b) Find the gradient of the line y = \(6-x\).

y = m\(x+c\)

y = -\(x+c\)

Therefore, gradient of the line is -1.

(c) The point (0, k) is the same distance from A as it is from B. Find the value of k.

Length of A from point = Length of B from point

\(\sqrt{(0\ -8)^{2}\ +\ (k-(-2))^{2}}=\sqrt{(0\ -8)^{2}+(k\ -13)^{2}}\)

\(=1237\)

Standard deviation = \(\sqrt{\frac{1237}{30}-6.3^{2}}\)

\(=1.24\) (3 s.f.)

### Elementary Mathematics Notes

Example: O Level 2014 Paper 1 Question 5

Alyssa wants to find out how much time students spend on the Internet. She uses this question as a questionnaire.

How many hours do you spend on the Internet? Tick one box

List two things wrong with this question.

1. Time limit such as per day, per week or per month is not set
2. The intervals for the number of hours spent are not continuous.
3. Duration of each option is not constant.

### Pie Chart

Formula to determine angle representing sector = \(\frac{sector\;required}{total}\) x 360\({}^{\circ}\)

Formula to calculate number of subjects given angle = \(\frac{angle\;given}{360}\) x total number of subjects

Example: N Level 2012 Paper 1 Question 15

The pie chart represents the time Brian spent swimming, cycling and playing badminton one week. The total time he spent on these three sports that week was 15 hours. The angle representing the time spent swimming is 140\({}^{\circ}\).

**(a)**: That week Brian spent 7 hours cycling. Calculate the angle of the sector representing cycling.

**Angle of the sector = \(\frac{7}{15}\) x 360\({}^{\circ}\)**

= 168\({}^{\circ}\)
**(b)**: On each of the seven days of the week, Brian spent the same amount of time swimming.

How many minutes did he spend swimming each day?

Amount of time spent swimming = \(\frac{140}{360}\) x 15

= \(5\frac{5}{6}\) hours

= 5 hours 50 min

= 350 min

Amount of time spent swimming each day = 350 \(\div\) 7

= 50 min

### 51.3 Pictogram

When doing question on pictogram, take note how many objects does each shape represents

Example: N Level 2013 Paper 1 Question 4

The pictogram represents the survey of the colour of each of the cars in a carpark

(a) How many cars are there in the car park?

Total number of cars = (3.5 x 2) + (5 x 2) + (6 x 2) + (3.5 x 2) + (4 x 2) + (4.5 x 2)

= 52

(b) How many more silver cars are there than white cars?

Number of silver cars = 6 x 2

= 12

Number of white cars = 3.5 x2

= 7

Difference = 12 - 7

= 5

### **S1.4 Bar Graph**

Example: O Level 2008 Paper 1 Question 2

In a survey, 48 children were asked how they travelled to school. The results of the survey are shown in the bar chart.

**(a)**: Express the total number of children who walked or cycled as a fraction of the total number of children. Give your answer in its lowest terms.

**Fraction = \(\frac{\textbf{30}+\textbf{12}}{6+30+}\)**

\(=\frac{7}{8}\)
**(b)**: The same information is to be shown in a pie chart. Find the angle which represents the children who travelled by car.

Angle representing the children who travelled by car = \(\frac{6}{48}\) x 360\({}^{\text{o}}\)

\(=45^{\text{o}}\)

### $1.6 Line Graph

Example: N Level 2014 Paper 1 Question 9

Two companies, A and B carry out household plumbing repairs. The graph below is used by company A to work out the cost of a job.

(a) Find the cost for a job by company A that takes 4 hours. Shown in blue.

Cost for the job = $185

(b) Company B charges a basic cost of $75 for the first two hours plus a fixed rate of $20 per hour thereafter. On the grid, draw a graph to show the charges made by company B for jobs of up to 5 hours. Shown in purple on the graph.

Note: Basic cost is read from the y-intercept. Fixed rate per hour is determined by the gradient of the line.

(c) Which company is cheaper for a job taking 3 hours and by how much? Company A is shown in green while Company B is shown in orange on the graph.

Difference = $145 - $95

= $50

: Company B is cheaper for a job taking 3 hours by $50.

### 51.8 Dot Diagram

Example: N level 2014 Paper 1 Question 18

Note: When counting the dots for the position of the median, be careful of the direction.

(a) Find the median mass for the males.

Position of the median = \(\frac{20+1}{2}\)

= 10.5th position

Median mass for the males = \(\frac{58+58}{2}\)

= 58 kg

(b) Find the median mass for the females.

Position of the median = \(\frac{20+1}{2}\)

= 10.5th position

Median mass for the females = \(\frac{51+52}{2}\)

= 51.5 kg

(c) Write down two comments comparing the masses of the male students and the female students.

1. Majority of the male students are heavier than the female students.

2. The median mass of 59.3 kg for the male students is heavier than the median mass for the females of 52.5 kg.

### $1.9 Stem and Leaf Diagram

Example: O Level 2010 Paper 1 Question 18

(a) Write down the mode of the boy's marks

**Mode = 75 marks**

(b) Write down the median of the girl's marks.

**Median position of the girl's mark = \(\frac{15+1}{2}\)**

= \(8^{\text{th}}\) position

Median = 69

(c) Explain briefly whether the boys or the girls performed better in the test.

Median position of the boy's mark = \(\frac{20+1}{2}\)

= \(10.5^{\text{th}}\) position

Median of the boy's mark = \(\frac{61+65}{2}\)

= \(63\)

Since the median of the girls' marks is higher than the boys, the girls performed better in the test.

### Elementary Mathematics Notes

#### Example: N level 2013 Paper 2 Question 12 (a)

The speeds in km/h, of 160 cars travelling along a road were measured. The cumulative frequency graph summaries the results.

Written by: Lai Zhi Yin (2016) | Mobile: 9232 2940 | Website: bishantuition.com- 126 = 34 Percentage of cars that were travelling faster than 60 km/h = \(\frac{34}{160}\) x 100% = 21.25% Note: Any numbers that is read off the graph is 'less than'. To find'more than', take the total number from the cumulative frequency to minus off what was found.

### Elementary Mathematics Notes

#### Example: O Level 2008 Paper 2 Question 10

The total mass of the tomatoes produced by each of 40 tomato plants was measured. The cumulative frequency curve below shows the distribution of the masses.

Note: To determine the frequency, example, \(4\leq x<8\), determine the frequency at x = 4 and x = 8. Find the difference in both the values.

## S2. Probability

### S2.1 Introduction of Probability

Probability is the chance that an event will occur. A probability of 0 means that the event will never occur while the probability of 1 means that the event will definitively occur, therefore the ranges of P is 0 \(\leq\) P \(\leq\)1.

Tree diagram and possibility diagrams are visual aids that helps to list out the possibilities of the events that may occur.

When the word 'or' is used in the question, the probabilities are added together. When the word 'and' is used in the question, the probabilities are multiplied together.

### S2.2 Problems Involving Probability

Example: O Level 2012 Paper 1 Question 3

A bag contains 10 red marbles, 5 blue marbles and 3 yellow marbles.

**(a)**: A marble is chosen at random and then replaced. What is the probability that it is a red marble?

P(red marble) = \(\frac{Number\;of\;red\;marbles}{Total\;number\;of\;marbles}\)

= \(\frac{10}{18}\)

= \(\frac{5}{9}\)
**(b)**: How many more blue marbles must be placed in the bag on that the probability of choosing a blue marble would be \(\frac{1}{2}\)?

Let \(x\) be the number of blue marbles

\(\frac{5+x}{18+x}=\frac{1}{2}\)

\(2(5+x)=18+x\)

\(10+2x=18+x\)

\(2x-x=18-10\)

\(x=8\)

Note: When blue marbles are added to the bag, the total number of marbles will increase as well.
