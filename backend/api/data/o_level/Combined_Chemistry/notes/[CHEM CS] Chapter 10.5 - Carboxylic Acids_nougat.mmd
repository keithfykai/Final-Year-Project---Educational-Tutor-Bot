## PHYSICAL PROPERTIES

\begin{tabular}{|p{142.3pt}|p{142.3pt}|} \hline Expected frequency & Reporting \\ \hline \hline  & As the number of carbon atoms in the carboxylic acids increases, the melting and boiling points of carboxylic acids increases as well. \\ \hline \multirow{3}{*}{**Melting and boiling points**} & As the number of carbon atoms in a carboxylic acid increases, the size of the molecules are bigger and have stronger intermolecular forces of attraction between each other. As such, more heat energy is needed to overcome the intermolecular forces of attraction between the carboxylic acid molecules. Hence, larger carboxylic acid containing more carbon atoms will have higher melting and boiling points. \\ \hline \multirow{3}{*}{**Volatility**} & As the number of carbon atoms in the carboxylic acid increases, the volatility of carboxylic acid decreases. \\ \cline{2-2}  & (similar to m.p. \& b.p.) \\ \cline{2-2}  & **With a higher relative molecular mass, there would be stronger intermolecular forces of attraction between the carboxylic acid molecules. As such, more heat energy is needed to overcome the intermolecular forces of attraction between the carboxylic acid molecules.** \\ \hline \multirow{2}{*}{**Density**} & As the number of carbon atoms in the carboxylic acid increases, the density of carboxylic acid increases. \\ \cline{2-2}  & As the number of carbon atoms in the carboxylic acid increases, the viscosity of carboxylic acid decreases. \\ \cline{2-2} Viscosity & (more difficult to flow) \\ \cline{2-2}  & Carboxylic acids with longer hydrocarbon chains flow less easily as they tend to get stuck together. \\ \hline \multirow{3}{*}{**Flammability**} & As the number of carbon atoms in the carboxylic acid increases, the flammability of alcohols decreases. (more difficult to burn) \\ \cline{2-2}  & **Solubility** & Carboxylic acids are **soluble in water, but as the number of carbon atoms increases, solubility in water decreases. \\ \hline \end{tabular}
