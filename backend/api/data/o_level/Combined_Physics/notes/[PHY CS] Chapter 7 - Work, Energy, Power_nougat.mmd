Work done is defined as the product of the force and the distance moved in the direction of the force.

Units: Joule (J) or Nm

_Formula:_

Work done can also be understood as the amount of energy that has been converted from one form to another or transferred from one body to another.

Work done & energy has the same units, Joules (J).

The best way to understand their relationship is:

_"We use energy to get work done"_

For the box to move up the slope, there is work done to overcome friction.

Work done against friction = F x d = 3N x 5m =15 ]

The box also gained gravitational potential energy. This gain in energy is also work done as somebody had to exert energy to move the box to its new position.

Gain in GPE = mgh = 1 x 10 x 3 = 30
