## 1 Introduction

Gravitational force is a force that is evident in our everyday lives and plays a crucial role in many processes on Earth. For instance, the ocean tides are caused by the gravitational attraction of both the Moon and Sun on the Earth's oceans. The falling of objects when released is also caused by the gravitational pull of the Earth on all objects. In terms of planetary motion, gravitational force is responsible for keeping the Earth in its orbit around the Sun, which in turn gives rise to four seasons in some countries, as Earth's tilted axis always points in the same direction when it orbits the Sun.

_(c)_ _recall and use Newton's law of gravitation in the form_ \(F=\frac{Gm_{1}m_{2}}{r^{2}}\)__

## 2 Gravitational force acting between two point masses \(m_{1}\) and \(m_{2}\) with separation \(r\)

**Newton's law of gravitation** states that the gravitational force of attraction between two _point masses_ is directly proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the separation between their centres.

This means that if there are two point masses \(m_{1}\) and \(m_{2}\) and they are separated by distance \(r\), the magnitude of the gravitational force attracting them to each other is

where \(G\) = 6.67 \(\times\) 10\({}^{-11}\) N m\({}^{2}\) kg\({}^{-2}\), which is the constant of proportionality known as _gravitational constant_ (provided in Data list).

**Note:**

(1)_Point masses_ have non-zero mass and no volume. If two objects are placed sufficiently far apart such that their dimensions become negligible compared to the distance separating them, the two objects can be considered point masses.

(2) The gravitational forces between two masses are equal and opposite and constitute an action and reaction pair of forces (Newton's 3\({}^{st}\) Law). The forces **always act along the line** joining the two point masses. To show its **attractive nature**, it is written (with negative sign) as:

The negative sign is ignored when only the magnitude of the force is required.

**Example 1** (Use of Formula for Newton's law of gravitation)

There are (a) a boy and a girl, with masses 65 kg and 45 kg respectively, separated by 1.1 m, and (b) the Earth and its Moon, with masses 6.0 \(\times\) 10\({}^{24}\) kg and 7.4 \(\times\) 10\({}^{22}\) kg respectively, separated by 3.8 \(\times\) 10\({}^{8}\) m. Determine the gravitational force between masses in (a) and (b).

**Solution:**

(a) \(F=\frac{Gm_{1}m_{2}}{r^{2}}\)

(b) \(F=\frac{Gm_{1}m_{2}}{r^{2}}\)

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:4]

The **direction of a field at a point** is along a _tangent_ to the field line at that point, as shown in **Fig. 3**.

The density of the field lines at a point (number of lines per unit area) corresponds to the strength of the field at that point. A denser arrangement of field lines indicates greater gravitational field strength and vice versa.

**Gravitational field strength** at a point \(g\) is defined as the **gravitational force per unit mass** exerted on a _small test mass_ placed at that point!

\(g\) is a **vector** quantity and it is in **the same direction as the gravitational force.** Its S1 unit is N kg-1.

_Example 2[761/l/6][Modified]_ (Synoptic Question: Units)

The S1 unit for gravitational field strength is

**A**: m s-2 **B**: J kg-1 **C**: kg N-1 **D**: N m-1

**Solution: (Ans: )**

\(g=\frac{F}{m}\) implies that the SI unit of \(g\) is

Since 1 N = 1 kg m s-2, N kg-1 =

The equation \(g=F/m\) can also be related to Newton's 2nd Law when applied to the acceleration, \(a\), of an object of constant mass: \(a=F/m\). Hence the gravitational field strength \(g\) near the surface of the Earth is 9.81 N kg-1. It is numerically equal to the _acceleration of free fall, \(a\), near the surface of the Earth,_ with the value 9.81 m s-2.

_Example 3_ (Gravitational Field Strength: Small Test Mass)

Gravitational field strength at a point is defined as the gravitational force per unit mass exerted on a small test mass placed at that point.

Why is it necessary for the test mass to be small?

**A**: so that the test mass does not distort the gravitational field
**B**: so that the force on the test mass is small
**C**: so that the test mass does not create any forces on nearby masses
**D**: so that Newton's law for point masses is obeyed

**Solution: (Ans: )**_derive, from Newton's law of gravitation and the definition of gravitational field strength, the equation \(g=\frac{GM}{r^{2}}\) for the gravitational field strength of a point mass._

### Gravitational field strength of a point mass \(M\)

Consider two point masses \(M\) and \(m\) separated by a distance \(r\).

1. From Newton's law of gravitation, the magnitude of the attractive gravitational force \(F\) acting on the mass \(m\) due to (the gravitational field of) \(M\) is expressed as \[F=\frac{GMm}{r^{2}}\] - - (1)
2. Based on definition of gravitational field strength, the magnitude of \(g\) at the point where \(m\) is situated is expressed as \[g=\frac{F}{m}\] - - (2)
3. From equations (1) and (2), \[g=\frac{GM}{r^{2}}\] which is an expression for the **magnitude** of the gravitational field strength \(g\) at a point a distance \(r\) measured from a point mass \(M\). (This point mass \(M\)**is the one which creates the gravitational field in its surrounding region of space.). In vector form, a negative sign indicates that the direction of the field strength is towards decreasing \(r\). \(\hat{g}=\frac{GM}{r^{2}}\). \(\hat{r}\) is a unit vector in the outward radial direction.

_Example 4[J81/I/8][Modified]_ (Use of Formula for Gravitational Field Strength)

At a point on the surface of a uniform sphere of diameter \(d\), the gravitational field due to the sphere is \(X\). What would be the corresponding value on the surface of a uniform sphere of the same density but of diameter \(2d\)?

* [1]_Example 6_ (Synoptic Question: Vectors) Earth is a point mass of 6.0 x 10\({}^{24}\) kg and Moon is a point mass of 7.4 x 10\({}^{22}\) kg and the distance between them is 3.8 x 10\({}^{5}\) km. Determine the position of a point from Earth where the gravitational field strength due to Earth and Moon is zero.

_Example 8 [91/1/8][Modified]_ (Gravitation Field Strength & Force)

A 20 kg mass is situated 4 m above the Earth's surface. Taking \(g\) as 10 m s\({}^{-2}\), what are the gravitational field strength and gravitational force acting on the mass?

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|} \hline  & **gravitational field** & **gravitational force / N** \\  & **strength / N kg\({}^{-1}\)** & \\ \hline
**A** & 0.5 & 10 \\ \hline
**B** & 10 & 10 \\ \hline
**C** & 10 & 200 \\ \hline
**D** & 40 & 200 \\ \hline \end{tabular}

_(g)_ _define the gravitational potential at a point as the work done per unit mass in bringing a small test mass from infinity to that point._

### Gravitational Potential Energy Near the Surface of the Earth

Consider Fig. 4. Recall from the topic of "_Work, Energy and Power_" that when lifting a mass \(m\) through a vertical height \(h\) with gravitational field strength \(g\) (= 9.81 N kg\({}^{-1}\)) near the surface of the Earth, the increase in gravitational potential energy = _mgh_

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|} \hline  & **or** & **\(\Delta U\)** = _mgh_ \\ \hline \end{tabular}

Strictly speaking, the quantity _mgh_ represents the _change_ in potential energy when the mass is lifted through a vertical height \(h\) rather than the absolute amount it possesses at a height \(h\). We conveniently choose a **lower** reference level (usually the **ground** level) as the zero potential energy level so that _mgh_ is the extra energy a mass has when it is at height \(h\) compared to when it is at the **zero** potential energy level.

Recall as well that the increase in gravitational potential energy is actually the work you must do against the gravity to move the mass \(m\) from the GPE = 0 reference point through a vertical height \(h\) to the higher point. It is based on this understanding that the formula \(\Delta U\) = _mgh_ is derived.

### Formal Definition of Gravitational Potential Energy

The **gravitational potential energy** of a mass at a point is defined as the work done on the mass in moving it from infinity to that point.

Here, the work is done by an external force acting in the **opposite** direction to the gravitational attraction.

Alternatively, the gravitational potential energy of a mass at a point can also be understood as the work done **against** the gravity in bringing the mass from infinity to that point.

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:10]

**Example 10** (Gravitational field strength for height \(>\) 1 km): A 3.0 kg mass is projected to a height \(h\) above Earth's surface. Taking the radius of the Earth as 6400 km and the mass of the Earth as 6.0 x 10\({}^{24}\) kg. Find the change in the gravitational potential energy for the 3.0 kg mass if

(i) \(h=1000\) m

(ii) \(h=1000\) km

**Solution:**

(i) Using \(\Delta U=mgh\), \(\Delta U=(3.0)(9.81)(1000)\approx 29\) kJ

Using \(\Delta U=U_{t}-U_{i}=\left(-\frac{GMm}{r+h}\right)-\left(-\frac{GMm}{r}\right)= GMm\left(\frac{h}{r(r+h)}\right)\),

**Solution:**

(ii) Using \(\Delta U=mgh\), \(\Delta U=(3.0)(9.81)(100000)\approx 29\) MJ

Using \(\Delta U=U_{t}-U_{i}=\left(-\frac{GMm}{r+h}\right)-\left(-\frac{GMm}{r}\right) =GMm\left(\frac{h}{r(r+h)}\right)\),

\(\Delta U=(6.67\times 10^{-11})(6.0\times 10^{24})(3)\left(\frac{1000\times 10^{ 3}}{6400(7400)\times 10^{6}}\right)\approx 25\) MJ

The gravitational potential energy of a mass depends on both the value of the mass as well as the position of the mass. We would like to define an energy-related quantity that is only dependent on the position (just like gravitational field strength) in a gravitational field. This quantity is the _gravitational potential_.

The **gravitational potential** at a point is defined as the work done per unit mass (by an external force) in bringing a small test mass from infinity to that point.

for potential at a distance \(r\)

away from a point mass \(M\)

The unit of gravitational potential is J kg\({}^{-1}\). It is a **scalar** quantity.

#### 5.3.1 _show an understanding of geostationary orbits and their application._

Geostationary orbits are circular orbits made by satellites about the Earth's axis such that these satellites **would appear stationary when observed from a point on surface of the Earth**, this characteristic enables it provide permanent coverage2 of a given wide area.

Footnote 2: Note that a minimum of three geostationary satellites to cover the entire Earth, except the areas near the poles.

(1) They must move (so that it moves in the same sense of self rotation of the Earth about its own axis);

(2) The satellite's must be equal to (so that it is the same as the Earth's rotational period about its own axis);

(3) Geostationary orbit is an (i.e. an orbit in the plane of the Equator).

This is because the gravitational force exerted must be directed towards the centre of the Earth so its circular orbit must have its centre at the centre of the Earth. If the orbit is not over the Equator it will sometimes be over the northern hemisphere and sometimes the southern hemisphere and so cannot be geostationary.

Geostationary satellites are often used for telecommunications

Most commercial communications satellites, broadcast satellites and Satellite-Based Augmentation System (SBAS) satellites operate in geostationary orbits. Satellites in geostationary orbits always remain at the same location, in constant line-of-sight to ground stations on Earth's surface, allowing their dish antenna to be easily directed (fixed) to communicate.

Other type of satellites and their applications

Other than geostationary satellites, there are polar orbiting satellites and Global Positioning System (GPS) satellites. Polar orbits are often used for Earth-mapping, Earth observation, capturing the earth as time passes from one point, reconnaissance satellites, as well as for some weather satellites.

**Self-Reading: Guided Exam Question**

[99/III/2] (Long Structured Question)

A satellite P of mass 2400 kg is placed in a geostationary orbit at a distance of 4.23 x 10\({}^{7}\) m from the centre of the Earth.

[(a)] Explain what is meant by the term _geostationary orbit_.

[(b)] Calculate

[(i)] the angular velocity of the satellite,

[(ii)] the speed of the satellite,

[(iii)] the acceleration of the satellite,

[(iv)] the force of attraction between the Earth and the satellite,

[(v)] the mass of the Earth,

[(vi)] the kinetic energy of the satellite,

[(vii)] the gravitational potential energy of the satellite,

[(viii)] the total energy of the satellite.

[(c)] Explain why a geostationary satellite

[(i)] must be placed vertically above the equator,

[(ii)] must move from West to East.

[(d)] Why is a satellite in a geostationary orbit often used for telecommunications?

**Solution:**

[(a)] **Geostationary orbits** are orbits of satellites orbiting around the Earth such that these satellites would appear stationary when observed from a fixed location from Earth.

[(b)] Since the orbit is geostationary, the period of the satellite = 24 hrs

\[\omega=\frac{2\pi}{T}=\frac{2\pi}{(24)(60)(60)}=7.27\times 10^{-5}\ \mathrm{rad\ s^{-1}}\]

[(ii)] \(\nu=r\omega=(4.23\times 10^{7})(7.27\times 10^{-5}\ )=3075\approx 3080\ \mathrm{m\ s^{-1}}\)

[(iii)] \(\alpha=r\omega^{2}=(4.23\times 10^{7})(7.27\times 10^{-5}\ )^{2}=0.224\ \mathrm{m\ s^{-2}}\)

[(iv)] The force of attraction between the Earth and the satellite is the **resultant force that provides the centripetal force** for the satellite to orbit the Earth.

By Newton's 2\({}^{\mathrm{nd}}\) law,

\[F_{g}=m\dot{a}=m\dot{a}^{2}=(2400)(0.224)=537.6\approx 538\ \mathrm{N}\]

[(v)] \(F_{g}=\frac{GMm}{r^{2}}\)

[(vi)] \(\dot{G}PE=-\frac{GMm}{r}=-\frac{(6.67\times 10^{-11})(6.0\times 10^{24})(2400)} {4.23\times 10^{7}}=-2.27\times 10^{10}\ \mathrm{J}\)* \(TE=GPE+KE=1.13\times 10^{10}+(-2.27\times 10^{10})=-1.14\times 10^{10}\) J **OR** \(TE=-\frac{GMm}{2r}=-\frac{(6.67\times 10^{-11})(6.0\times 10^{24})(2400)}{2(4.23 \times 10^{7})}=-1.14\times 10^{10}\) J
* \(\mathbf{(c)(i)}\) The gravitational force by the Earth provides the centripetal force for the satellite and is directed towards the centre of the Earth. Since the gravitational force is directed **towards the centre** of its orbit, the **centre of the orbit must be the centre of the Earth** and the **axis of rotation of the satellite is the same as the Earth. This means that all geostationary orbits must be **vertically above** the Earth's equator.
* In order to appear stationary from a fixed location from the Earth's surface, the period of the satellites in geostationary orbits must be the same as that of the Earth, i.e. **24 hours**. These satellites would also have to orbit about the Earth's axis of rotation and must **rotate from west to east** as the Earth rotates from west to east.
* A satellite in a geostationary orbit is often used for telecommunications because it will always remain at the same location, in constant electronic line-of-sight3 to the data receiving stations on the Earth's surface, which facilitates telecommunications.
