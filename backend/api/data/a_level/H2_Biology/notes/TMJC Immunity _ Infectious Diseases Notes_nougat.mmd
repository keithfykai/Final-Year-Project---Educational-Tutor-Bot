## Topic Synopsis

Micro-organisms, e.g. viruses and bacteria, cause diseases which disrupt the equilibrium of physiological systems in humans. This extension topic explores how some infectious diseases are diagnosed and treated.

The following question should help you frame your learning:

* What cause infectious diseases?
* How does the body respond during an infection?
* How can infectious diseases be prevented or diagnosed and treated?

With an understanding of how the human immune system functions, this concept explores the development of vaccines and vaccines are used to eradicate infectious diseases like smallpox. Yet, not all viruses can be eliminated by vaccines. The influenza virus and HIV infects humans. While treatment is available through vaccines and anti-viral drugs, they are still present in the population due to their high mutation rate. Besides viral infections, diseases can also be caused by bacterial infections. Tuberculosis is caused by the bacteria _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_. Although successful vaccination programs in Singapore have kept the infection under control, there have been new cases appearing in the population and it remains a fatal disease in developing countries.

## Learning Outcomes

### Extension Topic A: Infectious Diseases

Candidates should be able to:

* Describe the specific (adaptive) immune system, including active, passive, natural-acquired and artificially-acquired immunity, and the non-specific (innate) immune system.
* Outline the roles of B lymphocytes, T lymphocytes, antigen-presenting cells and memory cells in specific primary and secondary immune responses.
* Explain the relationship of the molecular structure of antibodies to their functions, using immunoglobulin G, IgG, as an example.

* Discuss how vaccination can control disease (e.g. in the eradication of smallpox), limited to vaccination stimulates immunity without causing the disease and vaccination of a high enough proportion of the population can break the disease transmission cycle.
* Discuss the benefits and risks of vaccination.
* Explain how viruses, including influenza virus and HIV, cause diseases in humans through the disruption of host tissue and function (e.g. HIV and helper T cells, influenza virus and epithelial cells of the respiratory tract)
* Explain the mode of transmission and infection of bacterial pathogens, using _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_ as an example.

## 2 Innate immunity (nonspecific)

**Learning outcome:**

Describe the specific (adaptive) immune system, including active, passive, natural-acquired and artificially-acquired immunity, and the non-specific (innate) immune system.

* Innate immunity refers to non-specific defence mechanisms that is activated immediately or within hours of a pathogen's appearance in the body. These mechanisms include **physical barriers** such as skin, antimicrobial **chemicals/proteins** in the blood, and **immune cells** that attack foreign cells in the body.

### _Barrier / physical defense_

* In mammals, epithelial tissues block the entry of many pathogens. These **barrier defenses** include the **skin** and also the **mucous membranes** (Fig. 2.1) lining the digestive, respiratory, urinary, and reproductive tracts.

Fig. 2.1: Barrier defense in innate immunity.

* Certain cells of the mucous membranes produce **mucus**, a viscous fluid that **traps pathogens** and other particles.
* In the trachea, **ciliated epithelial cells** sweep mucus and any entrapped microbes upward. This helps to prevent infection of the lungs.
* Saliva, tears, and mucous secretions that bathe various exposed epithelia provide a washing action that also inhibits colonization by fungi and bacteria.
* Beyond their physical role in inhibiting microbial entry, body secretions create an environment that is hostile to many microbes. **Lysozyme** in tears, saliva, and mucous secretions **destroys cell walls** of susceptible bacteria as they enter the openings around the eyes or the upper respiratory tract.
* The **acidic environment** of the stomach also kills most of the microorganisms before these microorganisms can enter the intestines. Similarly, secretions from oil and sweat glands give human skin a pH ranging from 3 to 5, acidic enough to prevent the growth of many bacteria.

### Cellular innate defense

* Pathogens entering the mammalian body are subjected to phagocytosis by various types of phagocytic cells (Table 1).

### 2.3 Antimicrobial proteins

* In mammals, pathogen recognition triggers the production and release of a variety of antimicrobial proteins that attack pathogens or impede their reproduction. Two examples of such proteins include **interferons** and **complement proteins**.

#### (A) Interferons

* **Cytokines** are **small proteins** that aid cell-to-cell communication in immune responses and stimulate the movement of cells towards sites of inflammation and infection.
* **Interferons** are a **subset of cytokines** that provide innate defense by **interfering with viral infections** (Fig. 2.4).
* Virus-infected body cells secrete interferons, which induce nearby uninfected cells to **express antiviral genes** that code for antiviral proteins. These antiviral proteins inhibit viral reproduction which limits the cell-to-cell spread of viruses in the body, helping to control viral infections such as influenza infection.

### 3.1 Antigen recognition by B cells and antibodies

#### Structure of B cell antigen receptor

* Each B cell antigen receptor is a Y-shaped molecule with four polypeptide chains: 2 identical **heavy chains** and 2 identical **light chains**. **Disulfide bridges** link the chains together (Fig. 3.3).
* A **transmembrane region** near one end of each heavy chain anchors the receptor in the cell's plasma membrane. A short tail region at the end of the heavy chain extends into the cytoplasm.
* The light and heavy chains each have a **constant (C) region**, where **amino acid sequences vary little among the receptors on different B cells**. The C region includes the cytoplasmic tail and transmembrane region of the heavy chain and all of the disulfide bridges.
* Within the two tips of the Y shape, the light and heavy chains each has a **variable (V) region**, where **amino acid sequence varies extensively from one B cell to another**. Parts of a heavy-chain V region and a light-chain V region form the binding site for an antigen.
* Each B cell antigen receptor has **two identical antigen-binding sites*
* (Fig. 3.3), complementary in shape to specific epitope.
* The binding of a B cell antigen receptor to an antigen is an early step in B cell activation, leading eventually to the formation of plasma cells that secrete a soluble form of the receptor known as **antibody**, or **immunoglobulin*
* (IgG) (Fig. 3.4).

Figure 3.4: B cells, upon activation, give rise to plasma cells which secrete soluble form of the antigen receptor called antibodies or immunoglobulins.

Figure 3.3: B cell antigen receptor comprises two identical heavy chains and two identical light chains.

#### Structure of Antibody (e.g. Immunoglobulin G, IgG)

* **Antibodies** have the same Y-shaped organization as B cell antigen receptors, except that antibodies are in a **soluble** and **secreted** form rather than membrane bound.
* The secreted antibody has a **hydrophilic C-terminus** at the heavy chains whereas the membrane-bound B cell antigen receptor has a **transmembrane hydrophobic C-terminus at the heavy chains**. (Fig.3.5)
* lgG is the major antibody class in the blood.
* Each IgG is made up of four polypeptide chain: **two heavy chains** and **two light chains** linked via **disulfide bonds**.
* Each heavy chain and light chain comprise a **variable (V) region**. The V regions make up the **antigen-binding site**.
* Similar to the B cell antigen receptor, antibody has **two identical antigen-binding sites** (Fig. 3.6), each has a **complementary shape** that binds to a **specific epitope**.
* The V region of different antibodies has **different amino acid sequences** that lead to **different tertiary structure**. This gives rise to the **diversity of antigen binding sites** where each binds specifically to a different epitope of an antigen. _Differences in the amino acid sequences of variable regions is a result of somatic recombination and somatic hyper-mutation that occur during B cell development (details in Section 3.3)_
* The light and heavy chains each has a **constant (C) region**, where **amino acid sequences vary little among the receptors on different B cells**.
* The constant region at the C-terminus tail region (also known as **Fc region**) of some subclasses of IgG can bind to specific receptors (**Fc receptors**) on macrophages and neutrophils to facilitate phagocytosis (Fig.3.7). This process is known as opsonisation. (_details in Section 3.4.3_)
* The two heavy chains each has a **hinge region** which gives **flexibility** to the structure. This improves the efficiency in which the antibody can bind with antigens. (Fig. 3.6)

Figure 3.5: (a) The membrane-bound B cell antigen receptor has a transmembrane hydrophobic C-terminus at the heavy chains where (b) antibody has a hydrophilic C-terminus at the heavy chains (no transmembrane region)

### 3.2 Antigen recognition by T cells

* For a T cell, the antigen receptor consists of **two different polypeptide chains**, an \(\alpha\)**-chain** and a \(\beta\)**chain**, linked by a **disulfide bridge** (Fig. 3.8).
* Near the base of the T cell receptor is a **transmembrane region** that anchors the molecule in the cell's plasma membrane.
* At the outer tip of the molecule, the **variable (V)** regions of \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\) chains together form a single **antigen-binding site**. The remainder of the molecule is made up of the **constant (C)** regions.
* While the B cell receptors bind to epitopes of **intact antigens** circulating in body fluids, T cell receptors bind only to **fragments of antigens** that are **displayed**, or **presented**, on the surface of host cells.
* The host protein that displays the antigen fragment on the cell surface is called the **major histocompatibility complex (MHC)** molecule (_Sections 3.4.1 and 3.4.2_).
* 2 main classes of MHC proteins (Fig. 3.9)
* **Class I MHC*
* protein presents foreign peptides to **cytotoxic T cells*
* (a.k.a. CD8+ T cells)
* **Class II MHC*
* protein presents foreign peptides to **helper T cells*
* (a.k.a. CD4+ T cells)

Figure 3.8: T cell antigen receptor comprises two different polypeptides – \(\alpha\)-chain and \(\beta\)-chain* [leftmargin=*]
* Recognition of protein antigens by T cells begins when a pathogen or part of a pathogen either infects (Fig. 3.9a) or is phagocytosed (Fig. 3.9b) by a host cell.
* Inside the host cell, enzymes in the cell cleave the antigen into smaller peptides. Each peptide, called an **antigen fragment**, then binds to an MHC molecule inside the cell.
* Movement of the MHC molecule and bound antigen fragment to the cell surface results in **antigen presentation**, the display of the antigen fragment in an exposed peptide-binding site of the MHC protein.
* Fig. 3.10 (a) and (b) show the process of antigen presentation, which signals that a host cell contains a foreign substance.
* If the cell displaying an antigen fragment encounters a T cell with the right specificity, the antigen receptor on the T cell will bind to both the antigen fragment and the MHC molecule. This interaction of an MHC molecule, an antigen fragment, and an antigen receptor is necessary for a T cell to participate in an adaptive immune response (_Section 3.4_).

Figure 3.9: Antigen recognition by a T cell. Inside the host cell, an antigen fragment from a pathogen binds to an MHC molecule and is brought up to the cell surface, where it is displayed. The combination of MHC molecule and antigen fragment is recognized by a T cell.

1. Virial-infected cells contain viral proteins in the cytosol.
2. Viral protein is degraded in the proteasome into small antigenic fragments.
3. The antigenic fragments are transported into the lumen RER via a protein transporter.

## Comparison between B cell receptor and T cell receptor

### Development of B and T cells

**Learning outcome:**

Explain how genetic recombination during development results in millions of different antibody molecules (including somatic recombination, hyper-mutation and class switching).

* Both **T and B cells originate from the bone marrow**, but **Immuture T cells** migrate to the thymus** (an organ behind the sternum and between the lungs where T cells undergo maturation) to **complete their development**, while **B cells** continue to **mature in the bone marrow**.

#### 3.3.1 Generation of B and T cell diversity

* Each person makes more than 3 million different B cell antigen receptors and 10 million different T cell antigen receptors. Yet there are only about 20,000 protein-coding genes in the human genome. How, then, do we generate such remarkable diversity in antigen receptors?

**(A) Somatic recombination in B cells**

* The capacity to generate diversity is built into the structure of Ig genes (Fig. 3.11). _Ig genes in B cell is used here as an illustration. T cell antigen receptor genes undergo very similar transformations. **(Note: T cell receptor diversification does not involve somatic hyper-mutation)**
* Somatic recombination occurs during the development of a B cell in the bone marrow **before antigenic stimulation**.
* The **heavy chain gene** is made up of 4 segments: a **variable** (V) segment, a **diversity** (D) segment, a **joining** (J) segment, and a **constant** (C) segment.
* The **light chain gene** is made up of 3 segments: a **variable** (V) segment, a **joining** (J) segment, and a **constant** (C) segment.
* The **VDJ segments of H chain gene** and **VJ segment of L chain gene** together encode the **variable region** of the Ig protein, while the **C segment of H chain gene** and **L chain gene** encodes the **constant region** of the Ig protein.

**Heavy (H) chain gene locus on chromosome 14**

**Figure 3.11: The gene loci of heavy chain, kappa light chain and lambda light chain of B cell.**

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:24]

* Somatic recombination requires the enzyme recombinase to select and recombine the gene segments coding for the variable region on the lg (Fig. 3.13a and 3.13b). This gives rise to a great diversity (\(\sim\)2.6 X 10\({}^{6}\)) of different lg, each specific for a particular antigen.
* The **kappa light chain gene locus** for example, contains a **single C segment**, **40 different V segments**, and **5 different J segments**. These alternative copies of the V and J segments are arranged within the gene in a series (Fig. 3.13b). A functional gene is built from one copy of each type of segment, thus, the pieces can be combined in 200 different ways (40V x 5J x 1C).
* Recombinase acts randomly, linking any one of the 40 V gene segments to any one of the 5 J gene segments (heavy chain genes undergo a similar recombination).
* In any given cell, however, **only one allele of a light-chain gene** (either **x** or **lambda**) and one allele of a heavy-chain gene undergo recombination.
* The **recombination is permanent** and is passed on to the daughter cells when the lymphocyte divides.
* Since the gene segments are **randomly selected and recombined**, some B cells produce receptors specific for epitopes on the organism's own self antigen. If these self-reactive B cells were not eliminated or inactivated, the immune system could not distinguish self from non-self antigen and would attack body proteins, cells, and tissues. These **self-reactive B cells** with receptors specific for the body's own molecules are **destroyed by apoptosis**.

_Think about it..._

Somatic recombination generates diverse gene products from one gene. For example, the H chain gene can generate many different H chain proteins, each with a specific shape at the variable region.

How is this process different from alternative splicing?

Figure 3.13c: Assembly of H and L chains forms the B cell receptor, with each B cell having different specificity.

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:26]

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:27]

#### Proliferation of B cell and T cells

* Once a B cell or T cell is activated by an antigen in the lymphoid organ (e.g. lymph node), they are stimulated to divide (proliferate).
* For B cells, somatic hyper-mutation and class switching take place during proliferation.
* After somatic hyper-mutation, the **cell with highest affinity to the antigen** are selected to undergo clonal expansion, while the rest undergo apoptosis. The outcome is a population of cells that are **identical to each other and highly specific to that antigen**. The process is known as **clonal selection and expansion** (Fig. 3.16).
* Some cells from this clone become **effector cells**, short-lived cells that take effect immediately against the antigen and any pathogens producing that antigen.
* The effector forms of B cells are **plasma cells**, which secrete antibodies.
* The effector forms of T cells are **helper T cells*
* and **cytotoxic T cells*
* (_Section 3.4_).
* The remaining cells in the clone become **memory cells**, **long-lived cells** that can give rise to effector cells **immediately** if the same antigen is encountered later in the animal's life. (Fig. 3.16). These memory B cells have already undergone **affinity maturation** and **class switching**, so are able to develop into **antibodies-secreting plasma cells very rapidly** when they encounter a foreign antigen.

In response to a specific antigen and to immune cell signals (not shown), one selected B cell divides and forms a clone of cells. The clone of cells formed by the selected B cell gives rise to memory B cells and antibody-secreting plasma cells.

Figure 3.16: Clonal selection and expansion, using B cells as an example.

#### Immunological memory

* Immunological memory refers to the ability of the immune system to respond more rapidly and effectively to a pathogen that has been **encountered previously**.
* Immunological memory is responsible for the **long-term protection** that a prior infection or vaccination provides against many diseases, such as chickenpox.
* When a B cell or T cell is **first exposed to an antigen**, a **primary immune response** is triggered which peaks at about 10-17 days after the initial exposure. The binding of the antigen to the antigen receptor activates the B cell or T cell to divide and to produce many more cells with the same receptors. Some of these selected B cells differentiate into memory B cells or plasma cells (effector cells) while selected T cells differentiate into memory T cells or helper and cytotoxic T cells (effector cells).
* If an individual is **exposed again to the same antigen**, the immune response is **faster**, of **greater magnitude**, and **more prolonged**. This is because the pre-existing memory B cells and T cells generated during the primary immune response can now respond more readily and rapidly. Such response is known as the **secondary immune response**.
* During the primary immune response, selected B cells give rise to antibody-secreting plasma cells specific to the antigen. If the same antigen is encountered again, these pre-existing memory B cell specific for that antigen enable the rapid formation of clones of thousands of plasma cells to secrete more antibodies. Hence, measuring the concentrations of specific antibodies in blood over time distinguishes the primary and secondary immune responses. (Fig. 3.17)
* The secondary immune response relies on the **pre-existing T and B memory cells** generated following initial exposure to an antigen. These cells are **long-lived**, hence, they provide the basis for immunological memory, which can span many decades.
* Effector cells have much **shorter life spans**, which is why the immune response diminishes after an infection is overcome.

Figure 3.17: The specificity of immunological memory. Long-lived memory cells generated in the primary response to antigen A give rise to a heightened secondary response to the same antigen, but do not affect the primary response to a different antigen (B).

Although the processes for antigen recognition, clonal selection, and immunological memory are similar for B cells and T cells, these two classes of lymphocytes fight infection in different ways and in different settings (_Section 3.4_).

In summary, there are five major characteristics of adaptive immunity:

1. Acquired immunity exhibits **high specificity** as each antigen receptor (T-cell receptor and antibody) binds to a specific antigen (epitope) on a pathogen.
2. There is an **immense diversity of lymphocytes and receptors**, enabling the immune system to detect pathogens never before encountered.
3. Adaptive immunity normally has **self-tolerance**, the lack of reactivity against an animal's own molecules and cells.
4. **Cell proliferation** triggered by activation greatly increases the number of B and T cells specific for an antigen.
5. There is a stronger and more rapid response to an antigen encountered previously, due to a feature known as **immunological memory**.

### Role of B cells, T cells, antigen-presenting cells and memory cells in adaptive immunity

**Learning outcome:**

Outline the roles of B lymphocytes, T lymphocytes, antigen-presenting cells and memory cells in specific primary and secondary immune responses.

* The activities of B and T lymphocytes produce a humoral immune response and a cell-mediated immune response respectively.
* In the **humoral immune response**, which occurs in the blood, **antibodies** help **eliminate toxins and pathogens** in the blood and lymph.
* In the **cell-mediated immune response**, specialized T cells destroy infected host cells.

#### 3.4.1 Helper T cell activates B cells and cytotoxic T cells

* 2 main classes of T cells:
* Helper T cell which helps stimulate the responses of other immune cells e.g. B cells, cytotoxic T cells, macrophages, dendritic cells.
* Cytotoxic T cell which directly kills cells that are infected with a virus or intracellular pathogen.
* The **helper T cell** triggers both the humoral and cell-mediated immune responses.
* Helper T cells themselves do not carry out those responses. Instead, **signals** from helper T cells initiate production of antibodies from plasma cell. The antibodies neutralize pathogens and activate cytotoxic T cells that kill infected cells (Fig. 3.18).
* Two requirements must be met for a helper T cell to activate adaptive immune responses:

1. **Presence of a foreign antigen** that can bind specifically to the antigen receptor of the T cell.
2. This antigen must be **displayed with major histocompatibility complex (MHC)** on the **surface of an antigen-presenting cell**. The antigen-presenting cell can be a dendritic cell, macrophage, or B cell.
* The antigen is presented in complex with **class II MHC**. Class II MHC molecules are present only in **antigen-presenting cells**.
* When the antigen receptor on a helper T cell binds to the class II MHC-antigen complex on the antigen-presenting cell, the antigen-presenting cell produces **cytokines**. The cytokines then stimulate the helper T cell to produce its own set of cytokines.
* Cytokines produced from antigen-presenting cell and helper T cell stimulate the helper T cell to proliferate.
* Following its proliferation, the helper T cells produce other cytokines to 1. **activate cytotoxic T cells** to **kill infected cells** (_Section 3.4.2_).
2. **stimulate antigen-activated B cell** to proliferate and **differentiate** into **memory B cells** and **plasma cells** (_Section 3.4.3_)

#### 3.4.2 Cytotoxic T cells kills infected cells

* In the cell-mediated immune response, once the **cytotoxic T cells** are **activated by helper T cell**, they can eliminate cells that are infected by viruses or other intracellular pathogens.
* **Infected host cells** present fragments of the foreign protein in complex with **class I MHC molecules** and are displayed on the cell surface. These fragments of foreign protein can be recognized by cytotoxic T cells.
* The killing of an infected host cell by a cytotoxic T cell involves the secretion of proteins that **disrupt membrane integrity** and **trigger apoptosis**. (Fig. 3.19)
* The death of the infected cell not only deprives the pathogen of a place to reproduce, but also exposes cell contents to circulating antibodies. After destroying an infected cell, the cytotoxic T cell can move on and kill other cells infected with the same pathogen.

Figure 3.18: The central role of helper T cells in humoral and cell-mediated immune responses. In this example, a helper T cell responds to a dendritic cell displaying a microbial antigen.

Figure 3.19: The killing action of cytotoxic T cells on an infected host cell. An activated cytotoxic T cell releases molecules that make pores in an infected cell’s membrane and enzymes that break down proteins, promoting the cell’s death.

#### B cell secretes antibodies that bind to and mark pathogens for destruction

* The humoral immune response involves the secretion of antibodies by clonal-selected B cells.

**(A) Activation of B cells**

* When a B cell (also an antigen-presenting cell) internalizes the foreign antigen, it displays an antigen fragment in complex with **class II MHC molecule** on its cell surface.
* Antigen receptor on activated helper T cell binds with the class II MHC-antigen complex on the B cell. This leads to the release of cytokines from T cell. (Fig. 3.20)
* These cytokines stimulate the B cell to proliferate and differentiate into memory B cells and plasma cells.

* An activated B cell gives rise to thousands of **identical antibodies-secreting plasma cells**.
* Each plasma cell secretes approximately 2,000 antibodies every second of the cell's 4- to 5-day life span.

Fig. 3.20: Activation of a B cell in the humoral immune response. Most protein antigens require activated helper T cells to trigger a humoral response. A macrophage (shown here) or a dendritic cell can activate a helper T cell, which in turn can activate a B cell to give rise to antibody-secreting plasma cells.

### (B) Antibody function

* Antibodies do not kill pathogens, but by binding to antigens, they mark pathogens in various ways for inactivation or destruction (Fig. 3.21).

1. **Neutralization** * The binding of antibodies to **viral surface proteins** prevent infection of a host cell, thus neutralizing the virus. * Similarly, antibodies sometimes bind to **toxins** released in body fluids, preventing the toxins from entering body cells
2. **Opsonization** * In opsonization, antibodies bound to antigens on bacteria (called opsonized bacteria) present a readily recognized structure for macrophages or neutrophils and therefore **increase phagocytosis**. * Antibodies also facilitate phagocytosis by linking bacterial cells, virus particles, or other foreign substances into aggregates.
3. **Facilitate the activation of complement proteins** * Binding of antibodies to antigens on the surface of a foreign cell activates the complement system.
4. **Facilitate the destruction of viral-infected cells** * When a virus uses a cell's biosynthetic machinery to produce viral proteins, these viral products can appear on the cell surface. * Antibodies specific for epitopes on these viral proteins bind to the exposed proteins. The presence of bound antibody at the cell surface can recruit a natural killer cell. * The natural killer cell then releases proteins that cause the infected cell to undergo apoptosis.

### Vaccination and the eradication of smallpox virus

**Learning outcome:**

Discuss how vaccination can control disease (e.g. in the eradication of smallpox), limited to vaccination stimulates immunity without causing the disease and vaccination of a high enough proportion of the population can break the disease transmission cycle.

* **Vaccination** is the administration (injection / inhalation / ingestion) of **antigenic material (vaccine)** to stimulate an individual's immune system to develop **adaptive immunity** to a pathogen. It is also known as **active immunization**.
* The objective is to provide the individual with long lasting immunologic protection against exposure to infectious pathogens by first eliciting primary immune responses to the antigens on the pathogen. Note that **vaccination does not cause diseases**.
* After an individual is immunized, **exposure to the actual pathogen triggers a secondary response**, which is faster and stronger and hence protecting the individual from the disease.
* There are different forms of vaccine:
* **Living attenuated microorganisms*
* are living but weakened microorganisms which do not cause symptoms. They can stimulate the body's immune system. Measles and tuberculosis (TB) can be vaccinated against this way.
* **Dead microorganisms*
* that can induce immune response. Typhoid and cholera can be controlled by this means.
* **Genetically engineered microorganisms*
* can be produced in which the genes for antigen production are transferred from a harmful microorganism to a harmless one. These are then grown in fermenters and the extracted antigen is separated and purified before injection. e.g. Hepatitis B vaccine.
* that codes for a surface protein of the pathogen (e.g. covid-19 mRNA vaccine). Note: Vaccination can only be used to control diseases caused by pathogen. It is not effective against genetic diseases such as sickle cell anaemia.
* The programme of vaccination against various diseases varies in its success. Features of a successful vaccination programme include:
* **Few**, if any, **side effects*
* from vaccination. Unpleasant side effects may discourage individuals in the population from being vaccinated.
* The ability to **vaccinate the vast majority of the vulnerable population at one time**. This **interrupts the transmission of the pathogen*
* because for a certain period there are no individuals in the population with the disease. This is known as **herd immunity**.
* Proper mechanism to produce, store and transport the vaccine.
* The means of administering the vaccine properly at the appropriate time by trained staff with appropriate skills at different centres throughout the population.
* Eradicating a disease can be unsuccessful even though the criteria for successful vaccination are met. The reasons for this include:
* Vaccination fails to induce immunity in certain individuals, e.g. ones with defective immune systems that do not produce the necessary clones of B and T lymphocytes.
* The disease-causing pathogen may mutate frequently so that its antigens change. This means that vaccines suddenly become ineffective as the antibodies produced no longer recognize the new antigens on the pathogen.
* Some pathogens suppress the body's immune system, so stimulating body immune response against such pathogens through vaccination is ineffective e.g. HIV

### Case Study: Successful Eradication Of Smallpox Virus Through Vaccination

* Smallpox is a deadly disease caused by the variola virus that emerged in human populations thousands of years ago. Its symptoms include high fever, fatigue, headache, backache, and a rash characterized by raised red bumps on the skin.
* In 1796, Edward Jenner, an English physician, noted that milkmaids who had cowpox, a mild disease usually seen only in cows, did not contract smallpox, a far more dangerous disease.
* He developed a procedure where he infected a person with cowpox virus and caused the person to develop immunity to smallpox. He called it vaccination.
* In 1979, the World Health Organization (WHO) launch a worldwide project to eradicate smallpox by vaccinating populations in endemic countries, using **live vaccinia virus** that is **closely-related to smallpox virus**, but **does not cause disease**.
* Vaccinia virus has the **same antigen as smallpox virus**. Thus, vaccinating an individual with vaccinia virus allows the **production of B cells and T cells with antigen receptors complementary to the antigen on smallpox virus**.
* Vaccinia virus is **genetically stable** which does not undergo frequent mutation on the gene coding for surface antigen, hence, making the vaccine more effective.
* The effect of the vaccine is **long lasting**. Only one dose of vaccination is enough.
* By **vaccinating a high enough proportion of the population at the same time**, the **disease transmission cycle can be terminated**. This is **herd immunity**. Indeed, in 1980, the World Health Assembly announced that the world was free of smallpox.

### Benefits and risks of vaccination

**Learning outcome:**

Discuss the benefits and risks of vaccination.

**Benefits**

1. **Confers immunity** to an individual even if he is previously not exposed to a certain pathogen.
2. **Confers long-term / life-long immunity** to individual due to production of memory B and T cells.
3. **Reduces the spread** of infectious diseases within human population. It is estimated that vaccines annually prevent almost 6 million deaths worldwide.
4. **Herd immunity**: When a critical portion of a community is immunized against a contagious disease at the same time, most members of the community are protected against that disease because there is little opportunity for an outbreak.
5. Vaccines are **cost-effective**: It is always cheaper to prevent a disease than to treat it.
6. **Cancer prevention**: Infective agents cause several cancers. For example, chronic hepatitis B infection leads to liver cancer. Vaccination against such pathogens helps to prevent the associated cancer.
7. **Protection against related diseases**: Vaccines will also protect against diseases related to the targeted disease (e.g. measles vaccination protects against multiple complications such as dysentery, bacterial pneumonia and malnutrition).
8. **Preventing development of antibiotic-resistant bacteria**: by reducing the need for antibiotics, vaccines may reduce the prevalence and hinder the development of resistant bacterial strains.
9. **Safe travel and mobility**: with global air travel rising, there is an increased risk of exposure to infectious diseases abroad, as travelers are capable of transmitting and disseminating diseases

**Risks**

1. On very rare occasions (1 in a million), a **severe allergic reaction** may happen within a few minutes of the vaccination. This is called an anaphylactic reaction. It can lead to breathing difficulties and, in some cases, collapse.
2. Live attenuated viruses used in vaccine may have a possibility of **regaining virulence** and cause disease.

## 6 Infectious diseases caused by viruses

**Learning outcome:**

Explain how viruses, including influenza and HIV, cause diseases in humans through the disruption of host tissue and function (e.g. HIV and T helper cells, influenza and epithelial cells of the respiratory tract)

### HIV weakens the immune system by destroying helper T cells

* HIV infects helper T cells as the viral glycoprotein gp120 on HIV is complementary in shape to the CD4 receptor present on helper T cells.
* Replication of HIV in helper T cells eventually kills the helper T cells.
* As more HIV are released into the blood and more helper T cells are infected, helper T cells decrease in number.
* Without helper T cells, the **immune system is compromised** because 1. antigen-activated B cells are unable to differentiate into antibody-secreting plasma cells, resulting in a lack of soluble antibodies to facilitate the removal of pathogen (_Section 3.4.3_). 2. cytotoxic T cells are unable to kill viral-infected cells (_Section 3.4.2_), allowing the virus to complete its reproduction cycle.
* A person with compromised immune system is **susceptible to opportunistic bacterial / viral infections** and **cancer**. When this happens, the person develops **acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)**.
* As **HIV reverse transcriptase is error-prone** and **lacks proofreading activity**, HIV genome is prone to mutation during its reproductive cycle. As a result, antibodies raised against the structures (e.g. gp120) of the initial HIV strain become ineffective against the new mutated strains. This is why it is difficult to produce an effective vaccine against HIV.

### Influenza virus damages respiratory epithelial cells

* The main targets of the influenza virus are the **epithelial cells** of the **respiratory tract**.
* How influenza virus damage epithelial cells leading to **inflammation**:
* **Interferes with metabolic processes*
* (e.g. gene expression) leading to epithelial cells undergoing *
* Viral release via **budding*
* leads to the partial **loss of the cell surface membrane*
* Viral-infected epithelial cells **present viral peptide on MHC class I*
* to **cytotoxic T cells**, which **kills the infected epithelial cell*
* The cytotoxic T cell / NK cells also secrete cytokines that can **damage nearby healthy epithelial cells**
* In severe cases, the lung inflammation may develop into **pneumonia** as the airways are blocked by fluid and there is reduced clearance of infectious agents. This can result in death.
* Influenza can lead to a **pandemic** (i.e. global outbreak) as its structure does not remain the same over time as a result of antigenic shift and antigenic drift.
* Some subtypes can cause tissue damage, e.g. H5N1 influenza does not only infect the lung epithelial cells, but other tissues in the body such as the gut. Hence it is a more lethal strain.

## 7 Infectious diseases caused by bacteria

**Learning outcome**:

Explain the mode of transmission and infection of bacterial pathogens, using _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_ as an example.

### _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_ infects the lung and causes tuberculosis

* apart from peptidoglycan, about 50% of its cell wall is made of **mycolic acids**.

**Mode of transmission**

* Tuberculosis is an **air-borne disease** that is spread from **person to person**. When people with tuberculosis cough, sneeze or spit, they propel the _M. tuberculosis_ into the air in **microscopic droplets**. A person needs to inhale only a few of _M. tuberculosis_ to become infected.

**Infection and symptoms**

* _M. tuberculosis_ most commonly infects the **lungs**.

* Once inside the lungs, macrophages will tend to remove the bacteria via phagocytosis. However, the bacteria can **escape the phagosome** to continue to divide by binary fission in the cytosol (Fig. 7.1a). From the lung, they can **move through the blood to other parts of the body**, such as the kidney, spine, and brain.

* Infected macrophages in the lung release chemical to attract many other white blood cells to the site of infection, resulting in **lesions** called **tubercles** (Fig. 7.1b, 7.1c).

* Eventually, the **tubercle ruptures**, allowing _M. tuberculosis_ to spill into a bronchiole and **spread throughout the lungs**. This results in development of a **productive cough** that facilitates **aerosol spread** of the infectious bacteria (Fig. 7.1b).

* Symptoms of tuberculosis disease includes fever, persistent cough with sputum (may cough up blood), pain in the chest, fatigue, chills and weight loss.

* Death is often a result of **respiratory failure** (pulmonary tuberculosis) due to damaged alveoli which **compromise gaseous exchange**.

* Due to a compromised immune system, HIV-positive individuals have a higher chance of developing tuberculosis disease upon infection by _M. tuberculosis_ as compared to a healthy individual.

### How antibiotics kill bacteria

Learning outcome:

Describe the modes of action of antibiotics, including penicillin, on bacteria.

* Antibiotics are chemicals produced naturally by certain bacteria and fungi to protect them against other species of bacteria.
* Ever since penicillin, the first true antibiotic, was discovered in 1928 by Alexander Fleming, it has been used extensively to fight bacterial infections. Subsequently, many other antibiotics were discovered.
* Antibiotics kill bacteria through one or more of the following ways:

1. **Interferes with peptidoglycan cell wall formation**: The cell walls of bacteria are essential to prevent the cells from bursting when water enters by osmosis. Antibiotics inhibit the synthesis and assembly of bacterial peptidoglycan cell wall, weakening the cells and causing them to burst, thereby killing the bacteria.
2. **Disrupts cell membrane**: A disruption or damage of the lipid bilayer could allow the cell contents to escape, thereby killing the cell.
3. **Interferes with translation** by binding to **large (50S) subunit or small (30S) subunit of the 70S ribosomes in bacteria**.
4. **Interferes with nucleic acid synthesis** * DNA replication: by binding to and inhibiting bacterial DNA polymerases * Transcription: by binding to and inhibiting bacterial RNA polymerases
5. **Inhibits the synthesis and use of essential metabolites**, thus interfering with metabolic activities

Figure 7.2: Five mechanism of action of antibiotics.

### Mechanism of action of penicillin

* Peptidoglycan cell wall is made up of chains of modified sugars cross-linked by short polypeptides. This cross-link is catalysed by **transpeptidase**.
* Bacteria constantly remodel their peptidoglycan cell walls, simultaneously building and breaking down portions of the cell wall as they grow and divide.
* Penicillin inhibits the formation of peptidoglycan cross-links in the bacterial cell wall by binding the **penicillin \(\beta\)-lactam ring to the transpeptidase**.
* The enzymes that hydrolyse the peptidoglycan cross-links continue to function, while transpeptidase that form the cross-links do not, leading to an imbalance between cell wall production and degradation.
* This weakens the cell wall of the bacterium, and **osmotic pressure** becomes increasingly uncompensated, eventually causing cell death. (Fig. 7.3)

Figure 7.3: Mechanism of action of penicillin. The linking enzyme is transpeptidase.

### How bacteria gain resistance to antibiotics

* A bacterial population develop resistance to antibiotics due to the initial existence of a very small number of bacteria that already contain the antibiotic-resistant gene as a result of mutation. (_Topic on Biological Evolution_)
* Due to the misuse of antibiotics, bacteria population of many species have evolved to become resistant to even the most powerful antibiotics.
* The antibiotic-resistant genes confer resistance to the bacteria by coding for 1. protein pump that transports antibiotics out of the bacterial cell before they can exert effect. 2. enzyme that degrades the antibiotics. 3. enzyme that alters the antibiotics into a harmless product. 4. enzyme that alters that cell wall to prevent entry of the antibiotics.
