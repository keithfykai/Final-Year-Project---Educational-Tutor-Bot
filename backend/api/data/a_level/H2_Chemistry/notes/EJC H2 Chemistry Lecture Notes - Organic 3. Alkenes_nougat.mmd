### Hybridisation of carbon atoms in C=C

* Each carbon atom in the C=C is **sp\({}^{2}\)** hybridised, and bonded to other atoms in a **trigonal planar** manner with a bond angle of **120\({}^{\circ}\)**.

Using ethene (CH\({}_{2}\)=CH\({}_{2}\)) as an example,

* Two of the three sp\({}^{2}\) hybrid orbitals of the carbon atom overlap head-on with the 1s orbitals of two hydrogen atoms to form two C-H sigma (\(\sigma\)) bonds.
* The remaining sp\({}^{2}\) hybrid orbital overlaps head-on with the sp\({}^{2}\) hybrid orbital of the neighbouring carbon atom to form a C-C sigma (\(\sigma\)) bond.
* The unhybridised 2p orbital, which is perpendicular to the plane containing the atoms, overlaps side-on with the 2p orbital of the neighbouring carbon atom to form **a** pi (\(\pi\)) bond. The \(\pi\) electron cloud lies above and below the plane containing the atoms.

### Strength of \(\pi\) bond in C=C

* As more energy is required to break a C=C bond than a C-C bond, a C=C bond is stronger than a C-C bond. This is due to **stronger electrostatic force of attraction for the more electrons shared** between the two carbon atoms.
* The energy required to break a C=C bond is less than twice the energy required to break a C-C bond as in a C=C, the \(\pi\)**bond is weaker than the \(\sigma\) bond** because the side-on overlap of orbitals is less effective than head-on overlap of orbitals.
* In terms of orbital overlap, the C=C bond in an ethene molecule is shorter than the C-C bond in an ethane molecule as the two carbon atoms in ethene are closer together to allow the formation of a \(\pi\) bond via side-on overlap of two unhybridised 2p orbitals.

## 2 Nomenclature (using the IUPAC system)

Steps in naming alkenes:

**Step 1: Name the parent chain**

* Determine the _longest continuous carbon chain_ which contains **both carbon atoms of the double bond** as the parent chain.
* Name parent chain with the suffix -_ene_
* If there are two double bonds within a molecule, name it with the suffix '_-diene_'.

**Step 2: Assign numbers** to the carbons on the parent chain so that the carbon atoms of the double bond have the smallest number possible. (_i.e._ assign the functional group the smallest number)

**Step 3: Name every **side group** that branches off according to their position on the chain.

**Step 4: Write the name as a single word.**

* The difference in stability can be quantified by comparing the enthalpy change of combustion.

How does the enthalpy change of combustion relate to stability of the isomers?

The same products are obtained when the isomers are completely burnt in oxygen.

A more exothermic \(\Delta H_{\mathrm{c}}^{\odot}\) means that the isomer is stable because of the higher energy content it has.

## 4 Physical Properties

### Boiling point and melting point

* For straight chain alkenes, the boiling point/melting point increases as the number of C atoms increases.
* Alkenes are **non-polar molecules*
* which experience instantaneous dipole-induced dipole forces of attraction between molecules. As **number of electrons*
* (as seen from the \(M\), of alkenes) increase, the boiling point increases.
* **bigger and more polarisable electron cloud*
* **strength of instantaneous dipole-induced dipole interactions between molecules*
* **more energy*
* is needed to overcome the stronger electrostatic forces of attraction between molecules.
* The greater the degree of branching in the isomer, the lower the boiling point due to weaker instantaneous dipole-induced dipole interactions between molecules since branched alkenes are more spherical in shape. Hence, **lesser surface area of contact** between molecules.
* _cis-trans_ isomers may have some differences in their physical properties.
* _cis_-but-2-ene is slightly **polar*
* while _trans_-but-2-ene is **non-polar**. The intermolecular forces in _cis_-but-2-ene (permanent dipole-permanent dipole and instantaneous dipole-induced dipole interactions) are **stronger*
* than those in _trans_-but-2-ene (only instantaneous dipole-induced dipole interactions).
* Since boiling involves the overcoming of intermolecular forces, _cis_-but-2-ene has a higher boiling point than _trans_-but-2-ene.
* However, the melting point of _cis_-but-2-ene (-138.9 \({}^{\circ}\)C) is lower than _trans_-but-2-ene (105.5 \({}^{\circ}\)C). Why? The more symmetrical _trans_-but-2-ene molecules pack into the crystal lattice better, allowing closer approach and larger attractive forces, thus resulting in higher melting points.

### **Cracking of alkanes**

Example:

### Dehydrohalogenation of alkyl halides (_i.e._ elimination of HX)

* Alkyl halides with H and X (e.g. C_l_ or Br or I) on adjacent carbon atoms are dehydrohalogenated (eliminate HX) to yield alkenes.

A more accurate equation to represent the reaction is

Example:

* Using Saytzeff's Rule to predict major products of an elimination reaction (**FYI only**)
* Consider a reaction of butan-2-ol with excess concentrated sulfuric acid and heat. A mixture of products is obtained.
* Saytzeff rule states that if an elimination results in the formation of more than one type of alkenes, the more highly substituted alkenes (_i.e._ the one with more alkyl groups attached to the double bonded carbon atoms) will be the **most stable** alkene formed.
* The most stable alkene is the **major product** (_i.e._ the product formed in greater amounts).

## 6 Reactions of Alkenes

### Combustion

Alkenes undergo complete combustion in air to form carbon dioxide and water.

### Reduction (catalytic hydrogenation / catalytic addition of hydrogen)

LO (b) Describe the chemistry of alkenes as exemplified, where relevant, by the following reactions of ethene:

(ii) reduction via catalytic hydrogenation (catalytic addition of hydrogen; see also Reaction Kinetics)

Alkenes are hydrogenated to give alkanes.

**Reagents and conditions:** H\({}_{2}\)(g), nickel (catalyst), heat

This reaction is an example of **heterogeneous catalysis**.

Hydrogenation can be carried out using more active catalysts such as platinum (Pt) and palladium (Pd) at room temperature.

Other reducing agents such as LiAlH\({}_{4}\) cannot be used for hydrogenation of alkene. Why?

LiAlH\({}_{4}\) which is a source of hydride ions, H\({}^{-}\), will be repelled by the electron-rich \(\pi\) electron cloud in C=C bond. It will not be able to add hydrogen atoms across the C=C double bond.

Applications

Catalytic hydrogenation is used to 'harden' unsaturated fats and oils in the making of margarine. It is also used in the conversion of alkenes, obtained from petroleum cracking, into alkanes in the manufacturing of high-octane gasoline and aviation fuels.

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:16]

* Alkenes, though generally non-polar, are **highly reactive** as compared to the alkanes because of the \(\pi\)**electron cloud** between the doubly bonded carbon atoms.
* These **loosely held \(\pi\) electrons** will attract **electrophiles** or even induce dipoles, creating electrophilic sites in some nearby neutral molecules.
* Alkenes are **unsaturated**, thus they undergo addition reactions. The reactions of alkenes mainly involve **electrophilic addition** reactions.
* During the reaction, the **weaker \(\pi\) bond** (due to less effective overlapping of p orbitals) is **broken** instead of the \(\sigma\) bond. In place, two **strong \(\sigma\) bonds** are formed in the saturated product.
* The **shape of the C atom in C=C now changes from trigonal planar to tetrahedral** (the **hybridisation of the C atom changes from sp\({}^{2}\) to sp\({}^{3}\)**).

* The addition of **hydrogen halides (HX)** to alkenes produces **halogenoalkanes** (**alkyl halides**).

* The order of reactivity of HX is HI > HBr > H\(CL\) The weaker the H-X bond strength, the greater the reactivity with alkenes.
* This takes place via the mechanism **electrophilic addition** with the formation of an **intermediate carbocation**.
* The electrophilic site is the partially positive hydrogen atom of HX. Hence it is the hydrogen that first adds to the alkene to give the intermediate carbocation.

**Hydrocarbons - Alkenes**

Name of mechanism: **Electrophilic Addition**

**Step 1: (Slow step)**

* In the first step of the mechanism, heterolytic fission of the H-Br bond (Lewis acid) occurs and the \(\pi\) bond of the ethene molecule (Lewis base) cleaves. This results in the formation of a bromide ion and a positively charged intermediate.

**Step 2: (Fast step)**

* In the second step, the negatively charged bromide ion (Lewis base) donates a lone pair with the carbocation intermediate (Lewis acid) to form the product.

Points to note when describing the mechanism:

* **Name** the type of reaction undergone, i.e. electrophilic addition
* Show the **movement of electrons** during the reaction using curved arrows (full arrow head for a pair of electrons).

_Remember that electrons flow from electron donor/electron-rich region (Lewis base) to electron acceptor/electron-deficient region (Lewis acid), and thus the arrow should point in the same direction._
* Show **lone pair of electrons** on Br(or any other species that reacts with the carbocation intermediate) in the fast step.
* Indicate **partial charges**, \(\delta\)+ and \(\delta\)-.
* Indicate **slow step** for each elementary step (if any).

Using **Markovnikov's Rule** to predict major products of an electrophilic addition reaction

* When HX is added to an **unsymmetrical alkene** (different R groups attached to the double bond carbons), **two products** are possible.
* According to Markovnikov's Rule, the **major product** is the one in which the H atom of the HX attaches itself to the C atom already carrying having the greater number of hydrogen atoms.

#### 6.3.3 Electrophphilic addition of halogens

The products obtained in the reaction are dependent on the solvent used.

* This reaction is conducted in the absence of uv light to prevent any free radical substitution that can happen on the alkyl groups.
* This reaction may be used as a simple laboratory **test to check for unsaturation*
* (_i.e._ the presence of the **C=C bond**). The amount of Br\({}_{2}\) required indicates the number of C=C bonds present in the molecule. For example, when ethene is bubbled into Br\({}_{2}\) in CC_4_ at room temperature (no light or in the **dark**): **Observation**: The orange-red colour of Br\({}_{2}\) in CC_4_ is rapidly **decolourised Explanation**: Br\({}_{2}\) is added across the C=C bond to give colourless 1,2-dibromoethane Note:
* Fluorine is too reactive and reacts explosively with alkenes under laboratory conditions;
* lodine does not react with most alkenes.

Hydrocarbons - Alkenes

Draw the carbocation intermediate and hence four possible products formed when ethene reacts with aqueous bromine in the presence of sodium chloride and sodium nitrate.

(carboncation formed when ethene first reacts with Br\({}_{2}\))

Why do compounds such as 1,2-dichloroane or 2-chloroethanol not exist in the product mixture?

The slow step of the reaction involves the \(\pi\) electrons attacking the halogen electrophile, Br\({}_{2}\) to form a carbocation intermediate.

The carbocation formed will have a Br atom bonded to it. Thus, all products must have at least one Br atom bonded.

H\({}_{2}\)O, NO\({}_{3}\)- and C\(\Gamma\) are all electron-rich nucleotides and thus they can attack the resulting carbocation.

Since they are electron-rich, they will NOT be attacked by ethene in the slow step.

Hydroocarbons - Alkenes

1 Reaction of ethene with bromine in the presence of aqueous sodium chloride gives a mixture of products. Which pair of products will be included in this mixture?

2 Which of the following is **not** a product formed when but-1-ene reacts with IBr(aq)?

#### 6.3.4 Electrophilic addition of water (hydration)

The addition of water to alkenes produces ** alcohols**:

* In the laboratory, this is achieved _via_ a two-stage process, involving reaction of the alkene with concentrated sulfuric acid in the cold to give an alkyl hydrogensulfate, which is then _hydrolysed_ by warming with water to give the alcohol:* Industrially, the reaction is performed using **steam** with **phosphoric acid catalyst under high temperature and pressure**:

* Water is not a good electrophile, hence, the addition of water has to be acid-catalysed.
* Hydration of **unsymmetrical** alkenes follows Markovnikov's rule.

* **At the end of these sections, you must be able to:**

* Describe the reagents and conditions for reactions that alkenes undergo:
* Reduction of alkenes
* Electrophilic addition of hydrogen halides, halogens (in inert solvent and in water), water
* Explain what electrophiles are and why alkenes generally reacts with it.
* Compare and explain the differences in general reactivity of alkanes and alkenes.
* Describe the mechanism of electrophilic addition, drawing curly arrows to show the movement of electron pairs during the reaction and label all the partial charges and/or charges of the species involved
* Apply Markovnikov's rule to electrophilic addition to unsymmetrical alkenes to determine the major product of a reaction.
* Explain the composition of products in terms of stability of carbocation intermediate 

### Oxidation

[0.5cm] LO (b) Describe the chemistry of alkenes as exemplified, where relevant, by the following reactions of ethene:

(v) oxidation by cold, alkaline solution of manganate(VII) ions to form the diol

(vi) oxidation by hot, acidified solution of manganate(VII) ions leading to the rupture of the carbon-to-carbon double bond in order to determine the position of alkene linkages in larger molecules

Alkenes can undergo different types of oxidation:

* cleavage of the \(\pi\) bond of the C=C bond (**mild oxidation**)
* cleavage of the C=C bond (**vigorous oxidation**)

#### 6.4.1 Mild oxidation (without cleavage of the C=C bond)

The reagents and conditions is strong enough to break the \(\pi\) bond but not the \(\sigma\) bond of the alkene, and hence a **diol** is produced.

[0.5cm] **Reagents and conditions:** KMnO\({}_{4}\)(aq), NaOH(aq), cold

**Observations:** Decolourisation of purple KMnO\({}_{4}\) and formation of brown precipitate (MnO\({}_{2}\))

**OR Reagents and conditions:** KMnO\({}_{4}\)(aq), H\({}_{2}\)SO\({}_{4}\)(aq), cold

**Observations:** Purple KMnO\({}_{4}\) solution is decolourised

[0.5cm] Example:

[0.5cm] **Cyclohexene is oxidised to give cyclohexane-1,2-diol.**
* This reaction can also be used as a test for the presence of C=C bond.

#### 6.4.2 Oxidative cleavage (with the cleavage of C=C bond)

In acidic medium:

* Both the \(\pi\) bond as well as the \(\alpha\) bond of the alkene are cleaved under the strongly oxidising conditions, resulting in a variety of products such as **ketones**, carboxylic acids or **CO\({}_{2}\)**.
* The oxidation products formed depends on the structure of the alkene. Therefore, vigorous oxidation of alkenes can be used to **determine the position of the C=C bond** in an alkene.

* Oxidative cleavage can be used as a test to differentiate alkenes with terminal C=C double bond and those without. For terminal C=C double bond, upon oxidation, CO2 is **liberated which forms a white precipitate when bubbled through limewater, Ca(OH)2.**
* The carboxylic acids HCO2H and HO2C-CO2H which may be formed from oxidative cleavage are further oxidised by hot, acidified potassium manganate(VII) to form CO2 and H2O. (You have learned this under Chapter 1 on Redox reaction)

In alkaline medium:

When the medium for strong oxidation of alkenes is changed from acidic to alkaline using NaOH(aq), some of the products obtained will change. For example, carboxylate salt, RCO2 is obtained instead of carboxylic acid, and carbonate, CO32 is obtained instead of CO2. Hence, **no effervescence will be observed**.

[title=Note:

1. The difference in mild and vigorous oxidation of alkene lies in the **temperature used and NOT the medium used**.
2. K2Cr2O, is not strong enough as an oxidising agent for oxidation of alkenes.

Hydrocarbons - Alkenes

**At the end of this section, you must be able to:**

* Describe the reagents and conditions for reactions that alkenes undergo:
* Mild oxidation of alkenes
* Oxidative cleavage of C=C in alkenes
* Understand that the difference in condition determines the type of oxidation that occur.
* Determine the products of vigorous oxidation depending on the structure of the alkene, and the medium that was used (acidic or alkaline).
* Use the products of vigorous oxidation to determine the structure of the alkene.

## 7 Chemical Tests for Alkenes

* The following reactions may be used as test for unsaturation because they give rise to easily observable colour changes:

### Heating under reflux

Some organic reactions like the elimination of HX from halogenalkanes and vigorous oxidation of alkenes require heating under reflux condition.

A reflux set-up is as shown:

* Heating under reflux is useful for organic reactions that are usually slow and require heat for the reaction to proceed. This condition allows substantial time for reaction to go to completion, without the need to add more solvent during the course of reaction.
* When heated under a reflux, the contents are heated at a constant temperature with the solvent boiling continuously. (i.e., temperature is kept at the boiling point of the solvent)
* In this method, any vapour produced is immediately condensed back into the reaction flask. This prevents highly volatile components, either the reactants or solvents, from boiling off and allows the reaction to go to completion.
