## 1 Theories of Acids and Bases

**Candidates should be able to:**

show understanding of, and apply the Arrhenius theory of acids and bases

show understanding of, and apply the Bransted-Lowry theory of acids and bases, including the concept of conjugate acids and conjugate bases

### Arrhenius theory of acids and bases

An Arrhenius acid is a substance that produces H\({}^{\pm}\) in aqueous solution.

An Arrhenius base is a substance that produces OH\({}^{\pm}\) in aqueous solution.

\begin{tabular}{l l} _E.g.:_ & HNO\({}_{3}(l)\) + H\({}_{2}\)O\((l)\) & NO\({}_{3}\)(aq) + H\({}_{3}\)O\({}^{\prime}\)(aq) \\ \multicolumn{2}{l}{_Note: H\({}_{3}\)O\({}^{\prime}\) is hydronium ion, which is the same as H\({}^{+}\)(aq)_} \\ \multicolumn{2}{l}{NaOH(s) + aq} & Na\({}^{+}\)(aq) + OH\({}^{\prime}\)(aq) \\ \end{tabular}

\(\bullet\) An acid-base reaction involves the formation of salt and water

### Bronsted-Lowry theory of acids and bases

A Bronsted-Lowry acid is a proton (H\({}^{\pm}\)) donor.

A Bronsted-Lowry base is a proton (H\({}^{+}\)) acceptor.

\begin{tabular}{l l} _E.g.:_ & NH\({}_{3}\)(aq) + H\({}_{2}\)O\((l)\) & NH\({}_{4}\)(aq) + OH-(aq) \\ \end{tabular}

\(\bullet\) An acid-base reaction involves the transfer of a proton from the acid to the base.

\(\bullet\) When a Bronsted-Lowry acid (HA) loses a proton, the resulting product (A\({}^{-}\)) is called the conjugate base of HA.

When a Bronsted-Lowry base (B) accepts a proton, the resulting product (BH\({}^{+}\)) is called the conjugate acid of B.
* A conjugate acid-base pair differs by a H\({}^{\pm}\).

Examples of conjugate pairs:

HCI / C\({}^{I}\)

NH\({}_{3}\) / NH\({}_{4}\)\({}^{*}\)

H\({}_{2}\)O / OH\({}^{-}\)

H\({}_{2}\)O / H\({}_{3}\)O\({}^{+}\)

CH\({}_{3}\)COOH / CH\({}_{3}\)COO\({}^{-}\)

CH\({}_{3}\)NH\({}_{2}\) / CH\({}_{3}\)NH\({}_{3}\)\({}^{*}\)

**Exercise 1**

Identify the acid, base, conjugate acid and conjugate base in the following reactions :

\begin{tabular}{l l l l l} a) & CH\({}_{3}\)COOH & + & H\({}_{2}\)O & CH\({}_{3}\)COO\({}^{-}\) & + & H\({}_{3}\)O\({}^{+}\) \\ a) & acid & base & conjugate base & conjugate acid & \\ b) & CH\({}_{3}\)COOH & + & HC\({}^{I}\) & CH\({}_{3}\)COOH\({}_{2}\)\({}^{*}\) & + & C\({}^{I}\) \\ b) & base & acid & conjugate acid & conjugate base & \\ c) & HNO\({}_{3}\) & + & H\({}_{2}\)O & NO\({}_{3}\)\({}^{-}\) & + & H\({}_{3}\)O\({}^{+}\) \\ a) & acid & base & conjugate base & conjugate acid & \\ d) & HNO\({}_{3}\) & + & H\({}_{2}\)SO\({}_{4}\) & HSO\({}_{4}\)\({}^{-}\) & + & H\({}_{2}\)NO\({}_{3}\)\({}^{*}\) \\ b) & base & acid & conjugate base & conjugate acid & \\ \end{tabular}

**Self-Check: Q1**

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|} \hline  & **Arrhenius** & **Bronsted-Lowry** \\ \hline
**Acids** & produces H\({}^{+}\)in water & donates H\({}^{+}\) \\ \hline
**Bases** & produces OH\({}^{-}\)in water & accepts H\({}^{+}\) \\ \hline \end{tabular}

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:4]

### The pH scale

Concentration of H+ can be used as a measure of acidity and alkalinity of a solution.

However, [H+] can be very small values. Hence, we can express these values as pH.

\begin{tabular}{|c c c c c|} \hline
**pH = - log\({}_{10}\) [H+]** & **or** & [H+] = 10\({}^{-\text{pH}}\) & [H+] in mol dm\({}^{-3}\) \\ \hline \end{tabular}

A solution with low pH has a high [H+], and is more acidic than a solution with higher pH.

Similarly,

**pOH = - log\({}_{10}\) [OH+]**

_Note: The logarithm used are to the base 10 (not to the base e), so make sure when doing calculations, you press the log or lg button on your calculator (not the In button)_

### Basicity of acid

* HC/ and CH3COOH are monoprotic (monobasic) acids as each acid can only lose one H+.
* H2SO4 is a dibortic (dibasic) acid as it can lose two H+.
* H3O* + HSO4: conjugate base * HSO4 + H2O
- H3O* + SO42
- conjugate base
* Conversely for bases, NaOH is a monoacidic base and Ca(OH)2 is a diacidic base.

**Candidates should be able to:**

* explain \(K_{\text{w}}\) and apply them in calculations calculate [H+(aq)] and pH values for strong acids and strong bases

## 2 AUTOIONISATION OF WATER

Water dissociates very slightly to give ions.

When [H+] = [OH+], the solution is neutral.

When [H+] > [OH+], the solution is acidic.

When [H+] < [OH+], the solution is alkaline.

We name the equilibrium constant for the autoionisation of water as ionic product of water.

\(K_{\text{w}}\).

\(K_{\text{w}}\) = [H+][OH+]_Note: [H\({}_{2}\)O] is not reflected in \(K_{w}\)_

\[\text{pK}_{w}=-\,log_{10}K_{w}=-\,log_{10}(\text{[H}^{+}]\,\text{[OH ]}\,)\] \[=-\,log_{10}[\text{H}^{+}]\,-\,log_{10}[\text{OH}^{+}]\] \[\text{pK}_{w}\,=\,\text{pH}+\,\text{pOH}\]

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|} \hline Temperature / \({}^{\circ}\)C & \(K_{w}\) / mol\({}^{2}\) dm\({}^{-6}\) \\ \hline
20 & 0.68 x 10\({}^{-14}\) \\ \hline
30 & 1.47 x 10\({}^{-14}\) \\ \hline
40 & 2.92 x 10\({}^{-14}\) \\ \hline \end{tabular} \(\text{pK}_{w}\) = [H\({}^{+}\)] [OH]

\end{table}
Table 1: Variation of ionic product of water, \(K_{w}\), with temperature [2018 P1 Q14] The ionic product of water, \(K_{w}\), is affected by temperature.

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|} \hline
**Temperature / \({}^{\circ}\)C** & \(K_{w}\)**x 10\({}^{-14}\)**/ mol\({}^{2}\) dm\({}^{-6}\) \\ \hline
10 & 0.293 \\ \hline
40 & 2.92 \\ \hline \end{tabular}

Which statement describes what happens as the temperature of water is increased from 10 \({}^{\circ}\)C to 40 \({}^{\circ}\)C?

**A** pH of water decreases and [H\({}^{+}\)] = [OH\({}^{-}\)]

**B** pH of water decreases and [H\({}^{+}\)] is greater than [OH\({}^{-}\)]

**C** pH of water increases and [H\({}^{+}\)] = [OH\({}^{-}\)]

**D** pH of water increases and [H\({}^{+}\)] is less than [OH\({}^{-}\)]

Ans: A

H\({}_{2}\)O(\(l\)) & H\({}^{+}\)(aq) + OH\({}^{-}\)(aq)

At 40\({}^{\circ}\)C

\(K_{w}\) = [H\({}^{+}\)][OH\({}^{-}\)] = 2.92 x 10\({}^{-14}\)

[H\({}^{+}\)] = [OH\({}^{-}\)]

[H\({}^{+}\)]\({}^{2}\) = 2.92 x 10\({}^{-14}\)

[H\({}^{+}\)] = 1.709 x 10\({}^{-7}\) mol dm\({}^{-3}\)

pH = 6.77

pH of pure water at 40\({}^{\circ}\)C is less than pH 7, but it DOES NOT mean that the water is not neutral! A **neutral solution has pH 7 only at 25 \({}^{\circ}\)C**. As \(K_{w}\)**changes with temperature**, pH of a neutral **solution can change with temperature**. Hence, as long as [H\({}^{+}\)] = [OH\({}^{-}\)], a **solution is neutral**.

**Steps in Calculating pH of Strong Acid/Base**

1. Write equation to illustrate complete dissociation (if necessary).

2. Determine [H'] for acids (or [OH'] for bases)

3. Determine pH or pOH using

**Acids**

**Bases**

**pH = - log\({}_{10}\) [H']**

**pOH = - log\({}_{10}\) [OH]**

**pH = 14 - pOH at 25\({}^{\circ}\)C**

**Exercise 3**

Calculate the pH of a) 0.0100 mol dm\({}^{-3}\) sulfuric acid

b) 0.00250 mol dm\({}^{-3}\) aqueous sodium hydroxide

a) H\({}_{2}\)SO\({}_{4}\)

**2H\({}^{+}\) + SO\({}_{4}\)\({}^{2}\)-**

**0.0100 mol dm\({}^{-3}\)**

pH = - _lg_ (0.0200)

**1.70**

**b) NaOH**

**Na\({}^{+}\) + OH-**

**0.00250 mol dm\({}^{-3}\)**

**pOH = - _lg_ (0.00250)

**= 2.602**

pH = pK\({}_{u}\) - pOH = 14 - 2.602**

= 11.4

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:9]

* \(K_{a}\) is temperature dependent.

* \(K_{a}\) and p\(K_{a}\) gives a good measurement of the strength of an acid, as it indicates the extent to which the acid is dissociated. The higher the \(K_{a}\) or the lower the p\(K_{a}\), the stronger the acid.

_Which of the following best indicates the strength of an acid?_

(1) \(K_{a}\) (2) pH

\(K_{a}\) best indicates the strength of an acid. It does not vary with concentration of acids. At the same temperature, a stronger acid would have a higher \(K_{a}\), indicating that it has a larger extent of dissociation of H\({}^{\pm}\).

pH only indicates the concentration of H\({}^{\pm}\)(aq) in solution. It varies with concentration of the acid. A weak acid of high concentration can give a lower pH than a stronger acid of lower concentration.

Eg: pH of 0.1 mol dm\({}^{-3}\) aqueous CH\({}_{3}\)COOH (weak acid) 2.9

pH of 10\({}^{-5}\) mol dm\({}^{-3}\) aqueous HC/ (strong acid) = 5.0

pH can only be used to compare the acid strength of two acids when they have the same concentration.

Eg: pH of 0.1 mol dm\({}^{-3}\) aqueous CH\({}_{3}\)COOH (weak acid) 2.9

pH of 0.1 mol dm\({}^{-3}\) aqueous HC/ (strong acid) = 1.0

Polybasic (polypretic) acids, such as H\({}_{3}\)PO\({}_{4}\), have more than one dissociation constant.

**Acids** & **Formula** & \(K_{a}\) / mol dm\({}^{-3}\) & p\(K_{a}\) \\ \hline Ethanoic acid & CH\({}_{3}\)COOH & 1.74 x 10\({}^{-5}\) & 4.75 & stronger acid \\ \hline Phenol & C\({}_{6}\)H\({}_{5}\)OH & 1.28 x 10\({}^{-10}\) & 9.89 & weaker acid \\ \hline \end{tabular}

If the pH is plotted against volume of base added, a titration curve will be obtained. Several possible types of titration curve are obtained.

* **Titration of strong acid against strong base / strong base against strong acid**
* **Titration of weak acid against strong base / strong base against weak acid**
* **Titration of strong acid against weak base / weak base against strong acid**

### Strong Acid - Strong Base titration

Consider a titration of 25.0 cm\({}^{3}\) of 1.00 mol dm\({}^{3}\)HCl with 1.00 mol dm\({}^{3}\) NaOH.

HCl/ (aq) + NaOH(aq) NaCl (aq) + H\({}_{2}\)O(\(l\))

_Note: NaOH (aq) is in the burette. HCl (aq) is in the conical flask. Initial pH (before titration)_

The conical flask contains only strong acid.

Eg:

[H'] = [HC/] = 1.00 mol dm\({}^{3}\)

pH = 0

_When some strong acid is neutralised (before equivalence point)_

pH increases as the acid in the conical flask is gradually neutralised by the added base.

The solution in the conical flask contains remaining strong acid and salt formed. The remaining strong acid determines the pH.

_Eg: When 24.90 cm\({}^{3}\) of 1.00 mol dm\({}^{-3}\) NaOH is added to 25.0 cm\({}^{3}\) of 1.00 mol dm\({}^{-3}\)HCl_

NaOH(aq) + HCl(aq) NaCl(aq) + H\({}_{2}\)O(_l_)

Initial amt / mol 0.0249 0.025

Amt after neutralisation/ mol 0 0.025 - 0.0249 = 0.0001

\([\)H\({}^{+}]\) = [HC/] = 49.9/1000 = 2.004 x 10\({}^{-3}\) mol dm\({}^{-3}\)

pH = 2.70

_At equivalence point_

* The number of moles of base added just neutralise the number of moles of acid present.
* The solution in the conical flask contains only the neutral salt and water formed. Hence, **pH = 7** at 25\({}^{\circ}\)C (from the dissociation of water at 25\({}^{\circ}\)C).

_When excess strong base is added (after equivalence point)_

All the strong acid in the conical flask has been completely neutralised at equivalence point. As excess strong base is still added, the solution in the conical flask contains excess strong base and the salt previously formed. The excess strong base determines the pH of the solution.

_Eg:_ When 25.10 cm\({}^{3}\) of 1.00 mol dm\({}^{-3}\) NaOH is added to 25.0 cm\({}^{3}\) of 1.00 mol dm\({}^{-3}\)HCl_,

NaOH(aq) + HCl(aq) NaCl(aq) + H\({}_{2}\)O(_l_)

Initial amt / mol 0.0251 0.025

Amt after neutralisation/ mol 0.0251 - 0.025 = 0.0001

\([\)OH\({}^{+}]\) = [NaOH\(]\) = 0.0001 0.0251+0.025 0.0251+0.025 = 1.996 x 10\({}^{-3}\) mol dm\({}^{-3}\)

pOH = _lg_ (1.996 x 10\({}^{-3}\))

= 2.699

pH = 14 - 2.699

= 11.3

The pH changes rapidly near the equivalence point from pH = 2.70 when 24.90 cm\({}^{3}\) of NaOH was added, to pH = 11.3 when 25.10 cm\({}^{3}\) of NaOH was added.

_Suitable Indicator:_

* Any indicator which changes colour within the region of rapid pH change in the titration curve is suitable: methyl orange / screened methyl orange / phenolphthalein /

### Weak Acid - Strong Base titration

Consider a titration of 25.0 cm\({}^{3}\) of 1.00 mol dm\({}^{3}\) CH\({}_{3}\)COOH with 1.00 mol dm\({}^{3}\) NaOH.

The conical flask contains only weak acid.

Before equivalence pointThe solution in the conical flask contains remaining weak acid and its conjugate base from the salt formed.

At equivalence pointThe number of moles of base added just neutralise the number of moles of acid present.

The solution in the conical flask contains the basic salt and water formed.

After equivalence pointAll the weak acid in the conical flask has been completely neutralised at equivalence point. As excess strong base is still added, the solution in the conical flask contains excess strong base and the salt previously formed. The excess strong base determines the pH of the solution.

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:20]

### Strong Acid - Weak Base titration

Consider a titration of 25.0 cm\({}^{3}\) of 1.00 mol dm\({}^{-3}\) hC_l_ with 1.00 mol dm\({}^{-3}\) hH_2.

HC_l_(aq) + NH_3(aq)  NH_4C_l_(aq)

Initial pH

The conical flask contains only strong acid.

Before equivalence point

The solution in the conical flask contains remaining strong acid and the salt formed: The remaining strong acid determines the pH of the solution.

At equivalence point

The number of moles of base added is calculated using the number of moles of acid present.

Strong adhesion in the conical flask contains the acidic salt and water formed.

[H+] = [HC_l_]_\({}_{\text{initial}}\)

After equivalence point

All the acid in the conical flask has been completely neutralised at

Vol of NH_3 added / cm\({}^{3}\)

excess weak ba strong acid + salt

and its conjugate [H+] = [HC_l_]_\({}_{\text{remaining}}\)

Suitable Indicator

Methyl orange/screened methyl orange

Consider a titration of 25.0 cm\({}^{3}\) of 1 mol dm\({}^{-3}\) NH_3 with 1.00 mol dm\({}^{-3}\) hC_l_.

HC_l_(aq) + NH_3(aq)  NH_4C_l_(aq)

Weak base only

equivalence point

acidic salt

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:22]

Consider a mixture of

NH\({}_{3}\) - weak base

NH\({}_{4}\)C\(I\) - contains its conjugate acid NH\({}_{4}\)\({}^{*}\)

On adding a small amount of OH\({}^{*}\)

OH\({}^{-}\) + NH\({}_{4}\)\({}^{*}\) NH\({}_{3}\) + H\({}_{2}\)O

The small amount of added OH\({}^{*}\) is removed by the large amount of NH\({}_{4}\)\({}^{*}\)in the buffer.

On adding a small amount of H\({}^{*}\)

H\({}^{+}\) + NH\({}_{3}\) NH\({}_{4}\)\({}^{*}\)

The small amount of added H\({}^{*}\) is removed by the large amount of NH\({}_{3}\) in the buffer.

Therefore, pH remains almost unchanged.

### Uses of Buffer Solutions

Buffer solutions are used in situations where it is necessary to maintain pH.

In many biological systems, a change in pH can have a great effect on the functioning of a cell. Therefore, they are usually buffered.

**Blood buffer system of H2CO3 and HCO3-**

The pH of human blood must be maintained within a narrow range of 7.35 - 7.45. The buffer in blood consists of a mixture carbonates (HCO3-/H2CO3).

The cells in our body produce CO2 as a product of aerobic respiration. CO2 dissolves with water in the blood to form carbonic acid, which dissociates partially to give hydrogen carbonate.

H2CO3 - HCO3 + H+

H2CO3/HCO3- forms a buffer system in blood.

When [H+] in the blood increases (e.g. from the lactic acid which is produced during exercise), HCO3- reacts with H+, decreasing the [H+] and helps keep the pH almost constant.

H+ + HCO3-

H2CO3

When [H+] in the blood decreases (e.g: from hyperventilation), the position of equilibrium shifts right, increasing the [H+] and helps keep the pH almost constant.

H2CO3 + OH- HCO3- + H2O

When [OH+] in the blood increases, H2CO3 reacts with OH-, decreasing the [OH-] and helps keep the pH almost constant.

The blood buffer system
