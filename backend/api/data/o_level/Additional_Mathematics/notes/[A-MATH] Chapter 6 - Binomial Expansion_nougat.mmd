## Binomial Theorem

An expression which contains two terms

Can be written in 3 different ways:

**Expression 1:**

\[(\alpha+b)^{n}=\left(\begin{smallmatrix}m\\ 0\end{smallmatrix}\right)\alpha^{n}+\left(\begin{smallmatrix}m\\ 1\end{smallmatrix}\right)\alpha^{n-1}b+\left(\begin{smallmatrix}m\\ 2\end{smallmatrix}\right)\alpha^{n-2}b^{2}+\cdots+\left(\begin{smallmatrix}m \\ r\end{smallmatrix}\right)\alpha^{n-r}b^{r}\]

**Expression 2:**

\[(\alpha+b)^{n}=\begin{smallmatrix}\alpha^{n}\alpha^{n}+\begin{smallmatrix} \mathcal{C}_{1}\alpha^{n-1}b+\mathcal{C}_{2}\alpha^{n-2}b^{2}+\cdots+ \begin{smallmatrix}\mathcal{C}_{r}\alpha^{n-r}b^{r}\end{smallmatrix}\end{smallmatrix}\]

**Expression 3:**

\[(\alpha+b)^{n}=\alpha^{n}+(n)\alpha^{n-1}b+\left(\frac{n(n-1)}{2}\right)\alpha^ {n-2}b^{2}+\cdots+\left(\frac{n(n-1)\ldots(n-r+1)}{(1)(2)\ldots(r)}\right)\alpha ^{n-r}b^{r}\]
## Example:

Find the coefficient of \(x^{0}\) of the expansion of Solution

We first find the \((r+1)^{\text{th}}\) term

\[(r+1)^{\text{th}}\] term \[=\binom{\frac{1}{2}}{r}(2x^{2})^{12-r}(-1)^{r}(x^{2})^{12-r}(x)^{-r}\] \[=\binom{\frac{1}{2}}{r}(2)^{12-r}(-1)^{r}(x^{2})^{42-3r}\]

For the term in \(x^{0}\), by comparison, At this junction, if you get a \(r\) value where it is NOT an integer, please review your workings again as this is not possible

\[(-1)^{r}=(-1)^{r}(x)^{-r}\]

We split up the constants and variables as such by first moving the variables to the numerator via the negative power trick (indices law from Chapter 2: indices & Surds)

Always factor out the \((-1)\) if there is a negative sign in the expression Example: [Common Exam Question Type]

Find, in ascending powers of \(x\), the first three terms of the expansion of

\[\left(\frac{1}{3x}-2x^{2}\right)^{6}\]

"Hence, or otherwise, find the term independent of \(x\) in the expansion of

\[\left(\frac{1}{3x}-2x^{2}\right)^{6}(5+x^{2})\]

Solution

\[\left(\frac{1}{3x}-2x^{2}\right)^{6} =\] \[= \frac{1}{729}x^{4}-\frac{4}{81}x^{3}+\frac{20}{27}+\cdots\]

The independent term of \(x\) for the expansion will be

\[\left(\frac{1}{3x}-2x^{2}\right)^{6}(5+x^{3}) =\] \[= \cdots+\left(-\frac{4}{81}x^{3}\right)(x^{3})+\left(\frac{20}{27 }\right)(5)+\cdots\] \[= \frac{53}{81}\]

The second part of this question is commonly tested in exams where students will be required to find another term of \(x\) in another similar expansion

\[\left(\frac{1}{3x}-2x^{2}\right)^{4}\underbrace{\left(5+x^{2}\right)}_{ \text{Additional Term}}\]

Always use the additional term added to help you solve the question. Many students will disregard the implications of that additional term

Since we are required to find the independent term of \(x\), students should ask themselves which term multiplied by each of the terms in the additional term is required to get the independent term of \(x\). Each of the unique terms in the additional term MUST be used once.

\[\left(\frac{1}{729}x^{4}-\frac{4}{81}x^{3}+\frac{20}{27}+\cdots\right)(5+x^{ 2})\]

To use the \(x^{1}\) term, we need to use the \(x^{-3}\)

To use the constant 5, we need to use the other constant
