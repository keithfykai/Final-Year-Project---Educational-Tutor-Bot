**Ovum (Egg cell)**

- wide (almost 50 times larger than sperm)
* Has a large nucleus containing haploid set of chromosomes.
* Has **abundant cytoplasm** which may contain a small amount of yolk.
* **Surrounded** by a plasma membrane and an **outer membrane.**

## Key Concept

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:9]

## Fertilisation

1. During sexual intercourse, **semen** containing sperms is **deposited into the vagina** of a woman.
2. The **sperms swim up the outducts** and encounter the ovum.
3. The **acrosome** of the sperms release **enzymes** to disperse the layer of cells surrounding the ovum and break down the outer membrane of the ovum.
4. **The sperm nucleus fuses with the egg nucleus.** This process is called **fertilisation**, **forming zygote**
5. The plasma membrane of the egg undergoes a change as soon as a single sperm has entered, preventing other sperms from entering.
6. The remaining sperms eventually die.

**FERTILE PERIOD**

* The **fertile phase** of the cycle is from **day 11 to 17**.
* This is because **sperms can survive for 2 to 3 days** in the female reproductive system, thus **sperms** deposited in the vagina from **day 11** onwards **can fertilise the ovum** which is **released on day 14** from the ovaries
* The **ovum can survive for 1 to 2 days** after ovulation; hence fertilisation is possible up till day 17.
* Other days of the menstrual cycle are infertile phase.

## 6 Implementation

After fertilisation, the level of **progesterone** will continue to **remain high** to **maintain the uterine lining**, so zygote **can be implanted** into the uterine lining and continue to **grow and develop into a foetus**

**Implantation**

1. **Cilia** lining the oviduct **sweep** the fertilised egg or zygote along the oviduct.
2. **Peristaltic movement** of the oviduct also help the zygote move towards the uterus.
3. The **zygote divides by mitosis** to form a hollow ball of cells called the **embryo**.
4. It takes about **five days** for the embryo to reach the uterus.
5. The developing embryo moves down the uterus and eventually embeds itself in the uterine lining.
