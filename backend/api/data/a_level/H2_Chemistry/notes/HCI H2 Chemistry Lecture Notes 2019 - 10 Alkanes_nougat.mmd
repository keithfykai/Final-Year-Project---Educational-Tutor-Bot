## 1 Introduction

Alkanes are the simplest and least reactive of the homologous series found in organic chemistry. The only two types of bonds contained in alkanes, C-C and C-H, are strong and non-polar. The C-C and C-H bonds are essentially non-polar due to similarity in electronegativities and hence unreactive towards polar reagents.

The chart below describes different types of hydrocarbons and some examples of them.

### Straight-chain alkanes

Straight-chain alkanes are named according to the number of carbon atoms in their chain with an _ane_ suffix.

#### Examples

1. Locate the longest continuous chain of carbon atoms; this chain determines the parent name for the alkanes.
2. Number the longest chain beginning with the end of the chain nearer to the substituent, if any.
3. Use the numbers obtained by application of rule no. 2 to designate the location of the substituent group.
4. When two or more substituents are present, give each substituent a number corresponding to its location on the longest chain, cite them in alphabetical order. The number prefixes _di-_tri-_tetra-_, etc. are ignored in alphabetizing (refer to point 6).
5. When two substituents are present on the same carbon atom, use that number twice.
6. When two or more substituents are identical, indicate this by the use of the prefixes di-, tri-, tetra- and so on.

### 3.1 Constitutional (structural) Isomerism

Alkanes can exhibit constitutional isomerism.

The number of constitutional isomers increases dramatically as the number of carbon atoms increases. For example C\({}_{60}\)H\({}_{22}\) has 75 and C\({}_{20}\)H\({}_{42}\) has 366,319 constitutional isomers respectively.

### 3.2 Enantiomerism

Draw the structural formula of the alkane with the lowest \(M_{\rm r}\) that can exhibit enantiomerism. Draw the mirror images of the enantiomers.

### Viscosity

Viscosity describes a fluid's internal resistance to flow and may be thought of as a measure of fluid friction. The viscosity of liquid alkanes increases with increasing number of carbon atoms present as the dispersion forces between the molecules increases. In addition, longer-chain alkanes have higher viscosity as the long molecules tend to "tangle up" with one another.

The following are boiling points of various alkanes given in \({}^{\circ}\)C and at atmospheric pressure.

Figure 1: (a) Explain why the boiling point of butane is lower than that of pentane?

#### 5.1.1 Mechanism of the free radical substitution of methane by chlorine

_Step 1. Initiation_

The _CI_-_CI_ bond is **homolytically** broken to give chlorine free radicals (_CI_). The energy required comes from the light absorbed or the heat supplied.

Why are the C-H bonds in CH\({}_{4}\) unaffected during the initiation step? (Hint: bond energies)

_Step 2. Propagation_

The highly reactive chlorine radical collides with a methane molecule and abstracts a hydrogen atom to produce _HCI_ and a methyl radical (*CH\({}_{3}\)).

(Note: \(\Delta\)H\({}_{\rm(H)}\) + B.E.(CI) + B.E.(HC) + 413 - 431 = -18 kkmol-4 which explains why it is the HCI and *CH\({}_{3}\) being formed and not the C-_CI_ and +H)

#### 5.1.3 Ratios of products formed when an alkane has non-equivalent hydrogen atoms

As all hydrogen atoms are susceptible to substitution, when an alkane contains 3 or more carbon atoms, isomeric products are formed depending on which H atom is substituted. The proportion of the isomers depends on the probability of the intermediates formed and the relative stability of the intermediates.

Let's look at the chlorination of propane: two monochlorinated products are possible and their experimental yields are shown in the equation below. How can we explain their ratios?

\begin{tabular}{l c c c}  & & & & \\ CH\({}_{3}\)CH\({}_{2}\)CH\({}_{3}\) & \(Cl_{2}\) & CH\({}_{3}\)CH\({}_{2}\)Cl & + & CH\({}_{3}\)CHCH\({}_{3}\) \\  & & & & \\ \end{tabular}

Before we examine their ratios, let's look at the classification of hydrogen atoms in alkanes and the stability of alkyl radicals.

The following information will allow you to determine the structures of **A**, **B**, **C** and **D**.

The ratio of the four products formed can be found by multiplying the relative reactivity of the hydrogen responsible for the formation of the product to the number of hydrogen atoms in the compound that can form that product:

There is twice as much of **C** as compared to **A** in the product mixture,

**B** and **C** are both optically active.

Draw the structures of the 4 monochlorinated products and label each structure (**A**, **B**, **C** or **D**). Explain your answer.

Although the combustion of alkanes is highly exothermic, it also has a high activation energy. For example, a mixture of methane and oxygen is stable unless ignited by a spark. The reaction, once started, accelerates explosively due to large amount of heat liberated.

Alkanes only burn in the gaseous state: Liquid and solid alkanes must be vapourised before they will burn.

When they are burnt in a limited supply of oxygen (incomplete combustion), carbon (soot) and carbon monoxide are also formed and these have adverse environmental consequences.

Petroleum is an important energy source. However, it is a finite resource [a resource that does not renew itself at a sufficient rate for sustainable economic extraction in meaningful human timeframes]. The world has a limited supply of petroleum, and current estimations tell us that within the next few decades mankind will have completely depleted this valuable natural resource.

### Environmental consequences of the use of hydrocarbons

#### 6.2.1 Carbon monoxides and unburnt hydrocarbons

Carbon monoxide and unburnt hydrocarbons arise due to incomplete combustion of the fuel, which may be caused by various factors such as short reaction time in the internal combustion engine; poor maintenance of the engine and a lack of oxygen supply in the engine.

Carbon monoxide is a dangerous pollutant as it binds irreversibly with hemoglobin in blood by forming a stable complex and reduces the capacity of hemoglobin to transport oxygen. This causes drowsiness, headaches and is fatal above 2000 ppm being odorless, it gives no warning of its presence.

Unburnt hydrocarbons by themselves cause little damage, but in the presence of sunlight, they react with oxygen, ozone and oxides of nitrogen to form _photochemical smog_ (read Section 6.2.2 below).

#### 6.2.2 Oxides of nitrogen

NO and NO\({}_{2}\), collectively known as NO\({}_{\alpha}\), are formed inside the combustion chambers of motor vehicles. At the high temperature of combustion, atmospheric nitrogen and oxygen combine to form NO which is further oxidized to NO\({}_{2}\),

Oxides of nitrogen irritate lungs, cause bronchitis and pneumonia and lower resistance to respiratory infections. They often result in the formation of _photochemical smog_ where the strong sunlight interacts with pollutant gas causing a complex series of photochemical reactions which produce a choking mixture of ozone, NO\({}_{\alpha}\) and other gases. Photochemical smog has a harmful effect on plants. It may also result in chest pains and breathing difficulties in children.

NO\({}_{2}\) dissolves in water to give a mixture of nitrous (HNO\({}_{2}\)) and nitric (HNO\({}_{3}\)) acids:

NO\({}_{2}\) also catalyses the formation of SO\({}_{3}\) from SO\({}_{2}\). SO\({}_{3}\) then dissolves in water to form H\({}_{2}\)SO\({}_{4}\).

NO\({}_{2}\) also catalyses the formation of SO\({}_{3}\) from SO\({}_{2}\). SO\({}_{3}\) then dissolves in water to form H\({}_{2}\)SO\({}_{4}\).

NO\({}_{2}\)(g) + NO\({}_{2}\)(g) \(\rightarrow\) SO\({}_{3}\)(g) + NO(g)

HNO\({}_{3}\) and H\({}_{2}\)SO\({}_{4}\) are strongly acidic. When they are present in rainwater, they produce _acid rain_. Acid rain renders farm land unsuitable for cultivation (due to the acidity of the soil), causes corrosion of buildings and other man-made structures, and adversely affects marine lives (due to increased acidity of water). In addition, NO\({}_{2}\) can be easily regenerated by atmospheric oxygen:

#### 6.2.3 Enhanced greenhouse effect

The "greenhouse effect" is the heating of the Earth due to the presence of greenhouse gases. It is named this way because of a similar effect produced by the glass panes of a greenhouse. Increase in the amount of greenhouse gases in the Earth's atmosphere enhances the greenhouse effect.

As concentration of greenhouse gases increases, there will be a greater proportion of radiation trapped in the atmosphere, resulting in an increase in global temperatures.

Many chemical compounds present in Earth's atmosphere behave as 'greenhouse gases'. These are gases which allow direct sunlight (relative shortwave energy) to reach the Earth's surface unobstructed. As the shortwave energy (that is in the visible and ultraviolet portion of the spectra) heats the surface, longer-wave (infrared) energy (heat) is re-radiated to the atmosphere. Greenhouse gases absorb this energy, thereby allowing less heat to escape back to space, and 'trapping' it in the lower atmosphere.

Many greenhouse gases occur naturally in the atmosphere, such as **carbon dioxide**, methane, water vapour, and nitrous oxide, while others are synthetic. Those that are man-made include the chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) and perfluorocarbons (PFCs), as well as sulfur hexafluoride (SF\({}_{6}\)). Atmospheric concentrations of both the natural and man-made gases have been rising over the last few centuries due to the industrial revolution. As the global population has increased and our reliance on fossil fuels (such as coal, oil and natural gas) has been firmly solidified, so emissions of these gases have risen. While gases such as carbon dioxide occur naturally in the atmosphere, through our interference with the carbon cycle (through burning forest lands, or mining and burning coal), we artificially move carbon from solid storage to its gaseous state, thereby increasing atmospheric concentrations, making carbon dioxide a major greenhouse gas.

Figure 5: Illustration of greenhouse effect

#### Impact of Methane on the Environment

Methane is one of literally millions of compounds in the carbon cycle, but one of the most abundant. It is formed when carbon-containing compounds decompose in the absence of air (anaerobic conditions). The organisms that bring this about are called methanogens. Each year an estimated \(5\times 10^{14}\) g of biologically produced methane is released into the atmosphere. This vast amounts of methane produced in the biosphere have been touted as a renewable, carbon neutral energy source. However, this also carries particular significance to the global climate because methane is a highly potent greenhouse gas, with a greenhouse factor \(\sim\)30. Although present at much lower concentrations in the atmosphere than CO2, methane currently accounts for \(\sim\)20% of the radiative forcing of all greenhouse gases.

Figure 6: U.S. greenhouse gas emissions by gas, 2009A catalytic converter removes pollutant gases from the exhaust by oxidizing or reducing them. The exhaust gases, pass through a converter containing an alloy of platinum or rhodium. The mechanism of the reaction is that of a heterogeneous catalyst reaction (recall Topic 6 Reaction kinetics for the mechanism). The harmful gases are adsorbed onto the surface on the metals, go through a reaction and then the harmless gas products desorb from the surface.

Three main pollutants (CO, NOx and unburnt hydrocarbons) are removed from exhaust gases by the catalytic converter. According to the following equations, these harmful gases are converted into less harmful CO2, N2 and water vapour.

However, catalytic converters only work with unleaded petrol because lead 'poisons' the catalyst in the converter (i.e. destroy their catalytic action).

### Importance of recycling

Recycling is a process to convert waste materials into new products to prevent waste of potentially useful materials, reduce the consumption of fresh raw materials, reduce energy usage, reduce air pollution (from incineration) and water pollution (from landfilling) by reducing the need for "conventional waste disposal and lower greenhouse gas emissions as compared to plastic production. Recycling is a key component of modern waste reduction and is the third component of the "Reduce, Reuse and Recycle" waste hierarchy.

Recycling is very important as waste has a huge negative impact on the natural environment.

* [noitemsep,topsep=0pt]
* Harmful chemicals and greenhouse gases are released from rubbish in landfill sites. Recycling helps to reduce the pollution caused by waste.
* Habitat destruction and global warming are some the effects caused by deforestation. Recycling reduces the need for raw materials so that the rainforests can be preserved:
* Huge amounts of energy are used when making products from raw materials. Recycling helps to preserve natural resources.
