The term "electricity" describes the set of physical phenomena associated with the presence and flow of electric charge. These phenomena include but are not limited to lightning, static electricity, electric current, and electromagnetic induction. Electricity is involved in powering household appliances, transportation devices, and industrial machineries; it is also used to transfer energy over large distances; and to send information via telecommunications.

This chapter introduces concepts required for the following chapters: D.C. Circuits, Electric Fields, Electromagnetism, Electromagnetic Induction and Alternating Currents.

## 1 **Electric Current and Charge**

Charge carriers (or charged particles) such as electrons, protons and ions carry either a positive or negative charge. An electric current is said to be present when there is a **net** flow of charge.

### **Electric Current**

Symbol: \(I\)

Sl unit: Ampere (A)

**Definition of Electric Current**

Electric current is the rate of flow of charged particles.

**Calculating Current**

\[I=\frac{dQ}{dt}\]

Where \(I\) is the current in amperes, \(Q\) is the charge in coulombs and \(t\) is the time elapsed in seconds.

If the current is constant, \(I=\frac{Q}{t}\)

Conventionally, the direction of current is the direction in which there is a net flow of **positive charge carriers**; it is opposite to the direction of net flow of negative charge carriers. The diagram below shows net movement of charge and the corresponding direction of current.

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|} \hline Net +ve charge movement & Net +ve charge movement & No net movement of charge \\ \hline \end{tabular}

### Drift velocity

When no potential difference is applied across a conductor, its mobile charge carriers undergo random motion similar to gas molecules in the air as shown in Fig. 3a.

The presence of a potential difference across the conductor alters this random motion such that while moving randomly, the mobile charge carriers also drift axially along the conductor as shown in Fig. 3b. This rate of change of axial displacement with respect to time is known as its **drift velocity, \(\mathbf{v_{d}}\)**.

To relate current \(I\) to the flow of individual charges \(q\), consider a small flow of charge \(\Delta Q\) through a small segment of conductor with volume \(\Delta V\) in a time interval \(\Delta t\).

The current in this segment is given by \(I=\frac{\Delta Q}{\Delta t}\).

\(\Delta Q=(\Delta N)q\)The charge \(\Delta Q\) is given by the product of the number of charge carriers \(\Delta N\) and the charge \(q\) carried by each carrier, thus

\(I=\frac{(\Delta N)q}{\Delta t}\)

\(\Delta N=n\Delta V\)Let \(n\) be the number density of charge carriers (i.e. number of charge carriers per unit volume). The number of charge carriers \(\Delta N\) is the product of the number density of charge carriers \(n\) and the volume of the segment \(\Delta V\), thus

\(I=\frac{(n\Delta V)q}{\Delta t}\)

\(\Delta V=A\Delta x\)The volume of this segment of conductor \(\Delta V\) is the product of its length \(\Delta x\) and cross-sectional area \(A\), thus

\(I=\frac{(n\Delta x)q}{\Delta t}\)

Since \(\frac{\Delta x}{\Delta t}\) is the average distance travelled by the charge carriers per unit time, we denote it as \(\mathbf{v_{d}}\) the **drift velocity** of the charge carriers.

Hence, we can relate \(I\) and \(q\) as follows:

**Relationship Between Current And Drift Velocity**

The current carried by a conductor, \(I\), is given by

\(I=nA\nu_{q}q\)

where \(n\) is the number density of charge carriers (number of charge carriers per unit volume), \(A\) is the cross-sectional area of the conductor, \(\nu_{d}\) is the drift velocity, and \(q\) is the charge carried by each charge carrier.

### 2Electric Charge

Electric charge is the physical quantity of matter that causes it to experience an electric force when it is in the vicinity of other electrically charged matter. The nature of this electric force will be further elaborated in the topic on Chapter 14 _Electric Field_.

Symbol: \(Q\)

Sl unit: Coulomb (C)

**Definition of electric charge**

The charge which flows past a point in time \(t\) is the product of current and time, if the current is steady.

**Definition of unit coulomb (not in syllabus)**

One coulomb is the amount of charge which flows past a point when a steady current of one ampere flows for one second.

**Calculating Total Charge from Current**

In general,

If the current is constant, \(Q=It\)

**Graphical Representation**

Consider a current, \(I\), at a point in space over time, \(t\).

\(I=I_{c}\)

The charge \(Q\) which flows past this point in the time interval \(\Delta t\) is determined by the **area** bound by the \(t\)-axis and the \(I\)-\(t\) curve.

Charge is quantised, which means it cannot take on arbitrary values. The smallest quantity of charge that can be carried is 1.60 x 10\({}^{-19}\) C, a value known as e, the elementary positive charge. A proton carries a charge of e, an electron carries a charge of \(-\)e; a helium nucleus carries a charge of 2e, and so on.

### Example 1

A charging iPhone 7 draws a steady current of 1.00 A from the iPhone charger.

**(a)**: Given that the capacity of the iPhone 7's battery is 7.06 x 10\({}^{3}\) C, determine how long it would take for the battery to charge fully.
**(b)**: The copper charging wire has a diameter of 0.511 mm, and the number density of charge carriers in the wire is 8.5 x 10\({}^{28}\) m\({}^{-3}\). Assuming that each charge carrier carries a charge of e = 1.60 x 10\({}^{-19}\) C, determine the drift velocity of the charge carriers.

The amount of charge entering and leaving each junction is the same (or conserved) i.e. charges do not accumulate or disappear. This implies that the current remains constant along one single conductor. Similar to energy, charges obey the law of conservation: charges cannot be destroyed or created.

## 2 Electric Potential Energy and Power

When connected in a circuit, charge carriers possess electric potential energy (or electrical energy). The electric potential energy of a charge carrier may change as other forms of energy (such as heat or chemical energy) are converted from it or to it. This section deals with the energy considerations in various parts of a closed circuit.

### Electric Potential

When such a circuit is connected to an electrical device (such as a bulb or television), current flows from a point of higher electric potential to a point of lower electric potential across the device.

In a circuit, the reference zero potential can be chosen at any point, as the **difference in potential** is the quantity that is physically meaningful. Without a **potential difference**, no charge can flow.

### Electric Potential Difference

When a charge carrier passes through an electrical component (or a resistive load), its electric potential energy is **converted to** other forms of energy (e.g. heat and light). This results in the decrease in the electric potential energy of the charge carrier and the decrease in electric potential at the point after the component.

Symbol: V

Sl unit: Volt (V)

**Definition of Electric Potential Difference (p.d.)**

The potential difference across a device is the electrical energy **converted to** other forms of energy, per unit charge passing through the device.

**Definition of the unit volt (not in syllabus)**

One _volt_ is the potential difference across a device when the _amount_ of electrical energy **converted to** other forms of energy per unit charge passing through the device is _one joule per coulomb_.

**Calculating Electric Potential Difference**

\[V=\frac{W}{Q}\]

\[[V]=V\;(\text{volts})=J\;\text{C}^{-1}\]

where \(W\) is the amount of energy converted **from electric potential energy to other forms of energy** (in joule),

\(Q\) is the amount of charge passing through the device (in coulomb).

#### Example 2 (Self-Attempt)

An electric clothes iron was connected to a 230 V voltage supply, during which it produced 720 kJ of heat.

#### 2.3.1 (a)

Calculate the total amount of charge that flowed through the heater.

#### 2.3.2 (b)

State an assumption that you made in your calculations.

#### 2.3.3 Did You Know?

Electricity in Singapore is supplied at a nominal voltage of 230 V (\(\pm\)6%). This is sometimes stated as 220/240 V.

### Electromotive Force

Electric potential energy (or electrical energy) in a system comes from a _source_. The quantity of **energy** supplied by the source is termed the _electromotive force_ (e.m.f.).

Symbol: \(\varepsilon\)

Sl unit: Volt (V)

**Definition of Electromotive Force (e.m.f.)**

The _electromotive force_ of a _source_ is the electrical energy, **converted from** other forms of energy per unit charge, transferred by the source in driving unit charge round a complete circuit.

**Determining Electromotive Force**

\[\varepsilon=\frac{W}{Q}\]

\[[\varepsilon]=\text{V (volts)}=\text{J }\text{C}^{-1}\]

where \(\varepsilon\) is the electromotive force (in volt),

\(W\) is the amount of energy converted **from other forms of energy to electric potential energy** (in joule),

\(Q\) is the amount of charge passing through the source (in coulomb).

When a closed circuit is connected to a source of e.m.f., the part of the circuit connected to the positive terminal is at a higher potential while the part of the circuit connected to the negative terminal is at a lower potential. This results in a current along the closed circuit (not shown in diagram) in the direction towards the lower potential.

Some examples of e.m.f. sources are:

1) Battery -- converts chemical potential energy to electrical energy
2) Solar cell -- converts light energy to electrical energy
3) Thermocouple -- converts thermal energy to electrical energy
4) Dynamo/generator -- converts mechanical (kinetic) energy to electrical energy

### 2.4 ELECTRIC POWER

Electrical devices _do work_ by converting _electrical energy to other forms of energy_. The more electrical energy a device converts **per unit time**, the more power it produces.

Symbol: \(P\)

S1 unit: Watt (W)

**Definition of Power**

Power is the rate at which work is done. (Refer to Chapter 5 _Work, Energy and Power._)

**Calculating Power**

\[P=\frac{dW}{dt}=IV=I^{2}R=\frac{V^{2}}{R}\]

where \(W\) is the amount of energy converted **from electric potential energy to other forms of energy** (in joules). See Appendix A for the derivation of this equation.

_Example 3_

A 230 V storage heater, drawing a current of 6.60 A, requires 18 minutes to fully heat up a tank of water for bathing. Determine

**(a)**: the power rating of the heater, and
**(b)**: the thermal energy gained by the water.

Similarly, e.m.f. sources do work by converting _other forms of energy to electrical energy_. The more energy it converts per unit time, the more electrical power it supplies _P = I_E_.

### Distinguishing between P.D. and E.M.F.

The term _voltage_ is often used interchangeably with _potential difference_ and _electromotive force_. However, the two latter terms cannot be used interchangeably as they refer to different physical quantities. P.d. and e.m.f both refer to the amount of work done per unit charge and share the same unit, the volt. However, they are fundamentally different in their energy considerations.

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|} \hline
**P.d.** & **E.m.f.** \\ (across two points) & (of a source) \\ \hline is the electrical energy **converted to** other & is the electrical energy, **converted from** other \\ forms of energy, per unit charge passing through the device. & forms of energy per unit charge, transferred by \\  & the source in driving unit charge round **a** \\ \hline  & \\ \(V=\frac{W}{Q}\) & \(\varepsilon=\frac{W}{Q}\) \\ \(W\): & amount of electric potential energy \\ **converted to** electric potential energy & **converted from** other forms of energy \\ \hline P.d. is zero when there is no current in the & \\ circuit.

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:10]

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:11]

#### Example 5

For each of the following graphs, state **(a)** whether the conductor is ohmic, and **(b)** how resistance varies with increasing current.

\begin{tabular}{|l|c|} \hline \multicolumn{1}{|c|}{**Ohmic Conductors**} & \multicolumn{1}{|c|}{**Non-ohmic Conductors**} \\ \multicolumn{1}{|c|}{(particularly pure metals and alloys)} & \multicolumn{1}{|c|}{(semiconductors, non-metals)} \\ \hline Since \(I\!\propto\!V\), \(I\!\!-\!V\) graph is a straight line & \(I\!\!-\!V\) graph can either be a straight line graph **or** \\
**passing through the origin**. & passes through origin **but not both**. \\ \hline Gradient of this straight line **is always**\(\dfrac{1}{R}\). & Gradient of this graph is **not always**\(\dfrac{1}{R}\). \\ \hline \end{tabular}

The resistance of the component for each value of p.d. is calculated using the ratio \(\dfrac{V}{I}\) (and not the inverse gradient of the tangent to the \(I\!\!-\!V\) graph).

### \(I\!\!-\!V\) Characteristic Curves

In order to investigate the resistance of different electrical components, the circuit below can be used. By applying a p.d. across the component under test, the current across it is recorded and its resistance deduced. Refer to Appendix B for the experiment procedure.

Certain electrical components possess unique electrical properties and hence display characteristic \(I\!\!-\!V\) curves which show how their resistance varies with increasing p.d. across them.

In the following sections, we will study the \(I\!\!-\!V\) curves of four devices: a **metallic conductor** at constant temperature, a **filament lamp**, a **semiconductor diode**, and an **NTC thermistor**.

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:13]

### Why is the \(I\)-\(V\) graph of a filament lamp an S-curve?

As the p.d. across the filament lamp increases, the steady-state temperature of the filament increases. An increase in temperature in the filament causes the conducting electrons to collide more frequently with the lattice ions in the wire, resulting in lower mobility of the electrons. Since the mobility of charge carriers decreases, the resistance of the filament increases.

#### 3.2.3 Semiconductor diode

A semiconductor diode is an electrical component that conducts electricity in only one direction. This direction, called the forward-bias direction, allows conduction much more easily than in the other direction which is called the reverse-bias direction.

### Characteristic \(I\)-\(V\) curve of semiconductor diode

The \(I\)-\(V\) graph of a semiconductor diode is a characteristic asymmetrical curve.

In the forward-bias direction, the graph is an **exponential curve** which begins shortly after the origin. Beyond the threshold voltage, since \(I\) increases exponentially with \(V\), the diode's **resistance is insignificant**.

In the reverse-bias direction, the graph is a **horizontal line from the origin followed by a near-vertical line**. Since \(I\) is insignificant before the breakdown voltage, the diode's **resistance is very high**.

The ratio \(\frac{V}{I}\) is not constant, hence the diode is a non-ohmic conductor.

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:15]

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:16]

_Example 6_ (Self-Attempt): Two wires \(A\) and \(B\) are made of the same material. \(A\) has twice the length and half the diameter of \(B\). Determine the ratio \(\frac{R_{A}}{R_{B}}\).

_Example 7_

A sample of resistive material is prepared in the form of a thin square slab with sides of length \(x\). If its thickness remains constant, the resistance between opposite edge faces of the sample (shown shaded in figure) is:

(A) proportional to \(x^{\,2}\) (D) proportional to \(x\) (B) independent of \(x\) (E) inversely proportional to \(x\) (C) inversely proportional to \(x^{\,2}\)

### Internal Resistance of E.m.f. Source

In practice, not all the energy provided by the source is dissipated across the external loads because real-world sources are not perfectly efficient. In the example of an AA cell, some energy is lost as heat. A useful model of a real world cell is to treat it as being equivalent to an ideal e.m.f. source in series with an internal resistor.

\begin{tabular}{|l|} \hline Symbol: \(r\) \\ SI unit: Ohm (\(\Omega\)) \\ \hline
**Circuit Representation of Internal Resistance** \\ \hline \end{tabular}

A real-world e.m.f. source with internal resistance is represented as an ideal source of e.m.f. \(\varepsilon\) in series with an internal resistor (drawn inside a dashed-line box) and an external resistance \(R\). The potential difference across the two ends of the real-world e.m.f. source is called the **terminal p.d.**, \(V_{T}\).

**Equation Relating Terminal P.D. \(V_{T}\), E.m.f. \(\varepsilon\), and Internal Resistance \(r\)**

When connected in a circuit in series with a resistor of resistance \(R\), the total resistance of the circuit becomes \(r+R\).

**By conservation of energy,**

Power supplied by e.m.f source = Power output in \(R+\) Power loss through \(r\).

\[P_{\varepsilon} =P_{R}+P_{r}\] \[I\varepsilon =I^{2}R+I^{2}r\] \[\varepsilon =IR+Ir\] \[\varepsilon =V_{T}+Ir\Rightarrow V_{T}=\varepsilon-rI\]

\begin{tabular}{|l|} \hline \(V_{T}\) & When \(V_{T}\) is plotted against \(I\), we get the graph on the left.

\begin{tabular}{|l|} \hline \(V_{T}\) & When \(V_{T}\) is plotted against \(I\), we get the graph on the left. \\ \hline \(I/\)A & The gradient of the best-fit-line gives the negative of the value of internal resistance \(r\) while the vertical intercept gives the value of the e.m.f. \(\varepsilon\). \\ \hline \end{tabular}

The symbol \(V_{T}\) represents **terminal p.d.** and denotes the potential difference between the two ends (terminals) of the source. The terminal p.d. \(V_{T}\) across the cell is less than the e.m.f. \(\varepsilon\) of the cell because there is a potential drop (\(I\)) due to current flowing through the internal resistance of the cell. The terminal p.d. of a cell is thus \(V_{T}=\varepsilon-Ir\).

### Experiment to Determine Internal Resistance

The internal resistance of an e.m.f. source \(r\) cannot be determined directly since the internal resistance is not physically separable from the source; it is not possible to measure \(\varepsilon\). Hence, the circuit below is used instead to determine internal resistance \(r\). Refer to Appendix D for the experiment procedure.

When the **switch is open**, the resistance in the circuit is infinite and the current in the circuit is zero. Hence, the reading on the voltmeter gives the e.m.f of the source.

When the **switch is closed**, the resistance in the external circuit is \(R\)+\(r\). By varying \(R\), readings on the voltmeter give the terminal p.d. \(V_{T}\) of the source and readings on the ammeter give the corresponding current \(I\) in the circuit.

A graph of \(V_{T}\) vs \(I\) allows the internal resistance \(r\) to be determined (see page 18).

### Effects of the internal resistance of an e.m.f. source on the terminal p.d. and output power

The internal resistance of an e.m.f. source causes the terminal p.d. of the source to be lower than its e.m.f. and the actual power output to be lower than its theoretical power output.

A source of e.m.f. is said to be ideal if it has no internal resistance. The terminal p.d. will then be equal to its e.m.f.

### Example 8

A battery is connected to a variable resistor and a voltmeter is connected across its terminals. When the variable resistor has resistance of 6.0 \(\Omega\), the voltmeter reading is 4.0 V. When the resistance is 10 \(\Omega\), the voltmeter reading is 4.4 V. Determine the e.m.f. and the internal resistance of the battery.

### Maximum Power Transfer Theorem

In practice, we want most of the power supplied by the e.m.f. source to be dissipated by the external load rather than wasted through internal resistance. Assuming that the power supplied by the source is constant, the power supplied to the external load depends on resistance of the external load.

For a circuit with external load of resistance \(R\) and internal resistance \(r\),

\[\varepsilon =V_{r}+Ir\] \[\varepsilon =IR+Ir\] \[I =\frac{\varepsilon}{R+r}\]

Considering the power transferred to the external load,

\[P_{R} =I^{2}R\] \[=\left(\frac{\varepsilon}{R+r}\right)^{2}R\] \[=\varepsilon^{2}\frac{R}{(R+r)^{2}}\]

When the power transferred to the external load is the maximum,

\[\frac{dP_{R}}{dR}=0\] \[\frac{d}{dR}\bigg{[}\varepsilon^{2}\left(\frac{R}{(R+r)^{2}} \right)\bigg{]}=0\leftarrow(\varepsilon\text{ is constant})\] \[\frac{d}{dR}\Big{[}R(R+r)^{-2}\Big{]}=0\]

Applying product rule and simplifying,

\[(R+r)^{-2}-2R(R+r)^{-3}=0\]

Since \((R+r)>0\), we can divide by \((R+r)^{-2}:\)

\(2R(R+r)^{-1}=1\)

\(2R=R+r\)

\(R=r\)

Hence, for the power transferred from the e.m.f. source to the external load to be maximum, the resistance of the load must be the same as the internal resistance. This is known as the **Maximum Power Transfer Theorem**.

## Appendix A Deriving the Equation for Electric Power

From the definition of power,

\[P=\frac{dW}{dt}\]

Where \(W\) is the amount of energy in units of joules converted from electric potential energy to other forms of energy.

Since the electrical device does work to move a quantity of charge \(Q\) across a potential difference \(V\), from the definition of p.d. \(V=\frac{W}{Q}\),

\[P =\frac{VQ}{t}\] \[=V\bigg{(}\frac{Q}{t}\bigg{)}=VI\]

From the definition of electric current \(I=\frac{Q}{t}\) at constant \(V\),

\[P=VI\]

Since the p.d. \(V\) across the device and the current \(I\) in the corresponding section of the circuit is proportional to its resistance \(R\), i.e. \(R=\frac{V}{I}\),

\[P=VI=(IR)I\] \[\text{thus, }P=I^{2}R=\frac{V^{2}}{R}\]

## Appendix B Determining _I-V_ Characteristic Curve of an Electrical Component

Experiment procedure:

1. Set up the apparatus as shown. Ensure that the contact of rheostat \(P\) is at the high-resistance end to minimise its resistance.
2. Measure and record the p.d. across the device \(V\) using the voltmeter.
3. Measure and record the current in the circuit \(I\) using the ammeter.
4. Repeat steps 2 and 3, varying the position of the contact to obtain at least six sets of data for \(V\) and \(I\).
5. Plot a graph of \(I\) against \(V\).

The resistance \(R\) of the device for each value of p.d. is calculated using the ratio _V/I_ (and not the inverse of gradient).

## Appendix D Determining internal resistance of source of electromotive force

### Experiment procedure:

1. Set up the apparatus as shown. The measured current on the ammeter should be 0 A.
2. Close the switch.
3. Measure and record the terminal p.d. across the e.m.f source \(V_{T}\) using a voltmeter.
4. Measure and record the current \(I\) using an ammeter.
5. Repeat steps 3 and 4, varying the contact position of the rheostat \(R\) to obtain at least 6 sets of data for \(V_{T}\) and \(I\).
6. Plot a graph of p.d. across the device \(V_{T}\) against \(I\).

## Appendix E Household Electrical Consumption

Household electrical consumption is measured in terms of energy with the unit kilowatt-hour (kWh). One kWh is the energy delivered by one kilowatt of power in one hour. 1.0 kWh = 1000 W \(\times\)3600 s = 3.6\(\times\)10\({}^{6}\) J.

Tariffs for electricity are regulated by the Energy Market Authority and revised quarterly. For the fourth quarter of 2017 (Q4 2017), the tariff for electricity is 20.30 cents/kWh while the tariff for gas is 17.68 cents/kWh.

The national average household consumption for electricity is shown below. Households staying in high-rise apartments pay up to about $110 a month on average for their monthly electricity needs.

## Appendix F Lithium-Ion Cells (Real-World E.M.F. Source)

Similarly, battery capacity is often measured in terms of charge with the unit milliampere-hour (mAh). A battery with a capacity of 1000 mAh is able to deliver a current of 1.0 A over a period of one hour, or a current of 2.0 A over 0.5 hours, or a current of 0.5 A over 2 hours, and so on. 1.0 Ah = 1.0 A\(\times\)3600 s = 3.6\(\times\)10\({}^{3}\) C.

The most popular type of battery storage is the lithium ion (LI) battery. In a lithium ion cell, lithium ions move from the negative electrode to the positive electrode during discharge, and in the reverse direction during charging. These cells typically have a nominal voltage of 3.2 V or 3.6 V

A lithium ion battery comprises several cells as shown. Cells can be arranged in series to provide a higher terminal p.d., or in parallel to provide higher charge capacity.

While the e.m.f. of an ideal source is assumed to be constant, a lithium-ion cell (and other kinds of chemical cells) produces an e.m.f. through a chemical reaction between lithium-cobalt oxide and graphite. The e.m.f. produced by the cell decreases as the concentration of reactants decreases. When the cell is no longer able to provide the required terminal p.d., it is considered to be depleted. The rate of decrease of e.m.f. depends on various factors, such as the current drawn through the cell, and the temperature of the cell, as shown in the graphs below.
