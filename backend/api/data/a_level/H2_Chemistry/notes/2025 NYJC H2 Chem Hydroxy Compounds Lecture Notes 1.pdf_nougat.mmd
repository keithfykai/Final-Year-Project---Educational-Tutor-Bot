## 1 Introduction

* Hydroxy compounds contain the **-OH functional group**.
* They can be classified as aliphatic compounds called **alcohols** or aromatic compounds, **phenols**.

## 2. Alcohols

\(\flat\) General formula for alcohols: **C\({}_{n}\)H\({}_{2n+1}\)OH** or **C\({}_{n}\)H\({}_{2n+2}\)O** where n = 1, 2, 3,...

\(\flat\) All alcohols (except methanol) are constitutional isomers (functional group isomers) of ethers.

Ethers (C-O-C), have the same general formula as alcohols but its reactions are not required in the H2 syllabus.

### Nomenclature and Classification of Alcohols

\(\flat\) Alcohols have names ending with **-oI**

e.g. Methanol, Ethanol, Propanol

\(\flat\) Examples:

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|} \hline
**IUPAC Name** & **Molecular** & **Structural** & **Displayed formula** \\
**Formula** & **Formula** & **Formula** & **(Full Structural Formula)** \\ \hline propan-1-ol & C\({}_{3}\)H\({}_{7}\)OH & CH\({}_{3}\)CH\({}_{2}\)CH\({}_{2}\)OH & H & C & O -H \\  & & & H & H \\ \hline propan-2-ol & C\({}_{3}\)H\({}_{7}\)OH & CH\({}_{3}\)CH(OH)CH\({}_{3}\) & H & C & H \\  & & & H & H \\ \hline

#### 3.1.2 Length of Alkyl Chain

Boiling point increases with increasing molecular mass in the alcohol homologous series.

\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|} \hline compound & \(M_{i}\) & b.p. / \({}^{\circ}\)C \\ \hline CH\({}_{3}\)OH & 32.0 & 65 \\ \hline CH\({}_{3}\)CH\({}_{2}\)OH & 46.0 & 78 \\ \hline CH\({}_{3}\)CH\({}_{2}\)CH\({}_{2}\)OH & 60.0 & 97 \\ \hline \end{tabular}

Reason:

Alcohols have simple molecular structure. As \(M_{i}\) increases with increasing length of alkyl chain, the **size of electron cloud increases** and **becomes more polarisable**. Hence **more energy** is required to overcome the **stronger instantaneous dipole-induced dipole interactions** between the alcohol molecules.

#### 3.1.3 Straight-chain vs Branched-chain

Branched alcohols have lower boiling points than their straight-chain isomers.

\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|} \hline compound & \(M_{i}\) & b.p. / \({}^{\circ}\)C \\ \hline (CH\({}_{3}\))\({}_{3}\)COH & 74.0 & 82 \\ \hline CH\({}_{3}\)CH\({}_{2}\)CH\({}_{2}\)CH\({}_{2}\)OH & 74.0 & 117 \\ \hline \end{tabular}

Reason:

Alcohols have simple molecular structure. The branched isomers are more **spherical** in shape, with **smaller surface area** of contact between molecules. Hence, the strength of intermolecular **instantaneous dipole-induced dipole interactions** is **weaker**, and **less energy** is required to overcome them.

### _Solubility_

\(\succ\) All alcohols are soluble in organic solvents.

\(\succ\) The first three alcohols (C\({}_{1}\) to C\({}_{3}\)) are completely **miscible** with water.

Reason:

This is due to the **hydrogen bonding** between the alcohol and the water molecules.

Alcohols with more than 4 carbons are partially miscible or immiscible with water.

Reason:

As the **length of the carbon chain increases, the instantaneous dipole-induced dipole (id-id) interactions** between the hydrocarbon chains in the alcohol become more significant. Amount of energy evolved during formation of id-id interactions between water and alcohol molecules is **insufficient** to overcome the id-id interactions between alcohol molecules and hydrogen bonding between water molecules.

#### 3.2.1 Solubility of alcohol and its applications

Alcohols are good solvents and are used in perfumes and flavourings to dissolve fats and oils. Heavier alcohols with long chains of hydrocarbons act as emulsifiers and surfactants, bringing oil and water together.

Applications:

* Ethanol is used as a fast-drying (due to its low b.p.) solvent in cosmetics and hairsprays.
* Stearyl alcohol (1-octadecanol) is a non-ionic surfactant used as a hair coating in shampoos and conditioners. As water and oil do not dissolve in each other, a surfactant has to be added to the mixture to keep it from separating into layers. Stearyl alcohol can be used as a surfactant as it has both hydrophobic and hydrophilic ends.

## 4 Chemical Reactions of Alcohols

### Combustion

Alcohols burn to give carbon dioxide and water.

e.g. ethanol burns with a pale-blue flame

CH\({}_{3}\)CH\({}_{2}\)OH + 3 O\({}_{2}\)\(\rightarrow\) 2 CO\({}_{2}\) + 3 H\({}_{2}\)O

### Other reactions of alcohols

Other reactions of alcohols can be divided into two groups: those that occur at the C-O bond and those that occur at the O-H bond.

### Ethanol as a chemical, drug and poison

The production of ethanol by fermentation of grains and sugars is one of the oldest known organic reactions, going back at least 2500 years. Fermentation is carried out by adding yeast to an aqueous sugar solution, where enzymes break down carbohydrates (sugars and starches) into ethanol and carbon dioxide:

In Singapore, binge drinking (defined as having 4 or more alcoholic drinks in one session for women, and 5 or more for men) is more common among 18 to 29 year olds - 18.7% of men and 12.2% of women. In 2010, the Singapore Mental Health Study found that about 3.5% of our citizens suffered from alcohol abuse at some point in their lives and 0.5% from alcohol addiction (or alcoholism).

A person's brain develops until the age of about 24. During this time, alcohol abuse can result in learning difficulties and social problems. Alcohol is also a known cause of cancers of the mouth, throat (pharynx), voice box (larynx), esophagus, liver, colon and rectum, and breast. Alcohol may increase the risk of cancer of the pancreas too.

The blood alcohol concentration in drivers can be tested by the Breathalyser test. It makes use of the colour change that occurs when the expired air reduces the bright orange oxidising agent potassium dichromate (K\({}_{2}\)Cr\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{7}\)) to green chromium(III) ion, Cr\({}^{3+}\).

### Alternative Form of Fuel - Bioethanol

Bioethanol is an alcohol made by fermentation, mostly from carbohydrates in the form of sugar and starch produced by crops such as com and sugarcane.

However, there are concerns about the production of bioethanol, such as the fact that it requires more energy for production than it can supply and that it directly competes for land for growing crops.

### Solubility of alcohol and its application

Alcohols are good solvents and are used in perfumes and flavourings to dissolve fats and oils. Heavier alcohols with long chains of hydrocarbons act as emulsifiers and surfactants, bringing oil and water together.

* Ethanol is used as a fast-drying (due to its low b.p.) solvent in cosmetics and hairstprays.
* Stearyl alcohol (1-octadecanol) is a non-ionic surfactant used as a hair coating in shampoos and conditioners. As water and oil do not dissolve in each other, a surfactant has to be added to the mixture to keep it from separating into layers. Stearyl alcohol can be used as a surfactant as it has both hydrophobic and hydrophilic ends.
* **Stearyl alcohol (1-octadecanol)**

## 1 Nomenclature

* Phenols have an -OH group attached directly to the benzene ring.

## 2 Structure of Phenol

* Recall: Benzene ring has a delocalised cloud of \(\pi\) electrons due to the overlapping p-orbitals of the carbon atoms.
* In phenol, the lone pair of electrons on oxygen is delocalised into the benzene ring as the **p-orbital of the oxygen atom overlaps with the \(\pi\) electron cloud of the benzene ring**, forming a delocalised cloud.

As a result,

* O bond is strengthened**, while the **O
- H bond is weakened**.
* Phenol is a relatively stronger acid than alcohol. Hence phenols can react with NaOH while alcohols cannot. (Refer to acidity of Phenols)

Therefore, ethanol is the least acidic, and POE (1) lies more to the left and ethanol donates a proton less readily than water. \\ \cline{2-2}  & **The phenoxide ion is the most stable** as the p orbital of O overlaps with the \(\pi\) orbital of the benzene ring resulting in the delocalisation of lone pair of electrons on the O atom into the benzene ring. The negative charge on O atom is dispersed over the benzene ring and one oxygen atom, hence stabilising the conjugate base. Therefore, phenol is the most acidic and POE (3) lies more to the right and phenol donates a proton more readily than water. \\ \hline \end{tabular}

[You should be able to compare the reactions of carboxylic acids with the above reagents after the completion of the _Carboxylic Acid_ & Derivatives lecture.]

### Effect of Substituents on Acidity

Phenols are **more acidic** when the ring is substituted with **electron withdrawing groups**.

The electron withdrawing groups **stabilises** the phenoxide ion by **further dispersing the negative charge on the oxygen**.

Conversely, phenols substituted with **electron donating groups** are **less acidic** than phenol.

## Summary of reactions for Phenol

## Appendix

* **Why tertiary alcohols and phenols cannot be oxidised** The general mechanism of oxidation is illustrated below.
* The hydrogen of the alcohol group is replaced by a leaving group (X in the figure below) in steps 1 and 2.
* A base abstracts the proton bound to the alcohol carbon (step 3), which results in elimination of the X leaving group and formation of a new carbon-oxygen double bond.
* **Tertiary alcohols, phenols, and carboxylic acids cannot be oxidised as they do not have a hydrogen atom on the alcohol carbon atom.** Source: **Organic Chemistry With a Biological Emphasis** by Tim Soderberg (University of Minnesota, Morris)
* **Comparison of electrophilic substitution of benzene and phenol**
