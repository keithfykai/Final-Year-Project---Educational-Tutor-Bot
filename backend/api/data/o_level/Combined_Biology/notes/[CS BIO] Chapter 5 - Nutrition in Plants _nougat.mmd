**Key Concept**

**Photosynthesis**

**Limiting Factors**

**Photosynthesis**

**Equation**

**Word equation**

\(CarbonDioxide+Water\xrightarrow{Chlorophyll}LightEnergy\) & \(Glucose+Oxygen+Water\)

**Chemical equation**

\(6CO_{2}+12H_{2}O\xrightarrow{Chlorophyll}C_{6}H_{12}O_{6}+6O_{2}+6H_{2}O\)

**Simplified chemical equation**

\(6CO_{2}+6H_{2}O\xrightarrow{Chlorophyll}C_{6}H_{12}O_{6}+6O_{2}\)

**In daylight when photosynthesis occurs, the carbon dioxide in the leaf is rapidly used up.**

**The carbon dioxide concentration in the leaf becomes lower than that in the atmospheric air, so carbon dioxide diffuses from the surrounding air through the stomatal openings into the intercellular air spaces**

**The surfaces of the mesophyll cells are covered by a thin film of moisture so that carbon dioxide can dissolve in it and diffuses into the cells.**

**Intake of water**

**The xylem transports water and dissolved mineral salts from roots to the leaves.**

**Water moves out of xylem vessels and enters cells via osmosis**
## 6.2. **Limiting Factors**

Effect of light intensity

* At a **constant** temperature and carbon dioxide concentration, the rate of photosynthesis **increases with increasing light intensity** until it reaches a **plateau**.
* When the plateau is reached, light is **no longer the limiting factor** in the reaction but other factors such as temperature and concentration of carbon dioxide. This is also called the **light saturation point**
* Raising these factors can increase the plateau
* **light compensation point** is when **rate of respiration = rate of photosynthesis**, so while rate of photosynthesis is increasing, the **net** CO2 uptake or O2 release is **zero**

# Limiting Factors

Effect of carbon dioxide concentration

An increase in the carbon dioxide concentration increases the rate of photosynthesis, until it reaches plateau

Beyond this point, rate of photosynthesis is limited by another factor such as light intensity or temperature and carbon dioxide is no longer the limiting factor.

Under normal circumstances, carbon dioxide is an important limiting factor since atmospheric carbon dioxide remains constant at about 0.03%
## 1 Limiting Factors

Effect of temperature

* Photosynthesis is a process that is highly dependent on enzymes (thus a similar graph to enzyme activity against temperature)
* When temperature increases, **kinetic energy** increases which increases the **frequency of effective collision** between enzymes and substrates, increase the **formation of enzyme substrate complex**, thus increasing the **rate of photosynthesis**.
* Rate of photosynthesis is at the maximum at optimum temperature
* When the temperature increases beyond the enzymes' optimum temperatures, the rate of photosynthesis begins to decrease until it stops as the enzymes are denatured.

## 5 Limiting factors

an example

explain the graph:

increasing light intensity increases the rate of photosynthesis as seen from increasing graph

At, light intensity is no longer a limiting factor but temperature because increasing temperature from 15\({}^{\circ}\)C to 25\({}^{\circ}\)C increases the rate of photosynthesis.

At, light intensity and temperature is no longer the limiting factor, but concentration of carbon dioxide. this is because increasing concentration of carbon dioxide to 0.4% greatly increases the rate of photosynthesis.
