## 1 Superposition

When 2 particles collide, they bounce off each other or sometimes stick together. However, when waves meet they interact in a very unique way called the principle of _superposition_:

When two waves of the _same kind meet_ at a point,

the _resultant displacement_ at the point is a

_vector sum_ of their individual displacements.

When two waves of the _same kind meet_ at a point,

the _resultant_

_displacement_ at the point is a

_displacement_ at

the point is a

_vector sum_ of

their individual displacements.

Figure 1: 1 shows how 2 wave pulses on a string interact. Notice how they pass right through each other and thereafter continue their journey as if nothing has happened. Such behaviour distinguishes waves from particles.

Figure 2: 1bIn Fig. 3, 4 & 1, sources S\({}_{1}\) & S\({}_{2}\) oscillate in phase and continuously radiate water waves of the same frequency. P is a selected point where we consider how the waves meet and superpose. To simplify things, we assume that as the waves travel from S\({}_{1}\) & S\({}_{2}\) to P, the respective amplitudes \(A_{i}\) and \(A_{2}\) do not decrease. \(|\) S\({}_{2}\)P - S\({}_{1}\)P \(|\) is called the _path difference_ (_PD_) which is the difference in distance travelled by the waves from S\({}_{1}\) and S\({}_{2}\). We shall see that _PD_ is one factor in determining the result of superposition.

In Fig. 3, P is a point equidistant from the sources. As the waves _originated in phase_ and travelled the _same distance_ to meet at P, they will meet in phase i.e. the trough of one wave will always meet the trough of the other and similarly for crests.

The result of superposition is an oscillation at P with amplitude = \(A_{1}+A_{2}\).

In Fig. 4, waves originated from S\({}_{1}\) and S\({}_{2}\)_in phase_ but waves from S\({}_{2}\) always travelled an extra _V\({}_{2}\)\(\lambda\)_ to reach P. The _different path lengths_ cause the waves to always meet at P in anti-phase(crest meet trough), resulting in cancellation of displacements by the principle of superposition.

The amplitude at P is = \(|\)\(A_{i}-A_{2}\) which equals zero if the individual amplitudes are equal.

In Fig. 5, S\({}_{1}\) and S\({}_{2}\) are in phase again but the _PD_ is now \(\lambda\) compared to \(\lambda\lambda\) in Fig. 4.

Now the result of superposition is an oscillation at P with amplitude = \(A_{i}+A_{2}\).

Whenever the amplitudes add, we say that the waves from S\({}_{1}\) and S\({}_{2}\) interfere _constructively_ and whenever the amplitudes subtract, we say they interfere _destructively_. There is no special term for situations in between constructive and destructive interference.

To generalise:

For sources S\({}_{1}\) and S\({}_{2}\) in phase, when \(PD\) = \(n\lambda\), waves meet in phase \(\leftrightarrow\) constructive interference \(PD\) = \((n+\gamma_{2})\lambda\), waves meet in anti-phase \(\leftrightarrow\) destructive interference \(n\) is integer.

When 2 waves trains meet _in phase_

_continuously_, the resulting amplitude is the sum of the individual wave amplitudes and the situation is called _constructive interference_.

When 2 wave trains meet _in phase_

_continuously_, the resulting amplitude is the sum of the individual wave amplitudes and the situation is called _constructive interference_.

When 2 wave trains meet _in anti-phase_

_continuously_, the resulting amplitude is the difference between the individual wave amplitudes and the situation is called _constructive interference_.

When 2 waves are in phase, the conditions for constructive or destructive interference are shown in the box on the left.

The difference between Fig. 1.6, 1.7 & 1.8 compared to Fig. 1.3, 1.4 & 1.5 respectively is that the sources S\({}_{1}\) & S\({}_{2}\) now oscillate in anti-phase instead. We shall see that the _initial phase difference_ when the waves are produced is the other factor that will also determine the result of superposition.

In Fig. 1.6, the initial phase difference between the waves generated at S\({}_{1}\) and S\({}_{2}\) is maintained as the waves travelled to meet at P because the paths travelled have the same distance. Hence the waves meet in anti-phase, resulting in cancellation of displacements.

Resulting amplitude \(A_{p}=|\ A_{t}-A_{2}|\).In Fig. 1.7, waves from S\({}_{1}\) and S\({}_{2}\) have initial phase difference 180\({}^{\circ}\) or \(\pi\) rad. Recall in the topic Waves that \(\lambda\) corresponds to a phase difference of 360\({}^{\circ}\) or 2\(\pi\) rad. The waves from S\({}_{2}\) travelled an extra distance of \(\gamma\lambda\) to meet waves from S\({}_{1}\) thus introducing an extra 180\({}^{\circ}\) phase difference and allowing the waves to meet in phase.

Resulting amplitude \(A_{p}=A_{t}+A_{2}\).In Fig. 1.8, the _PD_ is now \(\lambda\) compared to \(\gamma\lambda\) in Fig. 1.7. Due to the PD, the extra phase difference introduced is 360\({}^{\circ}\) or one cycle, which _in effect_ is equivalent to a phase difference of 0. Taking into account the initial phase difference of 180\({}^{\circ}\) due to the sources, the waves would meet in anti-phase.

Resulting amplitude \(A_{p}=|\ A_{t}-A_{2}|\).Again, to generalise:

When 2 sources are in anti-phase, the conditions for constructive or destructive interference are shown in the box on the left.

Fig. 2.1 & 2.2 show that coherent oscillations must have the same frequency while Fig. 2.3 shows that same frequency does not imply coherence.

If the sources S\({}_{1}\) and S\({}_{2}\) in the previous section were incoherent like in Fig. 2.2 and 2.3, the variable phase difference means that for _every_ point P, the interference may be constructive at one moment, destructive another moment and in between constructive and destructive at another moment. Thus there will not be a stable interference pattern where there are _fixed_ lines that are _always_ at constructive interference or _fixed_ lines that are _always_ at destructive interference like in Fig. 1.10.

On pages 2 and 3, the sources S\({}_{1}\) and S\({}_{2}\) are either in phase or in anti-phase which means phase difference of 0\({}^{\circ}\) and 180\({}^{\circ}\) respectively. As far as producing a _stable interference pattern_ is concerned, the phase difference can be any value as long as it is constant. Of course the conditions at the bottom of pages 2 and 3 for constructive and destructive interference would not apply for phase difference between sources that is neither 0\({}^{\circ}\) nor 180\({}^{\circ}\).

* When waves meet at a point they interfere by superposition.
* _Constructive_ and _destructive interference_ refer to the superposition result of _maximum and minimum amplitudes_ respectively.

In Fig. 3.7 a motor drives a rod to oscillate vertically and sends waves down the string. These waves repeatedly reflect off the fixed end as well as the end fixed to the oscillating rod. At _certain_ frequencies \(f_{0}\), \(f_{1}\), \(f_{2}\) etc, the opposite waves superpose to form one, two or more points of constructive interference called anti-nodes. Though the rod oscillates, its amplitude is small compared to that of the anti-nodes and it is effectively a node. At other frequencies, the many reflected waves could not meet consistently at fixed points to produce constructive or destructive interference so resulting in an unstable waveform. The stable stationary waveforms are called _resonant modes_ and the lowest frequency mode is called fundamental while subsequent higher frequency modes are called _overtones_.

As the motor's frequency is increased the wavelength is decreased according to \(\nu=f\lambda\) where \(\nu\) is fixed for the same string at the same tension. Recall that distance between consecutive nodes is \(\lambda/2\) so \(\lambda\) can be expressed in terms of the easily measured string length \(L\). We can thus show that there is a certain pattern to the resonant frequencies.

The motor's frequency \(f_{m}\) is fixed and a fixed weight provides a constant tension, thus resulting in constant \(\nu\), \(f\) and \(\lambda\). As length \(L\) is increased slowly from a small value, resonant modes are encountered at length \(L_{1}\), \(L_{2}\), \(L_{3}\) etc.

This case shows strings of different \(L\) have different fundamental frequencies.

Figure 3.8:

Waves get reflected all the time. Reflection occurs whenever there is a change in the properties of the medium (Fig. 3.9). Sometimes the reflection is almost 100% but sometimes it is partial with a portion of the incident energy being transmitted.

Sound waves can be reflected off both a closed end as well as the open end of a tube. At the closed end, air cannot oscillate so it must be a displacement node which is a pressure anti-node (recall from Waves section 4 that positions of zero longitudinal displacement have largest deviations from atmospheric pressure while the positions of greatest displacement are at atmospheric pressure). The pressures at open ends tend to equalise with atmospheric pressure, so the open ends are always displacement anti-nodes (AN). It turns out that the exact positions of the _displacement_ ANs at the ends are always at a small distance \(c\) outside the ends of the pipe. \(c\) is called the _end correction_.

Just like a string with fixed length, \(\nu\) is constant so increasing \(f\) leads to decreasing \(\lambda\). Gradually increasing the speaker frequency will lead to a series of rise and fall in loudness from the tube. The loudness maxima correspond to the resonant modes when there are ANs at the tube openings.

From the above, deduce that

\(\lambda_{c2}=\lambda_{c}/3\) : \(f_{c2}=3f_{c}\)

\(\lambda_{c3}=\lambda_{c}/5\) : \(f_{c3}=5f_{c}\)

\(\lambda_{c0}=\lambda_{c}/3\) : \(f_{c3}=3f_{c}\)

\(\ldots\)

\(\lambda_{\alpha n}=\lambda_{c}/(2n-1)\) : \(f_{\alpha n}=(2n-1)f_{c}\)

\(\lambda_{\alpha n}=\lambda_{\alpha}/n\) : \(f_{\alpha n}=nf_{\alpha t}\)

Just like for a string, the resonant frequencies follow a pattern.

First \(f\) Variable \(L\)

With fixed \(f\), \(l\) becomes fixed so the distance between consecutive nodes becomes fixed. Varying the length of the air column will thus produce resonant or stationary wave modes at specific lengths separated by half a wavelength. Hence as the length of air column is increased from zero, the first loud sound will be heard at \(L\), then at _L_\({}_{2}\), _L_\({}_{3}\) etc.

These set-ups are useful for finding the wavelength of sound. By listening for the occurrence of loudness maxima, one can then measure the lengths _L_\({}_{t}\), _L_\({}_{2}\), _L_\({}_{3}\) etc. These lengths are separated by _l/2_ so \(l\) can be found easily. If the frequency is known from the signal generator, the speed of the sound can be calculated (see Waves, end of section 6 for a slightly different set-up).

4Diffraction

Diffraction is the _spreading or bending_ of waves as they pass through an aperture or around an obstacle.

All waves diffract and this phenomenon is most easily observed in a ripple tank. Plane waves are created using a long straight edge and allowed to pass through an aperture. Fig. 4.1 shows the diffraction effect. After spreading, the wave amplitude and intensity is not uniform in all directions. Most of the wave energy is concentrated in the forward direction and there are some directions which do not get any wave energy.

Figure 3.12:

When a laser beam is directed at a small slit of about 0.25 mm wide, it will spread out with an intensity pattern as shown in Fig. 4.2 and form a series of bright and dark fringes on a screen in a dark room.

Diffraction can be explained by treating the whole medium as made up of oscillators. When plane waves reach the aperture, the aperture can be seen as a line of oscillators emitting circular waves spreading out from each oscillator. The waves from these oscillators will _all_ meet constructively only along the central line, leading to maximum intensity. In some directions, _all_ the waves meet destructively (D1, D2, D3 in Fig. 4.1b). In other directions (C1 & C2 in Fig. 4.1b), of the many waves contributed by the many oscillators, there is incomplete cancellation of displacements, resulting in an intensity between maximum and zero.

Figure 4.1: The intensity of the wave energy is not uniform in all directions.

Figure 4.2: The frequency of the wave energy is not uniform in all directions.

As seen earlier, the path difference (PD) in relation to the wavelength determines whether 2 waves interfere constructively or destructively. To get a rough idea of why the degree of spreading depends on the wavelength, we consider a point P\({}_{1}\) behind the obstacle. At P\({}_{1}\) waves from S\({}_{1}\) and S\({}_{2}\) will meet almost in phase because the path difference is very small. When waves from S\({}_{3}\), S\({}_{4}\),.. etc are also involved in the superposition at P\({}_{1}\), there will come a point when waves from one of the sources, perhaps S\({}_{6}\), will travel an extra distance of _\(\lambda\)/2_ compared to waves from S\({}_{1}\). Then waves from S\({}_{7}\) will also travel an extra distance of _\(\lambda\)/2_ compared to waves from S\({}_{2}\) and so on. The result is destructive interference or zero intensity at P\({}_{1}\) as waves from S\({}_{1}\) to S\({}_{5}\) are cancelled by waves from S\({}_{6}\) to S\({}_{10}\).

Next, if we switch to using waves with bigger \(\lambda\) in Fig. 4.3, the destructive interference at P\({}_{1}\) will happen with pairs of sources which are spaced further apart, say between S\({}_{1}\) and S\({}_{9}\). This will mean P\({}_{1}\) is no longer a point of destructive interference. However, there will be a point P\({}_{2}\) further to the left that will now be a destructive interference point because S\({}_{6}\)P\({}_{2}\) - S\({}_{1}\)P\({}_{2}\) is now _\(\lambda\)/2_ instead. Therefore,

As wavelength increases, the spreading increases.

To get a rough idea of why the degree of spreading depends on the wavelength, we consider a point P\({}_{1}\) behind the obstacle.

Then waves from S\({}_{7}\) will also travel an extra distance of _\(\lambda\)/2_ compared to waves from S\({}_{2}\) and so on.

If white light which has all the colours in it is used instead of monochromatic light, different wavelengths will have fringes of different spacing according to the formula \(x=\lambda D/a\). Violet has the smallest spacing while red has the largest (Fig. 4.8). The central or \(0^{\text{th}}\) order(PD is zero) bright fringe will appear more or less white but higher order fringes will be more coloured as the different colours are more separated.

### Two Source Interference

So far we have seen a number of _two source_ interference set-ups:

1. Two source water waves (Fig. 1.3 to 1.11).
2. Formation of standing waves including set-ups using reflector.

Reflector creates a virtual source.
3. Young's double slit (ideas apply to microwaves too).

They may look different but they are all two source interference set-ups. Sometimes one source can be substituted by a reflector which creates a virtual source like in Fig. 4.9.

Recall that for the formation of _stable_ interference pattern the sources need to be coherent. Furthermore the waves from the sources must either be _polarised in the same plane_ or both _unpolarised_. If the polarisations of the waves are perpendicular to each other, they cannot give rise to points of destructive interference.

### Diffraction Grating

Diffraction grating is usually a plastic sheet that has hundreds of slits or lines mm-1 engraved on it. Whether 2 or hundreds of slits, the mechanism is the same. Firstly, diffraction occurs when light passes through the slits, then the overlapping waves interfere to produce lines of constructive and destructive interference. When the light is intercepted by a screen, a series of bright dots/lines can be seen. These dots/lines are far more spaced out than the bright fringes of the double slit because the slits are far closer in the grating.

Figure 4.10a: Fig. 4.10b

As a laser beam is usually narrow the screen shows a series of dots (Fig. 4.10a). When the laser beam is expanded using a lens and a slit is used to direct a thin line of light on the grating, the screen shows a series of lines (Fig. 4.10b).

The grating splits the original beam into several beams. The undeviated beam is called the 0\({}^{\mathrm{th}}\) order beam followed by the 1\({}^{\mathrm{st}}\) and 2\({}^{\mathrm{nd}}\) order beams as shown in Fig. 4.9b. The angle of deviation \(\theta\) is related to the spacing of the slits \(d\), wavelength \(\lambda\) and the order of the beam \(n\):

\[d\sin\theta=n\lambda\]

Diffraction

Both the double slit set-up and grating are useful for determining the wavelength of light by measuring the other parameters.

\[d\sin\theta=n\lambda\]

Consider a typical grating that has 600 lines per mm. Using 635 nm red laser, what is the maximum number of orders visible?

\[\begin{array}{l}\text{Slit separation $d$ = 0.001/600}\\ \text{Theoretical maximum deviation angle = 90}^{\circ}\\ \therefore putting the numbers into the formula \(d\sin\theta=n\lambda\)

0.001/600 \(\sin(90^{\circ})=n_{max}(635\times 10^{-9})\\ n_{max}=2.6\end{array}\]

Since \(n\) must be integer, the maximum order is = 2

\[\begin{array}{l}\text{white light}\\ \text{source}\\ \end{array}\]

When white light which has all the colours in it is directed at a grating, from 1\({}^{\mathrm{st}}\) order onwards, the different colours(\(\lambda\)) are separated into different angles(\(\theta\)) as shown in Fig. 4.11.

\[\begin{array}{l}\text{white light}\\ \text{light}\\ \text{source}\\ \end{array}\]

Figure 4.11: When white light which has all the colours in it is directed at a grating, from 1\({}^{\mathrm{st}}\) order onwards, the different colours(\(\lambda\)) are separated into different angles(\(\theta\)) as shown in Fig. 4.11.
