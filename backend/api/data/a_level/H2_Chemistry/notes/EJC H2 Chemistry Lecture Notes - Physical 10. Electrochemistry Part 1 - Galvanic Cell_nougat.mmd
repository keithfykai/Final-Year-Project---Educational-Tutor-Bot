### The Set-up of the Galvanic Cell

Galvanic cells (or voltaic cells) are electrochemical cells in which redox reactions occur spontaneously to generate electrical energy.

#### About the set-up (also known as the Daniell Cell):

* The two reactants, Zn(s) and Cu\({}^{2+}\)(aq), are not in direct physical contact this time.
* Each beaker forms a metal-metal ion half-cell.
* The zinc and copper strips act as electrodes. The electrodes are being connected by an electrical wire (via an external circuit).
* The salt bridge consists of an inverted U-tube containing a salt solution, e.g. NaNO\({}_{3}\), K\({}_{2}\)SO\({}_{4}\). The salt chosen must not react with the ions in either half-cell. The ends of the salt bridge are stuffed with porous plugs to prevent direct mixing of the two solutions but allow the passage of ions through them. (The salt bridge can also be a piece of filter paper soaked in NaNO\({}_{3}\)(aq) or K\({}_{2}\)SO\({}_{4}\)(aq).)

#### Observations:

* The light bulb glows.
* The blue colour of Cu(NO\({}_{3}\))\({}_{2}\) solution fades.
* The mass of the Cu electrode increases, while the mass of the Zn electrode decreases.

#### What was happening?

#### At the zinc electrode:

* Zinc atoms become zinc(II) ions and enter into solution. \(\mathsf{Zn(s)}\rightarrow\mathsf{Zn^{2+}(aq)}+2e^{-}\)
* The zinc is the **anode*
* since _oxidation_ occurs at this electrode. Electrons are produced at the anode during oxidation, resulting in a 'build-up' of electrons at the anode
* anode of galvanic cell is the **negative electrode**.

#### In the external circuit:

* The electrons leave the zinc electrode (_i.e._ anode) and make their way round to the Cu\({}^{2+}\)(aq)\(|\)Cu(s) half-cell via the wire and the current generate causes the bulb to light up.

**At the copper electrode:**

* The electrons from the zinc electrode use the copper electrode as a solid conductor to bring them in contact with the Cu\({}^{2+}\)(aq) ions. The Cu\({}^{2+}\)(aq) ions accept the electrons to become copper atoms, which are deposited on the surface of the electrode. \[\text{Cu}^{2+}\text{(aq)}\ +\ 2e^{-}\ \rightarrow\ \text{Cu(s)}\]
* The copper is the **cathode** as _reduction_ occurs at this electrode. The cathode receives the electrons for the reduction reaction **cathode of galvanic cell** is the **positive electrode**.

**In the salt bridge:**

* The release of Zn\({}^{2+}\)(aq) cations into the Zn(NO\({}_{3}\))\({}_{2}\) solution causes a surplus of Zn\({}^{2+}\)(aq) cations, upsetting the electrical neutrality of the solution. Hence anions (NO\({}_{3}\)(aq)) from the salt bridge would move into the Zn(NO\({}_{3}\))\({}_{2}\) solution (and some Zn\({}^{2+}\)(aq) ions move from the solution into the salt bridge) to balance the surplus of Zn\({}^{2+}\)(aq) cations.
* The removal of Cu\({}^{2+}\)(aq) ions from the Cu(NO\({}_{3}\))\({}_{2}\) solution creates a surplus of NO\({}_{3}\)(aq) anions. Hence cations (Na\({}^{+}\)(aq)) from the salt bridge would move into the Cu(NO\({}_{3}\))\({}_{2}\) solution (and some NO\({}_{3}\)(aq) anions move from the solution into the salt bridge) to balance the surplus of NO\({}_{3}\)(aq) anions.
* Thus, the salt bridge has two functions:

* Previous direct mixing of Zn(NO\({}_{3}\))\({}_{2}\) and Cu(NO\({}_{3}\))\({}_{2}\) solutions but allows the passage of ions between the two half-cells to complete the electrical circuit.

* Helps to maintain the electrical neutrality in each half-cell.

Thus, the overall reaction occurring in the cell is:

\[\text{Zn(s)}\ +\ \text{Cu}^{2+}\text{(aq)}\ \rightarrow\ \text{Zn}^{2+}\text{(aq)}\ +\ \text{Cu(s)}\]

### 2.3 **Electromotive Force (e.m.f.) of a Galvanic Cell**

When the light bulb in _Figure 2_ is replaced with a high resistance voltmeter, a value of 1.10 V is recorded by the voltmeter under standard conditions. What does this value represent?

* The voltmeter measures the difference in electric potential between the 2 electrodes connected.
* The potential difference between two electrodes in a galvanic cell provides the "driving force" that pushes electrons through an external circuit. This potential difference is known as **electromotive force (e.m.f.)** or **cell potential**.
* The value of 1.10 V is the standard cell potential of the galvanic cell made up of the Zn\({}^{2+}\)(aq)\(|\)Zn(s) and Cu\({}^{2+}\)(aq)\(|\)Cu(s) half-cells under standard conditions.

The standard cell potential of a galvanic cell depends on the particular anode and cathode half-cells involved. If we can assign a standard potential to individual half-cells, we can then use these half-cell potentials to determine the standard cell potential for any anode/cathode combinations.

## 3 ELECTRODE POTENTIAL

### Definition

* When a strip of metal (the electrode) is placed in a solution of its ions, some metal atoms will lose electrons and go into the solution as hydrated metal ions. The electrons will be left behind on the metal. \[\text{M(s)}\ \rightarrow\ \text{M}^{n*}\text{(aq)}\ +\ n\ e^{-}\]
* Over time, there will be a build-up of negative charge on the metal surface. This will attract positive metal ions from the solution which may recombine with electrons to re-form metal atoms. \[\text{M}^{n*}\text{(aq)}\ +\ n\ e^{-}\ \rightarrow\ \text{M(s)}\]
* A dynamic equilibrium is eventually established when the rates of the above two processes are equal (_Figure 3_): \[\text{M}^{n*}\text{(aq)}\ +\ n\ e^{-}\ \rightleftharpoons\ \text{M(s)}\] At equilibrium (at a constant temperature), there will be a constant negative charge on the metal and a constant number of positive metal ions present in the solution around the metal. As a result of the separation of charge between the metal strip and the ions in solution, there is a potential difference between the metal and the solution. This potential difference is known as the _absolute electrode potential_ and is written as \(\ E\left(\text{M}^{n*}\text{(aq)}\middle|\text{M(s)}\right).\)
* By convention, the half-equation is written with _reduction_ as the forward reaction: \[\text{M}^{n*}\text{(aq)}\ +\ n\ e^{-}\ \rightleftharpoons\ \ \text{M(s)}\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ E\left(\text{M}^{n*}\text{(aq)}\middle|\text{M(s)}\right)\ \text{[units: V]}\]
* The value of the electrode potential depends on the position of the above equilibrium.
* **Positive \(\ E\left(\text{M}^{n*}\text{(aq)}\middle|\text{M(s)}\right)\)**\(\Rightarrow\) equilibrium position lies more to the _right_ **reduction** process favoured
* **Negative \(\ E\left(\text{M}^{n*}\text{(aq)}\middle|\text{M(s)}\right)\)**\(\Rightarrow\) equilibrium position lies more to the _left_ **oxidation** process favoured

Factors which affect the position of the equilibrium would therefore affect the value of the electrode potential.

## 4 Standard Electrode Potential

### Definition

* As electrode potentials depend on temperature, pressure and concentration, it is necessary to standardise these conditions if they are to be compared. Standard conditions are:
* 1 bar
* concentration of aqueous ions of 1 mol dm-3 The temperature in which the standard electrode potential is measured **should be stated**. Most measurements are made at 298 K (25 \({}^{\circ}\)C).
* A metal placed in a solution of its ions is an example of a **half-cell**. It is not possible to measure the electrode potential for a single half-cell. Only the difference in the potentials of two electrodes in a complete circuit is measurable.
* To enable comparison of electrode potentials, it is useful to measure the electrode potential of all half-cells against a particular standard half-cell (known as a _reference electrode_), which is the **standard hydrogen electrode** (S.H.E.).
* _Definition of standard electrode potential:_ **Standard electrode potential**, \(\mathbf{E}^{\circ}\), of an electrode (also known as _standard reduction potential_) is the relative potential of this electrode under standard conditions compared with the standard hydrogen electrode whose electrode potential is assigned as 0 V (normally at 298 K). The standard hydrogen electrode consists of H\({}_{2}\)(g) at **1 bar** bubbling over **platinum electrode coated with finely divided platinum** which is dipped into **1 mol dm-3 H+(aq)**.

### Standard Hydrogen Electrode (S.H.E)

* The S.H.E. consists of:
* H\({}_{2}\)(g) at 1 bar pressure bubbling around a _Pt electrode coated with finely divided Pt_ (_so that equilibrium between H\({}_{2}\)(g) and H+(aq) can be established rapidly_). The electrode is immersed in a 1 mol dm-3 H+(aq).
* _Pt is chosen for its inert property._
* By convention, the standard electrode potential for this reference hydrogen half-cell is taken to be 0 V.
* 2H+(aq) + 2e-
* _Pt is chosen for its inert property._
* Note that if standard conditions are not achieved, \(E\left(\text{H}^{\prime}\left(\text{aq}\right)\middle|\text{H}_{2}\left(\text{ g}\right)\right)\) is not zero.

Figure 4: Standard Hydrogen ElectrodeElectrochemistry(Part1)GalvanicCell ```

_Other Reference Electrodes (Enrichment)_

Although the S.H.E. is a useful reference electrode because \(E^{\circ}\left(H^{+}\left(aq\right)\right|H_{2}\left(g\right)\right)=0V\), the cell itself is not very convenient to use. A cylinder of H\({}_{2}\) is needed and the pressure must be maintained at exactly 1 bar. A range of other reference electrodes is available, e.g. the AgCl\(|\)Ag electrode (commonly used in pH meters) and the Hg\({}_{2}\)Cl\({}_{2}|\)Hg electrode (commonly known as the calomel electrode).

### Measuring Standard Electrode Potentials

* The following conditions must be used for measurement of standard electrode potentials:
* All solutions have a concentration of **1 mol dm-3** of the ions concerned.
* Any gas involved has a pressure of **1 bar**.
* **Platinum** is used as the electrode when the half-cell system does not include a metal.
* The voltmeter must have high resistance so that negligible current flows and the maximum potential difference can be measured.
* Measurements are usually made at **298 K** (25 \({}^{\circ}\)C). Temperature should be stated.
* The three most common types of half-cells involve: 1. a metal in contact with its ions in aqueous solution (_e.g._ Zn\({}^{2+}\left(aq\right)Zn(s)\) half-cell) 2. a non-metal in contact with its ions in aqueous solution (_e.g._ H\({}^{+}\left(aq\right)\)H\({}_{2}\left(g\right)\) half-cell) 3. ions of the same element in different oxidation states (_e.g._ Fe\({}^{3+}\left(aq\right)\)Fe\({}^{2+}\left(aq\right)\) half-cell)

**Case 1:**

**Electrons flow from metal electrode to S.H.E.**

_Example:_

_Zn\({}^{2*}\)(aq) + 2e\({}^{-}\)\(\rightleftharpoons\) Zn(s)_

Observations: Zn electrode decreases in mass with time \(\Rightarrow\)_Zn(s) oxidised to give Zn\({}^{2*}\)(aq)_;

Bubbles of H\({}_{2}\)(g) formed at surface of Pt electrode \(\Rightarrow\)_H\({}^{*}\)(aq) reduced to give H\({}_{2}\)(g)_;

Polarity of electrode: Zn electrode (anode) is the **negative** electrode,

Pt electrode of S.H.E. (cathode) is the **positive** electrode.

Voltmeter reads 0.34 V.

Direction of \(e^{-}\) flow: From Pt electrode of S.H.E. (anode) to Cu electrode (cathode)

Polarity of electrode: Pt electrode of S.H.E. (anode) is the **negative** electrode,

\(\therefore\): Cu\({}^{2*}\)(aq) + 2e\({}^{-}\)\(\rightleftharpoons\) Cu(s) \(\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\)\(E^{\circ}\left(Cu^{2+}\left(aq\right)\left|Cu(s\right)\right)\) = +0.34 V

### Predict Feasibility of Redox Reactions

To predict whether a redox reaction occurs, \(\mathbf{E}_{\text{eq}}^{\odot}\) is calculated.

* If \(\mathbf{E}_{\text{eq}}^{\odot}>0\) V, the forward reaction is **energetically feasible**, _i.e._ reaction is expected to be spontaneous under standard conditions.
* If \(\mathbf{E}_{\text{eq}}^{\odot}<0\) V, the forward reaction is **NOT energetically feasible**. However, the reverse reaction is expected to be spontaneous under standard conditions if the required reactants are available.
* If \(\mathbf{E}_{\text{eq}}^{\odot}=0\) V, an **equilibrium** is established. _(Note: In the case where \(E_{\text{eq}}^{\odot}\) = 0 V in a galvanic cell, there is no flow of electrons since there is no potential difference between the two half-cells, i.e. no current flows.)_

_Example:_ Use relevant data in the _Data Booklet_ to decide which of these reactions will proceed spontaneously under standard conditions.

* \(\text{I}_{2}(\text{aq})\) + \(2\text{Fe}^{2+}(\text{aq})\) \(\rightarrow\)\(2\text{I}^{-}(\text{aq})\) + \(2\text{Fe}^{3+}(\text{aq})\) \[\text{I}_{2}(\text{aq})\) + \(2\text{e}^{-}\)\(\rightleftharpoons\)\(2\text{I}^{-}(\text{aq})\)\(E^{\odot}=+0.54\) V \[\text{Fe}^{3+}(\text{aq})\) + \(\text{e}^{-}\)\(\rightleftharpoons\)\(\text{Fe}^{2+}(\text{aq})\)\(E^{\odot}=+0.77\) V

\[\mathbf{E}_{\text{eq}}^{\odot}=+0.54-\left(+0.77\right)=-0.23\text{ V}\]

Since \(\mathbf{E}_{\text{eq}}^{\odot}<0\), the reaction is not spontaneous.

* \(\text{Cr}_{2}\text{O}^{\gamma 2}(\text{aq})\) + \(14\text{H}^{+}(\text{aq})\) + \(6\text{I}^{-}(\text{aq})\) \(\rightarrow\)\(2\text{Cr}^{3+}(\text{aq})\) + \(7\text{H}_{2}\text{O}(\text{I})\) + \(3\text{I}_{2}(\text{aq})\) \(\text{Cr}_{2}\text{O}^{\gamma 2}(\text{aq})\) + \(14\text{H}^{+}(\text{aq})\) + \(6\text{e}^{-}\)\(\rightleftharpoons\)\(\text{Cr}^{3+}(\text{aq})\) + \(7\text{H}_{2}\text{O}(\text{I})\)\(E^{\odot}=+1.33\) V \[\text{I}_{2}(\text{aq})\) + \(2\text{e}^{-}\)\(\rightleftharpoons\)\(2\text{I}^{-}(\text{aq})\)\(E^{\odot}=+0.54\) V

\[\mathbf{E}_{\text{eq}}^{\odot}=+1.33-\left(+0.54\right)=+0.79\text{ V}\]

Since \(\mathbf{E}_{\text{eq}}^{\odot}>0\), the reaction is spontaneous.

* \(2\text{Fe}^{3+}(\text{aq})\) + \(\text{Br}_{2}(\text{aq})\) \(\rightarrow\)\(2\text{Fe}^{2+}(\text{aq})\) + \(2\text{Br}^{-}(\text{aq})\) \(\text{Fe}^{3+}(\text{aq})\) + \(e^{-}\)\(\rightleftharpoons\)\(\text{Fe}^{2+}(\text{aq})\)\(E^{\odot}=+0.77\) V \[\text{Br}_{2}(\text{aq})\) + \(2\text{e}^{-}\)\(\rightleftharpoons\)\(2\text{Br}^{-}(\text{aq})\)\(E^{\odot}=+1.07\) V

No reaction because \(\text{Fe}^{3+}\) and \(\text{Br}_{2}\) cannot both be reduced at the same time.

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:19]

## 7 Limitations of Standard Electrode Potentials

* \(E^{\circ}\) values tell us whether a reaction is possible (_i.e. energetic stability_), but not the rate of the reaction (_i.e. kinetic stability_). _e.g._ \(E^{\circ}\) values predict that Cu\({}^{2+}\)(aq) should oxidise H\({}_{2}\)(g) to H\({}^{+}\)(aq): \[\text{Cu}^{2+}\text{(aq) + H}_{2}\text{(g) }\rightarrow\text{Cu(s) + 2H}^{+}\text{(aq)}\qquad\qquad E^{\circ}_{\text{col}}=+0.34\ \text{V}\] However no reaction occurs when hydrogen is bubbled into copper(II) sulfate solution because the reaction rate is effectively zero due to the high activation energy. The reaction is said to be energetically feasible but kinetically not feasible.
* \(E^{\circ}\) values relate only to standard conditions. Changes in temperature, pressure and concentration will affect the values of electrode potentials. _e.g._ Cu\({}^{2+}\)(aq) + 2e\({}^{-}\)\(\rightleftharpoons\) Cu(s) \(E^{\circ}=+0.34\ \text{V}\) (_i.e._ conditions of 1.0 mol dm\({}^{-3}\) Cu\({}^{2+}\)(aq) at 298 K and 1 atm) But when 0.1 mol dm\({}^{-3}\) Cu\({}^{2+}\)(aq) is used at 298 K and 1 atm, the electrode potential becomes +0.31 V.

* _Example 6D(b)_, it is predicted that acidified Cr\({}_{2}\)O\({}^{2-}\) ions cannot oxidise C\({}^{L}\) ions to give C\({}_{L}\) gas. However, when acidified K\({}_{2}\)Cr\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{7}\) solution is added to concentrated HC\({}_{L}\), C\({}_{L}\) gas is readily formed. Explain. _Cl\({}_{2}\)(g) + 2e\({}^{-}\)\(\rightleftharpoons\) 2Cl\({}^{-}\)(aq) (') [Cl\({}^{-}\)(aq)] in conc. HC\({}_{1}\) is greater than 1 mol dm\({}^{-3}\) and hence the equilibrium position of (') shifts to the giving rise to a As a result, \(E_{\text{col}}=E\left(\text{C}_{\text{r}}\text{O}_{7}^{2-}\left(\text{aq} \right)\left|\text{Cr}^{3+}\left(\text{aq}\right)\right)-E\left(\text{C}l_{2} \left(\text{g}\right)\left|\text{C}l^{-}\left(\text{aq}\right)\right)\right)\) becomes and the reaction is* The above galvanic cell is initially set up under standard conditions. The following changes are made to the galvanic cell. Consider the effect of each change on \(E_{1}\) or \(E_{2}\) and hence predict whether the new \(E_{\text{cell}}\) is higher or lower than \(E_{\text{cell}}^{\circ}\).

## 8 Relationship between the Gibbs free energy and electrode potential

Redox reactions can be used to generate electricity in electrochemical cells. The change in the Gibbs free energy accompanying the reaction, \(\Delta G^{\circ}\), can be converted into electrical energy. If the cell is operated so that the current flows infinitely slowly, i.e. under reversible conditions, we have

\[\Delta G^{\circ}=-nFE^{\circ}_{\text{cell}} \text{where $n$ is the number of electrons per mole reaction,}\] \[\text{and $F$ is the Faraday constant ($9.65\times 10^{4}$ C mol${}^{-1}$)}\]

Similarly, the change in the Gibbs free energy for a half-reaction is related to the reduction potential, \(E\): \(\Delta G^{\circ}=-nFE^{\circ}\)

Hence, a spontaneous redox reaction \(\left(\Delta G<0\right)\) would mean that \(E_{\text{cell}}>0\). In other words, the extent of a redox reaction is governed by the sign and magnitude of \(E^{\circ}_{\text{cell}}\), like in the case of \(\Delta G^{\circ}\).

Since \(E^{\circ}_{\text{cell}}\) is dependent on both temperature and concentration (Nernst equation), a non-spontaneous reaction under standard conditions can be made feasible under non-standard conditions (e.g. _increasing temperature or concentration_).

Similar to the use of \(\Delta G^{\circ}\) to predict the feasibility of a reaction, \(E^{\circ}_{\text{cell}}\) only gives an indication of the _thermodynamic_ feasibility (spontaneity), _i.e._ based on energy consideration.

The other important aspect, the _kinetic_ feasibility (looking at the activation energy, \(E_{\text{s}}\)) must also be considered in order to understand fully whether a reaction is likely to proceed on its own.

### Fuel Cells

* Fuel cells differ from normal electrochemical cells in having a steady supply of reactants to produce an electric current. Hence fuel cells are not energy storage cells.
* Reactants (fuels) are continuously replaced as they are consumed and the products are continuously removed as they are formed.
* Fuel cells use a wide variety of fuels including hydrogen, hydrocarbons and alcohols.
* The hydrogen-oxygen fuel cell is an example of a fuel cell.
* The perous graphite electrodes are coated with Ni and NiO which act as catalysts on the surface of the terminals. (Note that other metal catalysts such as Pt and Pd can also be used.)
* The electrolyte is warm aqueous potassium hydroxide (alkaline conditions).
* At the anode (negative terminal): \(\text{H}_{2}(\text{g})\,+\,2\text{OH}^{-}(\text{aq})\,\to\,2\text{H}_{2} \text{O}(l)\,+\,2\text{e}^{-}\) At the cathode (positive terminal): \(\text{O}_{2}(\text{g})\,+\,2\text{H}_{2}\text{O}(l)\,+\,4\text{e}^{-}\,\to\,4 \text{OH}^{-}(\text{aq})\)
* The overall reaction: \(\text{2H}_{2}(\text{g})\,+\,\text{O}_{2}(\text{g})\,\to\,2\text{H}_{2} \text{O}(l)\)
* Note that different pairs of reduction-oxidation equations are chosen depending on the pH of the electrolyte. However, \(E_{\text{cell}}^{\circ}\) for both cases is the same.

* Advantages: 1) Pollution-free (only water produced). 2) High power to mass ratio. 3) Highly efficient, with 70% or more of the chemical energy being converted into electricity. \(\Rightarrow\) consequently, fuel cells are used in spacecraft to provide not only energy but also water for the astronauts
* Disadvantages: 1) Expensive due to large amounts of nickel and platinum metals required as catalysts for the electrode reactions. 2) The catalysts are easily poisoned by impurities in the fuel and oxygen and thus are less able to function efficiently for long periods of time without contamination. 3) Most fuels require a high temperature to react in the fuel cell.

The corrosion of iron (rusting) requires both oxygen and water. Other factors - such as the pH of the solution, the presence of salts, contact with metals that are more difficult to oxidise than iron, and stress on the iron - can accelerate rusting.

The corrosion of iron is electrochemical in nature. Not only does the corrosion process involve oxidation and reduction, the metal itself conducts electricity. Thus, electrons can move through the metal from a region where oxidation occurs to another region where reduction occurs, as in voltaic cells.

Because the standard reduction potential for the reduction of Fe\({}^{2+}\)(aq) is less positive than that for the reduction of O\({}_{2}\)(g), Fe(s) is oxidised.

Anode: \(\qquad\) Fe(s) \(\rightarrow\) Fe\({}^{2+}\)(aq) + 2\(e^{-}\)

The anodic region is the portion of the iron at which the oxidation of Fe(s) to Fe\({}^{2+}\)(aq) occurs. Once the Fe atoms are oxidised, a pit forms where the iron is lost.

The electrons produced migrate through the metal to another portion of the surface with relatively high O\({}_{2}\)(g) concentration near the surface of a surrounding water droplet, which serves as the cathode. At the cathodic region, the electrons released from the Fe atoms reduce O\({}_{2}\) molecules.

Cathode: \(\qquad\) O\({}_{2}\)(g) + 4H\({}^{+}\)(aq) + 4\(e^{-}\)\(\rightarrow\) 2H\({}_{2}\)O(\(l\))

The reduction of O\({}_{2}\)(g) requires H\({}^{+}\)(aq), so lowering the concentration of H\({}^{+}\)(aq) (_i.e._ increasing the pH) makes the reduction of O\({}_{2}\)(g) less favourable.

Rust forms through another redox reaction in which the reactants contact each other directly. The Fe\({}^{2+}\)(aq) ions formed originally at the anodic region disperse through the surrounding water and react with O\({}_{2}\)(g), often at some distance from the pit. The overall reaction for this step is

\(\qquad\) 2Fe\({}^{2+}\)(aq) + \(\gamma_{2}\)O\({}_{2}\)(g) + (2+\(n\))H\({}_{2}\)O(\(l\)) \(\rightarrow\) Fe\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{3}\)\(\cdot\)mH\({}_{2}\)O(s) + 4H\({}^{+}\)(aq)Electrochemistry(Part1)GalvanicCell

### Annex C: The Pain of a Dental Voltaic Cell (Enrichment)

Have you ever felt a jolt pain when biting down with a filled tooth on a scrap of foil left on a piece of food? Here's why.

The aluminium foil acts as an active anode \(\left(E^{\odot}\left(A^{\mathrm{I}^{3+}}(aq)\big{|}A\mathrm{I}(s)\right)=-1.66 \mathrm{V}\right)\), saliva as the electrolyte, and the filling (usually a silver/tin/mercury alloy) as an inactive cathode. O\({}_{2}\)(g) is reduced to H\({}_{2}\)O(\(\mathit{l}\)), and the short circuit between the foil in contact with the filling creates a current that is sensed by the nerve of the tooth.

### Annex D: The Nernst Equation (Enrichment)

The Nernst equation is used to determine the e.m.f. of an electrochemical cell under non-standard conditions.

The free energy change, \(\Delta G\), for a reaction can be expressed as:

\[\Delta G=\Delta G^{\circ}+RT\ln Q\]

where \(Q\) is the reaction quotient (for a reaction \(a\mathbf{A}\ +\ b\mathbf{B}\ \rightleftharpoons\ c\mathbf{C}\ +\ d\mathbf{D}\), \(Q=\frac{\left[\mathbf{C}\right]^{\circ}\left[\mathbf{D}\right]^{d}}{\left[ \mathbf{A}\right]^{d}\left[\mathbf{B}\right]^{b}}\), where \([\mathbf{A}]\), \([\mathbf{B}]\), \([\mathbf{C}]\) and \([\mathbf{D}]\) are concentration values at any given time).

Since \(\Delta G=-nFE_{\text{cell}}\) and \(\Delta G^{\circ}=-nFE_{\text{cell}}^{\circ}\),

\[-nFE_{\text{cell}}=-nFE_{\text{cell}}^{\circ}+RT\ln Q\]

Simplifying, \(E_{\text{cell}}=E_{\text{cell}}^{\circ}-\frac{RT}{nF}\ln Q\) (_Nernst equation_)

The Nernst equation is often expressed in terms of base-10 logarithm of \(Q\):

\[E_{\text{cell}}=E_{\text{cell}}^{\circ}-\frac{2.303RT}{nF}\lg Q\]

At \(T=298\) K, \(E_{\text{cell}}=E_{\text{cell}}^{\circ}-\frac{0.0257}{n}\ln Q=E_{\text{cell}} ^{\circ}-\frac{0.0592}{n}\lg Q\)

where \(R=8.314\) J K-\({}^{1}\) mol-\({}^{1}\) and \(F=96500\) C mol-\({}^{1}\).

The Nernst equation enables us to calculate \(E_{\text{cell}}\) as a function of reactant and product concentrations in a redox reaction and vice versa.

The Nernst equation also helps us understand why the e.m.f. of a voltaic cell drops as it discharges. As reactants are converted to products, \(Q\) increases and hence \(E_{\text{cell}}\) decreases, eventually reaching 0 V. When \(E_{\text{cell}}=0\), the cell reaction has reached an equilibrium and there is no net transfer of electrons. At equilibrium, \(Q=K\), where \(K\) is the equilibrium constant. The Nernst equation gives:

\[0=E_{\text{cell}}^{\circ}-\frac{RT}{nF}\ln K 0=E_{\text{cell}}^{\circ}-\frac{2.303RT}{nF}\lg K\] \[E_{\text{cell}}^{\circ}=\frac{RT}{nF}\ln K \text{or} \text{E}_{\text{cell}}^{\circ}=\frac{2.303RT}{nF}\lg K\] \[=\frac{0.0257}{n}\ln K\text{ (at 298 K)} =\frac{0.0592}{n}\lg K\text{ (at 298 K)}\]

In summary,

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|} \hline \(\Delta G^{\circ}\) & \(E_{\text{cell}}^{\circ}\) & \(K\) & **Reaction under standard conditions** \\ \hline Negative & Positive & \(>1\) & Spontaneous \\ \hline
0 & 0 & = 1 & At equilibrium \\ \hline Positive & Negative & \(<1\) & Non-spontaneous (reverse reaction is spontaneous) \\ \hline \end{tabular}
