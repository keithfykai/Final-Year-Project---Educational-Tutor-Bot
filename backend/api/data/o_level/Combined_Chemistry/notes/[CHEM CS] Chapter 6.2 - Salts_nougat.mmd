## 5 Neurhalisation

Neutralisation is the process where acid reacts with a base to produce salt & water.

## 6 A CID + BASE + SALT + WATER

## 7 Real-life applications

### 7.1 Regulating the pH of soil

Farmers will add bases like slaked lime (calcium hydroxide) or quididime (calcium oxide) to **ensure the soil maintains the optimal pH** for growth of plants.

### 7.2 Treating indigestion

Overeating can result in the overproduction of hydrochloric acid by our stomach, causing indigestion. In order to neutralize the excess hydrochloric acid, we would need to intake antacid (a type of base).

### 7.3 Toothpaste

Bacteria on our teeth produce acids which can result in tooth decay.

Toothpastes contain magnesium hydroxide help to remove bacteria & neutralise the acids in our mouth.

Due to the seemingly complex nature of salt preparation, many students opt to memorise the procedure for salt preparation and attempt regurgitate the content in exams.

While that might work to an extent, they will not be able to solve application questions and might remember some parts wrongly.

In this upcoming section, I will attempt to break down the logic behind salt preparation and show you _why you do not need to memorise anything once you have understood salt preparation_.

SALT PREPARATION

MEMORISING

## 6 Specification

The aqueous solutions of two soluble salts should be mixed; one salt must contain the cation while the other must contain the anion.

When the two salt solutions are mixed, a **resultant insoluble salt will form**.

The insoluble salt can be filtered out and washed with distilled water and dried with filter paper.

**Steps:**

1) Mix the 2 reactants.

2) Filter and collect residue.

3) Wash & dry with filter paper.

**ACID + INSOLUBLE SUBSTANCE**

**React excess of insoluble substance** (metal, carbonate, oxide/hydrooxide) with an appropriate **acid**.

**Add excess insoluble substance so that all the acid will be fully reacted.** This ensures that the filtrate collected is the pure soluble salt.

**Steps:**

1) Mix the 2 reactants.

2) Filter and collect filtrate.

3) Heat till saturation 8 allow to cool. Crystals will form.

4) Filter to collect crystals.

5) Wash & dry with filter paper.

## 6 Illustration

Soluble salts can also be prepared by reacting an acid with an alkali. However, we will need to know the **exact amount of alkali needed to react with a fixed amount of acid**.

### Steps:

1. Using a pipette, add 25.0 cm\({}^{3}\) of dilute acid into a conical flask.
2. Add a few drops of indicator to the acid.
3. Fill a burette with dilute alkali. Record the initial burette reading. Slowly release the dilute alkali into the conical flask and swirl the flask until a change in colour is observed.
4. Record the final burette reading. The initial and final reading gives the volume of alkali needed to completely neutralise the acid.
5. Repeat the experiment with the same exact amount of acid & alkali, but without the indicator. The flask now contains only the soluble salt and water.
6. Pour the solution into an evaporating dish. Heat till saturation.
7. Allow the solution to cool and crystals will form. Filter and dry between sheets of filter paper.
