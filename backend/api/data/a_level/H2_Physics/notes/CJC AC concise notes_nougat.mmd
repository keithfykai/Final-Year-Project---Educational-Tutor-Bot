### Alternating Current

An **alternating current** is the current which direction of flow of charge carriers reverses periodically with time.

An example of an alternating current follows the harmonic function of time, as depicted below.

We can describe the graph with the following relation:

\(\rm I=I_{0}\sin\omega t=I_{0}\sin\left(2\pi ft\right)t\)

**Note:**

Although the AC circuit may be different from the DC circuit in some ways, the AC circuit can still be described by the equations that apply to DC circuits.

Therefore, we can do the following analysis:

Using Ohm's Law,

\(\rm V\ =\ \rm IR\ =(I_{0}\sin\omega t)R\)

\(\rm I_{0}R\sin\omega t\)

\(\rm V_{0}\sin\omega t\)

Therefore, we get the relation for the alternating potential difference (voltage) with respect to time:

\(\rm V=V_{0}\sin\omega t=V_{0}\sin 2\pi ft\)

**Root-Mean-Square value** is the effective value of a continuously varying quantity, obtained from many samples taken at regular intervals during a cycle.

The **root-mean-square of an alternating current (or voltage)** is defined as the value of **steady** direct current (or voltage) that dissipates energy at the same rate as the alternating current (or voltage) in a given resistance.

\[\boxed{l_{rms}=\sqrt{\left\langle l_{AC}^{2}\right\rangle}=\sqrt{\text{mean value of}\,l_{AC}^{2}}}\]

\[\boxed{V_{rms}=\sqrt{\left\langle V_{AC}^{2}\right\rangle}=\sqrt{\text{mean value of}\,V_{AC}^{2}}}\]

**For Sinusoidal AC**

\[\boxed{l_{ms}=\frac{l_{0}}{\sqrt{2}}}\]

\[\boxed{V_{rms}=\frac{V_{0}}{\sqrt{2}}}\]

**Graphical Derivation of Root-Mean-Square Values of AC**

The calculation for r.m.s. values can be done graphically. In fact, in most cases, the graphical method is more direct. Here is how the method can be carried out.

To find \(l_{\text{rms}}\) :

Step (1) : From the l-versus-t graph, sketch the l\({}^{2}\)-versus-t graph.

Step (2) : From the graph in step 1, deduce the mean value of l\({}^{2}\)

\[\text{(in other words, calculate the ratio: }\frac{\text{Area under the graph for 1T}}{\text{1T}}\text{).}\]

Step (3) : Calculate the square-root of the mean value of l\({}^{2}\) to obtain the l\({}_{\text{rms}}\).

Employ the same method to calculate V\({}_{rms}\) starting from the V-versus-t graph.

\[\left\langle\text{P}\right\rangle =\frac{1}{2}\text{P}_{0}=\frac{1}{2}\text{I}_{0}V_{0}\] \[=\left(\frac{\text{I}_{0}}{\sqrt{2}}\right)\left[\frac{\text{V}_{ 0}}{\sqrt{2}}\right]=\text{I}_{\text{rms}}V_{\text{rms}}\]

\[\left\langle\text{P}\right\rangle =\text{I}_{\text{rms}}V_{\text{rms}}\]

In general for any AC,

\[\left\langle\text{P}\right\rangle =\text{I}_{\text{rms}}\text{V}_{\text{rms}}\ =\ \text{I}_{\text{rms}}^{2}\text{R}\ =\ \frac{\text{V}_{\text{rms}}^{2}}{\text{R}}\]

But for sinusoidal AC only,

\[\left\langle\text{P}\right\rangle =\frac{1}{2}\text{I}_{0}\text{V}_{0}\ =\ \frac{1}{2}\text{I}_{0}^{2}\text{R}\ =\ \frac{1}{2}\text{V}_{0}^{2}\text{R}\]

**Rectification**

**Rectification**

is the means by which alternating current is converted into direct current.

Diodes are used to achieve half-wave or full-wave rectification.
