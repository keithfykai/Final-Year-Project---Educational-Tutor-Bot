For sinusoidal a.c. current or voltage, is the mean value a useful representative value? No, because the mean is zero for any amplitude so it cannot tell us its effectiveness in producing useful work. What value then should we look at?

Consider the rate of heating in a resistor, \(P=\hat{F}R\) (note \(P\) and \(\hat{F}\) are time varying). The representative mean power <\(P\)> is = <\(\hat{F}\)>\(R\), where <\(\hat{F}\)> is the _mean square current_. For the _same_ resistance \(R\), if a constant current \(l_{c}\) gives a power \(P_{c}\) which is = <\(P\)>, then we can take \(l_{c}\) to be a good representative or effective current of the a.c. since \(l_{c}\) essentially produces the same outcome. As \(P_{c}=\) <\(P\)>, \(l_{c}^{2}=\) <\(\hat{F}\)> and so \(l_{c}=\) <\(\hat{F}\)>. This constant \(l_{c}\) that is representative of the effectiveness of the a.c. is formally known as _root mean square_ or _r.m.s_ current. A similar consideration using \(P=\) \(V^{2}\)/\(R\) leads to the r.m.s. voltage \(\sqrt{\textit{l}\cdot V^{2}}>\). Hence, the r.m.s. value of an alternating current is defined as

A constant current which produces the same effective rate of heating (mean power) as the alternating current for the same resistance.

How is the r.m.s. value calculated?

Looking at the origin of r.m.s. value, it is not difficult to see that it is calculated by firstly squaring the a.c. current or voltage, then finding the mean value over time and finally taking square root of that mean.

For sinusoidal a.c., a graphical way to find the r.m.s. value is as follows:

The second graph shows the result of squaring. The third graph shows the exploitation of the symmetry to get a mean value of % \(b^{2}\). Finally, taking the square root of that yields r.m.s. value of \(l_{0}\)/\(\sqrt{2}\).

Hence, for **sinusoidal** a.c. and resistive load:

\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|} \hline Instantaneous Power & Peak Power & Mean Power \\ \hline \(P=\textit{IV}\) & & \(P_{0}=l_{0}V_{0}\) & \(<\)\(P\)> = \(l_{ms}V_{rms}=l_{0}V_{0}

3 AC in Transformers

A transformer is a device that converts an alternating voltage to another alternating voltage of different magnitude using electromagnetic induction (Faraday's law). It consists of 2 coils, a primary coil and a secondary coil, wound on an iron core. The main function of the iron core is to drastically increase the flux linkage between the primary and secondary coils and thereby improve the efficiency of conversion. It is useful here to visualise _flux_ as the total number of field lines given by _BA_ where \(B\) is the number of lines per unit area.

Real transformers have efficiency of about 94% to 99% and some reasons for the lost power are:

1 Heating (I\({}^{\text{2}}\)R) in the windings.

2 Induced currents (eddy currents) in the core which also lead to heating.

3 Flux leakage (not all the flux from the primary coil are channelled to the secondary coil).

One important use of transformers is to step up the a.c. voltage before transmitting electrical power over long distance transmission lines and then step down to smaller voltages near to users. This is to exploit the fact that when stepping up the voltage, the current is correspondingly reduced, thereby reducing the loss due to heating in the transmission lines.
