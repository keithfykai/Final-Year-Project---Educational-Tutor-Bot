### Melting point and density

Both \(s\) block elements and transition elements consist of a giant metallic lattice structure held together by strong metallic bonds.

In transition elements, both the **3d and 4s electrons** are available for metallic bonds since the **energy level difference** between the 3d and 4s orbitals **is small**.

In \(s\) block elements, only **one or two 4s electrons** is/are available for metallic bonding. (e.g. calcium metal contributes its two 4s electrons)

The **greater** number of delocalised electrons available for metallic bonding in transition elements results in **stronger** electrostatic attraction between the positively charged ions and the'sea' of delocalised electrons.

More energy** is required to overcome the **stronger** metallic bonds in transition elements as compared to the \(s\) block elements.

Exception: **Manganese has a stable d5 arrangement ([Ar]3d54s2) which results in the low availability of electrons for delocalisation and hence a relatively low melting point**.

Transition elements have higher densities compared to \(s\) block elements, e.g. Ca

Transition elements have relatively **smaller atomic radii** and higher atomic mass compared to \(s\) block elements.

Also, transition elements have **more closely packed structures** due to their stronger metallic bonding as compared to \(s\) block elements.

Thus, transition elements are **denser** than \(s\) block elements.

_For self-reading_

_Why do transition elements have smaller atomic radius than \(s\) block elements?_

_They have higher nuclear charge than \(s\) block elements, and_

_d orbitals, being relatively diffused in nature, provide poor shielding from the attraction of the nucleus_

_thus there is strong attraction of the nucleus for the valence electrons, resulting in smaller atomic radius._

### Catalytic property of transition elements & their compounds

Transition element catalysts may be divided into two distinct groups:

* **homogeneous** catalysts whereby the catalysts are in the same phase as the reactants.
* **heterogeneous** catalysts whereby the catalysts are in a different phase from the reactants.

#### 3.2.1 Heterogeneous catalysts

* In heterogeneous catalysis, the reactants are usually liquids or gases and the catalyst is a solid that provides active sites at which the reaction occurs.
* The mechanism of heterogeneous catalysis is summarised in Figure 5.

Transition elements and their compounds are heterogeneous catalysts because they have **partially filled d subshells** which allow weak temporary bonds to be formed with the reactant molecules.

* **Examples of heterogeneous catalysts**:

_How does a heterogeneous catalyst increase the reaction rate?_

1. Reactant molecules form weak temporary bonds with the catalyst due to the presence of partially filled 3d subshells resulting in the weakening of existing bonds within the reactant molecules, thus lowering the activation energy of the reaction.
2. The reactant molecules are brought closer together at the active sites, thus resulting in higher concentration of reactants at the surface of the catalyst and increase in rate of reaction.

* The **total number of dative bonds** that are attached to the central atom or ion is called the **co-ordination number** of the complex. _Example:_ In [Co(NH\({}_{3}\))\({}_{6}\)]\({}^{3+}\), the coordination number is \(\underline{6}\).
* The co-ordination number around the central metal atom or ion is highly dependent on the nature of the metal atom or ion and the ligand involved.
* The difference in sizes of the ligands and the transition metal atoms or ions means that the number of ligands that can fit around the central metal atom or ion varies.
* The co-ordination number of **four** and **six** are the most common.
* A complex can be neutral (called neutral complex), or a cation or anion (called complex ions), depending on the overall charge. _Example of neutral complex_ Ni(CO)\({}_{4}\), Cu(OH)\({}_{2}\)(H\({}_{2}\)O)\({}_{4}\) _Example of complex ions_: [Fe(H\({}_{2}\)O)\({}_{6}\)]\({}^{3+}\), [Fe(CN)\({}_{6}\)]\({}^{3-}\)
* A complex ion does not exist on its own in a compound. An anionic complex ion forms ionic bonds with cations, while a cationic complex ion forms ionic bonds with anions. _Examples_: _K\({}_{4}\)Fe(CN)\({}_{6}\) contains four K\({}^{+}\) cations and one complex anion [Fe(CN)\({}_{6}\)]\({}^{4-}\) K\({}_{3}\)Fe(CN)\({}_{6}\) contains three K\({}^{+}\) cations and **one** complex anion [Fe(CN)\({}_{6}\)]\({}^{3-}\) [Cr(NH\({}_{3}\))\({}_{6}\)]\({}^{3+}\) complex cation and **three** C\(r\) anions

In aqueous solution, Fe\({}^{3+}\) ion exists as [Fe(H\({}_{2}\)O)\({}_{6}\)]\({}^{3+}\)(aq) and Cu\({}^{2+}\) ion exists as [Cu(H\({}_{2}\)O)\({}_{6}\)]\({}^{2+}\)(aq).

Complete the table below.

**Exercise 6b**

Platinum(IV) chloride combines with ammonia to form compounds in which the co-ordination number of platinum is 6. A formula unit of one of the compounds contains a cation and only two chloride ions.

**B** [Pt(NH\({}_{3}\))\({}_{4}\)Cl\({}_{2}\)]\({}^{2+}\)

Why does A\(\beta^{+}\) or Mg\({}^{2+}\) exist as [A/(H\({}_{2}\)O)\({}_{6}\)]\({}^{3+}\) or [Mg(H\({}_{2}\)O)\({}_{6}\)]\({}^{2+}\) respectively while Na\({}^{+}\) only form ion-dipole interactions with the water molecules?

_Why do transition metal ions form complexes?_

1. Transition metal ions have small ionic radius and hence high charge density, thus attracting ligands that contain lone pair of electrons.

2. (First row) transition metal ions have vacant 3d orbitals of low energy level that can accommodate lone pair of electrons from the ligands.

How to write the formulae of complexes?

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:17]

Another term for polydentate ligand is **chelating agent** (derived from the Greek word for 'claw'). The resultant complex ion is called a _chelate_ or _chelated_ compound.

[MISSING_PAGE_POST]

#### 3.3.2 Shapes of complexes

Aqua complexes are generally octahedral in shape with co-ordination number of 6 as H\({}_{2}\)O is a relatively small ligand, e.g. [Cr(H\({}_{2}\)O)\({}_{6}\)]\({}^{3+}\), [V(H\({}_{2}\)O)\({}_{6}\)]\({}^{3+}\), [Fe(H\({}_{2}\)O)\({}_{6}\)]\({}^{3+}\) and [Cu(H\({}_{2}\)O)\({}_{6}\)]\({}^{2+}\).

NH\({}_{3}\) and CN\({}^{-}\) are also considered relatively small ligands, and complexes containing these ligands are generally octahedral in shape with the co-ordination number of 6 e.g. [Ni(NH\({}_{3}\))\({}_{6}\)]\({}^{2+}\) and [Fe(CN)\({}_{6}\)]\({}^{3-}\).

However, there are _exceptions_ such as [Cu(CN)\({}_{4}\)]\({}^{3-}\), which is tetrahedral in shape with the co-ordination number of 4.

C\(I^{-}\) is relatively larger and only four C\(I^{-}\) ligands can fit around, for instance, cobalt and copper ions, e.g. [CoCl\({}_{4}\)]\({}^{2-}\) and [CuCl\({}_{4}\)]\({}^{2-}\) are tetrahedral.

Ag\({}^{+}\) tends to form complexes with the co-ordination number of 2 and these are linear in shape, e.g. [Ag(CN)\({}_{2}\)]\({}^{-}\) and [Ag(NH\({}_{3}\))\({}_{2}\)]\({}^{*}\).

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{c|c|c|c|c} \hline
**Coordination number** & **2** & **4** & **4** & **6** \\ \hline Shape & Linear & Square planar & Tetrahedral & Octahedral \\ \hline Examples & [Cu(CN)\({}_{2}\)]\({}^{-}\) & [Ni(CN)\({}_{4}\)]\({}^{2-}\) & [Cu(CN)\({}_{4}\)]\({}^{3-}\) & [Cu(H\({}_{2}\)O)\({}_{6}\)]\({}^{2+}\) \\  & [Ag(NH\({}_{3}\))\({}_{2}\)]\({}^{*}\) & [PdC\({}_{4}\)]\({}^{2-}\) & CuCl\({}_{4}\)]\({}^{2-}\) & [Cu(NH\({}_{3}\))\({}_{4}\)(H\({}_{2}\)O)\({}_{6}\)]\({}^{2+}\) \\  & [PtC\({}_{4}\)]\({}^{2-}\) & [Zn(NH\({}_{3}\))\({}_{4}\)]\({}^{2+}\) & [Cu(EDTA)]\({}^{2-}\) \\  & [PtC\({}_{2}\)(NH\({}_{3}\))\({}_{2}\)] & Ni(CO)\({}_{4}\) & [Cr(H\({}_{2}\)O)\({}_{6}\)]\({}^{3+}\) \\  & [Fe(CN)\({}_{6}\)]\({}^{3-}\) & [Fe(CN)\({}_{6}\)]\({}^{4-}\) & \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 5: Some examples of complexes and their co–ordination number and shapes

#### 3.3.3 Nomenclature of complexes

1. Identify and arrange the name of the ligands in alphabetical order (if there is more than one, ignore di-, tri- etc. in deciding the alphabetical order)

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|} \hline
**No. of ligands** & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 \\ \hline
**Prefix** & mono & di & tri & tetra & penta & hexa \\ \hline
**Neutral** & & & & & \\
**ligands** & & & & & \\ \hline H\({}_{2}\)O & aqua (aquo) & F- & fluoro \\ \hline NH\({}_{3}\) & ammine & C\(I\)- & chloro \\ \hline CO & carbonyl & CN- & cyano \\ \hline CH\({}_{2}\) CH\({}_{2}\) CH\({}_{2}\) CH\({}_{2}\) CH\({}_{2}\) & & OH- & hydroxo \\ \hline \end{tabular}
2. Name the central metal atom / ion. For net positive or neutral complexes, name the transition element. For net negative complexes, end the transition metal element with an 'ate'.

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|} \hline
**Name of transition element** \\ \hline
**in net positive or neutral complexes** & **in net negative complexes** \\ \hline chromium & & chromate \\ \hline manganese & & manganate \\ \hline vanadium & & vanadate \\ \hline iron & & ferrate\({}^{*}\) \\ \hline copper & & cuprate\({}^{*}\) \\ \hline \end{tabular}

\({}^{*}\)_For iron and copper, the Latin version of the metal name is used when the suffix '-ate' is used._

3. The oxidation state of the central metal atom / ion is given in brackets at the end.

_Examples:_

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|} \hline
**Complex** & **Name** & **Complex** & **Name** \\ \hline
[Cr(H\({}_{2}\)O)\({}_{6}\)]\({}^{3*}\) & hexaaquachrovium(III) ion & CrO\({}_{4}\)2- & chromate(VI) ion \\  & (or simply, aqueous Cr(III) ion) & & \\ \hline
[Cu(H\({}_{2}\)O)\({}_{6}\)]2\({}^{*}\) & hexaaquacopper(II) ion & [Fe(CN)\({}_{6}\)]4- & hexacyanoferrate(II) ion \\ \hline
[Cu(NH\({}_{3}\))\({}_{4}\)(H\({}_{2}\)O)\({}_{2}\)]2\({}^{*}\) & tetraamminediaquacopper(II) ion & [CoC\(I_{4}\)]2- & tetrachlorocobaltate(II) ion \\ \hline
[CoC\(I_{2}\)(NH\({}_{3}\))\({}_{4}\)]\({}^{*}\) & tetraamminedichlorocobalt(III) ion & [A/(OH)\({}_{4}\)]- & tetrahydrooxoaluminate(III) ion \\ \hline Ni(CO)\({}_{4}\) & tetracarbonylnickel(0) & & \\ \hline \end{tabular}

#### 3.3.4 Isomerism in complexes

Due to the different structural and/or stereochemical positions of the ligands with respect to the central metal ion/atom, isomerism can occur in complexes with co-ordination number 4 and 6. These are the different types of isomerism possible.

#### 3.3.4.1 Structural isomerism

The isomers have the same molecular formula but different arrangement of atoms or groups of atoms.

In **ionisation** isomerism, the anionic ligands and counter ions can exchange positions.

e.g. 2 possible isomers with the molecular formula of Cr(NH\({}_{3}\))\({}_{4}\)Cl\({}_{2}\)Br

[Cr(NH\({}_{3}\))\({}_{4}\)Cl\({}_{2}\)]\({}^{+}\)Br\({}^{-}\) and [Cr(NH\({}_{3}\))\({}_{4}\)Cl/Br]\({}^{+}\)Cl\({}^{-}\) exhibit ionisation isomerism.

In **hydration** isomerism, the water ligands and counter ions can exchange positions.

e.g. 2 possible isomers with the molecular formula of Cr(H\({}_{2}\)O)\({}_{6}\)Cl\({}_{3}\)

[Cr(H\({}_{2}\)O)\({}_{6}\)]\({}^{3+}\) 3C/\({}^{-}\) and [Cr(H\({}_{2}\)O)\({}_{4}\)Cl\({}_{2}\)]\({}^{+}\)Cl\({}^{-}\).2H\({}_{2}\)O exhibit hydration isomerism.

The isomers can be distinguished using aqueous silver nitrate solution. Each of them will form a different mass of AgCl due to the different number of (free) Cl\({}^{-}\) counter ions.

[_Recall Exercise 6_]

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:22]

In **enantiomerism**, the isomers are non-superimposable mirror images of each other. There is no (internal) plane of symmetry nor centre of symmetry in the complex. It is usually exemplified in octahedral complexes containing at least two bidentate ligands.

e.g. 2 possible isomers with the molecular formula [Cr(H\({}_{2}\)NCH\({}_{2}\)CH\({}_{2}\)NH\({}_{2}\))\({}_{3}\)\({}^{3+}\)] (or [Cr(en)\({}_{3}\)]\({}^{3+}\))

where L = en or H\({}_{2}\)NCH\({}_{2}\)CH\({}_{2}\)NH\({}_{2}\) (a bidentate ligand)

#### 3.3.4.3 Conformational isomerism [name is FYI]

The isomers have the same molecular & structural formula but the complexes can exist in two different geometries.

e.g. 2 possible isomers with the structural formula NiC\({}_{2}\)(R\({}_{3}\)P)\({}_{2}\), where R is an alkyl group.

The isomers can be distinguished by their net dipole moment (if any).

#### 3.3.4.4 Polymerisation isomerism [name is FYI]

It exists when the _cation_ and _anion_ of the compound are _both_ complex ions. The cation-anion pair share the same empirical formula as a single complex but has _twice_ the relative formula mass.

e.g. [Pt(NH\({}_{3}\))\({}_{4}\)]\({}^{2+}\) [PtC\({}_{4}\)]\({}^{2-}\) has the same empirical formula as _cis_-platin (_cis_-[PtC\({}_{2}\)(NH\({}_{3}\))\({}_{2}\)] and _trans_-platin but its relative formula mass is twice that of either.

#### 3.3.5 **Acidity of transition metal ions in solution**

In aqueous solution, transition metal ions exist as aqua complexes with H\({}_{2}\)O as the ligand e.g. [Fe(H\({}_{2}\)O)\({}_{6}\)]\({}^{3+}\). The aqua complex ions behave as **weak acids** in aqueous solution.

Reason:

Transition metal ions have **high charge density** and thus, the O-H bonds in H\({}_{2}\)O ligands are **polarised** and **break**. Thus, the aqua complex ions undergo **partial hydrolysis** to give H\({}_{3}\)O\({}^{+}\).

[FIGURE:S3.F1][ENDFIGUR

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:25]

* Haemoglobin is a red pigment found in red blood cells. It is the biological molecule responsible for transporting oxygen molecules to other cells during respiration.
* Haemoglobin is a complex consisting of an **iron** metal centre.

* Competition between ligands takes place in the haemoglobin.
* When haemoglobin absorbs oxygen, it forms oxyhaemoglobin.
* Oxygen molecule displaces water molecule and forms a dative bond with the iron(II) central ion.
* Oxyhaemoglobin carries oxygen from one part of the body to another.
* In cells of lower oxygen concentration, the reverse reaction occurs. The water ligands displace the oxygen ligands, thus oxygen is released into the cells. Haemoglobin re-forms.
* Ligands such as **CO and CN- ions*
* form **strong dative bonds*
* with the iron(II) central ion in haemoglobin.
* these bonds formed are **stronger*
* than the Fe-O\({}_{2}\) dative bonds
* thus, CO and CN- are **irreversibly bonded*
* to haemoglobin
* these ligands act as acute poisons by inhibiting the oxygen-carrying ability of haemoglobin.

### Formation of coloured complex ions

Most transition element complexes are **coloured**, unlike ions of non-transition elements (e.g. [Mg(H\({}_{2}\)O)\({}_{6}\)]\({}^{2+}\) is colourless).

_Common examples:_

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|} \hline
**Complex** & **Colour** & **Complex** & **Colour** \\ \hline
[Cu(H\({}_{2}\)O)\({}_{6}\)]\({}^{2+}\) & blue & CrO\({}_{4}\)[2-] & yellow \\ \hline
[Fe(H\({}_{2}\)O)\({}_{6}\)]\({}^{2+}\) & pale green & Cr\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{7}\)[2-] & orange \\ \hline
[Fe(H\({}_{2}\)O)\({}_{6}\)]\({}^{3+}\) & yellow & [Cr(H\({}_{2}\)O)\({}_{6}\)]\({}^{3+}\) & green \\ \hline
[Fe(SCN)(H\({}_{2}\)O)\({}_{6}\)]\({}^{2+}\) & blood-red & [Cr(H\({}_{2}\)O)\({}_{6}\)]\({}^{2+}\) & blue \\ \hline
[Co(H\({}_{2}\)O)\({}_{6}\)]\({}^{2+}\) & pink & MnO\({}_{4}\)- & purple \\ \hline
[CoC\({}_{4}\)]\({}^{2-}\) & blue & [Mn(H\({}_{2}\)O)\({}_{6}\)]\({}^{2+}\) & pale pink \\ \hline \end{tabular}

_Some background information on the appearance of colour:_

* White light is composed of various colours (i.e. with different wavelengths) that make up the visible region of the electromagnetic spectrum (refer to diagram below).
* When light falls on an opaque object, some or all the wavelengths of light may be absorbed.
* In general, the **observed colour** of an object is the reflected wavelengths that are **not** absorbed from the spectrum.

The colour of the object is therefore the **complementary** colour of those colours that are absorbed.

Example: If an object **absorbs** the **red** colour, it will **appear green** in colour, which is the complementary colour of red.

_Why are transition metal complexes coloured?_

* In an isolated gaseous atom or ion of a transition metal, the five d orbitals are _degenerate_ (i.e. have the same energy level).
* However, in the presence of **ligands** in transition metal complexes, the **d orbitals** are no longer degenerate but **split** into **two** sets of energy levels with an energy gap (\(\Delta\)E) between them. This process is called **d orbital splitting**.
* The **energy gap**, \(\Delta\)E**, between the non-degenerate d orbitals is **small** and **similar** to the energies of the visible region of the spectrum.
* When light passes through the transition metal complexes, energy **equal** to \(\Delta\)E is absorbed from the visible spectrum.
* As the d orbitals are partially filled, the absorption of energy results in an **electron transition** from the **lower** energy level d orbital to a **higher** energy level d orbital. This process is called **d-d transition**.
* The colour of the complex ion is the **complementary** of the colours that are absorbed.

_Why are compounds containing the ions Sc\({}^{3+}\), Ti\({}^{4+}\), Cu\({}^{+}\) and Zn\({}^{2+}\) colourless?_

\(\Rightarrow\) Sc\({}^{3+}\) and Ti\({}^{4+}\) do not have electrons in the **d orbitals** for d-d transition to occur.

(1s\({}^{2}\) 2s\({}^{2}\) 2p\({}^{6}\) 3s\({}^{2}\) 3p\({}^{6}\) **3d\({}^{9}\)**)**

\(\Rightarrow\) Cu\({}^{+}\) and Zn\({}^{2+}\) do not have a **partially filled d orbital** in the higher energy level to allow for excitation of electron from the lower energy d orbitals.

(1s\({}^{2}\) 2s\({}^{2}\) 2p\({}^{6}\) 3s\({}^{2}\) 3p\({}^{6}\) **3d\({}^{10}\)**)**

For a s-block metal ion such as Na\({}^{+}\) to undergo the electron transition (from 1s\({}^{2}\) 2s\({}^{2}\) **2p\({}^{6}\)** to 1s\({}^{2}\) 2s\({}^{2}\) **2p\({}^{5}\) 3s\({}^{1}\)**), the electron must absorb in the region of very high energy.

\(\Rightarrow\) such 2p-3s transitions are out of the energy range of visible light

\(\Rightarrow\) energy from visible light is not absorbed

solutions of Na\({}^{+}\) are colourless

**Exercise 9**

_Explain why an aqueous solution of Cr\({}^{3+}\) is coloured._

In the presence of water, the partially filled 3d orbitals of Cr\({}^{3+}\) are split into with a small energy gap (d orbital splitting).

When energy is  from the visible light region, an electron is promoted from the d orbital of a  energy level to a d orbital of a  energy level (d-d transition).

The colour of Cr\({}^{3+}\)(aq) is  of the colour absorbed.

#### 3.4.1 **d orbital splitting**

_Why do the d orbitals split into two sets of energy levels in the presence of ligands?_

* **Electrostatic repulsion** occurs between the lone pair of electrons on the donor atom of the approaching ligand and the electrons in the d orbitals of a transition metal.
* The strength of repulsion experienced by the five d orbitals is **not equal** because of the way they are arranged differently in space.
* Recall the shapes and orientation of the five d orbitals:
* For an **octahedral** complex,
* The six ligands approach the central metal cation **alone** the x, y and z axes.
* Since the lobes of the 3d\({}_{22}\) and 3d\({}_{22-y2}\) orbitals lie along these axes, **greater** electrostatic repulsion occurs between the lone pairs of the ligands and electrons in these orbitals \(\Rightarrow\) these orbitals have **higher** energy level.
* **Smaller** electrostatic repulsion occurs between the lone pairs of the ligands and electrons in the 3d\({}_{xy}\), 3d\({}_{xx}\) and 3d\({}_{yz}\) orbitals \(\Rightarrow\) these orbitals have **lower** energy level.

#### 3.4.2 Factors affecting the colours of complex ions

* The extent of d orbital splitting in a complex, which is measured by the magnitude of the energy gap (\(\Delta\)E), determines the colours absorbed, and therefore affects the observed colour of the complex. \(\Delta\)E = \(\frac{hc}{\lambda}\) where \(h\): Planck's constant \(c\): speed of light \(\lambda\): wavelength
* The magnitude of d orbital splitting is affected by the following factors: 1. _Identity of the transition metal ion_ e.g. [Cr(H\({}_{2}\)O)]\({}^{2+}\) is blue and [Fe(H\({}_{2}\)O)]\({}^{2+}\) is pale green. 2. _Electronic configuration of the transition metal ion_ e.g. [Fe(H\({}_{2}\)O)]\({}^{2+}\) is pale green and [Fe(H\({}_{2}\)O)]\({}^{3+}\) is yellow. 3. _Type of ligands_ e.g. [Ni(H\({}_{2}\)O)]\({}^{2+}\) is green and [Ni(NH\({}_{3}\))]\({}^{2+}\) is blue.

**Example: N17/5/2d** Crystals of hydrated iron(III) salts are violet. When dissolved in water, the solution is yellow or brown. Solid hydrated iron(II) are green.

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|} \hline  & **colour** & **ion** \\ \hline solid hydrated iron(III) ions & violet & [Fe(H\({}_{2}\)O)]\({}^{3+}\) \\ \hline aqueous hydrated iron(III) ions & yellow or brown & [Fe(H\({}_{2}\)O)]\({}^{2+}\) \\ \hline solid hydrated iron(II) ions & green & [Fe(H\({}_{2}\)O)]\({}^{2+}\) \\ \hline \end{tabular} The colour is due to the absorption of light at specific wavelengths. The colour observed is the complement of the colour absorbed.

Suggest why

* The solid containing hydrated iron(III) ions is a different colour from the aqueous solution of iron(III) ions,
* Solid iron(II) ions are a different colour from solid iron(III) ions.

**ANSWER:**

* **Type of ligands** Solid hydrated iron(III) ions contain 6 water ligands, while aqueous hydrated iron(III) ions contain 5 water ligands and 1 OH- ligand. The **different types of ligands** cause **magnitude** of the energy gap (\(\Delta\)E) to be **different**.

Electronic configuration of the transition metal ion

Solid iron(II) ions and solid iron(III) ions have the same ligands. Solid iron(II) ions have an oxidation number of +2, with 6 electrons in the 3d subshell. Solid iron(III) ions have an oxidation number of +3, with 5 electrons in the 3d subshell. The different electronic configurations caused magnitude of the energy gap (\(\Delta\)E) to be different.

When light passes through the complexes, energy equal to \(\Delta\)E is absorbed from the visible light region of the spectrum. The absorption of energy results in an electron transition from the lower energy level d orbital to a higher energy level d orbital. Since the \(\Delta\)E is different in the different complex ions, the colours of the complex ions are different.

Exercise 10

Ferrocene, Fe(C\({}_{5}\)H\({}_{5}\))\({}_{2}\), is an orange solid. In this complex, C\({}_{5}\)H\({}_{5}\) is the ligand and it donates \(\pi\) electrons from the ring to the vacant 3d orbital of Fe. The structure of ferrocene is given below.

Example: The complementary colours are illustrated with the following colour wheel.

### Reaction of [Co(H\({}_{2}\)O)\({}_{6}\)]\({}^{2+}\)

Ligand exchange reaction

* Co\({}^{2+}\)(aq) reacts with concentrated HC/\(l\) via a **ligand exchange** reaction to form [Co\(Cl_{4}\)]\({}^{2-}\), a blue solution. The stronger C\(l^{-}\) ligand from concentrated HC/\(l\) has displaced the weaker H\({}_{2}\)O ligand. 

* When concentrated HC/\(l\) is slowly added to [Co(H\({}_{2}\)O)\({}_{6}\)]\({}^{2+}\), the colour of the mixture changes from pink to purple to blue.
* The mixture appears purple due to the presence of both the pink [Co(H\({}_{2}\)O)\({}_{6}\)]\({}^{2+}\) and blue [Co\(Cl_{4}\)]\({}^{2-}\) at equilibrium.

### Stability constant of complexes

* **Complexation stability constant** describes the stability of the complex.
* The stability constant of a complex (\(K_{\text{stab}}\)) is the equilibrium constant \(K\) for its formation. **It is a measure of the relative stability of complex compared to its aqua complex.*
* For example, the \(K_{\text{stab}}\) for the [Ni(NH\({}_{3}\))\({}_{6}\)]\({}^{2+}\) complex is given as: [Ni(H\({}_{2}\)O)\({}_{6}\)]\({}^{2+}\)(aq) + 6NH\({}_{3}\)(aq) = [Ni(NH\({}_{3}\))\({}_{6}\)]\({}^{2+}\)(aq) + 6H\({}_{2}\)O(l) = [Ni(NH\({}_{3}\))\({}_{6}^{2+}\)] = [Ni(H\({}_{2}\))\({}_{6}^{2+}\)]INH\({}_{3}\)]\({}^{6}\)mol\({}^{-6}\)dm\({}^{18}\) The concentration of water is taken to be a constant as the water molecules are present in large excess in aqueous medium. The calculated \(K_{\text{stab}}\) of [Ni(NH\({}_{3}\))\({}_{6}\)]\({}^{2+}\) is 5 x 10\({}^{7}\) mol\({}^{-6}\) dm\({}^{18}\). A large \(K_{\text{stab}}\) value indicates that:
* the position of equilibrium lies to the right
* [Ni(NH\({}_{3}\))\({}_{6}\)]\({}^{2+}\) is a more stable complex ion than [Ni(H\({}_{2}\)O)\({}_{6}\)]\({}^{2+}\)
* NH\({}_{3}\) is a stronger ligand than H\({}_{2}\)O
* NH\({}_{3}\) forms a stronger dative covalent bond with the central metal ion than H\({}_{2}\)O
* Thus, ligands that form a complex with higher stability constant will displace ligands that are only capable of forming a complex with lower stability constant.

The \(K_{\text{stab}}\) values for some common complexes are given below. Sometimes log \(K_{\text{stab}}\) is used for easier comparison, as big numbers can be dispensed with. The larger the \(K_{\text{stab}}\) value, the more stable the complex is.

\begin{tabular}{l l c c} \hline \hline Element: & Complex Ion & K\({}_{\text{stab}}\) & logK\({}_{\text{stab}}\) \\ \hline \multicolumn{4}{l}{_Monodentate ligands_} \\ Fe & [Fe(CN)\({}_{6}\)]\({}^{2+}\) & \(1\times 10^{18}\) & 24 \\ Fe & [Fe(CN)\({}_{6}\)]\({}^{2+}\) & \(1\times 10^{18}\) & 31 \\ Ni & [Ni(CN)\({}_{6}\)]\({}^{2-}\) & \(1\times 10^{18}\) & 31 \\ Ni & [Ni(CN)\({}_{6}\)]\({}^{2+}\) & \(5\times 10^{17}\) & 7.7 \\ Cu & [Cu(CN)\({}_{6}\)]\({}^{2+}\) & \(1\times 10^{17}\) & 27 \\ \(\cdot\) & [Cu(NH\({}_{3}\))\({}_{6}\)]\({}_{4}\)(H\({}_{2}\)O)\({}_{6}\)]\({}^{2+}\) & \(1.2\times 10^{13}\) & 13.1 \\ \(\cdot\) & [Bi(CN)\({}_{6}\)]\({}^{2+}\) & \(6\times 10^{18}\) & 18.8 \\ Cu & [Co(e)\({}_{2}\)(H\({}_{3}\)O)\({}_{6}\)]\({}^{2+}\) & \(4\times 10^{19}\) & 19.6 \\ \(\cdot\) & [Bi(CN)\({}_{6}\)]\({}^{2+}\) & \(2\times 10^{18}\) & 14.3 \\ Fe & [Fe(e)(e)\({}_{4}\)]\({}^{2-}\) & \(1.3\times 10^{18}\) & 25.1 \\ Ni & [Ni(NH\({}_{3}\))\({}_{6}\)]\({}^{2-}\) & \(4\times 10^{18}\) & 18.6 \\ Cs & [Co(e)\({}_{4}\)]\({}^{2-}\) & \(6\times 10^{18}\) & 18.8 \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}

The stability of the complexes involving polydentate ligands (e.g. EDTA) is usually greater than that of complexes involving monodentate ligands.

### Acid-base reactions of hydrated ions

It is important to take account of the water molecules in hydrated ions. At first sight, the formation of iron(III) hydroxide Fe(OH)\({}_{3}\)(s), when sodium hydroxide solution is added to a solution containing Fe\({}^{3+}\)(aq) ions, looks like a simple precipitation reaction:

\[\text{Fe}^{3+}\text{(aq)}+\text{3OH}^{-}\text{(aq)}\rightarrow\text{Fe(OH)}_{3} \text{(s)}\]

This suggests that the reaction is similar to the precipitation, for example, of barium sulfate when sulfate ions and Ba\({}^{2+}\) ions are mixed together:

\[\text{Ba}^{2+}\text{(aq)}+\text{SO}_{4}{}^{2}\text{(aq)}\rightarrow\text{BaSO }_{4}\text{(s)}\]

However, such a treatment ignores the role of the water molecules. The Fe(H\({}_{2}\)O)\({}_{6}\)\({}^{3+}\) ion acts as a weak acid, \(K_{\text{a}}\) = 10\({}^{-5}\) mol dm\({}^{-3}\), because it undergoes an acid-base reaction with water molecules:

\[\text{Fe(H}_{2}\text{O)}_{6}\text{(aq)}+\text{H}_{2}\text{O(I)}\rightarrow[ \text{Fe(H}_{2}\text{O)}_{5}\text{(OH)}]^{2+}\text{(aq)}+\text{H}_{3}\text{O} ^{+}\text{(aq)}\]

If the H\({}_{3}\)O\({}^{+}\)ions are removed by the addition of a strong base such as hydroxide ions, further acid-base reactions can take place:

\[\begin{array}{l}[\text{Fe(H}_{2}\text{O)}_{5}\text{(OH)}]^{2+}\text{(aq)}+ \text{H}_{2}\text{O(I)}\rightarrow[\text{Fe(H}_{2}\text{O)}_{4}\text{(OH)}_{ 2}]^{+}\text{(aq)}+\text{H}_{3}\text{O}^{+}\text{(aq)}\\ [\text{Fe(H}_{2}\text{O)}_{4}\text{(OH)}_{2}]^{+}\text{(aq)}\rightarrow\text{Fe(OH)}_{3} \text{(s)}+\text{H}_{3}\text{O}^{+}\text{(aq)}+2\text{H}_{2}\text{O(I)}\end{array}\]

The overall reaction with hydroxide ions is:

\[\text{Fe(H}_{2}\text{O)}_{6}\text{(aq)}+\text{3OH}^{-}\text{(aq)}\rightarrow \text{Fe(OH)}_{3}\text{(s)}+\text{6H}_{2}\text{O(I)}\]

The net result is that the ion has been deprotonated by a series of acid-base reactions and water ligands have been released.

### Effect of ligands on \(E^{0}\) values

Different ligands can affect the **relative stabilities of oxidation states** in transition elements.

Example: \[\text{[Co(H}_{2}\text{O)}_{6}]^{3+}+\text{e}^{-}\rightleftharpoons[\text{Co(H}_{2} \text{O)}_{6}]^{2+}\text{\qquad}E^{\odot}=+1.81\text{ V}\] \[\text{[Co(NH}_{3}\text{)}_{6}]^{3+}+\text{e}^{-}\rightleftharpoons[\text{Co(NH}_{3} \text{)}_{6}]^{2+}\text{\qquad}E^{\odot}=+0.11\text{ V}\]

Observe the difference in the \(E^{\odot}\) values (and thus the difference in the ease of reduction of Co(III) to Co(II)) when different ligands are bonded to the same metal ion.

Two deductions can be made from the \(E^{\odot}\) values:

1. [Co(H\({}_{2}\)O)\({}_{6}\)]\({}^{3+}\) is more easily reduced / a stronger oxidising agent than [Co(NH\({}_{3}\))\({}_{6}\)]\({}^{3+}\).
2. NH\({}_{3}\) ligand stabilises Co(III) more relative to Co(II). Hence, **Co(III)** is **less readily reduced to Co(II) when it is bonded to NH\({}_{3}\) ligands**.
