#### Base Quantities and Units

Through the centuries, scientists in different parts of the world have used different units at different times to measure the same physical quantities. However standardised definitions and units are needed in the modern world.

The current International System of Unitsa, universally abbreviated SI (from the French _Le Systeme International d'Unites_), is the modern metric system of measurement.

Footnote a: The SI was established in 1960 by the 11th General Conference on Weights and Measures (CGPM, Conference Generale des Poids et Mesures). ([http://www.bipm.org/en/si/](http://www.bipm.org/en/si/)).

Seven well-defined and independent base quantities are chosen. Their corresponding **SI base units** are indicated:

\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|c|} \hline \multicolumn{2}{|c|}{**Base Quantity**} & \multicolumn{2}{|c|}{**SI Base Unit**} \\ \hline Name & Symbol & Name & Symbol \\ \hline Mass & \(m\) & kilogram & kg \\ \hline Length & \(l\) & metre & m \\ \hline Time & \(t\) & second & s \\ \hline Electric current & \(I\) & ampere & A \\ \hline Thermodynamic temperature & \(T\) & kelvin & K \\ \hline Amount of substance & \(n\) & mole & mol \\ \hline Luminous intensity & \(l_{e}\) & candela & cd \\ \hline \end{tabular}

Note:

1. The **units**, when **written in full**, are **in small letters**. Ampere and Kelvin are names of scientists.
2. The kilogram is the only SI unit with a prefix as part of its name and symbol.
3. Luminous intensity is not in the Learning Objectives(a) of the Syllabus.
4. Definitions of the units are not required in the Syllabus but are provided in Appendix I at the end of the lecture notes for your reference.

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|} \hline \multicolumn{2}{|c|}{**IMPORTANT TO KNOW**} \\ \hline \end{tabular}

Sl base units were chosen based on their mutual independence. They are the simplest units that cannot be expressed in terms of other SI base units.

#### Derived Quantities and Units

There are a lot of other physical properties that we come across in our daily lives. These quantities and units used scientifically are included in the SI as derived quantities and units.b Note that these derived units, such as newton and joule, are also SI units.

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|} \hline \multicolumn{2}{|c|}{**IMPORTANT TO KNOW**} \\ \hline \end{tabular}

Derived quantities are related to the base quantities through mathematical and scientific equations. Derived units (the units of derived quantities) are defined in terms of the base units using the same equations.

One simple example is the derived quantity of area. It is defined using the mathematical equation area = length x breadth, where both length and breadth are defined in terms of the base quantity, length. Hence the unit for area can be written in terms of base units as m2.

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:6]

**Common quantities quoted with no unit of measurement**

1. all pure numbers, e.g. 2, \(\frac{1}{2}\), \(\pi\), e
2. trigonometrical functions, e.g. sine, cosine, tangent
3. all logarithmic functions, e.g. \(\log_{10}\), In
4. powers, e.g. \(10^{\circ}\), e\({}^{\rm n}\), n has no unit.
5. physical constants with no unit of measurement: e.g. refractive index of glass, relative density of a liquid.

#### 1.2.3 Homogeneity of equations

For an equation to be physically plausible, the equation must be _homogenous_. This is to say the terms on both sides of the equations must have the same units when expressed in SI base units.\({}^{\circ}\) This is because only quantities with the same units may be equated, added or subtracted.

Example 2 Bernoulli's equation, which applies to fluid flow states that

\(P+h\rho g+\gamma\rho^{2}=k\)

where \(P\) is pressure, \(h\) is height, \(\rho\) is density, \(g\) is acceleration due to gravity, \(\nu\) is velocity and \(k\) is a constant.

Show the LHS of the equation is homogeneous and state the SI unit for \(k\). [Ans: kg m\({}^{\text{-1}}\) s\({}^{\text{-2}}\)]

Checking of homogeneity of an equation (by comparing the SI base units of the left and right hand side terms of the equation) is not only a powerful way of establishing if an equation is reasonable, but it also provides hints for guessing the actual equation.

A physically correct equation must be homogeneous. However, a homogeneous equation need not be physically correct. Ultimately, the validity of an equation can only be verified through experiments.

There are two basic reasons:

(1) The value of the coefficient may be incorrect.

\[\text{e.g.}\qquad E=3m\nu^{2}\qquad\qquad\text{ where }E=\text{kinetic energy}\]

_The coefficient 3 is incorrect. The value should be \(\dfrac{1}{2}\) instead._

(2) Missing or extra terms that may have the same unit.

\[\text{e.g.}\qquad E=\dfrac{1}{2}m\nu^{2}+mgh\qquad\text{where }E=\text{kinetic energy}\]

_There is an extra term mgh, which happens to have the same base unit as kinetic energy. This is an extra term._

#### Prefixes

Prefixes can be used with both base units and derived units. The rationale for prefixes is simple. While it is alright to write your height as 1.65 m, it will be quite cumbersome to write the width of your hair as 0.00005 m, or the size of an atom as 0.0000000001 m. In mathematics, you have learnt the use of standard form. The size of an atom can be rewritten more neatly as 1 x 10-10 m but scientists often use prefixes instead of standard form for values between 10-12 and 1012.

Footnote 2: [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_magnitude](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_magnitude)

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|r|r|} \hline
**Factor** & **Prefix** & **Symbol** & **Name** & **Decimal equivalent** & **Order of** \\  & & & & & **magnitude3** \\ \hline
10-12 & pico & p & Trillionth & 0.000,000,000,001 & -12 \\ \hline
10-9 & nano & n & Billionth & 0.000,000,001 & -9 \\ \hline
10-6 & micro & \(\mu\) & Millionth & 0.000,001 & -6 \\ \hline
10-3 & milli & m & Thousandth & 0.001 & -3 \\ \hline
10-2 & centi & c & Hundredth & 0.01 & -2 \\ \hline
10-1 & deci & d & Tenth & 0.1 & -1 \\ \hline
10-0 & - & - & One & 1 & 0 \\ \hline
10-3 & kilo & k & Thousand & 1,000 & 3 \\ \hline
10-6 & mega & M & Million & 1,000,000 & 6 \\ \hline
10-9 & giga & G & Billion & 1,000,000,000 & 9 \\ \hline
10-12 & tera & T & Trillion & 1,000,000,000,000,000 & 12 \\ \hline \end{tabular}

The accepted convention is to use a prefix such that the quantity can be written as a whole number and of least significant figures (s.f.). For example, the wavelength of red light would be written as 650 nm, rather than 0.65 \(\upmu\)m. Values larger than the ranges listed in the prefixes above should be written in standard form. (The above list of prefixes are stipulated in LO(e). Other prefixes are listed in Appendix 3).

You may notice that the symbol for the prefix milli (m) is the same as that for the base unit metre (m), leading to a confusion when we see, for example, "ms-1". It could mean "metre per second", or "per millisecond". To distinguish the units especially in print, the A-level standard is to **use "ms-1" for "per millisecond" and leave a space "m s-1" for the derived unit "metre per second".**

### Estimation

When was the last time you estimated something?

Physicists frequently use "back-of-the-envelope" calculations or "Fermi" problems, named after Physicist Enrico Fermi who worked on the Manhattan Project during World War II. Fermi was known for making approximate calculations with little or no actual data. One well-documented example was his estimate of the strength of the atomic bomb based on the distance travelled by bits of paper dropped from his hand at the test blast.*

Footnote *: [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermi_problem](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermi_problem)

Estimation in Physics uses simple numbers (1, 2 or 5) with the correct order of magnitude (10\({}^{3}\) or 10\({}^{4}\)). It is important to know whether a lecture theatre can sit a few students, tens, hundreds or thousands of students, but not so important to know that it has a capacity of 327. When the exact answer or values are not known, assumptions and estimation are used to find a rough answer.

Estimation is also very useful as a check to the answer that we would get from complex calculations.

Examples of "Fermi" problems:

Estimate the total number of hairs on your head.

How many bricks are needed to build a home?

Estimate the efficiency of an electric kettle.

How much paper is used by Hwa Chong Institution for lecture notes in 1 year?

Some important estimates that you should memorize:

Typical wavelength of visible light: 10\({}^{7}\) m (range: 400 to 700 nm)

Range of wavelengths of other electromagnetic regions

Size of an atom: 10\({}^{10}\) m or 1 angstrom (A)

Size of a nucleus: 10\({}^{15}\) m

Strategy for estimation:

Identify the unknown: Define specifically what you need to estimate

Identify the known: Find your experience that may help you relate to the unknown

Find a relationship between the known and the unknown: make a connection between what you know and what needs to be estimated.

* [N09/l/2]

Which estimate is realistic?

* [N09/l/2]

A The kinetic energy of a bus travelling on an expressway is 30 000 J.
* [B] The power of a domestic light is 300 W.
* [C] The temperature of a hot oven is 300 K.
* [D] The volume of air in a tyre is 0.03 m\({}^{3}\).

### Errors and Uncertainties

Whenever we attempt to make a measurement of a physical quantity, we are prone to all sorts of errors. As such, it is actually quite difficult, maybe impossible, to obtain a true value of the physical quantity. This can be a serious problem. It is essential in any experiment, in order to check the validity of a hypothesis, to be confident of our measurements, so that if the value of a physical quantity obtained in the experiment differs from the value predicted by the hypothesis, we can reject the hypothesis.

A measurement of a physical quantity \(X\) is reported in the form, \(X=(x\pm\Delta x)\) where \(\Delta x\) refers to the uncertainty associated with the measurement of \(X\).

It is to be interpreted as we are pretty confident that the true value of \(X\) lies in the interval \((x\cdot\Delta x,x+\Delta x)\). If the predicted value falls within this interval, then we have no evidence to reject the hypothesis. However, if the predicted value falls outside this interval, we may claim that we have evidence to reject the hypothesis.

Two scientists who performed their experiments independently in an attempt to measure the quantity \(X\) will also say that their values of \(X\) are consistent with each other if the two intervals overlap. If the intervals established by each scientist do not overlap, then their values of \(X\) are inconsistent.

In attempting to measure \(X\), we will naturally strive to do our best and make several measurements. But let's first suppose that we only make one measurement. In such a situation, the precision of the instrument we used limits our ability to obtain the true value. For example, when using a metre rule to measure the length of a pencil, we may at most be certain that our measured value is right up to the nearest mm, as the smallest division on the metre rule is 1 mm. We will hence report our measurement as \(X=(14.6\pm 0.1)\) cm.

However, there could be other sources of error that we did not realise. With only a single measurement, we will not be able to tell whether we might get a different reading the next time we tried and how far off that reading will be. As such, even though we have established an interval based on just one reading, it is entirely possible that the true value could fall outside this interval.

If we are aware of the presence of experimental errors other than instrumental errors, we could provide for it. For example, when we attempt to measure the length of the pencil, the butt of the pencil was broken with jagged edges, and it is difficult to ascertain the edge very precisely. As such, we could take that into consideration and report our measurement as \(X=(14.6\pm 0.3)\) cm with a reasonable subjective estimated uncertainty of 0.3 cm.

Ideally, we should make more attempts at measuring \(X\). If we make multiple attempts, the spread of the data could give us a better idea of the impact of errors that could be present and help us to make a more realistic guess at the interval which could contain the true value. As a rule of thumb, a reasonable estimate would be to determine the uncertainty as \(\Delta x=\frac{1}{2}\left(x_{\max}-x_{\min}\right).\) We would also use the mean \(\left\langle X\right\rangle\) of our readings as the true value of \(X.\) Hence we will report our measurement of \(X\) as

\[X=\left\langle X\right\rangle\,\pm\,\frac{X_{\max}-X_{\min}}{2}\]

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|} \hline  & \(1^{\mathrm{st}}\) attempt & \(2^{\mathrm{nd}}\) attempt & \(3^{\mathrm{rd}}\) attempt \\ \hline Length of pencil / cm & 14.6 & 14.3 & 14.4 \\ \hline \end{tabular}

\[X=\left(\frac{14.6+14.3+14.4}{3}\right)\,\pm\left(\frac{14.6-14.3}{2}\right)\] \[=(14.4\,\pm\,0.2)\,\mathrm{cm}\]

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|} \hline  & \(X\pm\Delta x=(14.4\,\pm\,0.2)\,\mathrm{cm}\) & \(X\) & \(X\) \\ \hline Physical Quantity & Actual & Mean value of & Estimated uncertainty \\ (length of a pencil) & uncertainty & multiple readings & (considering max-min values) \\ \hline \end{tabular}

You would realise by now that there is some level of arbitrariness in declaring the uncertainty associated with our measurement. Nevertheless, while declaring a larger uncertainty will result in a larger interval that is more likely to contain the true value, remember that too large an interval will also cause any subsequent conclusions derived from the experiment to be meaningless.

In practice, many attempts are made and we have a very large set of data and a statistical approach is used to establish the uncertainty but we will not go into that as it is not in our syllabus.

**Fractional uncertainty**

The **fractional uncertainty** is the ratio of the actual uncertainty to the measured value.

The fractional uncertainty in a quantity \(x\) is \(\frac{\Delta x}{x}\).

Example: The fractional uncertainty of \(x\), \(\frac{\Delta x}{x}=\frac{0.2}{14.4}=0.014\).

**Percentage uncertainty**

The **percentage uncertainty** is obtained by converting the fractional uncertainty into percentage form by multiplying by 100%.

The percentage uncertainty in a quantity \(x\) is \(\frac{\Delta x}{x}\times 100\%\).

Example: The percentage uncertainty of \(x\), \(\frac{\Delta x}{x}\times 100\%=\frac{0.2}{14.4}\times 100\%=1.4\%\).

#### 1.4.1 Significant Figures and Decimal Places

The general rules are:

**1. Express uncertainties to 1 s.f.**

If the uncertainty in a measurement is estimated to be 0.025 for example, it should be rounded to 0.03.

**2. Express the quantity to the same place value as its uncertainty.**

Using the same example, 0.03 has its most significant digit in the second decimal place. Hence the quantity should be written to exactly two decimal places:

\(12.10\pm 0.03\)

and NOT \(12.1\pm 0.03\) or \(12.102\pm 0.03\).

Example 5

A student makes measurements from which he calculates the speed of sound to be 327.66 m s-1. He estimates that the percentage uncertainty is 3%. Round off the speed to an appropriate number of significant figures. [Ans: 330 m s-1]

#### Combining Uncertainties

There are established statistical rules for propagation of uncertainty from individual pieces of information. The A-level course only requires a simplified version of the statistical treatment.

**(i)** **Adding or Subtracting Measured Quantities**

When two measured quantities are added together or one subtracted from another, the actual uncertainty in the result is equal to the sum of the actual uncertainty of the two quantities.

We always add up the uncertainties even if the equation involves subtraction because we do not know the sign of the actual uncertainty and thus need to estimate the _largest_ possible uncertainty in our quantities.

**Rule 1**: For \(c=a+b\), the actual uncertainty in \(c\), \(\Delta c=\Delta a+\Delta b\)

For \(d=a-b\), the actual uncertainty in \(d\), \(\Delta d=\Delta a+\Delta b\)

**(ii)** **Multiplying or Dividing Measured Quantities**

When two measured quantities are multiplied together or one divided by the other, the fractional uncertainty in the result is equal to the sum of the fractional uncertainties of the two quantities.

**Rule 2**: For \(p=ab\), the fractional uncertainty in \(p\), \(\frac{\Delta p}{p}=\frac{\Delta a}{a}+\frac{\Delta b}{b}\)

For \(q=\frac{a}{b}\), the fractional uncertainty in \(q\), \(\frac{\Delta q}{q}=\frac{\Delta a}{a}+\frac{\Delta b}{b}\)

Here, percentage uncertainty can be used interchangeably with fractional uncertainty as they differ only by a factor of 100 which is multiplied equally to every term in the equation. The percentage uncertainty in \(p\) is equal to the sum of the percentage uncertainties in \(a\) and \(b\),

\[\frac{\Delta p}{p}\times 100\%=\frac{\Delta a}{a}\times 100\%+\frac{ \Delta b}{b}\times 100\%\.\]

Let us use a simple equation to illustrate the analysis of most mathematical or scientific equations we will encounter. Consider the linear equation \(y=mx+c\), where \(m\), \(x\) and \(c\) are all measurements with their associated uncertainties. Our experimental result, \(y\), will also have an uncertainty that depends on that of \(m\), \(x\) and \(c\).

The addition is simple: \(\Delta y=\Delta(mx)+\Delta c\) but for the product \(mx\), \(\frac{\Delta(mx)}{(mx)}=\frac{\Delta m}{m}+\frac{\Delta x}{x}\). Rearranging,

\[\Delta(mx)=\left(\frac{\Delta m}{m}+\frac{\Delta x}{x}\right)\left(mx\right) \text{ and hence }\Delta y=\left(\frac{\Delta m}{m}+\frac{\Delta x}{x}\right)\left(mx \right)+\Delta c\.\]* [30]**Scaling** Actual uncertainty in a measured quantity is _scaled together_ with the measured quantity.

* [31]**Rule 3:** If \(r=\mathrm{k}a\), then \(\Delta r=\mathrm{k}(\Delta a)\) where \(\mathrm{k}\) is a constant
* [32]**E.g.** if \(r=\dfrac{1}{4}b\) then \(\Delta r=\dfrac{1}{4}(\Delta b)\)

* [33]**Think of the above as a special case of Rule 1. For instance, \(r=3a=a+a+a\)
* [34]**For the case of dividing measurement by a numerical constant \(k\), think of it as multiplying the inverse, 1/k.

* [35]**Note: the fractional uncertainty \(\dfrac{\Delta r}{r}\) is equal to \(\dfrac{\Delta a}{a}\), as the constant \(k\) is cancelled out in the ratios.

[Ans: (\(9.8\pm 0.4\)) m s\({}^{\text{-2}}\)] \\ \hline \end{tabular}

### Special functions or complicated functions, X

If measurements are put together with trigonometric functions, exponential functions or other complicated formulae, use simple numerical substitutions to evaluate the uncertainty directly. The following rule may be applied.

\begin{tabular}{|l|} \hline
**Rule 5:** \\ Actual uncertainty of \(\begin{array}{c}\text{X}\\ \text{\Delta X}\end{array}\) & = \(\%\) (maximum possible X - minimum possible X) \\ \hline Example 11 \\ \hline Consider S = \(x\cos 0\) for \(x=(2.0\pm 0.2)\) cm, \(0=(53\pm 2)^{\circ}\). Find S with its uncertainty. \\ \hline \end{tabular}

#### Precision and Accuracy

These are two terms which we need to understand in our approach to measurements.

_Precision_ is a measure of how well a result can be determined (without reference to a theoretical or true value). It is the degree of consistency and agreement among independent measurements of the same quantity.

Measurements are said to be precise when _repeated_ measurements remain very close to one another. If a certain measurement which is done, repeated several times, produces widely varying readings, the precision is poor.

For example, three measurements of my height: 1.75 m, 1.76 m, 1.75 m are precise but 1.72 m, 1.78 m, 1.76 m are not precise.

_Accuracy_ is the closeness of agreement between a measured value and a true or accepted value.

For example, if we are told that an object has a true mass 500 g, a measured value of 400 g is inaccurate.

Similarly, the measurement of the acceleration of free fall, \(g\) = 9.40 m s\({}^{-2}\) is also inaccurate, compared to \(g\) = 9.70 m s\({}^{-2}\).

#### Systematic and Random Errors

We have asserted that the true and exact value of a physical quantity can never be known. This is because our measurement of a physical quantity will always be limited by experimental errors. The causes of these experimental errors can be split into two broad categories - systematic errors and random errors.

##### 1.4.4.1 Random Error

Suppose we take many measurements to determine the diameter of a thin piece of wire using a micrometer screw gauge and tabulate our measurements in a table.

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|} \hline Readings / mm & Frequency \\  & (no. of times of occurrence) \\ \hline
0.42 & 4 \\ \hline
0.43 & 6 \\ \hline
0.44 & 10 \\ \hline
0.45 & 7 \\ \hline
0.46 & 3 \\ \hline Total no. of readings & 30 \\ \hline \end{tabular}

The distribution of the measurements can be represented in the plot as shown.

Since we measured the combined diameter of five thin wires, we can write \(5d=(2.19\pm 0.01)\) mm. Hence \(d=\frac{1}{5}\big{(}2.19\pm 0.01\big{)}=(0.438\pm 0.002)\) mm. The actual uncertainty in our result has decreased tremendously and the diameter can now be expressed to one more significant figure than before.

. A need for a large sample size in order for the mean value to be a good estimate of the true value

When there are random errors present during measurement, due to the random nature of the errors, taking the mean of only a small number of repeated readings can result in a value that is still quite different from the true value. For the mean value to be a good estimate of the true value, a large number of repetitions is necessary. The more the better!

Example 13: Oscillations of a pendulum

The period of one oscillation of the pendulum \(T\) is related to the length of the pendulum \(L\) according to the equation \(T=2\,\pi\sqrt{\frac{L}{g}}\), where g = 9.81 m s\({}^{-2}\). A diagram of the experiment is shown on the right. \(T\) is measured for one oscillation with a stop watch and \(L\) is measured with a metre ruler held in hand.

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|} \hline  & \(T\)/s & \(T\)/s \\ \(L\)_/cm_ & (_1\({}^{\text{st}}\) reading_) & (_2nd reading_) \\ \hline
22.0 & 1.16 & 0.98 \\ \hline
23.5 & 1.07 & 1.23 \\ \hline
25.1 & 1.15 & 1.19 \\ \hline
25.6 & 1.30 & 1.10 \\ \hline
27.3 & 1.42 & 1.20 \\ \hline
28.1 & 1.38 & 1.25 \\ \hline \end{tabular}

Using the given information,

a) identify a random error in this experiment and explain the source of the error

b) suggest an appropriate method to reduce the random error you have identified

#### 1.4.4.2 Systematic Error

Suppose now we discover that the micrometer screw gauge used has a _zero error_ of - 0.02 mm. Every single measurement is off by 0.02 mm.

The distribution of the readings would look like this:

This shift of values from the real values is the result of a _systematic error_. Systematic errors are reproducible errors which cause a set of readings to deviate in a fixed direction from the true value. Systematic errors are caused by instrumental errors, environmental conditions, and poor experimental techniques. The source of systematic errors can be determined and eliminated by corrective action.

**Question: Distinguish random errors from systematic errors.**

**Answer: Random errors** are deviations of the measured value from the mean value, with varying signs and magnitudes. **Systematic errors** are deviations of the mean value from the true value, with same sign and similar magnitude.

**Eliminating Systematic Error**

In some cases, systematic error can be accounted for and corrected after it has been detected. The easiest way to detect systematic error is to note the vertical-intercept of the graph that is plotted. For example the graph of \(y=mx+c\) when plotted gives a \(y\)-intercept of \(b\) instead of \(c\) as shown in the diagram below. The systematic error of \((c-b)\) results in an underestimation of the \(y\)- values.

The effects of random errors and of systematic errors appear in graphs as illustrated below.

Proper usage of measuring instruments is essential in eliminating systematic error. Measuring instruments need to be checked before usage. Always ensure balances, callipers, scale pointers, digital devices all read zero before being used. Calibration of instruments should be cross-checked if possible by comparing a measurement using two measuring devices.

In many experiments, the most glaring error is due to the experimenter himself. Carelessness while taking measurements can result in severe systematic errors and random errors. However, blunders such as misreading a ruler or calculation mistakes should NOT be quoted as examples of errors in practical reports or exams!

### Examples of Systematic Errors

For instance, Measure the average background count rate and subtract it from the measured count rate. \\ \hline \end{tabular}

### Scalars and Vectors

Physical quantities that have _no direction_ associated with them are known as _scalars_. Scalars are specified completely by numerical values and units. Examples of scalars include distance, speed, mass, time, temperature, energy, gravitational and electric potentials.

Physical quantities that have both a magnitude and a _direction_ are known as _vectors_. Examples of vectors include displacement, velocity, acceleration, force, gravitational and electric field strengths.

In books, a vector is often denoted in one of the following ways: \(\mathbf{F}\), \(\overrightarrow{F}\) or \(\overrightarrow{f}\). The magnitude is indicated as \(|\mathbf{F}|\) or simply \(F\).

The direction of vectors should always be clearly presented. In written form, we can express, for example, velocity as 5 m s-1 towards the east, or acceleration of free fall as 9.81 m s-2 downwards. This is somewhat troublesome to write when we come to diagonal motions.

Diagrams are always helpful in Physics when dealing with vector quantities. Each vector is represented by an arrow. The arrow is always drawn pointing in the direction of the vector quantity and the length of the arrow is proportional to the magnitude of the vector quantity. If more than one vector is drawn on a diagram, the lengths of the different arrows should be representative of the relative magnitudes of the vector quantities.

For example, a boat's engine can propel the boat to move at 6.0 m s-1 to the east and the current in the river is flowing at 3.0 m s-1 also to the east. The two vectors can be drawn as shown.

Note the relative lengths of the arrows: the velocity of the boat is twice that of the current, hence its arrow is also twice as long.

Multiplication of a vector by a scalar simply scales the length of the arrow. Multiplication of a vector by -1 (or a negative sign, "-") reverses the direction in which the vector points.

#### Adding and Subtracting Coplanar Vectors

It is obvious that the boat moves down the river faster with the presence of a current than without. In addition the boat will in fact move slower if it is moving upstream or against the flow of current. Hence there must be an additive and subtractive effect when there are two of more vector quantities present in one situation.

The sum of two or more vectors is called the _resultant_ vector. The resultant velocity vector of the boat is 9.0 m s-1 when flowing with the current and 3.0 m s-1 when flowing against the current.

As demonstrated in the diagram above, resultant vectors are always found by connecting one arrow-head to the tail of the next arrow. The resultant vector is then drawn from the tail of the very first arrow to the arrow-head of the last arrow. This summation process can be repeated step-by-step for any number of vectors.

#### 1.5.1.1 Vectors in 1D

Vectors in 1D can be added or subtracted via two methods.

The first method is via vector diagrams as we have described earlier. However, because in 1D, the directions of the vectors are limited to either forward or backward, we can actually add or subtract them just like how we add or subtract scalar quantities with the help of a sign convention.

By adopting a sign convention where the direction along the flow of river is taken as positive, the velocity of the river current is then \(v_{current}\) = +3 m s\({}^{\text{-1}}\).

The velocity of the boat traveling along the river is \(v_{boat}\) = +6 m s\({}^{\text{-1}}\).

Hence the velocity of the boat as seen by someone on the shore is given by

\(v_{shore}=\left(+3\right)+\left(+6\right)=+9\ m\ s^{\text{-1}}\).

If the boat is traveling against the flow of river, using the same sign convention,

the velocity of the river current is then \(v_{current}\) = +3 m s\({}^{\text{-1}}\).

the velocity of the boat traveling along the river is \(v_{boat}\)= - 6 m s\({}^{\text{-1}}\).

Hence the velocity of the boat as seen by someone on the shore is given by \(v_{shore}\)=(+3)+(-6) = -3 m s\({}^{\text{-1}}\).

Notice that we have managed to resolve the vector equation \(\vec{v}_{shore}=\vec{v}_{boat}+\vec{v}_{current}\) without having to draw arrows.

#### 1.5.1.2 Vectors in 2D

Two dimensional vectors lie on the same plane (coplanar) but point in different directions that are not along a single straight line.

In the diagram below, \(\vec{a}\) and \(\vec{b}\) are two coplanar vectors lying on the plane of the paper but not along a single straight line.

The tail of each arrow indicates the position where a vector quantity is acting upon. In the diagram above, if both \(\vec{a}\) and \(\vec{b}\) are forces, they would be acting on the same point, or the same object.

Imagine if you were pulled by two friends, one at each arm, in different directions. In which direction would you move? Can you possibly move in both directions you are pulled? There only exists one resultant force that will determine the direction you will move.

Similarly, the resultant vector \(\vec{c}\) is obtained by adding vectors \(\vec{a}\) and \(\vec{b}\), or \(\vec{c}\) = \(\vec{a}\) + \(\vec{b}\).

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:28]

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:30]

The angle as shown in in the diagram, \(\theta=\tan^{-1}\left(\dfrac{5.0}{7.5}\right)=33.7^{o}\)

#### Resolution of Vectors

Since two vectors can be added to give a resultant vector, any vector can be broken up (or resolved) into two vectors or components. We will usually resolve a vector into two mutually-perpendicular components through the use of trigonometry and Pythagoras' theorem. Mutually-perpendicular vectors are independent of each other.

##### Practice

For each vector below, draw the two perpendicular components in the direction given by the dotted lines and state their magnitudes in terms of the respective values and angles.

The first example below has been done for you. Note that the dotted rectangle is an important working to account for the exact magnitudes of component vectors.

Each of the vectors above is resolved into two perpendicular components. A vector can be resolved into infinite pairs of perpendicular components. The choice of directions depends on the problem at hand.

## Appendix A International System of Units (SI)

The current International System of Units, universally abbreviated SI (from the French _Le Systeme International d'Unites_), is the modern metric system of measurement. This collection of units consists of seven defining constants 1, seven base units (from the seven defining constants), derived units (combinations of these seven base units) and a set of decimal-based multipliers used as prefixes. While there are units not included in the SI, the units in the SI are actually sufficient for use for all physical quantities known to us.

Footnote 1: CGPM announced the new definition of SI units from 7 defining constants on 16 Nov 2018. Details of the definitions are found here: [https://www.bipm.org/en/measurement-units/base-units.html](https://www.bipm.org/en/measurement-units/base-units.html)

\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|c|} \hline Base Quantity & \multicolumn{3}{c|}{SI Base Unit} \\ \cline{2-4}  & Name & Symbol & Definition \\ \hline length & metre & m & The metre is the length of the path travelled by light in vacuum during a time interval of 1/299 792 458 of a second. \\ \hline mass & kilogram & kg & The kilogram, symbol kg, is the SI unit of mass. It is defined by taking the fixed numerical value of the Planck constant h to be 6.626 070 15 x 10\({}^{.34}\) when expressed in the unit J s, which is equal to kg m\({}^{2}\) s\({}^{\ast}\), where the metre and the second are defined in terms of speed of light and \(\Delta\)vs. \\ \hline time & second & s & The second is the duration of 9 192 631 770 periods of the radiation corresponding to the transition between the two hyperfine levels of the ground state of the caesium 133 atom. (\(\Delta\)vs = 9 192 631 770 hertz) \\ \hline electric current & ampere & A & The ampere, symbol A, is the SI unit of electric current. It is defined by taking the fixed numerical value of the elementary charge e to be 1.602 176 634 x 10\({}^{.19}\) when expressed in the unit C, which is equal to A s, where the second is defined in terms of \(\Delta\)vs. \\ \hline thermodynamic temperature & kelvin & K & The kelvin, symbol K, is the SI unit of thermodynamic temperature. It is defined by taking the fixed numerical value of the Boltzmann constant k to be 1.380 649 x 10\({}^{.23}\) when expressed in the unit J K\({}^{\ast}\), which is equal to kg m\({}^{2}\) s\({}^{\ast}\) K\({}^{\ast}\), where the kilogram, meter and second are defined in terms of \(h\), \(c\) and \(\Delta\)vs. \\ \hline amount of substance & mole & mol & The mole is the amount of substance of a system which contains exactly 6.022 140 76 x 10\({}^{.23}\) elementary entities. This number is the fixed numerical value of the Avogadro constant, N\({}_{A}\), when expressed in the unit mol\({}^{\ast}\) and is called the Avogadro number. The amount of substance, symbol \(n\), of a system is a measure of the number of specified elementary entities. An elementary entity may be an atom, a molecule, an ion, an electron, any other particle or specified group of particles. \\ \hline luminous intensity & candela & cd & The candela is the luminous intensity, in a given direction, of a source that emits monochromatic radiation of frequency 540 x 10\({}^{12}\) hertz and that has a radiant intensity in that direction of 1/683 watt per steradian. \\ \hline \end{tabular}

#### Dimensions of physical quantities

The dimension of a quantity denotes the physical nature of the quantity. It only makes sense to add and subtract two quantities from each other when they are of the same nature.

_In order for a mathematical equation that relates different physical quantities to be valid, the terms on both sides of an equation must have the same dimensions._

_An equation where terms on both sides of the equation have the same dimensions is said to be homogeneous._

_Dimensions of physical quantities can be treated as algebraic quantities. The dimensions of derived quantities can be determined using the same mathematical equations that relate the quantities._

In the SI, we have identified seven base quantities, each of them is of a different dimension (there are seven dimensions). All physical quantities of the same dimension have the same SI base unit. E.g., the length of a football field, a person's height, the thickness of a piece of paper, these physical quantities all have the same dimension of length. They all have the same SI base unit of metre.

To every dimension, we can associate an SI base unit. In this way, when we check the homogeneity of an equation by comparing the units of every term in the equation in terms of SI base units, we are also checking the dimensions of each term. If all the terms of the equation have the same unit in terms of SI base units, then the terms will have the same dimensions as well and hence the equation will be homogeneous.

### Introduction

_Kinematics_ (from Greek xviev, _kinein_, to move) is the branch of mechanics that describes the motion of objects without consideration of the causes leading to the motion. The study of why objects move falls under the branch of _Dynamics_. The first part of this chapter deals with one-dimensional motion of moving bodies in rectilinear motion.

### Terminology

#### 2.1.1 Distance vs. Displacement

**Distance.**_X_

**Distance** is the total length travelled by a moving object irrespective of the direction of motion.

**Displacement.**_s_

The **displacement** of an object from a reference point O is the **linear distance** and **direction** of the object from O. The **linear distance** refers to the shortest distance from the **initial** to the **final position** of an object moved from one place to another.

Note that distance is a **scalar** quantity whereas displacement is a **vector1** quantity.

Footnote 1: Generally, scalar quantities in textbooks are italicised and non-bold, e.g. x, while vector quantities in textbooks are either represented by an arrow above the quantity, a twiddle (-) below the quantity or italicised and bold, e.g. \(\widetilde{\textbf{A}}\), \(a\), or simply \(A\).

For illustration, in the diagram below, an object travels from point O to point P along the path represented by the solid line. The distance travelled is represented by the length of the solid line. The displacement is represented by the **length and direction** of the dashed line.

#### 2.1.2 Speed vs. Velocity

**Speed.**_y_

The speed of an object is defined as the **rate of change of distance** travelled by an object with respect to **time**.

**Velocity.**_y_

The velocity of an object is its **rate of change of displacement** with respect to **time**.

### Describing Rectilinear Motion using Diagrams

#### 2.2.1 Ticker tape diagrams

A common way of analyzing the motion of objects in physics labs is to perform a ticker tape analysis. A long tape is attached to a moving object and threaded through a device that places a tick upon the tape at regular intervals of time - say every 0.1 second. As the object moves, it drags the tape through the "ticker," thus leaving a trail of dots. The trail of dots provides a history of the object's motion and is therefore a representation of the object's motion.

The **distance between dots** on a ticker tape represents the object's position change during that time interval.

The analysis of a ticker tape diagram will also reveal if the object is moving with a constant velocity or undergoing acceleration.

Usually, ticker tape diagram reflects the time axis in the usual sense we understand it, meaning, the dots on the right were made at a later time. For example, in diagram (iv), the separation between dots increases to the right, indicating acceleration.

#### 2.2.2 Vector diagrams

Vector diagrams use vector arrows to depict the direction and relative magnitude of a vector quantity. Vector diagrams can be used to describe the velocity of a moving object during its motion. For example, the velocity of a car moving down the road could be represented by a vector diagram. In a vector diagram, the **magnitude** of the vector is represented by the length of the **vector** arrow.

#### 2.2.3 Recording motion using stroboscope

#### 2.2.4 Multi-flash photo of a bouncing soccer ball

_Multi-flash photographs or stroboscopic photographs_ are photographs of a subject illuminated with a flashing light, taken by a camera with an open shutter. By keeping the subject in the dark and then illuminating the subject only at certain times, the resultant image will show a series of different positions of the subject.

Today, by using digital video camera and digital image compositing, a multi-flash photograph can be easily re-constructed from several video frames. The video camera enables us to record motion conveniently, even at high speed. A single video camera captures 2-dimensional motion on a plane parallel to the image plane of the camera. To record complex 3-dimensional motion, many video cameras are used. This technique is useful for sports biomechanical analysis and character analysis in animated film production.

### 2.3 Describing Rectilinear Motion using Graphs

#### Displacement vs. Time Graph (s-t graph)

On an **s-t** graph,

The **instantaneous velocity** is the **slope** (or **gradient**) of the **tangent line** at a given **instant** of time.

The **instantaneous velocity** is the **slope** of the **straight line connecting two points** corresponding to a given time.

- Average velocity is the **slope** of the **straight line connecting two points** corresponding to a given time **interval**.

- If an object moves with **constant** velocity, its **s-t** graph will be a **straight** line graph, and the instantaneous velocity at any instant is equal to the average velocity over the entire time interval.

#### Velocity vs. Time Graph (v-t graph)

On a **v-t** graph,

The **instantaneous acceleration** is the **slope** (or **gradient**) of the **tangent line** at a given instant of time.

- Average acceleration is the **slope** of the **straight line connecting two points** corresponding to a given time **interval**.

- If an object moves with **constant** acceleration, its **v-t** graph will be a **straight** line graph, and the instantaneous acceleration at any instant is equal to the average acceleration over the entire time interval.

The **area under a \(\nu\)-\(t\) graph** for a time interval of \(\Delta t\) gives the **change in displacement** of the object in that time interval.

#### Summary of relations among \(s\)-\(t\), \(\nu\)-\(t\) and \(a\)-\(t\) graphs

What is the expression of the change in displacement, \(\Delta s\), of the object from \(t\) to \(t\)? If you need to find distance travelled by the object in the same time interval, what would be your answer in terms of A, B and C?

**Example 4**

A student throws a ball vertically upwards at a speed of 20 m s-t from level A. Neglect air resistance.

**(a)**: Sketch the **s** - \(t\), **v** - \(t\) and **a** - \(t\) graphs from the moment the ball is thrown to the moment it returns to the student's hand.
**(b)**: Calculate the time it takes for the ball to return to the student's hand. [Ans: 4.1 s]

### Describing Rectilinear Motion using Equations (for uniform acceleration)

#### 2.4.1 Derivation of the Equations of Motion (for uniform acceleration)

In this section, we will analyse the motion for an object moving in a straight line with **uniform acceleration** and derive equations that could be used for similar motions with uniform acceleration.

Suppose at time = 0, the object is at point O with an initial velocity of \(u\). The object moves at uniform acceleration of \(a\) until time = \(t\), and has travelled through a displacement of \(s\) to arrive at point A with the final velocity of \(v\).

Let us look at its velocity-time graph:

Note: acceleration of object, \(a\) is given by the gradient of its \(v\) - \(t\) graph,

\[a=\frac{v-u}{t}\]

\[v=u+a\ t\]

Note: The displacement of object from point O, \(s\), is given by the area under its \(v\) - \(t\) graph from time = \(0\) to time = \(t\),

\[s=\frac{1}{2}\left(u+v\right)t\]

Substitute Eqn (1) into (2), we have

\[s=\frac{1}{2}\left[u+\left(u+a\ t\right)\right]t\]

\[s=u\ t+\frac{1}{2}\ a\ t^{2}\]

From Eqn (1), we have

\[t=\frac{v-u}{a}\ \ \text{ and substitute into Eqn (2), we have}\]

\[s=\frac{1}{2}\left(u+v\right)\left(\frac{v-u}{a}\right)\]

\[\Rightarrow\]

\[\nu^{2}=u^{2}+2\ a\ s\]

**Note:**

* The equation \(s=u\ t+\frac{1}{2}\ a\ t^{2}\) sets the reference point \(s=0\) at \(t=0\).
* The "boxed" equations can only be used if **the acceleration is constant**.
* The equations are **vector equations.** Therefore, variables have to be analysed along the same dimension. For example, if we choose to analyse the motion along the \(x\)-direction, then we can only use quantities like \(u_{x}\)\(v_{x}\) and \(a_{x}\). Acceleration along the \(y\)-direction \(a_{y}\) will not affect motion along the \(x\)-direction.

**Tips**

**Solving Rectilinear Motion Problems:**

In solving problems involving rectilinear (one-dimensional) motion, follow the following steps:

* 'from rest'/dropped' means initial speed, \(u=0\) -'stop' means final speed, \(\nu=0\) -'maximum height' means \(\nu\) at maximum height = 0
* Assign a positive direction and ensure the correct signs for vectors.
* Select and apply the relevant kinematics equations of motion.

**Example 5**

A motorist traveling at 13 m s-1 approaches traffic lights, which turn red when he is 25 m away from the stop line. His reaction time is 0.70 s. If he brakes fully such that the car slows down at a rate of 4.5 m s-2,

On which side of the stop line will he stop, and how far from the stop line would he stop?

[Ans: Beyond the stop line, 2.9m]

### Free-Falling Bodies

The simplest example of motion with constant acceleration is a free falling body.

**A free falling object is any object moving only under the influence of gravity, i.e. the effects of resistive forces (i.e. drag forces) and upthrust are negligible.** For free falling objects, whether they are initially thrown upward, downward or released from rest, they will accelerate downwards at a rate of **9.81 m s\({}^{2}\)**, regardless of the objects' weight, size and shape. Let us illustrate this below.

Consider a mass \(m\) under free falling. Since air resistance is negligible, the only force acting on the mass is its own weight. Applying Newton's 2\({}^{\text{nd}}\) Law,

\[F_{net} =ma\] \[mg =ma\] \[a =g\]

In essence, even though a larger mass experiences a larger gravitational force, its larger inertia also makes it harder to accelerate. These two effects cancel out cleanly. This curious coincidence causes a feather to fall at the same rate as a lead ball.

For a video explanation:

Acceleration of free fall by xmphysics

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT17C0zgn2c](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT17C0zgn2c)

**Example 6**

The following are 2 cases of objects in motion.

**Case 1:** A box of mass \(M\), sliding down a smooth incline.

Assume that air resistance is negligible.

**Case 2:** A feather of mass \(m\), falling in vacuum.

Assume that air resistance is negligible.

**(a)** Determine the acceleration of the box and the feather.

**(b)** Explain whether the cases are in free fall.

**(c)** Explain if the equations of motion can be applied to each case.

### Viscous Drag Force

In fluid dynamics, drag (or fluid resistance) refers to forces that oppose the relative motion of an object through a fluid (a liquid or gas). When a body moves through a fluid, it has to push the surrounding fluid molecules away in order to move. Hence it exerts a force on the fluid molecules and by Newton's Third Law, the molecules exert an equal and opposite force back on the body. Hence there is resistance to motion.

It follows that drag force depends on the **velocity** of the body, _i.e._ the faster the motion of the body through the fluid, the larger the resistance. It also means that if the body is at rest relative to the fluid, there is no resistance.

Other factors affecting the magnitude of drag force include the **shape** and **dimension** of the body (a more streamline shape allows a body to experience less drag as it pushes through the fluid) and the type of fluid (**viscosity** of the fluid).

When there is no turbulent flow (_e.g._ small and streamline objects traveling at low speeds) the drag force is proportional to the speed of the object. The magnitude of drag force can be stated empirically as follows:

\(F_{D}=k\nu\)

\(F_{D}\) : magnitude of drag force

\(k\) : a constant that depends on the dimensions of the body and the type of fluid

\(\nu\) : the velocity of the body relative to the fluidIf the fluid flow is turbulent (e.g. objects moving at high speeds through air, such as aircraft, skydiver and baseball), the drag force is approximately proportional to the square of the speed. The drag force is then given by:

\(F_{D}=k\nu^{2}\)

\(F_{D}\) : magnitude of drag force

\(k\) : a constant that depends on the dimensions of the body and the type of fluid

\(\nu\) : the velocity of the body relative to the fluid

### Non Free-Falling Bodies

In practice, free fall does not happen because of resistive forces. The effects on a diver or bungee jumper may not be significant, but this is clearly not the case for a parachutist where air resistance is (deliberately) used to limit the maximum downward velocity of the parachutist.

#### 2.7.1 Velocity-time graph of object falling through air

Let us now consider the motion of an object, dropped from rest, falling through air. If air resistance is not negligible, the forces acting on the object are:

\(W\) : Weight of object

\(F_{D}\) : Drag force

For ease of analysis, break the motion up into stages as seen below. Let us assume that drag force is proportional to speed.

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:65]

#### 2.7.2 Terminal Velocity

We can now explain why heavier objects fall at a faster rate than light ones in the presence of air resistance. For simplicity, let us assume air resistance is proportional to speed \(\nu\), _i.e._\(F_{D}=k\nu\).

Consider the free body diagram of an object falling at terminal velocity,

At terminal velocity, the acceleration is zero and so the net force is zero. Hence,

\[F_{D}=W\]

Assuming air resistance is proportional to speed, therefore \(F_{D}=k\nu_{t}\)

\[k\nu_{t} =mg\] \[\nu_{t} =\frac{mg}{k}\]

Based on this equation, we can now conclude:

1. Between two objects of the same dimensions but different densities, the denser one reaches a higher terminal velocity because it has a larger \(m\) but the same \(k\).
2. Between two objects of the same mass but different shapes, the more streamlined one reaches a higher terminal velocity because it has a smaller \(k\) but the same \(m\).

For a video explanation:

Terminal velocity by xmphysics

**Example 7**

A steel ball bearing is released from a height above a deep pool of oil and it reaches a terminal velocity in the oil. Sketch the graph to show the variation of the velocity \(\mathbf{\nu}\) of the ball bearing against time \(t\) when the ball enters the oil the drag force acting on the ball is

**(a)**: smaller than the weight of ball (Case A)
**(b)**: larger than the weight of ball (Case B)

Indicate clearly on your diagram, \(t_{t}\), the time when the ball bearing hits the oil. Assume that upthrust is negligible.

### Two-Dimensional Kinematics

In this part of the chapter, we deal with the kinematics of a particle moving in a plane, or two-dimensional motion. Some common examples of motion in a plane are the motion of projectiles, motion of satellites and the motion of charged particles in an electric field. For the beginning we shall deal with the special case of motion of **an object with a uniform velocity in one direction and a uniform acceleration in a perpendicular direction.**

#### 2.8.1 Projectile Motion

Anyone who has observed a soccer ball in motion (or, for that matter, any object thrown into air) has observed _projectile motion_.

**Projectile motion** refers to the motion of an object in the presence of a gravitational field. In this section, we are interested in the motion of an object projected with an initial velocity at an angle to the horizontal. To analyze this type of motion, we will start with an idealized model. The assumptions made in our idealized model are:

1. the effect of air resistance is negligible.
2. the acceleration due to gravity \(\boldsymbol{g}\)_is constant4_, _acts downwards_ and has a _magnitude equal to_\(g=9.81\ m\ s^{2}\). Footnote 4: We shall restrict ourselves to objects whose distance travelled and maximum height above the Earth are small compared to the Earth’s radius (6400 km) so that \(\boldsymbol{g}\) can be considered constant.

With the above assumptions, we find that the path of a projectile, which we call its _trajectory_, is always a parabola5.

Footnote 5: The proof that trajectory of a projectile is parabolic will be shown in Example 11.

* The path of the projectile is symmetrical about the highest point.
* The speed of the projectile is symmetrical about the highest point.
* The time it takes for the object to go from \(y=0\) to the highest point **is equal to** the time it takes for the object to go from the highest point to \(y=0\).

It was Galileo, who first accurately described projectile motion. He showed that it could be understood by analysing the horizontal and vertical components of the motion separately. He found that:

**The horizontal and vertical motions of the projectile are independent of each other.**To examine this idea further, let us examine the motion of 2 balls:

1. Ball 1 is a ball released from rest and allowed to fall vertically through a hole on the table, and
2. Ball 2 is allowed to roll off the end of a table with an initial velocity \(\mathbf{u}_{\mathbf{x}}\) in the horizontal (\(\mathbf{x}\)) direction.

Both the balls leave the table at the same time. The stroboscopic photograph below depicts the motion of both balls. Let us examine the vertical and horizontal motion separately.

\(\circ\) **Vertical Motion:**

Consider the motion of both balls in the vertical direction.

Note,

The **vertical displacement of Ball 2 matches the vertical displacement of Ball 1**.

The **vertical displacement and vertical velocity** of Ball 2 are only affected by the vertical acceleration \(\mathbf{g}\) (as in Ball 1).

\(\circ\) **Horizontal Motion:**

Consider the motion of Ball 2. Note that

The **horizontal displacements** made by the ball at equal intervals of time are approximately the same.

The **horizontal velocity remains constant** with time.

The **horizontal acceleration is zero**.

Consistent with our assumption that only the weight acts on Ball 2 and no other forces act in the horizontal direction. Hence, horizontal acceleration is zero.

The **vertical acceleration hence has no effect on the horizontal velocity and horizontal displacements.**

Hence, we see that horizontal and vertical motions are **independent** of each other and projectile motion can be simplified by analysing the vertical and horizontal motions separately. Another result of this analysis, which Galileo himself predicted, is that _an object projected horizontally will reach the ground in the same time as an object dropped vertically_. This is because the vertical motions are the same in both cases.

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:70]

From the above equations, we can easily use them to obtain other information of the projectile, like:

* **Maximum Height:** Maximum vertical displacement with respect to the initial starting point (vertical velocity, \(\mathbf{v_{y}}\) = 0 m s\({}^{\text{-1}}\)).
* **Horizontal Range:** Maximum horizontal displacement with respect to the initial starting point.
* **Angle of Projection for Maximum Horizontal Range.**
* **Equation of the trajectory of the projectile (see Example 13(v)).**

## 111 **Solving Projectile Motion Problems:**

In solving problems involving projectile motion, follow the following procedures:

1. _Read_ the question carefully.
2. _Draw_ a careful diagram summarising the given information.
3. Choose an _x-y_ coordinate system.
4. Identify the accelerations in the \(x\) and \(y\) directions.
5. If you are given the initial velocity, you may want to resolve it into its \(x\) and \(y\) components.
6. Analyse the horizontal and vertical motion separately.
7. Apply the relevant equations. Remember to take sign conventions into consideration.

We shall now work through several examples of projectile motion to familiarize ourselves with the strategy and the application of the equations.

## 11 Example 8

A long-jumper leaves the ground at an angle of 20\({}^{\text{o}}\) to the horizontal and at a speed of 11 m s\({}^{\text{-1}}\).

**(a)**: How far does he jump? [Ans: 7.93 m]
**(b)**: What is his maximum height reached? [Ans: 0.72 m]

**Example 9**

A stone is thrown from the top of a building upward at an angle of 30\({}^{\circ}\) to the horizontal with an initial speed of 20 m s-1. If the height of the building is 45 m,

**(a)**: How long is the stone in flight? [Ans: 4.22 s]
**(b)**: What is the speed of the stone just before it strikes the ground? [Ans: 35.9 m s-1]

**Example 10**

An Alaskan rescue plane drops a package of emergency rations to a stranded party of explorers, as shown in the figure below. The plane is travelling horizontally at 40.0 m s-1 and is 100 m above a point O on the ground.
**(a)**: Determine how far from the point O does the package strike the ground. [Ans: 181 m]
**(b)**: Determine the position of the package relative to the airplane when it strikes the ground.

Consider a projectile projected with an initial velocity \(\mathbf{u}\) at an angle above the horizontal, diagram above. Assuming that air resistance is negligible and the acceleration of free fall \(\mathbf{g}\) remains constant, derive using the equations of motion expressions of:

**(a)**: maximum height \(H\) reached by the projectile,
**(b)**: duration of time of flight \(t_{light_{t}}\)
**(c)**: horizontal range \(R\),
**(d)**: optimal angle of projection \(\theta_{\max}\) (for maximum range),
**(e)**: equation of the trajectory of the projectile.

Adopt the sign conventions as given in the diagram above.

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:74]

**Example 12**

A boy aims his slingshot directly at an apple hanging in a tree. At the moment he **shoots** a pebble, the apple **drops**.

The initial speed of the pebble is 25 m s-1. The position of the apple is 5.0 m above the horizontal level, (\(h=5.0\) m). The pebble hits the apple 0.50 s later.

**(a)**: Determine the angle at which the boy must aim his slingshot towards the apple. [Ans: 24\({}^{*}\)]
**(b)**: Find the horizontal distance \(D\). [Ans: 11.4 m]

#### 2.8.3 2D Motion with Air Resistance

Consider an object projected above the horizontal with an initial speed of \(u\) and at angle of \(\theta\) with respect to the horizontal.

Suppose that the air resistance experienced by the projectile is not negligible. Then **throughout the motion, the projectile will experience a drag force in opposite direction to its motion** (velocity). Let us further analyse the horizontal motion and vertical motion independently,

\begin{tabular}{l l} \multicolumn{2}{l}{**Horizontally,**} \\ \hline draw force(s) acting on the projectile & The drag force acts in (the same/opposite) direction to the horizontal velocity. \\ \multicolumn{2}{l}{\(\Rightarrow\) The horizontal velocity (increases/decreases/remains the same) with time.} \\ \multicolumn{2}{l}{\(\Rightarrow\) The **horizontal range is reduced** (as compared with the case if no air resistance present).} \\ \end{tabular}

**Vertically,**

\begin{tabular}{|p{142.3pt}|p{142.3pt}|} \hline On its flight up, draw force(s) acting on the projectile & On its flight down, draw force(s) acting on the projectile \\ \hline The drag force acts in (the same/opposite) direction as the weight _mg._ & The magnitude of the net acceleration is (less/more) than _g._ \\ \(\Rightarrow\) **Maximum height reached** is lower than if there were no air resistance present. & The drag force acts in (the same/opposite) direction to the weight _mg._ \\ The magnitude of the net acceleration is (less/more) than _g._ & The magnitude of the net acceleration is (less/more) than _g._ \\ \(\Rightarrow\) **Maximum height reached** is lower than if there were no air resistance present. & The final (vertical) speed \(\nu_{y}\) will be (smaller/larger) than the initial (vertical) speed \(\nu_{y}\) (at the point of projection). \\ \(\Rightarrow\) **The average (vertical) speed upwards is (smaller/larger) than the average (vertical) speed downwards.** & The average (vertical) speed downwards. \\ Since, distance travelled up = distance to come down & Since, distance travelled up = distance to come down \\ and Average speed = Total distance / Time taken & \(\Rightarrow\) **The time taken to travel up is shorter than the time taken to travel down.** \\ \(\Rightarrow\) **The time taken to travel up is shorter than the time taken to travel down.** & Furthermore, comparing the vertical motion of the projectile on its flight up and on its flight down, we see that:

\(\circ\) The (vertical) acceleration experienced by the projectile when it is going up is different from the (vertical) acceleration experienced by the projectile when it is coming down. (\(\alpha_{\nu,\up}\neq\ \alpha_{y,down}\)) \\ \(\circ\) For a particular height, the speed of the projectile when it is going up is also different for the speed of the projectile when it is coming down. & Hence, we can see that the **path of the projectile will not be symmetrical about the highest point**, _i.e._ the path is asymmetrical about the highest point. \\ \end{tabular}

**In summary,**

\begin{tabular}{|p{142.3pt}|p{142.3pt}|} \hline The key characteristics of a projectile motion with air resistance (compared to if air resistance is negligible) are: \\ 1. Horizontal range is shorter. \\ 2. Maximum height is lower. \\ 3. The time taken to reach maximum height must be shorter than the time taken to return to the starting point. \\ 4. Path is asymmetrical about a vertical line through its highest point. \\ \end{tabular}

## Further Readings and References

### Appendix I : Understanding the Calculus Notations

Although rigorous treatment with calculus is not required in the A-level syllabus, it is however useful for us to understand the physical significance of some of the calculus notations as they are commonly used to define physical quantities.

### The Derivative : \(\dfrac{d\psi}{dx}\)

Consider a graph of \(y\) vs. \(x\) as indicated by the curve in Figure 1. \(\dfrac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}\) indicates the gradient of the line joining the 2 points A and B on the line.

Figure 2 shows that if we move point B closer towards point A, eventually the 2 points will meet. At this point gradient of the line AB will be exactly equal to the gradient of the tangent of the curve at A. (as represented by the bold straight line). Mathematically, we say:

\[\lim_{xx\to 0}\dfrac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}=\dfrac{d\psi}{dx}=\text{gradient of the tangent of the $y-x$ graph}\]

This physical interpretation is very important in physics as many physical quantities are expressed in this derivative form.

For example, in our study of kinematics, we have :

Velocity, \(\nu\) = Rate of change of displacement with respect to time

\[=\dfrac{ds}{dt}\] \[=\text{Gradient of tangent of the $s$ -$ $t$ graph}\]

and

Acceleration, \(a\) = Rate of change of velocity with respect to time

\[=\dfrac{d\nu}{dt}\] \[=\text{Gradient of the tangent of the $\nu$ -$ $t$ graph}\]

Figure 2: Tangent of the curve at A.

### The Integral: \(\int y\ dx\)

The reverse process to taking the derivative is referred to either as _integration_ or finding the _anti-derivative_. Graphically, it is equivalent to finding the area under the curve. Let us see why.

Consider a \(y\)-\(x\) graph as shown in Figure 3. Suppose we wish to find the area under the graph from some initial \(x\) value, \(x_{\text{initial}}\) to some final \(x\) value, \(x_{\text{final}}\). One way to do so is break the area up into \(n\) number of small rectangles each of some area, \(A_{i}\).

Hence, the area of each small rectangle can be written as: \(A_{i}=y_{i}\Delta x\) and the total area under the curve can be estimated by summing the area of all these little rectangles, i.e.

\[\text{Total area, }A=\sum_{i=1}^{n}y_{i}\Delta x\]

where the symbol \(\sum\) (upper case Greek sigma) signifies a sum over all terms, i.e. over all values of \(i\).

For the approximation of the area to be even better, we can try to divide the area into smaller and smaller rectangles, by decrease the interval \(\Delta x\), i.e. we say that we let \(\Delta x\to 0\). Therefore,

\[A=\lim_{\Delta x\to 0}\sum_{i=1}^{n}y_{i}\Delta x\]

This is also written as \(\int\limits_{x_{\text{final}}}^{x_{\text{final}}}y(x)\ dx\). So, \(\int\limits_{x_{\text{final}}}^{x_{\text{final}}}y(x)\ dx\) is the area under the \(y\)-\(x\) graph.

Figure 3: Finding the area under a curve. The area of the shaded rectangle is equal to the product of the width of the rectangle \(\Delta x\) and the \(y\) value of the curve at the particular \(x\), \(y_{i}\).

We now use the defining equations for acceleration and velocity to illustrate the use of the above concept.

The defining equation for acceleration of an object is \(\ a=\frac{\mathrm{d}\nu}{dt}\)

Therefore, the change in velocity of an object is

\[\nu_{\text{traul}}-\nu_{\text{traul}}=\int_{t_{\text{traul}}}^{t_{\text{traul}}} \alpha(t)\ dt\]

which is the area under a-t graph.

Similarly, velocity of an object is \(\nu=\frac{ds}{dt}\)

Rearranging the equation, we also have the change in displacement of an object given as

\[s_{\text{traul}}-s_{\text{traul}}=\int_{t_{\text{traul}}}^{t_{\text{traul}}}\nu(t )\ dt\]

which is the area under \(\nu\)-t graph.

### 3.1 Introduction

_Dynamics_ is the branch of classical mechanics concerned with the study of forces and their effects on motion. Isaac Newton defined the fundamental physical laws which govern dynamics in physics, especially his second law of motion.

#### 3.1.1 Types of Forces

Broadly speaking, forces may be categorized into two kinds: **contact** forces and **non-contact** forces.

#### 3.1.1.1 Contact Forces

Forces acting between two bodies that are in physical contact.

\begin{tabular}{l|l} \hline
**Contact forces** & **Description** \\ \hline Friction & Force that resists the **relative** motion or the tendency for **relative** motion between two surfaces that are in contact. \\ \hline Normal contact & Net electrostatic repulsion between two surfaces that are in contact. \\ force & \\ \hline Contact force & Vector sum of friction and normal contact force, meaning the total contact force. \\ \hline Spring force & Force exerted by one end of a spring when the spring is extended or compressed from its natural length. The spring forces acts throughout a spring, in both directions. \\ \hline Tension & Force exerted by one end of a string/rope which is being pulled taut. The tension is constant throughout the string/rope and acts in both directions. \\ \hline \hline Uphtrust & **Net** upward force exerted by the fluid on a body fully or partially submerged in the fluid. \\ \hline Viscous drag force & Force that resists a body moving **relative** to a fluid. \\ \hline Air resistance & Drag force exerted by air on a body moving in air. Air resistance is a specific form of drag. \\ \hline \end{tabular}

#### 3.1.1.2 Non-contact Forces

Forces acting between two bodies which are NOT in physical contact (separated by a distance). This characteristic of the force is described as **action-at-a-distance**.

\begin{tabular}{l|l} \hline
**Non-contact forces** & **Description** \\ \hline \multicolumn{1}{c|}{} & **Physical property of a** \\ \multicolumn{1}{c|}{} & **body on which the force** \\ \multicolumn{1}{c|}{} & **acts on.** \\ \hline Gravitational force & Attractive force exerted between masses. & Mass \\ \hline Electric force & Attractive/repulsive force exerted between electrically charged bodies. & Electric charge \\ \hline Magnetic force & Force exerted between currents & Moving charges \\ \hline \end{tabular}

#### Weight

The weight of a body is due to the body being in a gravitational field. In most cases, the object of interest is close to the Earth and its weight refers to the gravitational force exerted on its body by the Earth. However, an object may have a different weight elsewhere, for instance, when it is in the gravitational field of the Moon.

Notes:

* Weight is a **force** (hence a **vector**).
* Direction: For everyday-life problems, the weight of the object is taken to act **vertically downwards** at the centre of gravity of the object.
* Magnitude: \(W=mg\)

_W:_ weight of an object (SI unit: N)

_m:_ mass of the body (SI unit: kg)

_g:_ acceleration of free fall/ gravitational field strength at the point (SI unit: m s-2)
* Weight is a non-contact force. It does not only act on a person sitting in a chair, but also on a flying bird, regardless of whether we take into account air resistance.

Distinction between mass and weight

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|} \hline
**Mass** & **Weight** \\ \hline A measure of the inertia of a body & A measure of the gravitational pull on a body \\ \hline Scalar quantity & Vector quantity \\ \hline SI unit: kg & SI unit: N \\ \hline Same regardless of location & Varies with gravitational field strength at each \\  & location \\ \hline Same regardless of the method of measurement. & Some methods of measurement do not measure the \\  & true weight but the apparent weight (see example 7) \\ \hline \end{tabular}

In everyday language, the terms'mass' and 'weight' are used interchangeably, e.g. I "weigh" 70 kg. In physics, and especially during examinations, such casual usage is _not tolerated_.

#### 3.1.2.1 Centre of Gravity

An object of a significant size has its mass distributed (not necessarily uniformly) throughout its volume.

The **centre of gravity** of an object is the point at which the weight of the object _appears to_ act.

Notes:

- In free-body diagrams, the weight should be drawn from the centre of gravity of an object.

- The centre of gravity of an object is not necessarily on the object. It may lie outside the object.

- In a uniform gravitational field, the centre of gravity always coincides with the centre of mass of the object.

#### Contact Forces

When two surfaces come into contact, they both experience contact forces arising from electrostatic forces between atoms of the surfaces. For ease of analysis, this contact force is often resolved into two components: the component perpendicular to the surfaces is called **normal contact force**, and the component parallel to the surfaces is given the name **friction**.

##### 3.1.3.1 Normal Contact Force

A block can rest on a table because its weight is balanced by an upward force the table exerts on it. This force arises from the electrostatic repulsion between the molecules of the table and the molecules of the block. It is called the normal contact force since it acts perpendicularly (normal) to the surfaces.

In free-body diagrams (see Section 3.2.5.1 for details), contact forces must be drawn from a contact point (e.g. somewhere along the base of the block). A common mistake is contact forces that are drawn from the centre of gravity (see diagram below).

* By definition, the normal contact force is always directed **perpendicular to the surfaces**.
* The magnitude depends on how hard the two surfaces are pressed into each other.

##### 3.1.3.2 Friction

Friction is the force that resists relative motion between two sliding surfaces (called kinetic friction), or the tendency for relative motion between two stationary surfaces (called static friction).

Direction

Friction is always directed in the direction opposite to the direction of **relative motion**.

For example, a block sliding along a rough table is gradually decelerated to rest. It experiences a (kinetic) friction directed backward because the block's surface is sliding forward relative to the table's surface.

On the other hand, a person is able to walk forward only if he experiences a (static) friction that is directed forward. The sole of his shoe tends to rub backward relative to the floor's surface. When an exam question refers to friction, you have to infer from the question whether the relevant force is a _retarding_ frictional force or a _propelling_ frictional force.

#### 3.1.4 Tension

In physics, tension refers to the magnitude of the pulling force exerted by a string, rope, cable or chain on the object tied to its end when it is pulled **taut**.

- _At the end of a string_, the direction of the tension force exerted on the object is **along the string**, directed **away from the object**.

- _Within the string_, the magnitude of the tension is constant, and the tension acts in both directions equally. The magnitude of the tension in the string is equal to the magnitude exerted at the ends.

- _The magnitude of the tension force depends on how much the string is stretched. Once the string is **slack**, the tension falls to zero.

- _In many situations, we idealise the string, rope, cable, etc. to be **massless** and **inextensible** to simplify analysis.

- _Strings or ropes are often used together with pulleys. Again, in many situations, we idealise a pulley to be **massless** and **frictionless** (at the axle) to simplify analysis.

- _The tension is equal to the magnitude of the forces applied by the ends of the string, even if the bodies and the cord are accelerating and even if the cord runs around a massless, frictionless pulley (figs. b and c)._

\(\bar{T}\) is the tension force in the cord (directed away from the body).

### Newton's Laws of Motion

#### Newton's 1st Law

**Statement of Newton's 1st law of motion**

A body stays at rest or continues to move with a constant speed in a straight line unless acted upon by a _net external force_.

Notes

Changes in a body's state of motion refer to changes in its velocity. It can be a change in either its **speed** or **direction** (or both).

An object's resistance to change its state of motion is called **inertia**. As such, Newton's 1st law is also referred to as the Law of Inertia.

An object's inertia is dependent on its mass: The larger its mass, the larger its inertia.

#### Linear Momentum

Everyday experience tells us that two objects moving at the same velocity can result in very different consequences. Consider a 3-gram ping pong ball and a 3-ton lorry, both travelling at 5 m s-1. Which would you rather collide with?

In physics, we define a "quantity of motion" called **momentum**, \(p\).

**Definition of Linear Momentum**

The linear momentum of a body is the product of its mass and its velocity.

Mathematically, linear momentum, \(\vec{p}=m\vec{\nu}\)

Notes

Momentum is a **vector quantity**. It has the same direction as the object's velocity.

Momentum has the Sl unit: **kg m s-1**. Sometimes the alternative unit **N s** is used.

In H2 Physics, when we refer to momentum, we mean linear momentum. It is not to be confused with angular momentum, which is not in the syllabus.

A 110 g billiard ball rebounds off a wall, with velocities as shown in the (top view) diagram. The ball moves on a horizontal plane. Evaluate the change in momentum of the ball.

#### Newton's 2nd Law

**Statement of Newton's 2nd law of motion**

The _rate of change of linear momentum_ of a body is _directly proportional_ to the _resultant force_1 acting on it and is in the direction of the resultant force.

Strictly speaking, Newton's 2nd law only states that \(\vec{F}_{net}\propto\frac{d\vec{p}}{dt}\).

Hence, \(F_{net}=k\,\frac{dp}{dt}\), where \(k\) is some constant of proportionality. When SI units are used for all quantities in the equation, the constant \(k\) has a value of 1.

Mathematically, net force, \(\vec{F}_{net}=\frac{d\vec{p}}{dt}=\frac{d(m\vec{\nu})}{dt}\)

Average net force, \(\left\langle F_{net}\right\rangle=\frac{\Delta\vec{p}}{\Delta t}=\frac{\Delta(m \vec{\nu})}{\Delta t}\)

The SI unit for force is the newton (N).

**Example 1b: Rate of Change in Momentum**

The time interval of contact between the billiard ball and the wall is 0.100 s. Find the average net force acting on the wall during the collision.

\({}^{\dagger}\) Resultant force is also known as net force, or (vector) sum of forces.

#### Impulse

**Definition of Impulse**

The impulse of a force is the product of the **average force** and the time interval over which it is applied.

Mathematically, \(\vec{J}=\left\langle\vec{F}\right\rangle\Delta t\)

Notes

* Impulse is a **vector** quantity; its direction is the same as that of the average force \(F\).
* The SI units for impulse are **N s**. They can be shown to be equivalent to **kg m s\({}^{-1}\)**, the same as the units of momentum.

#### Relation between Impulse and Momentum

From Newton's second law,

\[\vec{F}=\frac{d\vec{p}}{dt}\]

Rearranging and integrating, we obtain

\[\int\vec{F}dt=\int d\vec{p}\]

The left-hand side of the equation, \(\int\vec{F}\ dt\), is the **impulse** of the force.

The right-hand side, \(\int d\vec{p}=\vec{p}_{t}-\vec{p}_{i}=\Delta\vec{p}\), is the **total change in momentum**.

This result, which links impulse to the change in momentum, is known as the **impulse-momentum theorem**.

**Impulse-Momentum Theorem**

The impulse-momentum theorem states that the _total change in momentum_ of a particle during a time interval **equals the impulse of the net force** that acts on the particle during that interval.

Mathematically, \(\vec{J}=\int\vec{F}dt=\Delta\vec{p}\)

For **average** or **constant** forces, this simplifies to \(\vec{J}\ =\ <\vec{F}>\Delta t=\Delta\vec{p}\).

#### 3.2.4.2 Graphical Representation of Impulse

Since \(\bar{J}=\int\tilde{F}\tilde{e}t=\Delta\tilde{\rho}\), impulse is represented by the **area under the _force-time_ graph. The same area also represents the **(total) change in the momentum** of the body.

To illustrate further, study the _F-t_ graphs below. Notice that, even though the two forces have different peak magnitudes, they both deliver the same impulse (i.e. same area under each graph). Hence, the two forces will cause the same change in momentum to the object they are applied on.

It is easy to confuse action-reaction pairs with force pairs that happen to be pairs of "equal-but-opposite" forces. Performing the following "mental checklist" may help to detect "impostors".

**Answer:**

### Principle of Conservation of Linear Momentum

Momentum is an important concept because, momentum is a **conserved** quantity. Consider, for example, the head-on collision of two billiard balls, A and B.

Assuming **no net** _external_ **force act on the two bodies**, the only forces experienced by the two bodies A and B during the collision will be the mutual normal contact forces, \(F_{AB}\) and \(F_{BA}\), respectively.

By Newton's 3\({}^{\text{rd}}\) law, the two forces must be equal but opposite:

\[\vec{F}_{AB}=-\vec{F}_{BA}\]

Since the entire interaction is simultaneous and over the same duration, the impulses of the two forces must also be equal but opposite:

\[\begin{array}{c}\int\vec{F}_{AB}\ dt=\int-\vec{F}_{BA}\ dt\\ \vec{J}_{AB}=-\vec{J}_{BA}\end{array}\]

It follows that the momentums exchanged between A and B must also be equal but opposite:

\[\left(\Delta\vec{\rho}\right)_{A}=-\left(\Delta\vec{\rho}\right)_{B}\]

If we see the two billiard balls as making up one system, then the **total momentum of the system does not change** in the collision:

\[\begin{array}{c}\sum\Delta\vec{\rho}=\left(\Delta\vec{\rho}\right)_{A}+ \left(\Delta\vec{\rho}\right)_{B}\\ =\left(\Delta\vec{\rho}\right)_{A}+-\left(\Delta\vec{\rho}\right)_{A}\\ \sum\Delta\vec{\rho}=0\end{array}\]

The above derivation can be extended to include any number of interacting objects in three-dimensional space, involving forces of any nature (magnetic, electric, gravitational, etc.), as long as the condition of **no resultant external force** holds. The logic is surprisingly straight-forward:

\[\begin{array}{cccc}\sum\vec{F}=0&\Rightarrow&\sum\vec{J}=0&\Rightarrow& \sum\Delta\vec{\rho}=0\end{array}\]

Thus the general statement of the principle of conservation of momentum is

**Statement of the Principle of Conservation of Linear Momentum**

The **total linear momentum** of a system **remains unchanged** if **no net external force** acts on the system. Mathematically, \(\ \sum m_{n}\vec{u}_{n}=\sum m_{n}\vec{v}_{n}\)

The principle is **NOT restricted to collisions!**

Sadly, every year, many students get zero marks during examinations when asked to state the principle of conservation of linear momentum, because they write about momentum before and after collisions and stuff.

Notes:

* By a system, we mean a set of objects that we choose.
* Some textbooks refer to the system as being _isolated_. An isolated system is one in which the only (significant) forces are those between the objects in the system. The sum of all these "internal" forces within the system will be zero because of Newton's 3rd Law.
* then the total momentum of the system will _not_ be conserved. E.g., if we take as our system a rock falling under gravity, the momentum of this system is _not_ conserved because an _external_ force, the gravitational pull by the Earth is acting on it. However, if we include the Earth in the system, the total momentum of rock plus Earth _is_ conserved.

**Example 8: (Freedman)**

An open-topped freight car with mass 24 000 kg is coasting along without friction along a level track. It is raising very hard and the rain is falling vertically downward. Originally the car is empty and moving with a speed of 4.00 m/s. What is the speed of the car after it has collected 3000kg of rainwater?

**Answer:**

#### Two-body Systems

For a **two-body system**, the principle of conservation of momentum can be mathematically simplified as follows:

\[\begin{array}{c}\left(\Delta\vec{p}\right)_{A}=-\left(\Delta\vec{p}\right)_ {B}\\ \left(\vec{p}_{r}-\vec{p}_{i}\right)_{A}=-\left(\vec{p}_{r}-\vec{p}_{i}\right) _{B}\\ m_{A}(\vec{v}_{A}-\vec{u}_{A})=m_{B}(\vec{u}_{B}-\vec{v}_{B})\\ m_{A}\vec{u}_{A}+m_{B}\vec{u}_{B}=m_{A}\vec{v}_{A}+m_{B}\vec{v}_{B}\end{array}\]

**Example 9**

A marksman holds a rifle of mass \(M=3.00\) kg loosely in his hands, so as to let it recoil freely when fired. He fires a bullet of mass \(m=5.00\) g horizontally with a velocity of \(\nu_{B}=300\) m s\({}^{-1}\).

What is the recoil velocity \(\nu_{R}\) of the rifle?

Answer:

Note that since both the rifle and bullet are **stationary** before firing, the total initial momentum of the system is **zero**. Since momentum is a vector quantity, in order for the final total momentum to be zero, the **rife must move in the direction opposite to the bullet** (recoil).

#### Types of Collisions

A **collision** is an isolated event in which two or more interacting bodies exert **relatively strong** forces on each other for a relatively short time. Note that the two bodies do not necessarily have to be in any physical contact, as interaction may involve a force at a distance.

##### 3.3.2.1 Head-on vs Glancing Collisions

Head-on collision (1-D)Glancing collision (2-D)

A **head-on** collision is one in which the directions of motion before and after the collision are along the same line of motion.

##### 3.3.2.2 Elastic vs Inelastic Collisions

The total _kinetic_ energy of the colliding bodies is _not_ necessarily conserved during a collision. (This is unlike the total momentum, which is _always_ conserved during a collision.) Some kinetic energy is usually converted into vibrational energy of the atoms, causing a heating effect, sound, and deformation energy. How much of the original kinetic energy is conserved after the collision depends on the **elasticity** of the collision.

* An **elastic** collision is one where 100% of the kinetic energy is conserved, e.g. two diamonds bouncing off each other. Note that _during_ an elastic collision, some of the kinetic energy can temporarily be converted to potential energy.
* An **inelastic** collision is one that is _not_ elastic, i.e. some or all of the kinetic energy is converted into vibrational energy, sound, deformation energy, etc.
* A **perfectly inelastic** collision is one where the 2 objects coalesce (stick together) and move with **common velocity** after the collision, e.g. two lumps of clay that don't bounce at all, but stick together after the collision. This represents the **maximum possible loss** of kinetic energy without violating the principle of conservation of energy; it does _not_ necessarily mean all the kinetic energy is lost.

Note that **momentum** is **always** conserved, regardless of whether a collision is elastic or inelastic. In most exam questions, you will have to apply the principle of conservation of linear momentum.

**Example 10** (Perfectly Inelastic collision)

A car of mass 1000 kg moving at 20.0 m s\({}^{-1}\) collides with a car of mass 1200 kg, moving at 5.0 m s\({}^{-1}\) in the same direction.

(a) If the collision is perfectly inelastic, determine their final velocity after the collision.

(b) Calculate also the ratio of (total final kinetic energy) to (total initial kinetic energy).

**Answer:**

#### 3.3.2.3 Relative Speed of Approach/Separation during Elastic Collisions

Consider a two-body elastic head-on collision.

\[\begin{array}{c}\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt, width=142.26378pt]{figure1}\end{array}\]

By the principle of conservation of momentum,

\[m,\nu_{1}+m_{2}\nu_{2}=m,\nu_{1}+m_{2}\nu_{2}\]

Rearranging, we get

\[m_{1}(\nu_{1}-\nu_{1})=m_{2}(\nu_{2}-\nu_{2})\]

Since the kinetic energy is conserved during an elastic collision,

\[\frac{1}{2}m,{\nu_{1}}^{2}+\frac{1}{2}m_{2}{\nu_{2}}^{2}=\frac{1}{2}m,{\nu_{1 }}^{2}+\frac{1}{2}m_{2}{\nu_{2}}^{2}\]

Rearranging, we get

\[m_{1}({\nu_{1}}^{2}-{\nu_{1}}^{2})=m_{2}({\nu_{2}}^{2}-{\nu_{2}}^{2})\]

\[m_{1}(\nu_{1}-\nu_{1})(\nu_{1}+\nu_{1})=m_{2}(\nu_{2}-\nu_{2})(\nu_{2}+\nu_{2}) \]

Dividing question (2) by equation (1),

\[(\nu_{1}+\nu_{1})=(\nu_{2}+\nu_{2})\]

Rearranging, we get

\[(\nu_{1}-\nu_{2})=(\nu_{2}-\nu_{1})\]

The \((\nu_{1}-\nu_{2})\) term represents the relative speed of approach before the collision.

The \((\nu_{2}-\nu_{1})\) term represents the relative speed of separation after the collision.

We thus come to the following conclusion:

\[\begin{array}{c}\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt, width=142.26378pt]{figure2} \end{array}\]

For **elastic** collisions, the relative speed of approach is equal to the relative speed of separation.

Mathematically, \(\nu_{1}-\nu_{2}=\nu_{2}-\nu_{1}\)

This result can only be applied for a 2-body **elastic** collision. During examinations, the above statement must be **made** before it can be applied mathematically in solving problems.

**Example 11**: Assuming the following are **head-on elastic collisions**, solve for the unknown velocity \(\nu\) in each case. Note that the masses of the objects are not (necessarily) equal.

**Sloving 2-body Collision Problems**

Step 1: Indicate velocity vectors for each of the bodies before and after the collision. Choose a convenient positive direction, usually to the right. You can assume the unknown velocities are all positive. If the solutions turn out to be negative later, it means these velocities are in the negative direction.

Step 2: Set up the equation for the principle of conservation of linear momentum. The positive direction chosen in step 1 helps us to define the signs of the (known) velocities in the equations: velocities in the positive direction get a "+" and those in the negative direction get a "-".

Step 3: IF the collision is perfectly inelastic, use one variable to represent the final velocities of both bodies (i.e. make \(\nu_{1}=\nu_{2}=\nu\) ).

IF the collision is elastic, you will probably have two unknown velocities and need another equation. (You need as many independent equations as there are unknowns to solve them uniquely.) Use the equation for relative speed of approach/separation (preferred) of that for the conservation of kinetic energy (which is more tedious, as it is a quadratic equation).

Step 4: Solve for the unknowns, e.g. mass, initial or final velocities.

## Appendix A Static and Kinetic Friction

### Static Friction

The magnitude of _static_ friction between two surfaces can be expressed as

\[f_{s}\leq\mu_{s}N\]

where \(\mu_{s}\) is the coefficient of static friction between the two surfaces in question and \(N\) is the magnitude of the normal contact force between the two surfaces.

Static friction thus has a maximum magnitude, called the limiting friction, \(f_{\max}=\mu_{s}N\).

### Kinetic Friction (or sliding friction or dynamic friction)

The magnitude of _kinetic_ friction between two surfaces can be expressed as

\[f_{k}=\mu_{k}N\]

where \(\mu_{k}\) is the coefficient of kinetic friction between the two surfaces in question and \(N\) is the magnitude of the normal contact force between the two surfaces.

Unlike the static friction, kinetic friction is a constant value. It is also independent of the relative speed of motion.

Both \(\mu_{s}\) and \(\mu_{k}\) are empirically found to be always less than 1 (friction is always less than the normal contact force). \(\mu_{k}\) is found to be always less than \(\mu_{s}\) (kinetic friction is always smaller than the limiting static friction).

To better understand the two, consider the results of the following experiment.

An external force is applied on the block and is increased very gradually until the block starts moving and continues to move at a constant speed. Since the block is always either stationary or moving at constant speed, the magnitude of the frictional force can be inferred from the applied force as measured by the force sensor.

The graph of the applied force against time is shown below in relation to the magnitudes of friction, both static and kinetic:

## Appendix B: Newton's Law in Car Safety

Using Newton's laws, discuss how each of the following features in vehicles increases the safety of its passengers:

a) seat belts,

b) head restraints,

c) air bags.

**(a)**: Seat belt exerts a retardation force on the passenger, without which he would have continued in his state of uniform motion in a straight line into the windscreen. (Newton's 1st Law).

If a moving car crashes into another (stationary) car, it comes to an abrupt stop. If the passenger continues to move forward, he will crash into the windscreen and likely suffer from severe injuries, or even death. Without the seat belt, the only retardation force on the passenger is the frictional force between the seat and the passenger's bum. But this force is limited. If the vehicle decelerates too fast, the frictional force is not large enough to decelerate the passenger at the same rate as the vehicle. When passengers crash into the wind screen, it is due to their inertia: they are already moving forward and continue to do so. It is not due to some mysterious "forward force" that pushes them into the wind screen
**(b)**: If a car is hit from the rear, the head restraint provides a forward force on the passenger's head so that the head is accelerated at the same rate as the rest of his body. If the passenger's body accelerates forward much faster than his head, the passenger may suffer from whiplash (a kind of neck injury). The muscles in the passenger's neck do not provide enough force to accelerate his head as fast as the rest of his body. (Newton's 2nd Law)
**(c)**: A collision with the car's wind screen would bring the passenger to rest in a very short period of time. Airbags exert a relatively small force over a relatively long duration of time, safely bringing the passenger to rest by reducing the passenger's momentum at a relatively slower rate. (Newton's 2nd Law)

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:137]

### _Hooke's Law_

When we try to extend a spring by pulling it apart or compressing it with both hands, each of our hands will be subjected to an opposing force by the spring. We refer to this force as the tension or compression in the spring. For our purposes, we usually consider light springs of negligible mass. In 1676, Robert Hooke stated an empirical law that allows us to calculate the magnitude of this force.

Hooke's Law states that the **magnitude of force _F_**exerted by a spring* on a body attached to the spring is proportional to the **extension**\(x\) of the spring from its natural length provided the proportional limit of the spring is not exceeded.

\[F=k\mathbf{x}\]

\(k=\) constant of proportionality (also referred to as force constant or spring constant or stiffness of spring)

**Example 1 (N94/1/23)**

A spring, obeying Hooke's Law, has an unstretched length of 50 mm and a spring constant of 400 N m-1. What is the tension in the spring when its overall length is 70 mm?

* Note that, in general, all elastic materials obey Hooke's Law within their elastic limits. The law is not restricted to springs.

### _Upthrust or Buoyant Force_

#### 4.2.1 Pressure due to Fluid

If an object is immersed in a fluid, the fluid will press on the surface of the object. The normal force per unit area of the surface is referred to as the pressure due to the fluid. For a cylinder that is filled with water, the water pressure on the base of the cylinder will increase if more water is added and the water level rises. Similarly, if a small sheet of metal is dropped into the cylinder, the pressure on the surface of the metal sheet will increase as it sinks deeper.

Apart from water, we also experience atmospheric pressure due to the air above us. The atmospheric pressure we experience as we climb up a mountain will decrease as we ascend higher.

#### 4.2.2 Derivation of the equation \(p=pgh\)

Consider a column of fluid as shown in the diagram. This column of fluid is pressed inwards on all sides by the rest of the fluid in the beaker. Let

\(\rho\) (Greek letter _rho_) = density of the fluid,

\(A\) = surface area of the bottom of the column,

\(h\) = depth from the surface of the fluid,

\(V\) = volume of the fluid column,

\(m\) = mass of the fluid column.

The weight of the fluid is pressing down on the bottom surface \(A\). Since _pressure is force over area_, the pressure due to the weight of the fluid column is

\(p=\frac{mg}{A}\).

Recall that _density is mass divided by volume_, \(\rho=m/V\). Rearranging, we find that \(m=\rho\ V\), from which we get

\(p=\frac{\rho Vg}{A}\).

Note further that the volume of the fluid column is equal to the height of the column multiplied by the surface area, \(V=h\ A\). Thus, we find that \(V/A=h\), from which

\(p=\rho gh\).

Hence, the average pressure due to the weight of a fluid column is \(p=\rho gh\).

Note that we also have atmospheric pressure on top of the fluid column in the derivation above, pressing the fluid column down as it were. The total pressure at the surface area \(A\) is therefore equal to the atmospheric pressure added to the pressure due to the fluid:

\(p_{total}=p+p_{atm}\),

where \(p_{atm}\) is the atmospheric pressure at the surface of the fluid and \(p\) is the pressure at the bottom surface of the column due to the weight of the fluid alone.

Note that this expression for the pressure on the surface of the column is independent of the cross-sectional area of the column. Hence, if we consider a column where the cross-sectional area of the column approaches zero, we then obtain the same formula for the _pressure at a point_ in the fluid.

By considering an object that is very small, of negligible volume, we can say that the _pressure at a point in a fluid is the same in all directions_. A simple experiment can be conducted to illustrate this using a manometer. Since the height difference \(a\) remains the same as we change the direction that the opening of the tube is facing in the fluid, we can see that the pressure at the opening of the tube in the fluid is the same in all directions.

**Example 2**

The diagram on the right shows a mercury manometer connected to a gas container. The atmospheric pressure is 760 mm Hg and the point X is at the bottom of the U-tube.

a) What is the pressure of the point X in mm Hg?

b) What is the pressure of the gas in mm Hg?

c) If the manometer is disconnected from the gas container, what will be the vertical heights of the mercury levels from the point X in the left and right limbs of the manometer?

[Answers: 794 mm Hg; 776 mm Hg; 26 mm]

#### 4.2.3 Uphrust

For an object that is immersed in a fluid, the force that the fluid exerts on different parts of its surface differs according to the depth of immersion of that part of the surface. We will now consider the net force that acts on the object due to the fluid.

Uphrust \(U\) refers to the **net upward** force exerted **by a fluid** on a body **fully or partially** submerged in the fluid.

By considering the fluid forces acting on a cube fully immersed in a fluid as shown in the diagram, we can generalise the result to find the upthrust experienced by any body immersed in a fluid.

Let \(\rho\) = density of the fluid,

\(A\) = surface area of a face of the cube,

\(\Delta h\) = \(h_{1}\) - \(h_{2}\) = length of a side of the cube.

The fluid forces acting on the side faces of the cube are equal in magnitude and in opposite directions, thus resulting in **zero net horizontal force**.

The fluid force \(F_{1}\) acting on the **bottom** surface is \(F_{1}\) = \(\rho gh_{1}A\).

The fluid force \(F_{2}\) acting on the **top** surface is \(F_{2}\) = \(\rho gh_{2}A\).

Thus, the **net vertical force** is \(F_{1}\) - \(F_{2}\) = \(\rho gh_{1}A\) - \(\rho gh_{2}A\) = \((h_{1}-h_{2})\rho gA\) = \(\Delta h\rho gA\)

= \(\rho Vg\) (since the volume of the cube is _V = A A_H)

= (mass of fluid displaced) \(g\)

= weight of fluid displaced

_Reference: Why is upthrust always upwards (amphysics),_

_[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yih8xQMa5zw_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yih8xQMa5zw_)* [1] Hwa Chong Institution (College) H2 Physics C1 2023

**Archimedes' Principle**

For a body submerged or floating in a fluid, the upthrust acting on the body is equal in **magnitude and opposite in direction** to the **weight of fluid displaced by the body**.

\[U=\rho Vg,\]

where \(U\) = upthrust,

\(\rho\) = density of fluid,

\(V\) = volume of fluid displaced by the body,

\(g\) = gravitational acceleration.

In free-body diagrams, upthrust must be drawn from the centre of gravity of the fluid displaced.

**Example 3**

Icebergs are often a danger to ships since most of an ice-berg's volume lies beneath the surface of the water. One can only see the "tip of the iceberg." Find the percentage of the iceberg that is submerged.

(density of ice, \(\rho\) = 0.917 g cm\({}^{-3}\), density of sea-water, \(\rho_{w}\) = 1.025 g cm\({}^{-3}\))

### Translational Equilibrium

A large object can exhibit different kinds of motion. When we describe the object as rigid, different parts of the object cannot move relative to each other. However, the rigid object as a whole can still rotate about its centre of mass (rotational motion) while the centre of mass can have translational motion. Let us first consider the translational motion of the centre of mass of the object.

The object is said to be in translational equilibrium when it is stationary or moving at constant velocity. According to Newton's First Law, this happens when the net external force acting on the object is zero.

**Condition for Translational Equilibrium:**

The net external force acting on a body is zero, i.e. \(\Sigma F_{ext}=0\).

There are two common methods to determine whether an object is in equilibrium. The first method is resolving vectors and the second one is the use of a vector triangle.

In the first method, all the vectors acting on an object are resolved into horizontal and vertical components. If the sum of all the horizontal components and the sum of all the vertical components are zero, then the object is in translational equilibrium. For the horizontal and vertical component of a force \(F\), acting at an angle \(\theta\), we typically use the following equations to resolve the force vectors: \(F_{n}=F\cos\theta\), \(F_{v}=F\sin\theta\).

For the special case where three coplanar forces (i.e. forces acting on the same plane) are acting on an object and the object is in translational equilibrium, the forces can be represented in magnitude and direction by the adjacent sides of a triangle. In other words, three force vectors that form a triangle for which the directions of the forces are all either clockwise or anticlockwise around the centre of the triangle have **zero resultant**.

**Example 4 (Resolution of forces into component method)**

Four forces act on a particle such that it is in equilibrium. Three of the forces are shown in the diagram.

Find the magnitude and direction of the unknown force \(F\) that maintains the equilibrium.

[Answer: 2.73 N, at an angle of 67\({}^{\circ}\) anticlockwise from the force of 11.0 N]

### Moment of a Force

Besides translational motion, objects also exhibit rotational motion. Forces applied on a rigid body can also cause or change its rotational motion. The quantitative measure of the extent to which a force can cause or change the rotational motion of a rigid body is called the **moment of the force**, \(\tau\) (Greek letter _tau_). The **moment of a force** is also called the **torque**.

**Definition of Moment of a Force**

The **moment of a force \(\tau\)** about a point is the product of the (magnitude of the) force \(F\) and the perpendicular distance \(r_{\perp}\) from the line of action of the force to the point.

To illustrate the concept of perpendicular distance and line of action, let us consider the example of a spanner being used to loosen a bolt. A force \(F\) is applied at an acute angle \(\theta\) to the length of the spanner and at a distance \(r\) away from the point \(O\) as shown in the diagram below.

The line of action of a force is the line along which the force acts. The perpendicular distance \(d\) is the length of the line that joins the point \(O\) to the line of action perpendicularly. Using simple trigonometry, it can be deduced that \(d=r\sin\theta\). The torque of the force \(F\) about the point \(O\) can then be calculated as

\[\tau=(F)(r_{\perp})=(F)(r\sin\theta)=F\tau\sin\theta\,.\]

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:144]

### Static Equilibrium for Rigid Extended Bodies

Equilibrium is a concept to describe the state of a body that is either at rest or moving at a constant velocity. The conditions for equilibrium are the same, regardless whether the body is at rest or moving at a constant velocity. However, if the body is at rest, we say that the body is in _static_ equilibrium.

**Conditions for (Static) Equilibrium of a rigid extended body:**

**The net external force acting on the body is zero.** \(\Sigma F_{ext}=0\).

**The net moment on the body _about any point_ is zero.** \(\Sigma\tau=0\).

**Sloving Static Equilibrium problems**

1. **Isolate the body of interest.**

2. **Draw the free-body diagram and identify all forces acting on the body.**

3. **Set up the torque equation (condition for rotational equilibrium)**

**Choose a "good" reference point.**

**A "good" reference point is a point which lies on the lines of action of one or more of the unknown forces, thereby reducing the number of unknown terms in the equation.**

**Apply the condition** \(\Sigma\tau=0\)**,**

**sum of clockwise moments = sum of anti-clockwise moments.**

4. **Set up the two force equations (**\(x\) **and** \(y\) **components) (conditions for translational equilibrium)**

**Choose two perpendicular directions** \(x\) **and** \(y\)**.**

**Resolve all forces into** \(x\) **and** \(y\) **components.**

**Apply the condition** \(\Sigma F_{x}=0\)**,**

**sum of leftward forces = sum of rightward forces**

**Apply the condition** \(\Sigma F_{y}=0\)**,**

**sum of upward forces = sum of downward forces**

5. **Solve the equations to find the unknown forces.**

### Three-Force Systems

A solid body submitted to three forces whose lines of action are not parallel is in equilibrium, if the following three conditions apply:

1. The lines of action are coplanar (\(\Rightarrow\) all forces lie in one and the same plane)

2. The vector sum of the forces is equal to the zero vector (\(\Rightarrow\) they can form a closed vector triangle)

3. The lines of action are _convergent_ (\(\Rightarrow\) their lines of action cross through a single point).

_Reference: The 'Three forces must intersect at the same point' Rule, (xmphysics)_

_[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5bf80D0D2c_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5bf80D0D2c_)

A uniform beam balance of length \(L\) is hinged to a wall and is supported by a rope as shown. Show the direction of the force exerted by the hinge (attached to the wall) on the beam.

### Couple

**Definition of a Couple**

A pair of forces, which are equal in magnitude but opposite in direction, whose lines of action do not coincide.

Couples produce **only rotation** but no translation.

An example of a couple is shown in the figure below.

Taking moments about the centre of mass, the torque due to the couple \(=\)\(\left(\frac{1}{2}x\right)F+\left(\frac{1}{2}x\right)\)\(=\)\(xF\) (in the clockwise direction),

where \(F\) is the magnitude of the forces and \(x\) is the _perpendicular distance_ between the lines of action.

In fact, taking moments about **any point** would produce the same result.

**Torque of a couple** is the product of the perpendicular distance between the lines of action of the forces and the magnitude of one of the forces.

**Example 11**

The following diagrams show forces acting on uniform metre rules. The rulers are lying on a horizontal smooth table top and shown as seen from above.

Which of the diagrams do not show a couple?

For the other diagrams, what is the torque of the couple?

Assume that for each option, the two forces are parallel to each other.

## Appendix I Contact force and Frictional force

When two bodies are in contact such as a stone at rest on a road, the two rough surfaces actually make close contact only at relatively few places. Where contact is made, the road will exert a force on the stone as shown in Fig. (a). The vector sum of these forces is represented by the single force known as the contact force which the road exerts on the stone as shown in Fig. (b).

## Appendix II

### Viscous Force (air resistance and air drag)

A viscous force refers to the resistance force which a body experiences when it moves through a fluid (a gas or liquid). As the moving body exerts a force on the fluid to push it out of the way, the fluid would in turn exert an equal and opposite force on the body (by Newton's third law).

Two things to note on viscous forces:

1. The direction of the fluid resistance acting on a body is always opposite the direction of the body's velocity relative to the fluid.
2. Magnitude of the fluid resistance \(f\) increases with \(v\) the speed of the body through the fluid. 1. For small objects moving at very low speeds, the air resistance is proportional to \(v\), (_f_\(\propto\)_v_ ) 2. For larger objects (such as airplanes) moving at very fast speeds (through air), the fluid resistance also known as air drag is proportional to _v_\({}^{2}\), (_f_\(\propto\)_v_\({}^{2}\) )

refer to kinematics notes, section 2.6 Viscous Drag Force (pg 17-18) on other factors affecting the viscous force]

## Appendix III Buoyancy of a submarine

A submarine or a ship can float because the weight of the water it displaces is equal to the weight of the ship. This displacement of water creates an upward force called the buoyancy (upthrust). Unlike a ship, a submarine can control its weight, thus allowing it to sink and surface at will.

To control its weight, the submarine has ballast tanks and auxiliary, or trim tanks, that can be filled with water or air. A supply of compressed air is maintained aboard the submarine in air flasks for life support and for use with the ballast tanks.

When the submarine is on the surface, the ballast tanks are filled with air and the submarine's overall density is less than that of the surrounding water. As the submarine dives, the ballast tanks are flooded with water and the air in the ballast tanks is vented from the submarine until its overall density is greater than that of the surrounding water and the submarine begins to sink. To keep the submarine level at any set depth, the submarine maintains a balance of air and water in the trim tanks so that its overall density is equal to the surrounding water.

## Chapter 5 Work, Energy and Power

_"There is a fact, or if you wish, a law governing all natural phenomena that are known to date. There is no known exception to this law - it is exact so far as we know. The law is called the conservation of energy._

_It states that there is a certain quantity, which we call "energy" that does not change in the manifold changes that nature undergoes. That is a most abstract idea, because it is a mathematical principle; it says there is a numerical quantity which does not change when something happens._

_It is not a description of a mechanism, or anything concrete; it is a strange fact that when we calculate some number and when we finish watching nature go through her tricks and calculate the number again, it is the same._

_It is important to realize that in physics today, we have no knowledge of what energy "is." We do not have a picture that energy comes in little blobs of a definite amount. It is not that way. It is an abstract thing in that it does not tell us the mechanism or the reason for the various formulas."_

### Work

The meaning of 'work' in physics differs from everyday usage. Work done by a force acting on a body refers to the amount of energy that was transferred to the body by the agent that exerts the force.

A person holding a heavy book at rest may feel that he is doing work as he feels tired after a while but, although he is exerting a force on the book, there is no energy transferred to the book as a result and hence the work done on the book by him is zero.

#### 5.1.1 Work done by a constant force

Consider a constant force \(F\) acting on a body over a period of time, during which the object has a displacement \(s\) in the direction of the force.

The work done BY the force ON the body is defined as the **product of the magnitude of the force \(F\) and the displacement \(s\) in the direction of the force.**

For the general case when the displacement is not in the direction of the constant force, the work done by the force is the product of the displacement and the component of the force in the direction of the displacement, or, equivalently, the product of the force and the component of the displacement that is in the direction of the force. As can be seen below, both have the same mathematical expression.

\[W=F\ s_{i^{\prime}}=F\ (s\cos\ \theta)\]

Alternatively \(W=F_{i^{\prime}}s=(F\cos\ \theta)\ s\)

where \(F\) is the magnitude of constant force \(s\) is the displacement \(\theta\) is the angle between the force and displacement \(\cdot\)_subscript_\(\varepsilon\) refers to its vector component parallel with respect to some other vectors_

**Notes:**

* Work is a **scalar** quantity. The unit of work is the **joule** (J).
* It is assumed that the object is _not rotating_, or _changing shape_ (i.e. it is rigid), so all parts of the object move with the same displacement. In this case, the work done by a force can be calculated by using a point to represent the object, with the force acting on that point
* Where there are more than one force acting on a body, work done by the individual forces can be calculated separately.

**Concept Check 1**

As the man is walking around at a constant speed and holding up the load, is any work being done on the load? Explain why.

_Since F and s are perpendicular._

_Work done by Man exerting force F on the load = F s cos 90\({}^{\circ}\) = 0 J_

_Similarly work done by gravitational force is also zero._

**Concept Check 2**

Under what circumstance is the work done by a force acting on a body negative?

_W = F_scos\(\theta\)

Work \(W\) is negative

when 180\({}^{\circ}\) > \(\theta\) > 90\({}^{\circ}\), cos \(\theta\) is negative.

_e.g. When \(\theta\) = 180\({}^{\circ}\), cos \(\theta\) = -1_

**Qn: What does this mean physically?** The force is resisting the motion and doing negative work to reduce the kinetic energy of the body.

**Example 1**

A lawn mower is pushed by a force \(P\) of 20.0 N at 30\({}^{\circ}\) to the horizontal, against a horizontal resistive force \(D\) of 8.0 N. It moves a horizontal distance of 10.0 m. Calculate

(i) the work done by the force \(P\) on the lawn mower.

(ii) the work done by the resistive force \(D\).

(iii) the work done by the normal contact force from the ground and the weight of the lawn mower.

(iv) the change in kinetic energy of the mower.

#### 5.1.2 Work done by a variable force

Suppose an object is being displaced along the \(x\)-axis under the action of a variable force \(F_{x}\) that acts in the \(x\) direction. The object is displaced in the direction of increasing \(x\) from \(x=x_{i}\) to \(x=x_{r}\)

In order to calculate work done by the _variable force_\(F_{x}\), we first need to know how the force \(F_{x}\) vary with displacement. Let's imagine we were able to use a force sensor and a data logger to measure this variation and that we were able to get the plot shown below.

The total displacement \(x\) can be regarded as the sum of many very small steps \(\Delta x\). During each small step, the force is practically constant.

The total work done = sum of work done for each step

\[W =\Delta W_{i}+\Delta W_{2}+\Delta W_{3}+......\] \[=F_{i}\Delta x+F_{2}\Delta x+F_{3}\Delta x+......\]

As the width of the small steps, \(\Delta x\), gets really small, the sum of area of these strips will just be the area under the graph of \(F_{x}\) against \(x\).

\[W=\int\limits_{x_{i}}^{x_{i}}F_{x}dx\]

In other words, **the work done by variable force acting on an object that undergoes a displacement is equal to the area under the force-displacement graph**.

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:165]

**Work- Energy Theorem (good to know)**

* More generally, if the object does not start from rest (\(u\neq 0\)), and is acted by several forces,
* then the net work done on the object (i.e. the work done by the net force),
* \[W_{net}=mas=m\times\frac{1}{2}\big{(}v^{2}-u^{2}\big{)}=E_{k\ final}-E_{k\ initial}\]

* When there is no net work done on an object (i.e. work done by net force is zero), the object's change in kinetic energy is zero. Referring back to Concept Check 1 (p.5), no work is done on the load, so its kinetic energy remains constant. In Fig.(a), A diver's kinetic energy increases as she springs upward because positive work is done on her, since normal contact force **N** is greater than her weight **w**. In Fig. (b), a baseball player's kinetic energy decreases as he slides because friction does negative work on him.
* Work-energy theorem is valid even for varying net force. One useful example is when an object at rest is pushed from one position to another position, back to rest, we conclude that the net work done is zero since there is no change in kinetic energy in the process.

### Potential energy

We know that two bodies will tend to attract each other due to gravity. This means that if we want to separate the two bodies, we need to exert forces on them. The energy we use to do this is stored in the two-body system as gravitational potential energy. If we now release the two bodies, they will begin to move towards each other. The gain in the kinetic energies of the two bodies comes from the gravitational potential energy that was stored earlier.

Similarly, we know that two positively charged bodies tend to repel each other due to electrostatic forces. We can try to force them together, and in so doing, we need to exert forces on them and the energy we expend is stored in the form of electrical potential energy of the two-body system. If we now release the two bodies, they will repel each other and move apart at increasing speed. The gain in their kinetic energies comes from the electrical potential energy that is stored earlier.

The same principle applies to a spring. When loading a spring gun, we expend energy in compressing the spring. This energy is stored in the form of elastic potential energy and when fired, the spring exerts a force on the bullet and the work done by this force, which is the gain in the bullet's kinetic energy, came from the stored elastic potential energy.

In all these examples, the amount of stored potential energy in the system came from the work done by an external agent who set up the system in the first place.

There are three kinds of potential energy (PE) you will commonly encounter. They are summarized in the table below.

\begin{tabular}{|p{142.3pt}|p{142.3pt}|p{142.3pt}|} \hline
**Elastic PE** & **Gravitational PE (GPE)** & **Electrical PE** \\ \hline The amount of elastic PE stored in a spring depends on the extent to which the spring is stretched or compressed. & The amount of GPE stored in a system depends on the relative position of the masses in the system. & The amount of EPE stored in a system depends on the relative position of electrical charges in the system. \\ \hline When a spring is stretched, attractive forces act to pull the parts of the spring together and when the spring is compressed, repulsive forces act to push the parts of the spring apart. & Attractive forces act between any two masses. & Attractive forces act on two bodies of opposite charges and repulsive forces act on two bodies of like charges. \\ \hline Elastic PE increases when the spring is stretched or compressed. & In a two-mass system, GPE increases when two masses are separated. & In a two charged body system, EPE increases when two opposite charges are separated or when two like charges are brought closer together \\ \hline \end{tabular}

#### 5.3.1 Gravitational Potential Energy (GPE), \(E_{p}\) or \(U\)

Derivation of \(E_{p}=mgh\)

Consider a person lifting a box of mass \(m\) at constant speed to a height \(h\).

Since the box is moving at constant speed, there is no change in its kinetic energy. Net work done on the box must be zero. In the process, however, the person exerting a constant upward force on the box does positive work on the box while the gravitational force acting downwards does negative work. The work done by the person on the box is stored in the form of gravitational potential energy (GPE), \(E_{p}\).

Since velocity is constant,

there is no acceleration \(F_{net}=m\dot{a}=0\), thus \(F_{ext}=F_{0}=mg\).

We can form an equation as follows.

Increase in \(E_{p}=\) Work done by external force on the box by person, \(W\)\(F_{ext}\)\(h\)\(F_{ext}\)\(h\)\(mgh\)

Hence, Increase in \(E_{p}=mgh\)

Note:
* This derivation applies only to objects that stay near to the surface of the Earth during the motion, and \(h\) is small relative to the diameter of the Earth, so that the gravitational acceleration \(g\) on the body is practically constant during the motion. (
* The potential energy is associated with the gravitational force between the Earth and the mass \(m\). Hence the gravitational potential energy \(E_{p}\) belongs to the mass-Earth system and not simply to the mass \(m\) alone. It is a property of the system as a whole. In general, a system is one or more objects that we choose to study.
* \(E_{p}\) is a relative and not an absolute quantity. It is always taken in relation to a reference level which can be chosen arbitrarily. What is more important is the change in the \(E_{p}\) with reference to this level (as shown in the figure below). Consider the change in potential energy \(\Delta E_{p}\) of a 1.0 kg mass along path 1 and 2.

* The _work done on the mass_ in moving it between two positions _is dependent only on the initial and final positions_ and _independent of the path taken by the mass_. \(\Delta E_{p}\) remains the same for path 1 and 2. When the starting and ending points are the same, the total work is zero, and there is no change in the gravitational potential energy.

**Example 2**

[FIGURE:S4.F1][ENDFI

#### 5.3.2 Relationship between Gravitational Force and Gravitational Potential Energy

Consider the same box on p.10, we define the change in GPE as the work done by the external force on the box. The change in GPE can also be expressed as _the negative of the work done on the mass by gravitational force._

\[\Delta E_{p}=-\,W_{G}\]

Consider a small downward displacement, \(\Delta x\), at constant velocity so that \(F_{\mathrm{sat}}=F_{\mathrm{G}}\).

\[F_{\mathrm{sat}}\]

the work done by the gravitational force, \(W_{G}=F_{\mathrm{G}}\,\Delta x\) is positive.

Thus \(\Delta E_{p}=-\,W_{G}=-\,F_{\mathrm{G}}\,\Delta x\Rightarrow\,F_{\mathrm{G}}= -\,\frac{\Delta E_{p}}{\Delta x}\)

When we take the limit as \(\Delta x\to 0\),

\[F_{\mathrm{G}}=-\,\frac{dE_{p}}{\Delta x}\]

_the gravitational force is the negative of the gradient of the potential energy - position graph._

The magnitude of gradient gives the magnitude of the gravitational force, while the negative sign suggests that the gravitational force always acts in the direction towards lower potential energy.

Let us now apply the above relationship in _the uniform gravitational field_ near the surface of Earth, where gravitational acceleration is \(g\).

Consider a mass \(m\) at a height \(x_{0}\) from the ground, taking GPE = 0 J at the ground level.

Since GPE, \(E_{p}=mgx\), the \(E_{p}\) - \(x\) graph is a straight line graph passing through the origin, with gradient \(mg\).

The gravitational force at \(x_{0}\) is the negative of the gradient of \(E_{0}\) - \(x\) graph, or \(F_{\mathrm{G}}=-\,\frac{dE_{p}}{\Delta x}=-mg\).

In general, the force-potential energy relationship is applicable in any conservative1 system.

Footnote 1: See Appendix 1 for more details regarding conservative system and conservative force

Conservative force, \(F=-\,\frac{dE_{p}}{\Delta x}\) is the negative of the gradient of the \(E_{p}\) - \(x\) graph.

We will re-visit this relationship when we study the chapters on Gravitational Field and Electric Field later. In those chapters, potential energy is often denoted by the symbol \(U\). You will encounter situations in which you are given a potential energy - distance graph and you can use this general relationship to find the corresponding force.

#### 5.3.3 Elastic Potential Energy

In order to stretch a spring, we must exert an increasingly larger force to pull both ends of the spring apart as we stretch the spring. This is because the force we exert must at least be equal to if not larger than the resistive spring force that the rest of the spring exerts on the ends of the spring. Indeed, the resistive spring force gets stronger the more the spring is extended or compressed.

In fact, in most situations the resistive spring force needed to stretch the spring **increases in proportion to the extension**. Whenever this is true, we say that **the spring obeys Hooke's law**, i.e. **the spring force \(F_{spring}\) is proportional to the spring's extension \(x\)**, i.e. \(F_{spring}\) = -\(J\alpha\) where \(k\) is the spring constant. The negative sign appears because \(F_{spring}\) is in the direction opposite to the displacement \(x\). A stiffer spring that requires a larger force to stretch it has a larger spring constant. A stiffer spring also means that more elastic potential energy is stored per unit of extension.

Let a light spring be stretched through an extension \(x\), very slowly (at practically zero velocity) by applying an external force \(F_{ext}\).

To just overcome the spring force, the external force \(F_{ext}\)= - \(F_{spring}\).

\(W\)\(=\int\limits_{0}^{x}F_{ext}\ dx\ =\) Area under the _force-extension graph_

\(=\int_{0}^{x}Fx\)

\(=\int_{2}(k\ x)(x)\)

\(E_{\text{elastic}}\ =\int_{2}k\alpha^{2}\)

Hence, elastic potential energy \(E_{\text{elastic}}=\frac{1}{2}Fx=\frac{1}{2}k\alpha^{2}\)

**Example 3 (mod J99/l/23)**

A sample is placed in a tensile testing machine. It is extended by known amounts and the tension is measured. (i) What is the work done in stretching the sample to the first point where it no longer obeys Hooke's Law. (ii) What is the work done on the sample when it is given a total extension of 9.0 mm?

[0.15 J, 0.43 J]

#### 5.3.4 Work done by External Force on a Deformed Material

An elastic material (e.g. a wire) usually obey Hooke's Law closely unless the deformation is excessively large. If the material is stretched beyond its proportionality limit, it will no longer obey Hooke's Law and the force-extension graph will not be a straight line from that point onwards. If an elastic material (e.g. a wire) is stretched further **beyond its elastic limit** (also known as yield point), it will **suffer a permanent deformation** and not snap back to its original length when the external force is removed. If the wire is stretched even further, it will eventually hit fracture point and the wire will simply snap. The force-extension graph will look like the one shown in the figure below.

In such cases, to determine work done by external force on wire, one cannot simply use the equation \(E=\gamma_{2}\ \kappa\alpha^{2}\) since Hooke's Law is no longer obeyed. Instead, the work done can simply be worked out by estimating the area under the force-extension graph (shaded area).

When the wire is **stretched beyond its elastic limit** and the external force is subsequently removed, the extension is only partially recovered. Work done by external force on wire will be more than the elastic potential energy. Energy is therefore lost as heat.

Try this out I The effect of hysteresis is usually very small for metals, but is noticeable for polythene, glass and rubber. You can easily investigate this using a rubber band. By simply stretching it and then holding it against your lips you can detect a rise in temperature!

### Principle of Conservation2 of Energy

When solving problems via the energy approach, remember that this approach is based on the principle of conservation of energy:

Energy can be **converted from one form to another** but **cannot be created or destroyed**.

In other words, the total energy is neither increased nor decreased in any process.

* **When the only force that does work is gravitational force in the system, the total mechanical energy \(E\) (i.e. sum of kinetic energy and potential energy) is constant. Mathematically, \((E_{k}+E_{p})_{\rm initial}=(E_{k}+E_{p})_{\rm final}\) or \(\Delta E_{k}+\Delta E_{p}\) = 0**

Example: Consider the motion of a 1.0 kg mass projected vertically upwards from the ground with an initial speed of 4.43 m s\({}^{-1}\). Given that air resistance is negligible, the kinetic energy of the mass is converted to gravitational potential energy as it rises from 0 to A. As it falls back to 0, potential energy is converted into kinetic energy.

* **When there is presence of external forces doing work in the system, change in mechanical energy = net work done by external forces, \(W_{\rm ext}\). Mathematically, \((E_{k}+E_{p})_{\rm initial}+W_{\rm ext}=(E_{k}+E_{p})_{\rm final}\) or \(\Delta E_{k}+\Delta E_{p}\) = \(W_{\rm ext}\)**

Note that an external force can be doing positive work, adding to the total mechanical energy, or negative work, reducing the total mechanical energy of the system.

* [2] A. Attorcyclist drives horizontally off a cliff at a speed of 38.0 m s\({}^{\text{-1}}\). Ignoring air resistance, find the speed of the motorcycle just before it reaches the ground. [46.2 m s\({}^{\text{-1}}\)]
* [3] Would your answer in (a) change if the motorcyclist leaps across at the same 35 m height with an initial upward angle while maintaining the same initial speed of 38.0 m s\({}^{\text{-1}}\)?

```
Example 5 (external force present, mechanical energy is lost) A car of mass 800 kg moving at 30 km h\({}^{\text{-1}}\) along a horizontal road is brought to rest by a constant retarding force of 5000 N. Calculate the distance the car moves before coming to rest. [5.6 m]
```

**Example 6 (external force present, mechanical energy is lost)**

A block of mass 4.0 kg is released at point P on a curved frictionless track as shown. The block slides down a vertical distance of 80 cm and enters a sand pit. Determine the distance the block can move along the sand pit before coming to rest if the friction acting on the block is 85 N. [0.37 m]

```
Example 7 (external force present, mechanical energy is lost) A block of mass 4.0 kg is released at point P on a curved frictionless track as shown. The block slides down a vertical distance of 80 cm and enters a sand pit. Determine the distance the block can move along the sand pit before coming to rest if the friction acting on the block is 85 N. [0.37 m]
```

### Power

The same amount of work is done in raising a given body through a given height, regardless whether it takes one second or one year to do so. However, _the rate at which work is done_ is greater if less time is taken.

Power is defined as the rate at which work is done.

Instantaneous power, \(P=\dfrac{dW}{dt}\)

Average power, \(<P>=\dfrac{\Delta W}{\Delta t}\)

Notes:
* The SI unit of power is the **watt** (W). Power is a **scalar** quantity.
* Work can also be expressed in units of (power x time). This is the origin of the term _kilowatt-hour_. One _kilo-watt hour_ is the work done in 1 hour by an agent working at a constant rate of 1 kW.

Example 7 (Average Power)

A 1.10 x 10\({}^{3}\) kg car, starting from rest, accelerates for 5.00 s. The magnitude of the acceleration is 4.60 m s\({}^{2}\). Determine the average power generated by the net force that accelerates the vehicle. [5.82 x 10\({}^{4}\) W]

#### 5.5.1 Relationship between Power, Force and Velocity

Consider a force \(F\) that acts on a body for a small time interval \(\Delta t\). The body moves a small displacement \(\Delta x\) in the direction of the force.

Work done by the force \(F\) during \(\Delta t\), \(\Delta W\ =\ F\Delta x\)

Power delivered by that force \(F\) during \(P\ =\ \Delta W/\Delta t\)

the time interval \(\Delta t\) = \((F\Delta x)/\Delta t\)

= \(F\Delta x/\Delta t\)

= \(F\nu\)

where \(\nu\) is the instantaneous velocity of the body.

When a force \(F\) acts on a body that is moving with velocity \(\nu\), in the direction of the force, work is done on the body at the rate given by \(P\) = \(F\nu\)

Notes:
* A force \(F\) that acts in the direction of the displacement \(\Delta x\), does positive work on the body. It transfers energy to the body at a rate proportional to the speed of the body.
* If \(F\) or \(\nu\) varies with time, then \(P\) may not be constant. However, the product \(F\nu\) at any moment will gives the instantaneous power of \(F\) at that instant.
* Where \(F\) acts against the motion of the body, it does negative work on the body. It extracts energy out of the body at a rate equal to the magnitude of \(F\nu\).

Example 8: A 1000 kg car experiences a total resistive force of 2000 N moving with a constant velocity of 20.0 m s\({}^{\text{-1}}\) along a straight horizontal road.

What is the power developed by the engine of the car when it travels at 20.0 m s\({}^{\text{-1}}\)

(a) horizontally, and

(b) up a slope with gradient of 5\({}^{\circ}\)?

[40 kW; 57.1 kW]

### Efficiency (of energy conversion), \(\eta\)

No practical engine can transform energy from one form to another without some energy going to internal energy and other non-useful forms of energy.

The efficiency of any energy conversion process is the ratio of

* the useful energy output to the total energy input, or
* the useful power output to the power input

\[\text{efficiency }=\frac{\text{useful energy output}}{\text{total energy input}}\quad,\quad\eta=\frac{E_{output}}{E_{input}}=\frac{P_{output}}{P_{input}}\]

**Note:**

\(\eta\) (Greek small letter, Eta) is a ratio between two quantities of the same type. It has no unit.

**Example 9**

A small motor is used to raise a weight of 2.0 N at constant speed through a vertical height of 80 cm in 4.0 s. The efficiency of the motor is 20 %. What is the electrical power supplied to the motor? [2.0 W]

## Appendix 1 Potential Energy (_U_) and Conservative Force (Good to know)

From the derivation on p. 10, the _gain in gravitational potential energy_, \(\Delta U\) can be taken as:

the positive work done on the mass by an external force

when the mass moves (a distance _h_) to higher position.

\(\Delta U=F_{ext}\)_h_

or:

the negative of the negative work done on the mass by gravitational force

when the mass moves to a higher position.

\(F_{0}=mg\)

The above is applicable only to a conservative system, or a system that involves a conservative force, such as gravitational force, electric force and spring force. An essential feature of conservative forces is that their work is always reversible. Another important aspect of conservative forces is that a body may move from point 1 to point 2 by various paths, but the work done by a conservative force is the same for all of these paths. Thus, if a body stays close to the surface of the earth, the gravitational force _mg_ is independent of height, and the work done by this force depends only on the change in height. If the body moves around a closed path, ending at the same point where it started, the total work done by the gravitational force is always zero.

The work done by a conservative force always has four properties:

1. It can be expressed as the difference between the initial and final values of a potential-energy
2. It is reversible.
3. It is independent of the path of the body and depends only on the starting and ending points.
4. When the starting and ending points are the same, the total work is zero.

When the only forces that do work are conservative forces, the total mechanical energy \(E=E_{k}+E_{p}\) is constant.

**Not all forces are conservative.** Consider the friction force acting on the crate sliding on a ramp. When the body slides up and then back down to the starting point, the total work done on it by the friction force is not zero. When the direction of motion reverses, so does the friction force, and friction does negative work in both directions. The lost kinetic energy cannot be recovered by reversing the motion or in any other way, and mechanical energy is not conserved. There is no potential-energy function for the friction force.

Friction is a non-conservative force that acts to reduce the mechanical energy in a system.

However, non-conservative forces do not always reduce the mechanical energy; a non-conservative force changes the mechanical energy, so a force that increases the total mechanical energy, like the force provided by a motor or engine, is also a non-conservative force.

In general,

When there are only conservative forces,

**Change in total mechanical energy of the system = 0**

When there are presence of conservative forces and non-conservative forces,

### Introduction

Circular motion is a type of motion we often encounter in our everyday lives, - the motion of a car and its passengers when navigating a bend, the motion of the capsules of a Ferris wheel when in rotation, children on a spinning merry-go-round, and clothes being spun in a spin dryer.

On a larger scale, in astronomy, we know that the moon circles the Earth, which circles the Sun, which circles the centre of the Milky Way.

On the atomic scale, for early models of the hydrogen atom, we picture an electron orbiting around the nucleus at the centre of the atom (a single proton in hydrogen's case).

Have you ever wondered?

Why must an airplane tilt when executing a turn?

Why the reading of your weight would be different at the bottom of a Ferris wheel as compared to the top?

Why do people in a roller coaster not fall out at the top of the loop? (No, it is not because of the belts!)

The exploration of the fascinating world of circular motion begins here.

**A Short Revision on basic ideas of Newton's Laws of Motion**

_Newton's 1st Law:_

Describes the motion of any object not subjected to a net external force, specifically that

an object at rest remains at rest, or

an object continues with constant speed in a straight line.

In the presence of a net external force, a constant mass experiences an acceleration governed by _Newton's 2nd Law._

\[\ddot{a}=\frac{\dot{F}_{net}}{m}\]

Note:

Forces which are parallel to the motion of an object result in its motion either speeding up or slowing down, with the direction of motion remaining along the original axis.

Forces which are perpendicular to the motion of the object cannot affect its speed, but instead will change its direction of motion.

Forces which are neither wholly parallel nor perpendicular to the direction of motion will affect both the speed and direction of the object upon which the force acts. (Consider projectile motion.)

**In this chapter you will learn that objects may move in circular paths when they experience a force or forces acting perpendicularly to their motion.**

### Kinematics of Circular Motion

When an extended object such as the wheel of a bicycle is rotating, different parts of the wheel will travel different distances in the same time. The outer parts of the wheel will travel larger distances and hence will have higher speeds than the inner parts of the wheel. However, all parts of the wheel will pass through the same angle in a given time. Hence the speed of rotation of a wheel is better expressed as an angular speed, as this is the same for all parts of the wheel.

#### 6.2.1 How angle is measured

The S.I. unit for angles is not the degree but the radian. An angle measured in radians is actually the ratio of two lengths: arc length and radius. The _arc length_\(s\) is the distance travelled along the circular path, and the angle \(\theta\) is said to _subtend_ the arc length at the circle centre (Figure 1).

Hence, note that \(\theta\) is actually a dimensionless quantity since it is a ratio of 2 lengths.

\(\theta\) (in rad) = \(\frac{\text{arc length}}{\text{radius}}=\frac{s}{r}\)

\(s\) = \(r\)\(\theta\)

Figure 1

One radian is the angle subtended at the centre of the circle by an arc equal in length to the radius of the circle.

If the circumference of a circle \(s\) = \(2\pi r\), \(\theta\) = \(s/r\) = \(2\pi\) rad.

Since for a complete circle, the angle subtended is \(360^{\circ}\),

\(360^{\circ}\) = \(2\pi\) rad

We can deduce that 1 radian = \(\left(\frac{360}{2\pi}\right)^{\circ}\) = \(57.3^{\circ}\)

Conversion between degrees and radians:

\(180^{\circ}\) = \(\pi\) rad

\(Z\) (degrees) = \(Z\) x \(\frac{\pi}{180}\) (radians)

#### 6.2.2 Angular Displacement (\(\theta\))

The angular displacement \(\theta\) is the angle an object has turned about a fixed point. In circular motion, the fixed point is taken to be the centre of the circle (Figure 2).

\(\Delta\theta\) = \(\theta-\theta_{0}\)

If \(\theta_{0}\) = 0, then \(\Delta\theta=\theta\).

S.I. unit of \(\theta\): radian (rad)

Figure 2

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:195]

#### 6.2.5 Period (7) and Frequency (f)

_Period_ (7) is the time it takes for an object in circular motion to make one complete revolution, or cycle.

_Frequency_ (f) is the number of revolutions, or cycles, made per unit time. The unit of frequency is s-1, which is called the _hertz_ (Hz) in the SI.

frequency, \(f=\dfrac{1}{T}\)

_Note:_

When asked to _define_ frequency, students often give it as the number of revolutions _per second_. This is incorrect, as a frequency can also be given as e.g. per minute or per year (frequency of the Earth).

Since an angular displacement of 2\(\pi\) rad is travelled in 1 period,

_angular speed, \(\omega=\dfrac{2\pi}{T}=2\pi f\)_

Example 1

A Blu-ray player is spinning a standard Blu-ray Disc (120 mm diameter) at 900 revolutions per minute (RPM). Determine

i) the frequency of the rotation (in revolutions per second)

ii) the period of the rotation

iii) the angular speed

**Example 2**

Dishes are placed on a Lazy Susan at a reunion dinner during Chinese New Year. When the Lazy Susan is spun around to serve the guests, what can be said about the dishes in the inner circle compared to those in the outer circle in terms of their speed and angular velocity?

### Uniform Circular Motion

_Uniform circular motion_ is the motion of an object travelling at a **constant** (uniform) speed in a circular path.

An object moving in a uniform circular motion (Figure 4) has a _constant angular velocity_ (\(\omega\)). The _magnitude_ of the velocity vector (or the linear speed, \(\nu\)) is _constant_ but the _direction_ of the velocity vector is _changing_. Thus, the _linear velocity vector is continuously changing_ (\(\nu_{t}\), \(\nu_{2}\) & \(\nu_{3}\)) as the object moves around the circle. Since there is a change in the velocity with respect to time, the object can be considered to be undergoing acceleration. So the object is travelling at constant speed but is still accelerating!

In the next section we derive an expression for the magnitude of this acceleration in terms of the speed and radius of the motion. We also find out the direction of this acceleration which is quite a surprising result!

_Centripetal acceleration of a body moving with constant speed in circular motion:_

[https://xmphysics.com/2022/12/22/6-1-3/](https://xmphysics.com/2022/12/22/6-1-3/)

#### 6.3.1 Derivation of the equation of centripetal acceleration

In this derivation we only consider the kinematics of uniform circular motion to arrive at a general expression for the acceleration an object is experiencing when it moves in a circle at constant speed.

Consider a particle moving in a circle of radius \(r\) with uniform angular speed (Figure 4(a)). At one instant the particle is at A, and its instantaneous velocity is \(v_{A}\) in the direction AA'.

A short time \(\Delta t\) later, the particle has moved to B, a distance \(t\Delta\theta\) along the arc, where \(\Delta\theta\) is a small angle, and the particle's velocity has changed to \(v_{B}\) in the direction BB'.

With reference to the vector triangle in Figure 4(b), which is rotated \(90^{\circ}\) with respect to Figure 4(a), the arc length can be approximated to a chord. For small angle \(\Delta\theta\),

\[\begin{array}{l}\Delta\nu\approx\nu\Delta\theta\qquad\text{(note, magnitude of $\nu_{A}=v_{B}=\nu$)}\\ \Delta\nu/\Delta t\approx\nu\Delta\theta\Delta t\\ \frac{\partial\nu}{dt}=\nu\frac{\partial\theta}{dt}\\ \alpha=\nu\omega\end{array}\]

Similarly,

\[\begin{array}{l}\alpha=(r\omega)\omega=r\omega^{2}\\ \alpha=\nu(\frac{\nu}{r})=\frac{\nu^{2}}{r}\end{array}\]

As \(\Delta t\) (or \(\Delta\theta\)) (Figure 4(b)) becomes smaller, the angle between \(\Delta\nu\) and either \(\nu_{A}\) or \(\nu_{B}\) will tend to \(90^{\circ}\). Since \(\nu_{A}\) and \(\nu_{B}\) are _tangent_ to the circular path, this means \(\Delta\nu\) will point _towards the centre_ of the circular path. From the derivation above, we see that the acceleration \(\alpha\) points in the same direction as \(\Delta\nu\), so the acceleration also points towards the centre of the circular path. This type of acceleration in uniform circular motion is called _centripetal acceleration_ (centripetal means centre-seeking).

The centripetal acceleration is directed radially inward towards the centre of the circular path. The direction of the centripetal acceleration is thus continuously changing.

For an object in _uniform circular motion_, there is **no** acceleration component in the tangential direction (i.e. angular acceleration), or else the magnitude of the velocity vector (tangential or linear speed) would change.

The centripetal acceleration is indicated by the subscript \(c\). Hence,

Centripetal acceleration, \(a_{c}=\frac{\nu^{2}}{r}=r\omega^{2}=\nu\omega\)

_Deriving the formula for centripetal acceleration \(a=\frac{\nu^{2}}{r}\)_ :

Derivation of Formula for Centripetal Acceleration \(\nu^{2}/r\) - YouTube

**Conceptual Questions:**

1. _Is an object travelling at non-uniform speed accelerating?_

Yes, there is a change in velocity.
2. _Can an object travelling at constant speed be accelerating?_

Yes, an example is an object moving in circular motion.

#### 6.3.2 Centripetal Force (\(F_{c}\))

In the last section we discovered both the magnitude and direction of the acceleration associated with circular motion. We now move into the dynamics of circular motion, quantifying and identifying forces that can constrain objects to follow such circular paths.

To provide acceleration, there must be a net force. Thus, **to produce a centripetal (inward) acceleration, there must be a resultant force towards the centre of the circular motion**. As the resultant force is centre-seeking, we call it the centripetal force, also indicated by the subscript \(c\).

From Newton's second law (\(\sum F=ma\)),

\(F_{c}=ma_{c}=\frac{m\nu^{2}}{r}=m\nu^{2}=m\nu\), and it is **always directed toward the centre** of the circle.

_Note:_ In general, when a force is continuously applied **at an angle of 90deg to the direction of motion** (which in this case centripetal force is), _only the direction_ of the velocity changes.

**Conceptual Question:** Is there work done by a centripetal force?

No, the centripetal force is always perpendicular to motion. (\(W=F\)s cos\(\theta\), where \(\theta=90\)deg)

_Note:_ For uniform circular motion,

* Centripetal force is not a new type of force, it is provided by the **net force** pointing toward the centre of the circular path, and this net force is the **vector sum of all the force components that point along the radial direction**.
* Forces labelled as "centripetal" or labelled as \(\frac{m\nu^{2}}{r}\) should **never** appear in a free-body diagram!

_Some forces that provide the centripetal force necessary for a body to undergo a circular motion:_

[https://xmphvsics.com/2023/01/02/6-2-1-centripetal-force/](https://xmphvsics.com/2023/01/02/6-2-1-centripetal-force/)

**Example 3 - Conical pendulum**

In a conical pendulum system, a small pendulum bob of mass 0.50 kg is rotating in a fixed horizontal plane. The string is 30 cm long and makes an angle of 15\({}^{\circ}\) to the vertical.

Calculate the (a) tension in the string;

(b) linear speed of the bob;

(c) period of rotation of the bob.

_A conical problem explained:_

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CDwVWMvOgC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CDwVWMvOgC)

**Example 4**

Explain, with the aid of a diagram, why the mass at the end of a light inelastic string cannot be whirled in uniform circular motion in such a way that the string is horizontal.

### Vertical Circular Motion

When an object is set to travel in a vertical circular path, (without the use of a motor*) its speed will not be constant as some kinetic energy will be lost to account for potential energy the object gains as it climbs the circle. This results in **non-uniform circular motion**. For non-uniform motion, _the net force is no longer equal to the centripetal force_. We can still resolve the net force into its tangential and radial components. The tangential component changes only the speed of the motion, while the radial component changes only the direction of the motion. Calculations-wise, the equation for centripetal acceleration is still \(\frac{V^{2}}{r}\), just that centripetal acceleration must now vary as the speed changes.

Typical examples of vertical non-uniform motion, are a roller coaster going through a loop-de-loop and an object whirled in a vertical circle at the end of a string. Both will be further explored in Examples 5 and 6 below. **We will assume in both cases, that the object's total energy is conserved**. At the top of the circular motion, the object's gravitational potential energy is larger than at the bottom of the circular motion. By the principle of conservation of energy, the object will be moving faster at the bottom than at the top as it will possess more kinetic energy to compensate for having less potential energy.

Depending on the context, there are two approaches to attack problems involving vertical, non-uniform motion.

In the **FORCES APPROACH**, we follow our **general strategy for solving dynamics problems**: drawing a free-body diagram, carefully identifying the individual forces experienced by the object undergoing circular motion, and determining the net force acting on the object. Subsequently, we resolve the net force into its _tangential_ and _centripetal_ components.

The **ENERGY APPROACH**, involving vertical, non-uniform circular motion invokes the **principle of conservation of energy**. We know how the gravitational potential energy changes as an object goes from a higher point to a lower point. Hence, if we know the difference in height between two points, we also know the difference in kinetic energy and, thus, the difference in speed.

*Take the Singapore Flyer as an example, the carriages are moving in a uniform circular motion although it is a vertical circular path.

**Example 5 - Roller coaster**

Some roller coasters have several loops along the track. The picture on the right illustrates such a coaster executing a loop-the-loop.

In the question below, assume that the total mass of one car plus its passengers is 170 kg and that friction can be ignored.

(a) A passenger car for a roller coaster enters a loop of radius 19 m at position 1, as indicated in the diagram, with a speed of 33 m s\({}^{\text{-1}}\). Determine the normal contact force the track exerts on the car at i) the bottom (position 1) and ii) the top (position 2) of the loop.

(b) Find the minimum speed at which the passenger car must travel while it is at the top of the loop, in order to clear the loop safely.

A stone of mass 800 g is tied to one end of a string and is whirled in a vertical circle. The string is inextensible and of length 1.2 m. The stone has a certain speed \(V_{A}\) at the lowest point, as shown below.

1. Determine the minimum speed the stone must have at the top of the circular motion if the string is to be taut at that instant.
2. Hence, show that the stone can complete a vertical circular motion if \(V_{A}=8.0\) m s\({}^{-1}\).

Analysing vertical circular motion:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0ByVmuOfIU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0ByVmuOfIU)

In some other instances of vertical circular motion, the speeds of the objects are kept constant (e.g. Ferris wheel). In these cases, the objects are undergoing uniform circular motion. You will encounter some of these applications in the tutorial.

### _Problem solving for Circular Motion_

1. Identify the object undergoing circular motion (and the relevant known quantities such as \(m\), \(v\), \(r\), \(\omega\)...).
2. Draw a **free-body diagram** of the object, carefully identifying the individual forces _experienced by_ the object, to determine the net force acting on the object.
3. **Resolve the net force** into relevant perpendicular "directions", i.e., the tangential and centripetal components.
4. The **tangential component** is usually zero. If it is not, applying Newton's 2nd Law to the tangential component only will tell you how fast the object is slowing down or speeding up.
5. The **centripetal component** will be equal to \(\frac{m\nu^{2}}{r}\). You can use this to determine any further unknowns in the question.

Note that you have not learnt a new way of solving physics problems. The main strategy is still to draw a free-body diagram and to resolve the net force into perpendicular components. In the previous topics, it was convenient to take the horizontal and the vertical component, or the component along some slope and the component perpendicular to it. Now it is convenient to choose components parallel and perpendicular to the motion.

**Example 7 - Car going around a bend**:

1. A bend in the road has a 50 m radius of curvature. A car of mass 600 kg takes the bend at 45 km h-1. 1. What is the centripetal acceleration of the car? 2. What is the centripetal force experienced by the car and what provides it? 3. What will happen to the car if driver decides to take the bend at 60 km h-1 instead? (Given that the maximum friction between the tyres and road surface is 3000 N.) [label=()]
2. When the car negotiates a corner on horizontal ground, the frictional force between the tyres and the ground is the only force providing the centripetal force. As there is a limit to this frictional force for a particular road surface, there is a maximum speed which the car can make the turn safely, beyond which skidding will occur.

Hence, some corners (especially at race-tracks) have raised embankments to increase the maximum speed at which a vehicle can turn the corner than if on a level road. It does so by making the **normal contact force** contribute a component to the centripetal force.

For an embankment inclined at 20\({}^{\circ}\) to the horizontal, find the speed at which the normal contact force is able to **completely provide the centripetal force** (i.e. no frictional force is required).

### Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation

Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation states that:

Every **point mass attracts** every other **point mass** with a **force** that is directly **proportional to the product of their masses** and **inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them**.

Consider two point masses of \(m_{t}\) and \(m_{2}\) separated by a distance \(r\). Each will exert a force \(F\) on the other, and its magnitude is given by

\[F=G\frac{m_{t}m_{2}}{r^{2}}\]

where 

The two forces form an **action-reaction pair** and have the following characteristics,

* are equal in magnitude,
* are opposite in direction,
* act on different bodies
* are of the same type (gravitational force).

\(G\) is called the _gravitational constant_ (or constant of universal gravitation), which has been measured experimentally to be: \(\textbf{{G=6.67 x 10^{-11} N m^{2} kg^{-2}}}\). It is given in the list of constants provided on the second page of all tests and exams.

Important points to note about Newton's Law of Gravitation

1. Newton's Law of Gravitation is a **universal** law. It applies everywhere in the universe.
2. **Attractive nature of gravitational force:** Note that the masses in this case are always attracted to each other.
3. The gravitational force is a **field force** that always exists between two masses regardless of the medium that separates them and the two masses need not be in contact with other. In fact, it would still exist if there were no medium between them.

4. **Inverse-square law:** Newton's Law of Gravitation is an example of an **inverse-square law**, i.e., the force is inversely proportional to the square of the separation of the masses. \[F\propto\frac{1}{r^{2}}\]
5. Newton's Law of Gravitation can be applied to spherical bodies as though they were point masses with all their mass concentrated at their geometrical centres.

**Example 1: Finding Resultant Gravitational Force**

Three identical masses, each of mass \(m\), are located on a table at the corners of an equilateral triangle of side \(d\). Determine the resultant gravitational force on mass C due to masses A and B.

**Solution**:

**Concept:** If several masses are present, each pair will experience a mutual gravitational attraction. The resultant gravitational force on a given mass is **the vector sum of the separate attractive forces acting on it due to the masses interacting with it.

### Gravitational Field Strength

The gravitational field is a **region of space** where a **mass** will experience a **gravitational force**.

Consider a particle of mass \(m\) placed at a point in a gravitational field (due to another mass \(M\)).

The particle would experience a **gravitational force**, \(F_{g}\), in the gravitational field, given by:

\[F_{g}=mg\]

**Definition: Gravitational Field Strength, \(g\)**

The gravitational field strength \(g\) at a point is the **gravitational force per unit mass** acting on a small test mass placed at the point.

\[g=\frac{F_{g}}{m}\]

where \(\begin{array}{c}\mathbf{g}\ :\\ \mathbf{F_{g}}\ :\end{array}\) gravitational field strength at that point

gravitational force acting on mass \(m\) placed at that point in

the gravitational field.

**Notes:**

1. S.l. unit of \(g\): N kg-1 or m s-2.
2. \(g\) is a **vector** quantity. Its **direction is determined by the gravitational force acting on a **mass \(m\) placed at the point** in the gravitational field.
3. Mass \(m\) is a particle that is placed in the gravitational field. It is not the mass that is creating the gravitational field. Hence, mass \(m\) is often known as the _test_ mass. The mass \(M\) that is creating the gravitational field is known as the _source_ mass. The presence of the test mass is not necessary for the field to be present.
4. \(g\) is also commonly known as the _acceleration due to gravity_ or _gravitational acceleration_.

#### 7.2.1 Gravitational Field of a Point Mass

If a point mass \(M\) is placed at some point in space, it will set up a gravitational field around itself. Suppose we wish to determine the gravitational field strength \(g\) at a distance \(r\) away from this point mass \(M\). We need to place a test mass \(m\) at the distance \(r\) away from this source mass \(M\).

The test mass would experience a gravitational force \(F\) as it is in the gravitational field created by \(M\). By Newton's Law of Gravitation,

The magnitude of the gravitational force acting on \(m\) due to the gravitational field set up by \(M\),

\[F=G\frac{Mm}{r^{2}}\]

From the definition of gravitational field strength,

The magnitude of gravitational field strength due to \(M\) at a distance \(r\) away from \(M\),

The magnitude of gravitational force acting on test mass \(m\)

The magnitude of the gravitational field strength at a point due to a point mass \(M\) at a distance \(r\) away is given by:

The equation is also valid for gravitational field strength outside a spherical body of uniform density or spherical shells of uniform density, where its whole mass is concentrated at its geometric centre.1\(r\) would then represent the distance between the test mass and the geometric centre of the source mass.

#### 7.2.2 Representation of Gravitational Field

We use field lines to represent a gravitational field. The gravitational field lines are related to the gravitational field in the following manner:

1. **Direction** The direction of the gravitational field strength \(g\) is **tangent** to the gravitational field line at each point in space.
2. **Magnitude** The magnitude of the gravitational field strength is **proportional to the number of lines per unit area** through a surface perpendicular to the lines. Therefore, \(g\) is large when the lines are close together and small when they are far apart.

**Gravitational Field Line Diagram** For a point mass**

* The gravitational field in the vicinity of a point mass is always directed _radially towards_ the point mass.
* The magnitude of the gravitational field is inversely proportional to the square of the distance from the point mass. Therefore, the number of field lines per unit area decreases at further distances from the point mass, indicating the diminishing strength of the field.
* The field is really 3-dimensional, but on paper, we can only take a 2-dimensional slice of it. This is a radial field.
* Note that \(\circ\) Fields lines end on a mass and extend back all the way to infinity. \(\circ\) Field lines never cross one another.

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:222]

#### 7.2.3 Gravitational Field Strength (Acceleration due to Gravity)

If the only force acting on a mass \(m\) is the gravitational force, which is given by \(mg\), where \(g\) is the gravitational field strength at the point, then applying Newton's second law,

\[\begin{array}{c}\textit{m}\textbf{a}=mg\\ \textbf{a}=\textbf{g}\end{array}\]

Hence the mass will have an acceleration equal to the gravitational field strength \(g\). Thus the gravitational field strength \(g\) is also known as _acceleration due to gravity_ or _gravitational acceleration_.

#### 7.2.4 Variation of \(g\)

However, when we try to measure the value of \(g\) at various regions on Earth, the value of \(g\) varies. At the poles, \(g\) is 9.83 m s\({}^{-2}\), while at the equator, it is 9.78 m s\({}^{-2}\). In Singapore, it is about 9.79 m s\({}^{-2}\).

What accounts for this variation? There are mainly three factors affecting the value of \(g\) measured.

**(1) The Earth is not a perfect sphere**

Earth is approximately an ellipsoid, flattened at the poles and bulging at the equator. Its equatorial radius is greater than its polar radius by 21 km. Thus a point at the poles is closer to the dense core of the Earth than a point on the equator. This is one reason the gravitational field strength increases as one proceeds, at sea level, from the equator towards the poles.

**(2) The density of the Earth is not uniform**

The density of the Earth varies from region to region over the Earth's surface. The northern hemisphere, for instance, has far more land area than the southern hemisphere. Accurate measurements of the gravitational pull are used to identify different densities of materials beneath the Earth's surface. These measurements are used in prospecting for oil, coal and other minerals.

**(3) The Earth is rotating**

The Earth rotates about an axis passing through the poles. Because of the Earth's rotation, the gravitational force on a body that is not at the poles has to also provide the body with the centripetal acceleration required for rotation.

The farther the body is from the poles and the nearer it is to the equator the larger the centripetal acceleration required. Therefore, the _measured_ gravitational acceleration gets smaller as one approaches the equator.

The measured acceleration is also called the acceleration of free fall (or the apparent gravitational field strength).

#### 7.2.5 Measurement of acceleration of free fall

In this experiment, a steel ball bearing is made to fall a known distance, \(s\), from rest and the time taken to fall this distance is measured using an electric stop-clock.

When the two-way switch is changed to the 'down' position, the electromagnet releases the ball and simultaneously the clock starts. At the end of its fall, the ball opens the 'trap door' of the impact switch and the clock stops.

Assuming air resistance is negligible and applying the equations of motion,

\[s=ut+\frac{1}{2}at^{2}\ \ \Rightarrow\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ a=\frac{2s}{t^{2}}\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \text{where $t$ is the time taken to fall the distance $s$.}\]

Accurate measurements of \(s\) and \(t\) will allow the acceleration of free fall to be obtained.

**Example 3: How Earth's rotation affects the weight measured**

Consider a crate of mass \(m\) resting on a weighing scale at the equator.

Take the Earth to be a uniform sphere of mass \(M\) and radius \(R\), spinning on its axis.

On the diagram, draw all the forces acting on the crate.

Write down an expression for the reading of the weighing scale supporting this mass.

Write down an expression for the 'apparent' gravitational acceleration indicated by the weighing scale and determine its value.

### _Satellites_

A satellite is a moon, planet or machine that orbits a planet or star. For example, Earth is a satellite because it orbits the sun. Likewise, the moon is a satellite because it orbits Earth. Usually, the word "satellite" refers to a machine that is launched into space and moves around Earth or another body in space.

Earth and the moon are examples of natural satellites. Thousands of artificial, or man-made, satellites orbit Earth. Some take pictures of the planet that help meteorologists predict weather and track hurricanes. Some take pictures of other planets, the sun, black holes, dark matter or faraway galaxies. These pictures help scientists better understand the solar system and universe.

Still other satellites are used mainly for communications, such as beaming TV signals and phone calls around the world. A group of more than 20 satellites make up the Global Positioning System, or GPS. If you have a GPS receiver, these satellites can help figure out your exact location.

**Example 4:** **Investigating satellite motion**

Consider a satellite of mass \(m\) revolving around a larger mass \(M\) in a circle of radius \(r\).

Determine the relationship between the radius of the orbit and

(a) the velocity of the satellite;

(b) the period of rotation.

**Solution:**

As the satellite revolves, its velocity keeps changing as the direction of motion keeps changing. Hence, the satellite is accelerating. From the topic of Circular Motion, we know that a resultant force must be providing this centripetal acceleration.

The gravitational attraction of the large mass \(M\) on the satellite keeps the satellite in orbit, i.e., **the gravitational force acting on the satellite (by the mass _M_) provides for the centripetal force required for the satellite to maintain circular orbit about the mass \(M\).

**Example 5: How do you 'weigh' the Earth?**

When Newton first discovered his Law of Gravitation, he had neither the value of \(G\) nor the mass of the Sun.

In 1798, a hundred and twenty-one years after Newton proposed the Universal Law of Gravitation, Henry Cavendish2 conducted the first experiment to measure the force of gravity between masses in the laboratory, and obtained accurate values for the gravitational constant, \(G\), and the mass density of the Earth. With the value of \(G\), it was possible to obtain a value for the mass of the Earth.

Footnote 2: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cavendish_experiment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cavendish_experiment)

By considering the motion of the moon about the Earth, show that the mass of the Earth \(m_{e}\) is approximately 6 x 10\({}^{24}\) kg. You may assume that the distance between Earth and the moon is \(r=4.0\times 10^{8}\) m.

**Solution:**

The **gravitational force** acting on the moon by the Earth's gravitational field **provides** for **the centripetal force** required by the moon to move in orbit about the Earth.

_(NOTE: the statement above is required to explain the following steps below. Please write this in exams!)_

By Newton's 2\({}^{nd}\) Law,

\[F_{g}=m_{m}\,\mathfrak{a}_{c}\]

\[\Rightarrow\,\,G\,\frac{m_{s}m_{m}}{r^{2}}\,\,\,=m_{m}\,r\,\omega_{m}{}^{2} \,\,=\,\,m_{m}r\bigg{(}\frac{2\pi}{T_{m}}\bigg{)}^{2}\]

\[\Rightarrow\,\,m_{e}=\frac{4\pi^{2}}{G}\frac{r^{3}}{{T_{m}}^{2}}\]

Substituting for \(G\), \(r\) and since we know that the moon takes approximately about 1 month to make one complete revolution around the Earth,

\[\Rightarrow\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\

#### 7.3.1 Geostationary Satellites

Geostationary satellites are satellites in orbits where the satellites are always positioned over the same geographical spot on Earth.3 They appear stationary when seen from Earth.

Footnote 3: Besides the geostationary orbits, satellites can have other orbits as well. Check out the following sites for different types of satellites, orbits and functions by scanning the QR codes below.

#### Key Features of Geostationary Satellites:

1. **Period** \(\circ\) 24 hours (same period as the Earth's rotation about its own axis)
2. **Direction of rotation** \(\circ\) same direction as the rotation of the Earth, i.e. from west to east.
3. **Plane of rotation** \(\circ\) the plane that contains the equator.

The gravitational force on the satellite is always directed towards the centre of the Earth and so any circular orbit must have its centre at the centre of the Earth. If the orbit is not in the equatorial plane, the satellite will sometimes be over the northern hemisphere and sometimes over the southern hemisphere and so will not be geostationary.

**Advantages of Geostationary Satellites**

1. As they remain stationary above the same point on Earth, they are ideal for use as communication satellites as they require no tracking to receive signals from Earth. This is why there is no need to keep adjusting the satellite dish to receive TV signals from a particular geostationary satellite.

2. As geostationary satellites are positioned at such a high altitude (see Example 6 for its height above the Earth's surface), they can capture almost the full-disk Earth image, rather than a small subsection. Hence, they are ideal for meteorological applications and remote imaging.

**Disadvantages of Geostationary Satellites**

1. As geostationary satellites are positioned at such a high altitude, the spatial resolution (i.e. the amount of detail shown) of their images tends to be not as good as satellites which are much closer to Earth.
2. Another problem with geostationary satellites is that since they are positioned above the equator, they cannot see the north or south poles and are of limited use for latitudes greater than 60-70 degrees north or south.

**Example 6**: **Geostationary Satellite**

A communications satellite of mass \(m\) is placed in a circular geostationary orbit.

Find its height above the Earth's surface.

(Take radius of the Earth to be 6.38 x 10\({}^{6}\) m and the mass of the Earth to be 5.98 x 10\({}^{24}\) kg).

**Solution**:

The **gravitational force** on the satellite **provides** the required **centripetal force**.

_(NOTE: the statement above is required to explain the following steps below. Please write this in exams!)_

By Newton's second law:

#### 7.3.2 Weightlessness

There are two types of weightlessness - true weightlessness and apparent weightlessness.

**True Weightlessness**

**An object is truly weightless when there is no net gravitational force acting on it**, such as when it is at an infinite distance away from any other body, or when it experiences opposing gravitational forces that exactly cancel one another out.

**Apparent Weightlessness**

An astronaut orbiting the Earth in a space vehicle with its thrusters off is often said to be 'weightless' as well. To understand why, let us try to 'weigh' this astronaut in the space vehicle.

Suppose an astronaut is standing on a weighing balance in a space vehicle orbiting the Earth. Let us first consider the space vehicle, astronaut and weighing balance as a single system. Let the mass of this system be \(M_{\text{sys}}\).

The only force acting on this system is the gravitational force due to the Earth's gravitational field, \(F_{g}\).

Since the space vehicle is in a circular orbit around the Earth,

\(\Rightarrow\)\(F_{g}\) provides for the centripetal acceleration required for the space vehicle to move in a circular orbit.

By Newton's 2nd Law,

\(F_{g}=M_{\text{sys}}\)\(a\)

But

\(F_{g}=M_{\text{sys}}\)\(g\)

\(\Rightarrow\)\(M_{\text{sys}}\)\(g=M_{\text{sys}}\)\(a\)

Therefore,

\(a=g\)

The space vehicle, the man and the weighing balance all have the same acceleration of \(g\).

Now consider forces acting only on the astronaut at position X in the orbit.

By Newton's 2nd Law,

\(mg-N=ma\)

where \(m\) is the mass of the astronaut and

\(a\) is the acceleration of the astronaut.

However, from above, \(a=g\).

Therefore,

\(mg-N=mg\)

\(\Rightarrow\)\(N=0\)

Therefore, we see that the weighing balance does not exert a support force on the astronaut.

By Newton's 3rd Law, the astronaut does not exert a force on its support, the weighing balance. The reading indicated on the weighing balance is **zero**. The astronaut thus experiences the sensation of 'weightlessness'.

Hence, **an object is considered to be (apparently) weightless when it exerts no contact force on its support.** This happens when the object is accelerating with an acceleration of \(g\), e.g. an object in free fall or an object orbiting around the Earth.

### Gravitational Potential and Gravitational Potential Energy

#### 7.4.1 Gravitational Potential Energy

Consider a region of space in which a gravitational field, created by source mass \(M\), is present.

Consider a mass \(m\) placed in this gravitational field. If no external force is applied on mass \(m\), it will accelerate towards mass \(M\) due to the attractive gravitational force on \(m\) by \(M\). Let's say we apply an external force on the mass to move it between two points, from A to B, without changing its kinetic energy. By conservation of energy, whatever work is done by the external force would be equal to the change in gravitational potential energy of the system of 2 masses, \(M\) and \(m\), i.e.

work done by an external force to move \(m\) from A to B in the gravitational field,

\[\begin{array}{ll}&W=\Delta U_{{}_{AB}}=U_{{}_{B}}-U_{{}_{A}}\\ \mbox{where}&\Delta U_{{}_{AB}}\quad:\mbox{Change in gravitational potential energy of the system as mass $m$ moves}\\ &\quad\mbox{from A to B}\\ &U_{A}\quad:\mbox{Gravitational potential energy of system when $m$ is at A}\\ &U_{B}\quad:\mbox{Gravitational potential energy of system when $m$ is at B}\\ \end{array}\]

If point A is at an infinite distance from \(M\), then the gravitational field strength due to \(M\) would be zero there. The gravitational potential energy is zero at that point (\(U_{A}=U_{\infty}=0\)), then

\[W=\Delta U_{{}_{AB}}=U_{{}_{B}}-U_{{}_{A}}=U_{{}_{B}}\]

i.e. the work done by an external force to move a mass \(m\) from A (at infinity) to a point B without a change in kinetic energy is the gravitational potential energy of the system when mass \(m\) is at B.

From the concept of work done by a force, the **gravitational potential energy4**_U_**of a system of two point masses \(M\) and \(m\) separated by a distance \(r\) is given by \(\int_{{}_{\infty}}^{r}\frac{GMm}{r^{2}}dr\). It can be shown that

Footnote 4: A more rigorous derivation of the Gravitational Potential Energy (GPE) between 2 point masses and the gravitational potential of a point mass can be found in Appendix B.

\[\begin{array}{ll}&U=-G\,\frac{Mm}{r}\\ \end{array}\]

**Notes:**

1. S.I. unit for _U_: joule (J).
2. The **gravitational potential energy is actually a property of the system of the two masses** rather than of either mass alone. There is no way to divide this energy and say that so much belongs to one mass and so much to the other. Therefore, we say that it is the **gravitational potential energy of the system of \(M\) and _m_**. However, if _M_>>_m_, as for the case of the Earth and the apple, we often use the phrase "the potential energy of the apple". This is because when an apple moves in the vicinity of Earth, changes in the potential energy of the Earth-apple system appear almost entirely as changes in kinetic energy of the apple, since the changes in the kinetic energy of the Earth are negligible.
3. \(U\) is a scalar quantity. A scalar quantity can be positive or negative in value. However, gravitational potential energy is always negative. The negative sign has nothing to do with direction.
4. **Why is \(U\) negative and what is the significance of the negative sign?**

* Gravitational force is attractive in nature.
* To bring a mass from infinity to the point in the field without changing its kinetic energy, an external force opposite to the gravitational force needs to be applied.
* Since the external force and displacement of the mass are in opposite directions, the external force does negative work on the mass in the process.
* As GPE at infinity is taken as zero, the GPE at any point must be negative.

**Example 7: Gravitational Potential Energy of a System of 3 Masses**

A system consists of three particles, each of mass \(m\) located at the corners of an equilateral triangle of side \(x\). Determine the gravitational potential energy of the system.

**Solution:**

**Example 8: Gravitational Potential Energy Changes near the Earth's Surface**

Show that the expression \(U=-G\frac{Mm}{r}\) can be reduced to the expression \(mg\Delta h\) for calculations of changes in gravitational potential energy near the Earth's surface, i.e. for \(\Delta h<<\) radius of the Earth \(R_{E}\).

**Solution**

**Example 9: Escape Speed**

The minimum speed with which a mass should be projected from the Earth's surface in order to escape Earth's gravitational field is known as the **escape speed** of the body from Earth.

Show that the escape speed of the mass \(m\) placed at the surface of the Earth is \(\sqrt{2gR_{E}}\), given that the radius of the Earth is \(R_{E}\) and gravitational field strength at the Earth's surface is given by \(g\).

**Solution:**

**Example 10: Mechanical Energies of a Satellite in Orbit**

A satellite of mass \(m\) orbits Earth of mass \(M\) in a circular path. The satellite has speed \(\nu\) and the radius of its orbit about Earth is \(R\).

1. Derive an expression for the KE and the total energy of the satellite in terms of G, \(M\), \(m\) and \(R\).
2. Plot a graph showing how each of the following physical quantities associated with the satellite varies with distance from the centre of Earth: 1. kinetic energy; 2. gravitational potential energy; 3. total energy.

**Solution:**

#### 7.4.2 Gravitational Potential

Whenever a field is present in a region, we can always define a scalar property of the field at each point in the region. This property is called the _potential_ of the field. This _potential_ of a field is associated with the _potential energy per unit mass_ that a test mass will possess when it is placed at the point in the field.

**Definition: Gravitational Potential, \(\phi\)**

The **gravitational potential** at a point in a gravitational field is the work done per unit mass, by an external force, in bringing a small test mass from infinity to that point, without any change in kinetic energy.

**Notes:**

1. S.I. unit of gravitational potential \(\phi\). J kg\({}^{-1}\).
2. The gravitational potential is a **scalar quantity**.
3. The gravitational potential at infinity is taken to be zero.

**Gravitational Potential due to a Point Mass :**

The gravitational potential \(\phi\) at a point a distance \(r\) away from a source point mass \(M\) is given by:

**Note:**

1. The equation is also valid for any point outside masses of radial symmetry. This means that, for instance, we can assume the whole mass of the Earth to be concentrated at the Earth's centre. The gravitational potential _beyond the Earth's radius_ can then be calculated using the formula given above.

The gravitational potential at a point in the field is the work done per unit mass in bringing a test mass from infinity to that point.

Since the gravitational field is attractive and zero potential is at infinity, the gravitational potential is always negative.

2. All points at the same distance from the centre of the Earth will have the same gravitational potential. Points of the same potential are known as points of **equipotential**. Equipotential lines/surfaces join points of equal potential. Below are diagrams showing the cases of uniform fields (near the surface of the Earth) and radial fields (for point and spherical masses): 

The gravitational field is uniform close to the surface of the Earth. This results in uniformly spaced equipotential lines. The gravitational field obeys the inverse square law. Hence the distance between adjacent equipotential lines increases as distance from Earth increases. Equipotential lines are always perpendicular to field lines. Diagrams of equipotential lines give us information about the gravitational field in much the same way as contour maps give us information about geographical heights which show regions of same heights as shown below.

**Relationship between Gravitational Potential Energy \(U\) and gravitational potential \(\phi\)**

\[U=m\phi\]

As we move a mass from one point to another, the change in gravitational potential energy is given by

\[\Delta U=m\Delta\phi=m(\phi_{\phi}-\phi_{i})\]

#### 7.4.3 Relationship between Potential and Field Strength

Consider a mass \(M\) fixed in space. Suppose we move a mass \(m\) from point P to point P' in the gravitational field of \(M\) by applying an external force \(F_{ext}\) such that there is no change in the kinetic energy of \(m\). Then

\[\Rightarrow F_{ext}=-F_{g}\] where \[F_{g}\] gravitational force acting on \[m\]. (Note that \[F_{ext}\] and \[F_{g}\] vary with \[r\].)

The change in gravitational potential energy of \(m\), \(\Delta U\), is equal to the work done \(W_{ext}\) by external force \(F_{ext}\) in moving a mass \(m\) from point P to point P' (without an increase in kinetic energy) i.e.,

\[\Rightarrow W_{ext}=\Delta U\] But \[W_{ext}=\int_{r_{p}}^{r_{p}}F_{ext}dr\] \[\Rightarrow \int F_{ext}dr=\Delta U\] \[\Rightarrow F_{ext}=\frac{dU}{dr}\] \[\Rightarrow F_{g}=-\frac{dU}{dr}\]

**Relationship between Gravitational Force \(F_{g}\) and Gravitational Potential Energy \(U\)**

\[\boxed{F_{g}=-\frac{dU}{dr}}\]

Dividing both sides of \(F_{g}=-\frac{dU}{dr}\) by \(m\), we obtain:

**Relationship between Gravitational Field Strength \(\alpha\) and Gravitational Potential \(\phi\)**

\[\boxed{g=-\frac{d\phi}{dr}}\]

**Notes:**

1. \(\frac{d\phi}{dr}\) is known as the **potential gradient**.
2. The magnitude of the potential gradient at a point in the gravitational field gives the magnitude of the gravitational field strength at the point.
3. The **negative sign** indicates that gravitational field strength points in the direction of decreasing \(\phi\).

**Note:** The four relationships in the boxes are only valid for point masses (and spherical objects) while the other four relationships are valid for all cases.

## Appendices:

### Appendix A: Variation of the Gravitational Field Strength above and below the Earth's Surface

Consider the Earth to be a non-rotating spherical planet of uniform density \(\rho\). Take the radius of the Earth to be \(r_{E}\), and the mass of the Earth to be \(m_{E}\).

To determine the variation of \(g\) with respect to the distance from the centre of the Earth \(r\), the following results are useful:

* The acceleration due to gravity **outside** a spherical body of uniform density is the same as if the entire mass of the body were concentrated at its centre.
* The acceleration due to gravity at all points **inside** a spherical shell of uniform density is zero.

With these results, we are able to obtain expressions for the acceleration due to gravity both above and below the Earth's surface.

### Gravitational Field Strength above the Earth's surface (\(r\geq r_{E}\))

It follows from Result 1 that for \(r\geq r_{E}\), \(g=G\frac{m_{E}}{r^{2}}\) ; and at \(r=r_{E}\), \(g=G\frac{m_{E}}{r_{E}}\)2

Since \(G\) and \(m_{E}\) are constants, \(g\propto\frac{1}{r^{2}}\).

### Gravitational Field Strength below the Earth's surface (\(r\leq r_{E}\))5

Footnote 5: The gravitational field strength below the Earth’s surface is not explicitly required in the syllabus, it is only introduced here for completeness.

Consider a point P below the Earth's surface and at a distance \(r\) away from the centre of the Earth.

* The gravitational field at P,
* \(g=g\) at P due to spherical shell A + \(g\) at P due to spherical mass B
* By Result 2,
* Gravitation field at P due to shell A = 0, and
* By Result 1,
* Gravitation field at P due to spherical mass B
* \(G\frac{M_{B}}{r^{2}}\) where \(M_{B}\) is the mass of the spherical mass B\[\text{But}\qquad M_{B}=\rho\ (\text{Volume of spherical mass B})=\rho(\frac{4\pi^{3}}{3})\]

Hence the gravitational field at P (with \(r<\) radius of the Earth) is:

\[g\qquad=\frac{G}{r^{2}}(\frac{4\pi^{3}\rho}{3})=(\frac{4\pi G\rho}{3})r\]

Since \(\frac{4\pi G\rho}{3}\) is a constant, we see that for \(r<t_{E}\), \(g\propto r\).

A sketch of \(g\) against \(r\) is shown below.

## Appendix B Derivation of the Gravitational Potential Energy and Gravitational Potential

Consider a particle of mass \(m\) moving between two points A and B in the gravitational field exerted by another particle \(M\). To find an expression for the gravitational potential energy of this system, we need to first find the work done by an external force in moving the mass \(m\) between the two points without a change in kinetic energy of \(m\).

Suppose we set up the coordinate system as below.

\(M\)\(x=0\)\(x=r_{B}\)\(r_{G}\)\(r_{ext}\)\(x=r_{A}\)By Newton's Law of Gravitation, the gravitational force6\(F_{g}\) acting on the mass \(m\) at a distance \(x\) away from \(M\),

Footnote 6: Note that is gravitational force is an internal force to the system of \(M\) and \(m\). To consider work done on \(m\), we must always treat \(M\) and \(m\) as a single system, as \(m\) only experiences a force due to the gravitational field exerted by \(M\).

\[F_{g}=-G\,\frac{Mm}{x^{2}}\]

The negative sign here indicates that the gravitational force is pointing in the negative \(x\) direction.

For the kinetic energy of \(m\) to remain constant, we must move \(m\) at a **constant velocity** (acceleration = 0).

Therefore, the external force \(F_{ext}\) acting on \(m\) is opposite in direction and equal in magnitude to \(F_{g}\).

\[F_{ext}=G\,\frac{Mm}{x^{2}}\]

Since \(F_{ext}\)is not constant but varies with distance \(x\) away from \(M\), to find the work done W by this external force in moving the mass \(m\) between A and B,

\[W =\int\limits_{r_{A}}^{r_{B}}F_{ext}dx=\int\limits_{r_{A}}^{r_{B}}G\, \frac{Mm}{x^{2}}dx=GMm\left[-\frac{1}{x}\right]_{r_{A}}^{r_{B}}=-GMm\left[ \frac{1}{r_{B}}-\frac{1}{r_{A}}\right]\]

By conservation of energy, since there is no increase in the kinetic energy of the system,

\[W=\text{Change in gravitational potential energy of the system, }\Delta U\]

Therefore,

\[W=\Delta\,U=U_{B}-U_{A}=-GMm\left[\frac{1}{r_{B}}-\frac{1}{r_{A}}\right]= \left[-G\,\frac{Mm}{r_{B}}\right]-\left[-G\,\frac{Mm}{r_{A}}\right]\]

If the reference point A is chosen to be at an infinite distance away from M, i.e. \(r_{A}=\infty\), the gravitational potential energy for \(m\) at A, \(U_{A}\) is equal to zero.

\[U_{A}=U_{\infty}=\left[-G\,\frac{Mm}{r_{\ast}}\right]=0\]

Then,

\[U_{B}-U_{A}=U_{B}=-\,G\,\frac{Mm}{r_{B}}\]

Therefore, the gravitational potential energy \(U\) of a test mass \(m\) placed at a distance of \(r\) away from the source mass \(M\), is given by

\[U=-\,G\,\frac{Mm}{r}\]

From the definition of the potential at a point, the potential \(\phi\) at a point at a distance \(r\) away from the source mass \(M\),

\[\phi=\frac{U}{m}\]

\[\Rightarrow\quad\left[\begin{array}{c}\phi=-\frac{GM}{r}\\ \end{array}\right]\]

### Introduction

Oscillations are very common in everyday life such as the motion of a clock pendulum, the vibrations of strings in musical instruments, the vertical oscillations of a car after passing over a bump on the road or even the vibrations of atoms in a lattice.

Oscillations can occur when displacing an object that is in a state of stable equilibrium from its equilibrium position results in a restoring force acting on the object directed towards the equilibrium position. The motion is said to be _periodic_ if the displacement of a body in oscillatory motion repeats itself at equal intervals. The full range of its motion that is repeated is referred to as a cycle and the time taken for the body to go through a cycle is the period of the oscillation.

**Example 8.1: Periodic Motion**

Which of the following cases are periodic oscillations?

### Simple Harmonic Motion

The free oscillation of a mass attached to a spring is a very special example of a periodic oscillation that we call simple harmonic motion (SHM). It is special because the displacement of the mass about its equilibrium position varies sinusoidally. We will prove this analytically but first, let us look at an experiment that shows the sinusoidal variation of its displacement with time.

**Spring-Mass System**

\(T=2\pi\sqrt{\frac{m}{k}}\) (*)

where \(T=\) period of oscillation

\(m=\) mass of the oscillating object

\(k=\) spring constantWe can obtain a graph of the variation in the displacement of the mass hanging from a spring via the following experiment. We attach a pen to the mass such that its motion is traced onto a vertical sheet of graph paper that is pulled to the left at a constant rate.

#### 8.1.1 Terms used to describe SHM (with reference to Fig 8.1)

Terms**Definitions**

_Displacement, x_The displacement x is the linear distance of the mass from its equilibrium position (x = 0) in a specified direction.

It is a **vector**; the + / - sign tells the direction of displacement from equilibrium.

If you set the direction for displacement above equilibrium to be positive, then displacement below the equilibrium would be negative and _vice versa_.

_Equilibrium Position (x = 0)_When the oscillating mass is at equilibrium position, the **net force acting on the mass is zero**.

_Amplitude, x_oIt is the **magnitude** of the maximum displacement of the mass from the equilibrium position. It is a scalar.

_Period, T_It is the time taken for the mass to complete one cycle of oscillation. S.I. unit: second.

_Frequency, f_It is the number of cycles per unit time: \(f=\dfrac{1}{T}\cdot\) S.I. unit: hertz (Hz). 1 Hz = 1 s-1.

_Angular frequency, o_It is the rate of change of the _phase angle_ (introduced in Section 8.2) with respect to time: \(\omega=\dfrac{d\theta}{dt}\cdot\) S.I. unit: rad s-1.

A cycle of oscillation is associated with a phase angle of \(2\pi\) rad, \(\omega=\dfrac{2\pi}{T}=2\pi f\).

Figure 8.1: Tracking the oscillation of a vertical spring-mass system

#### 8.1.2 SHM - Displacement-time (x-\(\theta\)) relationship

From Fig. 8.1, we see that the time variation of the displacement of the mass obtained in the experiment is remarkably similar to a sine graph as shown in Fig 8.2.

The equation of such a graph can be written as follows,

\[x=x_{0}\sin\omega t\]

where \(\omega=\dfrac{2\pi}{T}\) is known as the _angular frequency_ and \(x_{0}\) is the _amplitude_ of the oscillation.

We can see from this graph that when we start timing, the displacement of the mass is zero, which means that the mass is at its equilibrium position at that instant. If the mass is not at the equilibrium position but at some other location at the instant when we start timing, we can adjust the equation easily to fit the graph obtained in the experiment.

\begin{tabular}{|p{113.8pt}|p{113.8pt}|} \hline
**Position of mass when timing starts (\(t=0\))** & **Displacement-time (x-\(\theta\)) Graph** & **Displacement-time Equation** \\ \hline Mass is _released from rest_ at _maximum displacement_ from equilibrium position. & **\(x_{0}\)** & **\(x=x_{0}\cos\omega t\)** \\ \hline Mass is moving with _initial velocity_\(\nu\) at _displacement_\(X\) & **\(x^{\prime}\)** & **\(x^{\prime}\)** \\ \hline \end{tabular}

1.3 SHM - Velocity-time (v-\(\theta\)) relationship and acceleration-time (a-\(\theta\)) relationship

From the topic of kinematics, we know that from the displacement-time relationship of an object, we can obtain its corresponding velocity-time and acceleration-time relationship by differentiating the equations or analysing the gradients of the tangents at the various points on the graphs accordingly (see Fig. 8.3).

We can similarly do so for SHM.

The table illustrates two examples.

Figure 8.2: Displacement-time graph of mass

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|} \hline \(t=0\) (initial conditions) & Example 1: \(x=0\), \(\nu\) is at maximum value & Example 2: \(x=x_{o}\), \(\nu=0\) \\ \hline \(x\)-\(t\) graph & \(x_{o}\) \\ \hline Equation & \(x=x_{0}\sin\omega t\) \\ \hline \(\nu\)-\(t\) graph & \(x_{o}\) \\ \hline Equation & \(x=x_{0}\cos\omega t\) \\ \hline Equation & \(x_{o}\) \\ \hline Equation & \(x_{o}\) \\ \hline Equation & \(x_{o}\) \\ \hline Equation & \(x_{o}\) \\ \hline Equation & \(x_{o}\) \\ \hline Equation & \(x_{o}\) \\ \hline Equation & \(x_{o}\) \\ \hline Equation & \(x_{o}\) \\ \hline Equation & \(x_{o}\) \\ \hline Equation & \(x_{o}\) \\ \hline Equation & \(x_{o}\) \\ \hline Equation & \(x_{o}\) \\ \hline Equation & \(x_{o}\) \\ \hline Equation & \(x_{o}\) \\ \hline \end{tabular} From the graphs and the equations above, together with the fact that \(-1\leq\sin\theta\leq 1\) and \(-1\leq\cos\theta\leq 1\), we can see that:

(1) Maximum value of velocity, \(\nu_{o}\):

(2) Maximum value of acceleration, \(a_{o}\):

\begin{tabular}{|c|} \hline \(v_{0}=\omega x_{0}\) \\ \hline \(a_{0}=\omega^{2}x_{0}\) \\ \hline \end{tabular} where \(\omega\) is the angular frequency and \(x_{o}\) is the amplitude of the oscillation.

**Example 8.2: Describing SHM in terms of time**

The pendulum bob in a particular clock oscillates so that its displacement from a fixed point is as shown.

(a) By taking the necessary readings from the graph, determine for this simple harmonic oscillator

(i) the amplitude \(x_{o}\)

(ii) the angular frequency, \(\omega\)

(iii) the maximum velocity \(\nu_{o}\) and

(iv) the maximum acceleration \(a_{o}\)

(b) Hence, write down the equation that describes the displacement-time relationship.

(c) Sketch labelled graphs, illustrating the corresponding time variation of the oscillator's

(i) velocity,

(ii) acceleration.

**Example 8.3: Displacement-time Relationship for SHM**

The displacement \(x\) (in m) of a body moving in SHM is given by the equation

\(x=3.5\) sin \(4.0t\)

a) What is the amplitude of the motion?

b) What is the angular frequency?

c) What will be the displacement \(0.20\) s after oscillation has begun?

d) Determine the velocity at time \(t=0.50\) s.

#### 8.1.4 Definition of SHM - relationship between acceleration and displacement

Comparing the \(x\)-\(t\) and \(a\)-\(t\) relationship for both the examples in the table in section 8.1.3, we see that \(a=-\omega^{2}\,x\). This is actually the defining equation for SHM!

**Definition of Simple Harmonic Motion**

_Simple harmonic motion_ is a periodic motion in which the **acceleration** of the body

* is **directly proportional** to the **displacement from its equilibrium point**, and
* is always in the **opposite direction to the displacement.**

\[a=-\omega^{2}\,x\]

where \(\omega\) is the angular frequency and \(x\) is the displacement from the equilibrium point.

**Notes:**

(1) The **negative sign** in the equation indicates that **the acceleration in SHM is always in the direction opposite to the displacement from the equilibrium point**; in other words, the acceleration is always directed towards the equilibrium point.

(2) Since \(a=\frac{d^{2}\,x}{dt^{2}}\), we can write \(\frac{d^{2}\,x}{dt^{2}}=-\omega^{2}\,x\).This is a \(2^{nd}\) order differential equation and

\(x=x_{0}\sin(\omega t+\phi)\)is a general solution where \(\phi\) depends on the position of the oscillator when observation starts.

You are not required to know how to solve differential equations for the A-level Physics syllabus. However, by differentiating the expression \(x=x_{0}\sin(\omega t+\phi)\) twice, you can verify that \(\frac{d^{2}\,x}{dt^{2}}=-\omega^{2}\,x\).

**Case Study: SHM of Horizontal Spring-Mass System Explained Using Dynamics**

Let us consider a mass oscillating at the end of a horizontal light spring. At the start of section 8.1, we said that the spring-mass system is an example of SHM. We shall now prove that indeed, the mass satisfies the defining equation of SHM. Ideally, the spring obeys Hooke's Law and the mass of the spring is negligible, the mass slides without friction on the horizontal surface. Point O is the equilibrium position of the mass, where the spring is unstretched.

Let us now look at how the restoring force \(F\) exerted by the spring on the mass varies with displacement \(x\): (a) when mass is displaced to the right \(\left(x>0\right)\), causing the spring to be stretched, \(F\) is towards the left. (b) when the mass is at its equilibrium position \(\left(x=0\right)\) (spring is unstretched), \(F\) is zero. (c) when the mass is displaced to the left \(\left(x<0\right)\), causing the spring to be compressed, \(F\) is towards the right. Hence, we see that

1. the **resultant restoring force is always towards the equilibrium position.**
2. the **direction of this resultant force is always opposite to that of the mass's displacement** at all points, except at equilibrium position, where \(a=x=0\).
3. According to Hooke's Law, \(F=-k\alpha\), where \(k\) is the spring constant. The restoring force, \(F\), is proportional to the displacement, \(x\), but directed opposite to it (as indicated by the negative sign). By Newton's \(2^{nd}\) Law, \(F_{net}=ma\) Since \(F_{net}\) is provided by the restoring force of the spring acting on the oscillating mass \(m\), \(m\alpha=-k\alpha\) \(a=-\dfrac{k}{m}\,x\) Hence, the **acceleration is** \(\circ\) **opposite in direction to the displacement** and \(\circ\) **proportional to the displacement, with proportionality constant -\(k\,l\,m\).** (d) When the spring is a **definition of SHM**!
4. Comparing the expression above with the SHM equation \(\dot{a}=-\omega^{2}x\) : \(\omega^{2}=\dfrac{k}{m}\to T=\dfrac{2\pi}{\omega}=2\pi\sqrt{\dfrac{m}{k}}\) This is the expression we quoted for the period of the spring-mass system earlier. Note that the period of the oscillation depends on the physical properties of the system.

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:268]

#### 8.1.5 Simple Harmonic Motion: velocity-displacement (v-x) relationship

The velocity-displacement (v-x) relationship for SHM is given by

\[\nu=\pm\omega\sqrt{\left(x_{0}^{2}-x^{2}\right)}\]

**Note:**

1. The equation is provided in the A-level Physics formulae list. It is applicable no matter where the body is when observation starts.
2. The "\(\pm\)" sign implies that the body in SHM always passes through each position back and forth with the same speed.
3. When the body is at maximum displacement \(\left(x=x_{0}\right)\), \(\nu=0\). At the equilibrium position \(\left(x=0\right)\), the speed is maximum, \(\nu_{0}=\omega x_{0}\).
4. The v-x graph is an **ellipse** as shown.

**Derivation of the relationship between velocity and displacement (not in syllabus)**

Consider \[x=x_{0}\sin(\omega t+\phi)........\text{(1)}\]

Differentiate (1) with respect to \(t:\nu=\frac{d\mathbf{x}}{dt}=\omega x_{0}\cos(\omega t+\phi)\)........ (2)

Given that \(\sin^{2}\theta+\cos^{2}\theta=1\), \(\cos\theta=\pm\sqrt{1-\sin^{2}\theta}\)

Substitute into equation (2): \[\nu=\omega x_{0}\left[\pm\sqrt{1-\sin^{2}\left(\omega t+\phi\right)}\right]\]

\[\Rightarrow\nu=\pm\omega\sqrt{x_{0}^{2}-x_{0}^{2}\sin^{2}\left(\omega t+\phi \right)}\]

\[\Rightarrow\nu=\pm\omega\sqrt{x_{0}^{2}-x^{2}}\]

**Example 8.6: Relationship between velocity and displacement for SHM**

**Example 8.7: Relationship between velocity and displacement for SHM**

An object moving with simple harmonic motion has an amplitude of 0.020 m and a frequency of 20 Hz. Calculate

(a) the period of oscillation.

(b) the velocities at the equilibrium point and the position of maximum negative displacement.

**Solution:**

### Relationship between Simple Harmonic Motion and Uniform Circular Motion

We have thus far established that for SHM, \(x=x_{0}\sin\omega t\) where \(\omega\) is a constant known as the angular frequency, it is also known as the rate of change in phase angle \(\theta\). Let us look at an experiment to gain a better understanding of the concept of phase angle.

Consider a peg on a turntable. Parallel light rays from a distant source are shone on the turntable. As the turntable rotates, the peg moves in uniform circular motion and the shadow of the peg against a vertical screen will move back and forth. As it turns out, we can prove that the motion of its shadow is SHM.

### Some observations

1. The motion is symmetrical about the fixed point, O' on the screen.
2. The time taken to complete one oscillation (period) is the same as the time taken to complete one cycle. Thus frequency of SHM = frequency of the circular motion.
3. The distance from the fixed point O' to the extremity (amplitude), is equal to the radius of the circle.
4. When the peg is shifted nearer to the centre of the turntable, the amplitude of the SHM decreases, but the period or frequency remains unchanged.
5. The shadow reaches maximum speed as it passes O' and is momentarily at rest at the extreme positions.

Consider the following diagram where the OA is the projection of OP along the vertical line OB. P represents the peg and A represents its shadow on the screen OB. As the turntable rotates, P moves in a circle of radius \(OP=OB\) with constant angular speed \(\omega\). The angle \(\theta\)it makes with reference to the equilibrium position is thus given by \(\theta=\omega t\).

Considering the right angle triangle OAP, we can easily see that the displacement \(x\) of the peg's shadow A with respect to O is given by

\[x=x_{0}\sin\theta=x_{0}\sin\omega t\]

Hence the shadow of the peg does indeed move in SHM.

#### Phase & Phase Difference

For any object in SHM, we may associate with it the motion of an imaginary peg moving in uniform circular motion such that at any point in time, the angle \(\theta\)it makes with reference to the equilibrium position is called the **phase (angle)** of oscillation.

Thus the **angular frequency**\(\omega\)** in a simple harmonic motion is also **the rate of change of phase angle** of the imaginary peg.

The concept of phase angle is useful for comparing two oscillators of the same frequency (and therefore period), even if they have different amplitudes. We can describe how far ahead one is compared to the other in terms of the difference in their phase angles.

1. The difference in phase angle between two oscillations is called **phase difference**\(\Delta\phi\)**.
2. Two oscillations are said to be _in phase_ when they are in step, i.e., they reach their respective maximum displacements in the same direction at the same time. It does not matter what their respective amplitudes are.

The phase difference \(\Delta\phi=0\) rad or any integral multiple of \(2\pi\) rad.

3. Two oscillations are said to be _in anti-phase_ when they are completely out of step, i.e., one oscillation reaches maximum displacement in a given direction at the same instant as the other oscillation reaches maximum displacement in the opposite direction.  The phase difference \(\Delta\phi=\pi\) rad or any odd integral multiple of \(\pi\) rad. 4. Of course the two oscillations may not be in phase or in anti-phase but at some intermediate phase difference. In such a case, the phase difference can be calculated by the following: \(\Delta\phi=\frac{\Delta t}{T}\times 2\pi\).  You will learn more about phase difference in the next chapter on Waves. **Example 8.8: Phase and Phase Difference** The displacement-time graph of two objects A and B oscillating is shown below.

### Damped Oscillations, Forced Oscillations and Resonance

#### 8.4.1 Damped oscillations

In an ideal oscillating system, there is no friction and the total energy associated with the oscillation is constant. The oscillation continues forever, with no decrease in amplitude.

In real-world systems, there is friction and the total energy associated with the oscillations decreases with time due to the work done against friction. The progressive decrease in amplitude of any oscillatory motion caused by dissipative forces is called _damping._ Such an oscillatory motion is known as a _damped oscillation._

Commonly used damping methods:

A) Attach a piece of cardboard of negligible mass but large surface area to the base of the mass. Air resistance dissipates energy.

B) Submerge the mass in a viscous fluid. Viscous forces dissipate energy.

C) Swing the copper plate in a magnetic field so that eddy currents are induced in the plate. Eddy currents dissipate energy (will be discussed in Electromagnetic Induction in year 2).

### Extent of damping

Damping changes the behaviour of SHM systems. Certain features of the oscillation (amplitude etc.) are dependent on the extent of damping.

### (1) _Light Damping (underdamped system)_

In a lightly damped system, the total energy of the system decreases with time as its energy is dissipated when the system oscillates against resistive forces.

The period/frequency remains constant, but the amplitude of the system decreases exponentially with time.

### (2) _Critical Damping (critically damped system)_

If we are able to gradually increase the resistive force acting on an oscillatory system, damping increases till a point such that when displaced, the system **returns to the equilibrium position in the shortest possible time without oscillating** at all. The system is said to be critically damped.

Critical damping is deliberately introduced into some systems to prevent continuous oscillations. For example, in analogue instruments such as balances, ammeters and voltmeters, the pointer is critically damped so that it stops in the shortest possible time to indicate the reading, instead of oscillating about the reading (underdamped) or taking an unnecessarily long time to crawl to the reading (overdamped).

Critical damping is also used in **car suspension systems** to ensure a smooth ride when the car moves on a bumpy road. The shock absorbers in the suspension system have hydraulic pistons to prevent the car from bouncing up and down excessively after hitting a bump.

### (3) _Heavy Damping (overdamped system)_

When the damping force is increased beyond the point of critical damping, we say that the system is **overdamped** or that it experiences heavy damping. Once displaced from its equilibrium, the oscillator takes a very long time to return to its equilibrium position.

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:278]

One example of forced oscillation is pushing a child on a swing at the playground; one needs to continually give the swing a push at the right moment to sustain its oscillation.

### Resonance

Consider the above example of a child on a swing. The child will need to be pushed to keep him swinging.

If the frequency of the driving force matches the natural frequency of the oscillatory motion of the child-swing system, an interesting phenomenon happens - the final amplitude of the oscillation would be the greatest compared to the amplitudes of oscillation for other frequencies of driving force. This phenomenon is known as _resonance_.

_Resonance_ is a phenomenon in which an oscillatory system responds with maximum amplitude to an external periodic driving force, when the frequency of the driving force (driver frequency) equals the natural frequency of the driven system.

### Note:

1. The frequency at which resonance occurs is known as the _resonant frequency_.
2. Under ideal conditions, i.e., if no resistive forces are present (there is no damping), the amplitude will build up to an infinitely large value.
3. However, in real cases, damping occurs. Whilst putting energy into the system in each cycle, energy is also taken away by damping and the amplitude will stop increasing when the rate of energy supplied is the same as the rate at which it is lost.
4. Resonance represents the point where (driving) energy is transferred most efficiently into the oscillatory system.

The above set-up may be used to investigate the phenomenon of resonance in the lab.

(1) The system under study is a spring-mass system that is driven to oscillate by a metre rule which is in turn driven to vibrate by a vibration generator. To vary the frequency of vibration, the vibration generator is connected to a signal generator. (2) To vary the amount of damping experienced by the spring-mass system, a light paper card is attached to the mass. By varying the area of the paper card attached, the damping is varied. The larger the paper card, the greater the damping. (3) To measure the amplitude of vibration, a motion sensor is placed directly below the paper card. (4) For each frequency of vibration, we can then measure and record the amplitude of vibration of the spring-mass system. We start off with a driving frequency that is much lower than the natural frequency of the spring-mass system and slowly increase this frequency till beyond the natural frequency. (5) The graph above shows the typical results obtained from the experiment for one area of card. (6) The experiment is then repeated for different areas of cards in order to produce different amounts of damping. (7) The data points for each different area of cards / different damping can then be plotted on the same pair of axes for comparison as shown below.

The figure below shows the amplitude vs. driving frequency graphs that will be obtained.

**Note:**

1. The amplitude of a lightly damped system is very large at resonance and the peak is sharp. The amplitude drops off rapidly when the driver frequency differs from the natural frequency of the system.
2. When the driver frequency approaches zero, the amplitude of the forced oscillations will be the same as the amplitude of the driver.
3. As the system experiences greater damping, \(\circ\) the amplitude of the oscillation **decreases**. \(\circ\) the resonance peak becomes **broader**. \(\circ\) the resonance peak shifts slightly to the **left** to a slightly lower value of frequency.

From the graphs, it is evident that damping is a useful way to reduce the effects of resonance. Another way to avoid resonance is to ensure that the frequency of the periodic external force differs from the natural frequency of the driven system.

**Example 8.12: Damped Oscillation (N10/1/16)**

A mass, suspended from a helical spring, is made to oscillate. The graph shows the variation with frequency \(f\) of the amplitude \(x_{0}\) of vibration of the mass.

A sheet of cardboard of negligible mass is now fixed to the mass on the spring to cause light damping of the oscillations. Which graph shows how \(x_{0}\) will vary with \(f\) over the same frequency range?

#### Examples of Destructive and Useful Resonance

Examples of destructive resonance

1. **Shattering glass with voice** When an opera singer projects a high-pitched note whose frequency matches the natural frequency of a wine glass, resonance may cause the glass to vibrate at a large amplitude that it breaks.
2. **Violent vibrations in vehicles and machines** If the panel in a bus rattles violently when the bus is travelling at a certain speed, it is likely that a resonant vibration is occurring. A washing machine with a load which has natural frequency matching the spinning frequency will vibrate violently as resonance occurs.
3. **Collapse of some buildings in earthquakes** An earthquake consists of many low-frequency vibrations ranging from 1 to 10 Hz. During an earthquake, when the frequencies of the vibration match the natural frequencies of buildings, resonance may occur and result in serious damage. That also explains why some buildings collapse while others stand almost unaffected. In regions of the world where earthquakes happen regularly, buildings may be built on foundations that absorb the energy of the shock waves. In this way, the vibrations are damped and the amplitude of the oscillations cannot reach a dangerous level.

Examples of useful resonance

1. **Radio receptions** Resonance not only occurs in mechanical oscillations but also in electric circuits. A radio receiver works on the principle of resonance. Our air is filled with radio waves of many different frequencies which the aerial picks up. The tuner can be adjusted so that the frequency of the electrical oscillations in the circuits is the same as that of the radio wave transmitted from a particular station we desire. The effect of resonance amplifies the signals contained in this wave while the radio waves of other frequencies are diminished.
2. **Magnetic Resonance Imaging** Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is increasingly used in medical diagnosis to produce images similar to those produced by X-rays. Strong, electromagnetic fields of varying radio frequencies are used to cause oscillations in atomic nuclei. When resonance occurs, energy is absorbed by the molecules. By analysing the pattern of energy absorption, a computer-generated image can be produced. The advantage of MRI scanners is that no ionising radiation (as in the process of producing X-ray images) is involved.
3. **Musical Instruments** Most vibrating objects have more than one resonant frequency. The lowest resonant frequency of a vibrating object is called its fundamental frequency. A harmonic is defined as an integer multiple of the fundamental frequency. (You will learn more about it in the topic Superposition, under Stationary Wave). Strings and air columns used in musical instruments typically vibrate at harmonics of the fundamental frequency. In an acoustic guitar, when you pluck a string, the string initially vibrates at all the frequencies. Those frequencies that are not one of the resonances are quickly filtered out-- or attenuated--and all that is left is the harmonic vibrations that are transmitted through air molecules as sound energy into the hollow wooden body of the guitar, making it (and the air inside) resonate and amplifying the musical note (making it considerably louder).

## Appendix 1 Case study: Oscillations of A Simple Pendulum

A simple pendulum is in its midst of motion, where its bob is at a horizontal displacement \(x\) from its equilibrium position. The string is attached to a bob of mass \(m\) and makes a small angle of \(\theta\) to the vertical as shown.

The restoring force (\(mg\ sin\ \theta\)) which is pointing towards equilibrium position and is approximately horizontal, is in the opposite direction to the positive direction of the horizontal displacement,

\(F_{net}=-mg\ sin\ \theta\)

When the angular displacement \(\theta\) is small,

the horizontal displacement of the bob is approximately equal to

the arc length

\(x\approx L\theta\)

\(\Rightarrow\)

\(\theta\approx\chi L\)

\(\Rightarrow\)

\(F_{net}=-mg\ sin\ \theta\ \approx-mg\frac{x}{L}\)

From Newton's 2nd law:

\(ma\approx-mg\frac{x}{L}\)

\(\Rightarrow\)

\(a\approx-\left(\frac{g}{L}\right)x\)

i.e., \(a=-\alpha^{2}x\)

where \(\alpha^{2}=\frac{g}{L}\)

Hence, motion of a simple pendulum bob attached to a light inextensible string oscillating with **a small angular displacement of \(\sim\) 10\({}^{o}\) or smaller** is, to a good approximation, a linear SHM with period, \(T\), given by

\(T=2\pi\sqrt{\frac{L}{g}}\)

**Note:**

1) Other assumptions made are that the string is massless, the radius of the bob is small compared with the length of the string and air resistance is negligible.

2) The period \(T\) is independent of the amplitude of the oscillation.

## Appendix 2 Case study: Oscillations of a Mass on Vertical Spring

A mass \(m\) attached to the end of a spiral spring exerts a downward force on it and stretches it by an amount \(e\) as shown in the diagram.

If the spring obeys Hooke's law, then the extension \(e\) is directly proportional to the extending tension, \(F_{\text{s}}\), i.e.,

\[F_{\text{s}} =-k\epsilon\text{\ \ where \ }k\text{\ is a constant.}\]

Since the mass is in equilibrium, the net force on it is zero (\(\sum F=0\)).

\[mg+(-k\epsilon) =0\] \[\Rightarrow mg =k\epsilon\]

Suppose the mass is now pulled down a further distance \(x\) below its equilibrium position, then the tension in the spring is increased to \(-k(\epsilon+x)\). Thus the resultant force on the mass is given by

\[F =mg-k(e+x)\] \[=k\epsilon-k(\epsilon+x)\] (since \[mg=k\epsilon\] ) \[=-k\alpha\]

i.e., the resultant force is acting upwards, with the direction opposite to that of the displacement.

By Newton's 2nd law,

\[ma =-k\alpha\] \[\Rightarrow a =-\frac{k}{m}x\]

Since \(k\) and \(m\) are fixed, the oscillation of a mass on spring is simple harmonic.

The angular frequency \(\omega\) is given by \(\omega^{2}=\frac{k}{m}\)

\[\Rightarrow T=\frac{2\pi}{\omega}=2\pi\sqrt{\frac{m}{k}}\]

## Appendix 3 Equations of motion for damped simple harmonic oscillations

In an oscillatory system, the decrease in amplitude caused by dissipative forces is called damping and the corresponding motion is called damped oscillation. The simplest case to analyse is a simple harmonic oscillator under damping, where its dissipative force is directly proportional to its _velocity_. This behaviour occurs in friction involving the flow of viscous fluid, such as in shock absorbers or sliding between oil-lubricated surfaces. The additional force on the body due to viscous drag is \(f=-bv\), where \(b\) is a constant.

With a viscous drag, the net force on the body is \((-kx-bv)\).

Applying Newton's \(2^{nd}\) second law,

\[m\frac{d^{2}x}{dt^{2}}=-kx-bv\] \[m\frac{d^{2}x}{dt^{2}}+b\frac{dx}{dt}+kx=0\]

This is a second order linear differential equation with constant coefficients.

If \(b<2\sqrt{km}\), the system is under light damping and the equation of motion is

Its amplitude \((x_{0}e^{\frac{-\left(\frac{b}{2m}\right)}{\left(\frac{b}{2m}\right)}})\) is not a constant, but decreases with time because of the decaying exponential factor. In addition, the larger the value of \(b\), the faster the decrease in the amplitude.

Its angular frequency\(\omega^{\prime}=\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}-\frac{b^{2}}{4m^{2}}}\), is smaller than that without damping, \(\omega=\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}\), and therefore the period is slightly larger.

If \(b=2\sqrt{km}\), then \(x=x_{0}e^{-\left(\frac{b}{2m}t\right)}\). The system is in critical damping, where it no longer oscillates but returns to its equilibrium position without overshooting the equilibrium position.

If \(b>2\sqrt{km}\), then the system is heavily damped. Again, there is no oscillation, but the return to its equilibrium takes longer than in the case of critical damping. Its solutions are in the form of \(x=C_{1}e^{-a_{1}t}+C_{2}e^{-a_{2}t}\), where \(C_{1}\) and \(C_{2}\) are constants determined by initial conditions and \(a_{1}\) and \(a_{2}\) are constants determined by \(m\), \(k\) and \(b\).

## Appendix 4 Demonstration of Forced Oscillation and Resonance - Barton's pendulums

Barton's pendulums consist of several pendulums of different lengths hung from a horizontal string. Each has its own natural frequency of oscillation. The 'driver' pendulum at the end has a large mass and its length is equal to that of pendulum R. When the driver is set swinging, its vibrations are transferred through the common support string to the other pendulums and start the forced oscillations.

Observations show that:

1. All the pendulums vibrate with the same frequency as the driver.
2. Pendulum R whose length matches that of the driver pendulum (therefore has the same natural frequency as the driver) has the largest amplitude. It is said to be resonating with the driver.

**Explanation:**

All the pendulums are coupled together by the suspension. As the driver swings, it moves the suspension, which in turn moves the other pendulums. The matching pendulum is being pushed slightly once each oscillation, and the amplitude gradually builds up to maximum. The other pendulums are being pushed at a frequency that does not match their natural frequency and they therefore oscillate with smaller amplitudes.

## Chapter 9 Wave Motion

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:302]

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:303]

### 9.1 Introduction

Consider a rope that is held under tension. If we give the left of the rope a small wiggle, a pulse is formed (called the waveform) which can be seen to travel along the length of the rope (Fig. 9.1.1).

When the waveform travels down the rope, **there is a transfer of energy and momentum** from one end of the rope to the other. However each section of the rope only vibrates up and down about an equilibrium position-- **no section of the rope actually travels from one end to the other**.

### 9.2 Classification of Waves

Waves can be categorised by three broad properties (Fig. 9.2.1):

(i) the type of the wave,

(ii) the mode of vibration of the wave, and

(iii) the motion of the wave.

For example, a sound wave can be characterised as mechanical in nature, longitudinal in terms of its displacement and can be either progressive or stationary.

Figure 9.2.1: Classifications of Waves

Figure 9.1.1: Wave pulse travelling down the rope

### Mechanical Waves

Mechanical waves are created when part of a physical medium is disturbed. The disturbance spreads through the medium distributing energy to points far from the original disturbance. All mechanical waves therefore require a medium for propagation.1 The speed of wave propagation depends on the medium (specifically both its inertial and elastic properties). Sound waves, waves in ropes, water waves and seismic waves are all examples of mechanical waves.

Footnote 1: Propagation of mechanical waves is possible due to the restoring forces produced upon deformation; Sound waves, which rely on oscillations of molecules of the medium resulting in pressure variation, obviously cannot be propagated through a vacuum.

### Electromagnetic (EM) waves

Electromagnetic (EM) waves consist of _mutually perpendicular time-varying electric field (\(\vec{\mathbf{E}}\) ) and magnetic field (\(\vec{\mathbf{B}}\) ) oscillating perpendicularly to the direction of wave travel_ (Fig. 9.2.2).

Characteristics of EM Waves:

* All EM waves are transverse in nature, i.e. the planes of oscillation of the electric and magnetic fields are perpendicular to the direction of motion.
* All EM waves are self-propagating and hence do not require a medium in which to travel. Unlike mechanical waves they can move through a vacuum but are also able to propagate through materials e.g. light through glass, X-rays through bone and radio waves through walls.
* In vacuum, all EM waves travel at the same speed \(c\) known as the speed of light: \[c=3.00\times 10^{8}\text{ m s}^{-1}\]

### The Electromagnetic Spectrum

Common examples of electromagnetic waves include visible light, ultraviolet light, radio wave, microwaves and x-rays. Fig. 9.2.3 shows the electromagnetic spectrum and relative positions of these EM waves on the spectrum.

Figure 9.2.3: The electromagnetic spectrum.

Figure 9.2.2: The E-field and B-field are mutually perpendicular to each other and both fields are also perpendicular to the direction of wave travel.

* A useful mnemonic to remember for visible light : **Red** : **Richard** (700 nm) **O**range : **Of** **Yellow** : **York** **Green** : **Gave** **Blue** : **Battle** **Indigo** : **In** **Violet** : **Vain** (400 nm) The electromagnetic spectrum is a _continuous spectrum_ i.e. there are no gaps or _sharp boundaries_ between one type of radiation and next. For example, the wavelengths of \(\gamma\)-rays and x-rays overlap. Their key difference is in their mechanism of production.

### Basic Terminology

The waves that we encounter may be one-dimensional, two-dimensional or three-dimensional. Waves on string and slinky are examples of one-dimensional waves, i.e. the waves are travelling only in one dimension. A water wave that is produced by a raindrop that is striking the surface of a lake is an example of a two-dimensional wave. (Fig. 10.1). A sound wave in air is an example of a three-dimensional longitudinal wave. It consists of compressions and rarefactions of air molecules spreading out in all directions

### Sinusoidal Waves

If we sound a tuning fork which produces a "pure tone" i.e. a single frequency and use a microphone and oscilloscope (See Appendix A for review of CRO) to capture the wave form we will observe a near perfect sine profile. So, for a medium that undergo a periodic disturbance of a single frequency, we characterise the waves that emanate from the disturbance and pass through the medium as sinusoidal.

Figure 10.1: (a) and (b) Two-dimensional water wave (c) Three-dimensional sound waves propagating from a speaker

Figure 10.1: Different types of Periodic Waves. All periodic waves can be formed from a combination of sinusoidal waves.

We will use a transverse sinusoidal wave set up on the string to illustrate some basic terminology used in waves.

Suppose we set the free end of a string in simple harmonic motion. A transverse wave will be set up along the string and propagate down the string.

**Displacement (\(y\)) :**

The displacement of a particular point on the wave refers to the **distance and the direction** of the point from its equilibrium position.

Before the wave is setup, the rope lies along the x-axis. When the wave is setup in the rope, some points on the rope are being displaced from their equilibrium positions.

Points P and Q are displaced at a distance of \(y_{i}\)_from_ their equilibrium position in the positive direction (as defined by the \(y\)-axis). Hence, their displacements are both \(y=+y_{i}\).

Point U is displaced at a distance of \(y_{o}\) from its equilibrium position in the negative direction. Hence its displacement is \(y=-y_{o}\).

**Amplitude (\(A\) or \(y_{o}\)) :**

The amplitude of a wave is the magnitude of the maximum displacement of a point on the wave.

Fig. 9.3.4: Points S, T and U are at the amplitudes of the wave.

**Wavelength (\(\lambda\))** :

The wavelength of a wave is the distance between two adjacent points which are oscillating in phase.3

Footnote 3: This refers to two points in the same state of oscillation. The concept of phase associated with oscillations will be dealt with further in the chapter.

**Note:**

For a transverse wave, the distance between two successive crests or two successive troughs corresponds to a single wavelength.

For a longitudinal wave, the distance between two successive compressions or rarefactions also corresponds to a single wavelength.

Figure 9.3.4: The figure shows a snapshot of the wave on the rope at an instant of time.

**Example 9.3.1:**

Consider the snapshot of the wave shown below. Other than the distance between the 2 successive crests or troughs,

1. identify another point (B') that pairs with B that will correspond to a single wavelength.
2. Choose another pair of points on the wave that correspond to one wavelength.
3. What do you notice about the pairs of points that represent one wavelength?

Each pair of points not only have the but also the

. They are said to be in the same state of oscillation or

**Period (7) :**

Period is the time taken for a point on the wave to _complete one oscillation cycle._

Period is also the time taken for the wave to advance by a distance of one wavelength or the time taken for _2 consecutive crests/ compressions or troughs (rarefactions) to pass through a certain point._ (see Fig. 9.3.3)

**Frequency (\(\theta\)):**

Frequency is the _number of oscillations per unit time_ made by a point on a wave.

Frequency is also the number of crests/compressions or troughs/ rarefactions that pass through a point along the path of wave travel in a unit time.

S.I. unit of frequency is _s-1_ or _Hz (hertz)_.

The relationship between frequency \(f\) and period \(T\) is given by :

### Wavefronts

* A **wavefront*
* (of a 2-dimensional or 3-dimensional wave) is an imaginary line or curve which joins points on the wave which are oscillating in phase.
* _All points on a wavefront are at the same part of the cycle_ of their vibration.
* By convention, when we represent waves in a diagram, the _distance between consecutive wavefronts is one wavelength apart._
* The direction of propagation of the waves perpendicular to the wavefront as indicated by arrows (\(\rightarrow\)) are known as rays.

### Wave Speed (v):

The speed of a wave is the distance that the wave profile travels per unit time.

**Note:**

There are two sets of motion associated with waves.

* One is that of the motion associated with the oscillation of the individual points on the wave, the points always oscillate about the equilibrium position.
* The other is that of the motion associated with the propagation of waveform of the wave. This is the one that defines the wave speed.

Figure 9.3.6: Wave representations using wave fronts and rays.

Figure 9.3.5: Wavefront of a wave.

#### Relationship between Frequency, Speed and Wavelength

The time taken for a wave to move a distance of one wavelength \(\lambda\) is one period \(T\).

From the definition of wave speed: Speed of the wave, \(v=\dfrac{\text{Distance Travelled}}{\text{Time Taken}}=\dfrac{\lambda}{T}\)

\[\text{Now, }\ f=\dfrac{1}{T}\ \ \Rightarrow\qquad\overline{v}=f\lambda\qquad \text{ where }f\ \text{ is the frequency of the wave.}\]

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:314]

### Graphical Representation of Waves

Consider a transverse water wave travelling from left to right as shown in the diagram below.

As the wave moves through this region of space, we note the following:

* At a particular instant of time, the _displacement of each point on the wave varies with the distance it is located from the source_.
* For a particular point on the wave e.g. at **P**, the _displacement of the point also varies with time_.

Therefore, to completely represent a wave, we need two graphs:

**1**: **Graph of displacement (\(y\)) varies with position (\(x\))** of the points on a wave (at a particular instant of time.)

At a particular instant of time \(\implies\) Graph of \(y\) vs. \(x\).
**2**: **Graph of displacement (\(y\)) varies with time (\(\theta\)) for a particular point on the wave** (at a particular position).

At a particular position \(\implies\) Graph of \(y\) vs. \(t\).

#### Graph of Displacement (\(y\)) vs. Position (\(x\))

Consider a snapshot of a wave on a rope. (Fig. 9.4.2). By superimposing a pair of \(x\) and \(y\) axes on the snapshot, we can describe how the displacement of each point on the rope varies with position.

This graph of displacement vs. position at a particular instant of time (\(y\) vs. \(x\)) gives the **wave profile at an instant of time**. You can imagine this as a snapshot of the wave at a particular instant.

Note :

* +ve \(y\) : displacement of a point on the wave when it is above its equilibrium position
* -ve \(y\) : displacement of a point on the wave when it is below its equilibrium position
* \(x\) axis (\(y=0\)) : equilibrium position of points when there is no disturbance
* _Wavelength (\(\lambda\)) of the wave can also be obtained from the graph._

Figure 9.4.1: A progressive transverse wave moving towards the right.

**Example 9.4.1: Displacement-Position Graph for a Longitudinal Wave**

A displacement-position graph can also be drawn for a longitudinal wave. Consider the following displacement-position graph for the air molecules along a line when a sound wave passes through a region of space. Sketch the corresponding pressure variation of this region.

**Note:** Points of **compression and rarefactions** corresponds to points where **displacements of air molecules are zero.**

**Compressions** are regions of **high air pressure**, while **rarefactions** are regions of **low air pressure**.

**Graph of Displacement (\(\mathbf{y}\)) vs. Time (\(\mathbf{t}\))**

Consider a point P on a rope. As a wave propagates through the rope (Fig. 9.4.3), the displacement of this point varies sinusoidally with respect to time (as shown in Fig. 9.4.4).

**Fig. 9.4.4.**

The graph of displacement vs. time for a wave gives us **the variation of the displacement of a particular point on a wave (at a fixed position \(\mathbf{x}\)) with respect to time.** You can imagine it as a motion video of a particle in a wave.

**The period (\(\mathbf{7}\)) associated with the wave can be obtained from this graph.**

In summary, two graphs are needed to fully depict a wave:

\(\circ\) The graph of **displacement vs. position** (wave profile of a wave at a certain instant of time),

\(\Rightarrow\) Wavelength \(\lambda\) may be obtained

\(\circ\) The graph of **displacement vs. time** (Motion of a particular point on a wave w.r.t. time)

\(\Rightarrow\) Period \(T\) of the waves may be obtained.

**Example 9.4.2: Determining the speed of a wave**

A vibrating bar makes waves in a ripple tank. Fig. 9.4.5(a) shows the displacement of the wave as it travels out from the bar. The position of the floating cork in the tank varies with time as shown in Fig. 9.4.5(b).

**Figure 9.4.5**

From the above two graphs, determine the speed of the wave.

**Example 9.4.3**

The following graph shows a displacement vs. position graph of a progressive transverse wave at \(t\) = 0. For the point **Q** on the wave, sketch the corresponding displacement vs. time graph, given that the wave is moving in the positive \(x\) direction at a speed of 1.0 m s\({}^{-1}\).

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:319]

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:320]

1. **The two waves are said to be in phase** if every point on wave **P** is at the same state of oscillation as the corresponding point of the same position in wave **Q** at the same time. The phase difference between the two waves are \(\Delta\phi\) = 0, 2\(\pi\), 4\(\pi\),...

\(\circ\) Notice that when the two transverse waves are in phase, their "_crests_" will correspond and their "_troughs_" will also correspond.
2. When the phase difference between the two waves are \(\Delta\phi\) = \(\pi\), 3\(\pi\), 5\(\pi\),...., we say that the **two waves are in antiphase.**

\(\circ\) When the two waves are in antiphase, every particle in Wave P is in antiphase with the corresponding point.

\(\circ\) Note that the waveforms seem like a reflection of one another.

**Example 9.5.1 :**

(a) The following graph shows the displacement vs. position of two waves **P** and **Q** at a particular instant of time, what is the phase difference between the two waves **P** and **Q**?

(b) Is it possible to compare the phase difference between two waves of different wavelengths? What is the phase difference between the two waves shown below?

Answer:

No. As \(\Delta x\) is not constant for the 2 waves, the phase difference between the two waves keeps changing value.

It is only meaningful to talk about phase difference between 2 waves only if they have the same wavelength or same frequency.

Figure 9.5.5: (a) Wave P is in phase with wave Q

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:322]

#### Intensity of a Wave from Point Source or Spherical Source

In the special case where the source is **point source** or **spherical source**, and the propagation is _isotropic_ (i.e. the same in all directions), then the wavefronts of the waves are spherical in shape. The wave itself is said to be a _spherical wave_.

The energy spreads out over the wavefront as the wave propagates, hence, the intensity \(I\) at a particular point a distance \(r\) from the source is given by :

\[\text{Intensity},\ I=\frac{\text{Power}}{\text{Area}}=\frac{P}{4\pi r^{2}}\]

where \(P\) is the time rate of energy delivered by the wave to a distance of \(r\) away from the source.

Therefore, we see that the **intensity \(I\) at any distance \(r\) is therefore inversely proportional to \(r\)2.

\[I\propto\frac{1}{r^{2}}\qquad\qquad\text{(For constant P)}\]

#### Note:

* This relationship is called the _inverse-square law for intensity_.
* This relationship is only valid for _point sources / spherical sources_ and is based on the assumption that **the power of the wave does not diminish as it spreads out**.

**Example 9.6.1 : (N94/1/10 - modified)**

A sound wave of amplitude 0.20 mm has an intensity of 3.0 W m\({}^{2}\).

(a) What will be the intensity of a sound wave of the same frequency which has an amplitude of 0.40 mm?

(b) How will the intensity change if the frequency of the source of wave is doubled but the amplitude remains unchanged? Treat the source as a simple harmonic oscillator.

**Example 9.6.2**: **:**

If the intensity of an earthquake _P_-wave is \(1.0\times 10^{6}\) W m\({}^{2}\) at 100 km from the source, what is the intensity of the wave 400 km from the source?

### Polarisation of Waves

One characteristic that distinguishes _transverse waves_ and _longitudinal waves_ is _polarisation4_.

**Plane Polarisation**

**Polarisation** is a phenomenon whereby vibrations in a transverse wave are restricted to only one direction in the plane normal to the direction of energy transfer.

To polarise a wave, we often use a _polarising filter_, or _polariser_, that permits only waves with a certain polarisation direction to pass through.

Consider waves set up on a string. A slot as shown in Fig. 9.7.1 can be used to limit the string's plane of propagation to the x-y plane and the oscillation to the y-axis.

**Polarising Axis or Transmission Axis**

The polarisation direction of the polariser is also known as the _polarising axis_ or _transmission axis_.

_Only components of the waves parallel to the polarising axis are allowed to pass through._

Figure 9.7.1: A vertical slot is used to polarise the wave on the string so that oscillations are limited to a vertical plane.

Figure 9.7.2: A wave on a string polarised to oscillate in the x-y plane (a) and x-z plane (b). For each case, what is the polarizing axis on the polarizer?

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:325]

When unpolarised light is incident on an ideal polariser, the intensity of the transmitted light is exactly half that of the incident unpolarised light, no matter how the polarising axis is oriented.

Since incident light is a random mixture of all polarisation states, the components of the electric field vectors that are perpendicular or parallel to the polarising axis is roughly equal. By only transmitting the component that is parallel to the polarising axis, **only half the incident intensity** is transmitted.

An ideal polariser passes 100% of the incident light that is plane-polarised along its polarisation direction and 0% of the light that is 90\({}^{\circ}\) to its polarisation direction. Since unpolarised light is a mix of all possible polarisations, an ideal polariser transmits only 50% of the incident unpolarised light intensity.

### Light Passing Through Two Polarisers

By using two polarisers, we can also control the intensity of light.

Fig. 9.7.7 shows the typical setup used to control the intensity of light. An unpolarised light beam is incident on two polarisers **P** and **Q** with their polarising axes at an angle of \(\theta\)with each other.

* In such a setup, the second polariser is often known as an **analyser**.
* After passing through the first polariser **P**, the light is polarised along the polarising axis of polariser **P**. Suppose the light then has an amplitude of **E\({}_{o}\)** and an associated maximum intensity of \(I_{o}\).
* If this polarised light then falls on a second polariser **Q**, _then the component of **E\({}_{o}\)** perpendicular to the analyser axis is completely absorbed, while only the component parallel to polarising axis is allowed to transmit through Q._
* Since the plane of oscillation of the electric field of this light is oriented at an angle of \(\theta\)to the polarising axis of **Q**, the resultant amplitude of vibration of the light after passing through the polariser **Q** is given by **E = E\({}_{o}\)cos \(\theta\)**.

Figure 9.7.6: Intensity of plane polarised light

Figure 9.7.7: Using two polarisers to control intensity of light.

* Since the intensity of a wave is directly proportional to the square of the amplitude of vibration, therefore, \[\frac{\text{Intensity of Light after passing through the analyser Q}}{\text{Intensity of Light after passing through the polariser P}}=\frac{I}{I_{o}}=\left(\frac{E_{o}\cos\theta}{E_{o}}\right)^{2}\] \[\Rightarrow\] \[I=I_{o}\cos^{2}\theta\] Hence the intensity of light that passes through two polarisers that are aligned with an angle between their polarisation directions is \[I=I_{o}\cos^{2}\theta\] where \(I_{o}\) is the maximum intensity of light transmitted when the two polarisers are aligned along the same direction of polarisation. The above equation is known as **Malus' law** after its discoverer Etienne Louis Malus, who first observed this effect experimentally in 1809.

Malus's law applies only if the incident light passing through the analyzer is already _linearly polarized_.

Malus' law states that the intensity of a beam of plane-polarised light after passing through a polariser varies with the square of the cosine of the angle through which the polariser is rotated from the position that gives maximum intensity.

Based on Malus' law, when 2 polarisers are aligned at 90\({}^{\circ}\) with respect to each other, zero intensity of light passes through the second polariser.

Web Simulation on Polarization: [https://javalab.org/en/polarization_en/](https://javalab.org/en/polarization_en/)

Some applications of polarised light are:

1. Polarised sunglasses - Glare is usually due to light reflected off a horizontal ground (e.g. snow surface, car roof). As light gets reflected off a horizontal surface, it will be polarized horizontally. Polarised lenses contain a special filter which block off the reflected light from the ground, which reduces the glare.
2. Stress Analysis - Certain plastic materials under stress will affect the plane of polarization of light through them. This can be used to study stress in various structures.
3. 3-D films - Two images are projected through polarising filters onto a screen. The viewer will have to wear a pair of glasses which has 2 different polarising filters for each lens, so that the movie appears to be three dimensional. (see Appendix B 3-D films and Polarisation)

**Example 9.7**

The figure below shows a beam of initially unpolarised light passing through two polarizing filters P1 and P2. The polarising axis of P1 is fixed at 40\({}^{\circ}\) with respect to the vertical axis.

The polarizing axis of P2 is then rotated clockwise from its vertical axis. At what values of \(\theta\) will intensity minima of the emergent light occur?

**Example 9.8**

Two polarising sheets have their polarizing directions parallel so that the intensity \(I_{o}\) of the transmitted light is a maximum. Through what angle must either sheet be turned if the intensity is to drop by half?

**Figure 9.9**

Two polarising sheets have their polarizing directions parallel so that the intensity \(I_{o}\) of the transmitted light is a maximum. Through what angle must either sheet be turned if the intensity is to drop by half?

## Appendices

### Appendix A: Function Generator and Cathode Ray Oscilloscope (C.R.O)

### Function Generator

A function generator is an instrument that produces alternating (a.c.) voltage of different frequencies. The standard voltage signals it can produce are:

\(\circ\) sine waves,

\(\circ\) triangular waves

\(\circ\) rectangular waves

As not all function generators have a precise digital display of the frequency of the waveform or the amplitude of the voltage wave produced. It will sometimes be necessary to connect the function generator to a CRO in order to determine the precise frequency and amplitude of the voltage wave.

To generate the sound waves, the function generator is often connected to a speaker so that the speaker can convert the voltage signals to vibrations of the membrane of the speakers to produce sound waves.

Figure 1: Examples of function generators. The top one is a single output generator. The bottom generator is able to produce two outputs at the same time.

### Cathode Ray Oscilloscope

The other commonly used equipment in sound experiments is the **cathode ray oscilloscope** (CRO). The oscilloscope is basically a graph displaying device that traces the variation of the input voltage signal with respect to time.

Using the oscilloscope, you can measure the amplitude, period, and frequency of any voltage signal. Therefore, a CRO is actually a more complex voltmeter. Hence, to measure the frequency of a sound wave, we need to first connect a microphone to the scope. The microphone will then convert the vibrational energy of the air molecules to voltage signals which can be measured by the CRO.

Most scopes can display two signals on the screen at one time, enabling you to observe their time relationships. These scopes are known as dual-channel oscilloscopes. A typical front panel view of such a scope is shown in Fig. 2.

Actual CROs vary depending on model and manufacturer, but most have certain common features. The main controls will be discussed below. You will need to refer to the user manual for complete details of the scope you are using.

### Vertical Controls:

In the vertical section of the scope (Fig. 2), there are identical controls for each of the two channels (CH1 and CH2).

* **Position Control**. The position control lets you move a displayed waveform up or down vertically on the screen.
* **Volts/Div control**. The Volts/Div (volts per division) control is also known as the **Y-sensitivity / Y-gain control**. It adjusts the number of volts represented by each vertical division (usually 1 cm) on the screen. For this scope, the Volts/Div setting for each channel is displayed at the bottom of the screen. For CH1, it is 500 mV/div and for CH2, it is 200 mV/div.

### Horizontal Controls:

In the horizontal section, the controls apply to both channels.

* **Position Control**. The position control lets you move a displayed waveforms left or right horizontally on the screen.

Figure 2: A typical dual channel oscilloscope. Numbers below screen indicate the values for each division on the vertical (voltage) and horizontal (time) scales and can be varied using the vertical and horizontal controls on the scope. Although this may be a typical dual-channel oscilloscope, it does not lock like the ones we have in the lab!* **Sec/Div Control.** The Sec/Div (seconds per division) control is also known as the **Timebase** control, it adjusts the time represented by each horizontal division or main time base. Similarly, for this scope, the Sec/Div setting is displayed at the bottom of the screen.

## Appendix B 3-D films and Polarization

3-D films such as Avatar (by 20\({}^{\text{th}}\) Century Fox), G-Force (by Walt Disney Pictures) and Cloudy With A Chance of Meatballs (by Sony Pictures Animation) have been a hit with the cinema these days. In fact, 3-D films have existed in some forms since 1950s. There are various techniques to produce 3-D films. Current methods include interference filter technology, for example Dolby 3D and polarization systems, for example RealD. We will look at the latter in detail.

For 3-D films which are shown using polarization systems, the viewers will have to wear 3-D glasses to view the polarized image on the screen. The image will be blurry when viewed without the special glasses. There are two types of polarization systems: linear polarization and circular polarization.

For the linear polarization system, two images are superimposed onto the same screen through two polarizing filters which are at 90 degree angles of each other (orthogonal). The silver screen is specially constructed such that it is non-depolarizing to compensate for light loss and to preserve the polarization. The viewer wears a pair of glasses which is made of a pair of orthogonal polarizing filters. Each filter only allows light from the image which is polarized in the same plane to pass through and blocks the orthogonally polarized light, each eye will only see one of the images. The 3-D effect is then achieved.

Similarly, for a circular polarization system, two images polarized differently are superimposed onto the same screen. However, unlike linear polarization system, the two images pass through circular polarizing filter of opposite handedness. The viewer wears a pair of glasses made of a pair of circular polarizer mounted in reverse handedness. Hence, each eye will only see one of the images and the 3-D effect is achieved. RealD Cinema is a digital stereoscopic projection technology which uses similar techniques as a circular polarization system; except that it only needs one projector. A circularly polarizing liquid crystal filter which can switch polarity is placed in front of the projector lens, so that the left and right images are displayed alternately.

### Introduction

In your secondary schools, you have seen that all waves exhibit _reflection_ and _refraction_.

For the A-levels, we extend our understanding of waves by looking at two other phenomena that are exhibited by waves: _interference_ and _diffraction_.

We will learn about _Young's double slit experiment_, _the measurement of wavelengths_ of light and sound, and the formation of musical notes in strings and woodwind instruments through the formation of _stationary waves_.

### Principle of Superposition

Imagine throwing two pebbles into a still pond. Each pebble makes its own ripples and as the ripples spread out, they kind of overlap. What determines the resultant "ripple" that we see?

The **displacement** of the resultant wave is determined by the **Principle of Superposition**:

_Principle of Superposition:_

The principle of superposition states that **when two or more waves of the same kind overlap**, the **resultant displacement** at any point at any instant is given by the **vector sum of the individual displacements** that each individual wave would cause at that point at that instant.

\[y_{resultant}=y_{1}+y_{2}+y_{3}+....+y_{N}\]

where \(y_{resultant}\)is the displacement of the resultant wave and \(y_{1}\), \(y_{2}\),..., \(y_{N}\) are the individual displacements of the waves at the point of consideration.

The statement of the Principle of Superposition is a popular exam question. Be careful to use the word "**displacement**" and not "amplitude" in your statement.

Fig. 10.2.1 and 10.2.2 are pictorial representations of the superposition of two wave pulses, \(y_{1}\) and \(y_{2}\), travelling in opposite directions. When the waves begin to overlap, the resultant displacement of the waveform on the string at every point at any time is given by \(y_{1}+y_{2}\).

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:348]

Note that when interference is neither fully constructive nor fully destructive, it is called _intermediate interference_ or _partially constructive or destructive interference_. The amplitude of the resultant waveform will be between the maximum and minimum amplitudes possible (not inclusive).

Two pulses are travelling toward each other, at 10 cm s-1 on a long string, as shown in the figure below. Sketch the shape of the string after 0.6 s.

**Solution:**

### Interference of Two Wave Sources

#### 10.4.1 Interference of Waves from Two Sources that are in Phase

Consider two identical sources of monochromatic waves \(S_{1}\) and \(S_{2}\) as shown in Fig. 10.4.1. The two sources produce waves of _same amplitude_, _same frequency_ and are permanently oscillating _in phase_. Both waves have the same speed.

### Path Difference between the Two Wave Sources

Before we derive the general conditions for _constructive interference_ or _destructive interference_ to be observed at any point \(P\), we first define what we mean by _path difference_:

**Path difference \(\delta\)** between the two waves,

\(\delta\) = \(\left|\text{Distance travelled by wave from }S_{i}\text{ to }P-\text{ Distance travelled by wave from }S_{2}\text{ to }P\right|\)

\(=\) \(\left|S_{1}P-S_{2}P\right|\)

Figure 10.4.2: Path difference between waves from \(S_{1}\) and \(S_{2}\) is the difference between the distances travelled by wave from \(S_{1}\) and wave from \(S_{2}\).

Figure 10.4.1: Interference pattern of 2 waves sources oscillating in phase. Solid lines represent the crests while dotted lines represent the troughs of the waves produced by the two sources

### Conditions for Constructive Interference

Consider the lines \(\mathbf{A_{o}}\), \(\mathbf{A_{1}}\), \(\mathbf{A_{2}}\) and \(\mathbf{A_{3}}\).

Along these lines, the crests of the wave from \(\mathbf{S_{1}}\) (See Fig. 10.4.1) will always meet with crests from \(\mathbf{S_{2}}\). Similarly the troughs of the wave from \(\mathbf{S_{1}}\) will meet with the troughs from \(\mathbf{S_{2}}\).

From the Principle of Superposition, at the points where a crest meets another crest, we will get a resultant crest that is twice as high of that of the component waves. Similarly, at the points where a trough meets another trough, the resultant wave will have a trough that is twice as low as that of each component wave.

Therefore along the lines \(\mathbf{A_{o}}\), \(\mathbf{A_{1}}\), \(\mathbf{A_{2}}\) and \(\mathbf{A_{3}}\), the waves will always meet in phase and hence **constructive interference** occurs. \(\mathbf{A_{o}}\), \(\mathbf{A_{1}}\), \(\mathbf{A_{2}}\) and \(\mathbf{A_{3}}\) are also known as the **antinodal lines**.

**For a point P on the antinodal line \(\mathbf{A_{o}}\), two waves from \(\mathbf{S_{1}}\) and \(\mathbf{S_{2}}\) travel to P over the same distance, therefore they meet in phase. We see that for all points on line \(\mathbf{A_{o}}\)**

\[\text{Path difference between the 2 waves at P:}\hskip 36.135pt\delta=\left|S_{1}P-S_{2}P\right|=0\]

\[\text{Phase difference between the 2 waves at P:}\hskip 36.135pt\Delta\phi=0\]

**For any point P on the antinodal line \(\mathbf{A_{1}}\),** we see that the path (distance) travelled by one wave to P is always longer than the other wave by **one wavelength**.

\[\text{Path difference between the 2 waves,}\hskip 36.135pt\delta=\left|S_{1}P-S_{2}P\right|=\lambda\]

\[\text{Phase difference between the 2 waves at P:}\hskip 36.135pt\Delta\phi=2\pi\]

**Similarly for antinodal lines \(\mathbf{A_{2}}\),** for all points P on the line, the path travelled by one wave is always longer than the other wave by **two wavelengths**.

\[\text{Path difference between the 2 waves,}\hskip 36.135pt\delta=\left|S_{1}P-S_{2}P\right|=2\lambda\]

\[\text{Phase difference between the 2 waves at P:}\hskip 36.135pt\Delta\phi=4\pi\]

In general,

### Conditions for Constructive Interference:

1. **Looking at Phase difference (independent of phase difference at the sources)**:

**Phase difference between the two waves meeting at point P is** \[\Delta\phi=0,2\pi,4\pi,6\pi,...=2m\pi\]
2. **Looking at Path difference (dependent on phase difference at the sources)**:

For two waves sources \(\mathbf{S_{1}}\) and \(\mathbf{S_{2}}\) that are oscillating **in phase**,

**Path difference between the two waves travelling from the sources to the point P is:**

\[\delta\hskip 5.690551pt=\hskip 5.690551pt\left|S_{1}P-S_{2}P\right|\hskip 5.690551pt= \hskip 5.690551pt0,\lambda,2\lambda,3\lambda,...\hskip 5.690551pt=m\lambda\]

**where \(m\) = 0,1,2,3,... and \(\lambda\) is the wavelength of the individual waves.**

### Note:

1. **The points of constructive interference are also known as points of maxima.**
2. \(m\) **is also commonly known as the** _order_**.*** The central maximum is known as the _zeroth order maximum_. (_m_ = 0)
* The two maxima on either side of the zeroth order maximum are known as the **1st order maxima** (_m_ = 1). The next maxima further away are then known as the **2nd order maxima** and so on.
* ) to distinguish the "directions" of the order e.g. the orders observed to the right of the zeroth order may be given a positive sign (+) and therefore those orders observed to left of the zeroth order may be given a negative (-) sign.

### Destructive Interference

Consider each point along lines **N\({}_{\text{1}}\), N\({}_{\text{2}}\)**, and **N\({}_{\text{3}}\)** (See Fig 10.4.1). We notice that, along these lines, the crest of a wave from S\({}_{\text{1}}\) will always meet with a trough from S\({}_{\text{2}}\).

Hence, the two waves will always meet in **antiphase** and therefore **destructive interference occurs. N\({}_{\text{o}}\), N\({}_{\text{1}}\), N\({}_{\text{2}}\)** and **N\({}_{\text{3}}\)** are also known as **nodal lines**.

We follow the same procedure to derive the general condition for a destructive interference to be observed at any point **P** from the two sources by examining the nodal lines.

For a particular nodal line N\({}_{\text{1}}\), the wave from S\({}_{\text{1}}\) travels one-half of a wavelength (\(\lambda\)/2) more than the wave from S\({}_{\text{2}}\) to P, so if initially the waves were produced at the source to be in phase (phase difference is zero), this additional \(\lambda\)/2 will cause an equivalent phase difference of 180\({}^{\circ}\) and hence the two waves will meet in antiphase. Therefore a destructive interference will be observed at P.

Figure 10.4.4: For a particular nodal line N\({}_{\text{1}}\), the wave from S\({}_{\text{1}}\) travels one-half of a wavelength (\(\lambda\)/2) more than the wave from S\({}_{\text{2}}\) to P, so if initially the waves were produced at the source to be in phase (phase difference is zero), this additional \(\lambda\)/2 will cause an equivalent phase difference of 180\({}^{\circ}\) and hence the two waves will meet in antiphase. Therefore a destructive interference will be observed at P.

Figure 10.4.3: Two wave sources interfere with each other to produce points of constructive and destructive interference in a two dimension area. Point \(b\) is a point where constructive interference is observed. Point \(c\) is a point where destructive interference is observed. The antinodal lines (lines that join points of constructive interference of the same order) are indicated as well with the value of the order \(m\) shown. Here orders which lie above the zeroth order maximum are given a (+) sign and orders which lie below the zeroth order maximum are given a (-) sign.

**Conditions for Destructive Interference:**

1. **Looking at Phase difference (independent of phase difference at the sources):** Phase difference between the two waves meeting at point P is given by: \[\Delta\phi=\pi,\,3\pi,\,5\pi,\,7\pi,...=(m-\frac{1}{2})\,2\pi\]
2. **Looking at Path difference (dependent on phase difference at the sources):** For two waves sources \(\mathbf{S_{1}}\) and \(\mathbf{S_{2}}\) that are oscillating in **phase**, **Path difference** between the two waves travelling from the sources to the point P is: \[\delta = \left|\mathbf{S_{1}P-S_{2}P}\right|\,\,=\,\,\frac{\lambda}{2},\, \frac{3\lambda}{2},\,\,\frac{5\lambda}{2},\,...\,\,\,=(m-\frac{1}{2})\lambda\] where the order, \(m\) = 1,2,3,... and \(\lambda\) is the wavelength of the individual waves.

**Note :**

1. The points of **destructive interference** are also known as points of **minima**.
2. Notice that because there is no destructive interference in the central line, there is **no zeroth order minimum observed**.

**10.4.2 Accounting for Phase Difference at the Sources**

**Question:**

The conditions for constructive and destructive interference stated above are for the case that _the sources started out in phase_. If the **original sources** _are 180\({}^{\circ}\) out of phase_ (i.e. in anti-phase or equivalent to an additional path difference of \(\frac{\lambda}{2}\)), will the **conditions for path difference** change and why?

**Answer:**

(The phase difference between the 2 wave trains arriving at P)

= (Phase difference at the source) + (Phase difference due to the equivalent path difference)

All the points where the waves meet in phase previously, the waves will now meet in antiphase.

All the points where the waves meet in antiphase previously, the waves will now meet in phase.

Hence, the conditions for constructive and destructive interference **looking at path difference** are interchanged

For Constructive Interference :

For **two waves sources S\({}_{1}\) and S\({}_{2}\)** that are oscillating **in anti-phase**,

**Path difference** between the 2 waves trains arriving at P,

\(\delta\) = \(\left|S_{1}P-S_{2}P\right|\) = \(\frac{\lambda}{2}\), \(\frac{3\lambda}{2}\), \(\frac{5\lambda}{2}\),...

= (\(m\)-1/2)\(\lambda\). where m = 1, 2, 3, 4,....

_m: \(m\)_th order maxima

**Note: Phase difference** between the two waves **meeting at point P** is still given by:

\(\Delta\phi\) = \(2\pi,4\pi,6\pi,...\) = \(2m\pi\)

Note : In this case, the zeroth order is a minimum and there is no zeroth order maximum.

**Example 10.4.1: Two Source Interference**

## 10.5 Interference of Light Waves - Young's Double Slit Experiment

The interference pattern produced by two _water waves_ of the same wavelength can be readily seen in a ripple tank1. However, interference pattern is generally not easily observable when two light waves overlap.

Footnote 1: Read more about the Ripple Tank in Appendix C (Pg. 48).

### So can light waves interfere with each other?

When two independent light sources are placed side by side, no interference pattern is observed because the light waves emitted by each of the sources are not **coherent** (i.e. they do not maintain a constant phase relationship with each other over the time of observation).

Light from an ordinary source undergoes random phase change about once every 10-8 s. Therefore, conditions for constructive interference, destructive interference, or some intermediate state last for times of the order of 10-8 s.

Since the eye cannot follow such short-term changes, no interference pattern is observed.

**Conditions for two waves to produce an Interference Pattern**

1. The sources must be **coherent**; i.e. they must maintain a _constant phase difference_ with respect to each other.
2. The two wave sources must also emit waves of roughly the same amplitude.
3. For transverse waves, they must be unpolarised, or share a common direction of polarisation.

**Note:**

1 **Coherence:**

Two waves are said to be **coherent** if they have a **constant phase difference** between them.

* When two sources are coherent, it does not necessarily imply that they are in phase with each other.
* The constant phase difference may be non-zero.
* Therefore, if 2 sources are coherent, this necessarily implies that the frequencies and wavelengths (and hence speeds) of the waves emitted must be the same.

#### 10.5.1 Description on Young's Double Slit Experiment

It was Thomas Young who first demonstrated that light can also interfere with each other to produce an interference pattern as predicted by wave theory and hence demonstrating that light is a wave. A schematic diagram of the apparatus that Young used is shown in Fig. 10.5.1.

* To produce light sources which are coherent in Young's interference experiment, a point source of monochromatic light is incident on 2 slits. As light reaches the two slits, it is diffracted2 by slits S\({}_{1}\) and S\({}_{2}\), which then act as 2 point sources. Since there is only one primary point source, the light waves emerging from S\({}_{1}\) and S\({}_{2}\) are always coherent. If S\({}_{1}\) and S\({}_{2}\) are equidistant from S\({}_{0}\), then the 2 sources are in phase. Footnote 2: Diffraction will be discussed in more detail in Section 10.7
* The light waves travelling from S\({}_{1}\) and S\({}_{2}\) overlap and undergo interference, forming an interference pattern of **maxima** and **minima**.
* On the screen, points of visible bright rows called _bright bands, bright fringes_, or _maxima_ are formed. The dark regions are called _dark bands, dark fringes_, or _minima_.
* The pattern of bright and dark fringes on the screen is called an **interference pattern**. (Fig.10.5.2)
* A point source is obtained usually by placing another slit S\({}_{o}\) between the double-slit and an extended light source.

Figure 10.5.1: Setup for Young’s Double Slit Experiment

### Conditions for Maxima and Minima

Let us now derive the conditions for the positions of the maxima and minima of the Young's Double Slit experiment.

In Fig. 10.5.2, a screen is placed at a perpendicular distance \(L\) from the double-slits. The double slits are separated by a _slit separation_ of \(d\). Because the wave through S\({}_{1}\) originate from the same wavefront as the wave through S\({}_{2}\), the two waves at S\({}_{1}\) and S\({}_{2}\) are always **in phase**.

Consider an arbitrary point **P** on the viewing screen,

* For **a maximum to be observed at P**, the wave from S\({}_{1}\) needs to **constructively interfere** with the wave from S\({}_{2}\). Hence, the path difference \(\delta\)between the two waves when they meet at P needs to be: \[\delta=\left|r_{1}-r_{2}\right|=0,\lambda,2\lambda,3\lambda,...=m\lambda\qquad \text{where }m:\text{order }(m=0,1,2,3,...)\]
* Similarly, for **a minimum to be observed at P**, the wave from S\({}_{1}\) needs to **destructively interfere** with the wave from S\({}_{2}\). Hence, the path difference \(\delta\)between the two waves when they meet at P needs to be: \[\delta=\left|r_{1}-r_{2}\right|=\frac{\lambda}{2},\frac{3\lambda}{2},\frac{5 \lambda}{2},\frac{7\lambda}{2}=(m-\frac{1}{2})\lambda\qquad\text{where }m:\text{order }(m=1,2,3,...)\]

However, for the experiment, the **separation between the slits \(d\) is often negligible compared to the distance \(L\) between the screen and the slits_**, i.e. \(L>>d\). Therefore the rays from S\({}_{1}\) and S\({}_{2}\) to \(P\) are almost parallel to each other. (Fig. 10.5.3)

_Point to Note: What are the typical orders of magnitude for slit separation, d, slit widths S\({}_{1}\) and S\({}_{2}\) and distance \(L\) for Young's double slits experiment with light?Approximating the rays to be parallel to each other, the _path difference_\(\delta\) may thus be _approximated_ by:

\[\delta=d\,\sin\theta\]

where \(d\) is _the separation between the slits_, and \(\theta\) is the _angular displacement of the position of interference fringe observed from the principal axis QO_.3

Footnote 3: The _principal axis_ is a line joining the midpoint of the two slits perpendicularly to the viewing screen.

The conditions that define whether _bright_ or _dark_ fringes are observed at point P is thus given by

**1**: **Conditions for Constructive or Destructive Interference**

**Condition for Constructive Interference (Maxima or Bright Fringes):**

\[d\,\sin\theta=m\lambda\qquad\qquad\text{ where }m:\text{order number }(\ m=0,1,2,3,...)\]
**Condition for Destructive Interference (Minima or Dark Fringes):**

\[d\,\sin\theta=(m-\frac{1}{2})\lambda\qquad\text{where }m:\text{order number }(\ m=1,2,3,...)\]
**The assumption made during the derivation of these two equations is \(L>>d\)**

**Note:**

* Similar to the two source interference introduced earlier, \(m\) is called the _order number_.
* \(m=0\) corresponds to \(\theta=0\). In this case, a central bright fringe is observed and hence it is known as the _zeroth order maximum_. The first maximum on either side is called the _first-order maximum_, and so forth.
* Sometimes, a sign is assigned to the order to help distinguish the positions of the maxima or minima. For example, in this case, maxima located at one side (suppose above) of the zeroth order maximum may have values of \(m=1\), \(2\), \(3\), \(4\).... while maxima located at the other side (below) the zeroth order maximum may have values of \(m=\) -1, -2, -3, -4,...
**2**: **Positions \(\boldsymbol{\nu}\) of Bright and Dark Fringes**

It is often useful to obtain expressions for the positions \(y\) along the screen of the fringes measured vertically from O to P.

In a typical Young's Double Slit experiment, constructive interference occurs when

\[d\,\sin\,\theta=m\lambda\Rightarrow\sin\,\theta=m\lambda d\]
**if \(\boldsymbol{\lambda<<d}\), the value of \(\boldsymbol{\theta}\) would be very small for low order fringes (i.e. small \(m\))**, hence we can use small angle approximation (\(\sin\,\theta\!\approx\!\tan\,\theta\)) to arrive at \(\tan\,\theta=m\lambda d\)

From triangle OPQ (Fig. 10.5.2), we have \(\tan\theta=\frac{\gamma}{L}\)\(\Rightarrow\)\(\frac{m\lambda}{d}=\frac{\gamma}{L}\)

**Example 10.5.1** : **Determination of wavelength of light using Young's Double Slit**

(i) What is the fringe separation between 2 neighbouring bright fringes formed on the screen?

(ii) Determine the wavelength of light. Ans: (i) 2.25 mm (ii) 5.63 x 10\({}^{-7}\) m

**Solution:**

**Effects of Diffraction on Double Slit**

The slits used in the double slit experiment in practice cannot be considered as point sources. As a result, each slit produces a diffraction pattern as shown in Fig. 10.7.5. Fig. 10.5.4 illustrates the interference pattern of two slits superposed on the intensity pattern of a single slit. The interference fringe pattern due to the double slit gets moderated by the diffraction pattern.

**Fig. 10.5.4**

This can sometimes result in missing orders in the interference fringe pattern. When the minima of the diffraction envelope coincide with the maxima of the interference pattern, the "maxima" of the interference pattern go missing because they are too dim to be seen.

### Diffraction Grating

We have seen that the Young's double-slit experiment is able to allow us to determine the wavelength of light. However, a more commonly used tool is the _diffraction grating_. A diffraction grating has many fine, parallel, closely spaced and equidistant slits/rulings inscribed on a sheet of glass or metal. A typical diffraction grating has several hundreds to thousands of slits per mm.

To see how a diffraction grating pattern differs from a Young's double-slit pattern and why it is so useful, we will analyse the diffraction pattern for various number of slits of the same slits-separation \(d\).

Figure 10.6.1:From Fig. 10.6.2(a) above, we make the following observations:

* For the same slit separation \(d\), the **positions of the maxima remain the same**.
* As the number of slits increase, the maxima become narrower (i.e. the fringes become sharper on the screen).
* As the number of slits increase, the intensity of the maxima increases.

Therefore, we can infer that for a grating (no. of slits \(\rightarrow\infty\)) the **fringe pattern will have very good contrast** (narrower and brighter maxima separated by broad regions of dark minima).

Figure 10.6.2: This shows the diffraction pattern of one slit, then two, then three, four, five, six, and more. When there are many slits, we call it a diffraction grating. The more slits, the narrower the fringes become. The pictures (a) above were taken with monochromatic light. The intensity distribution is shown in (b).

**Condition for Maxima for a Diffraction Grating**

From Fig. 10.6.2(b) above, we notice that for same value of \(d\), the positions of the maxima (bright fringes) of a grating coincide with the positions of the maxima for a double slit:

We can therefore infer the equation that determines the positions of the maxima for a _diffraction grating pattern_.

**Condition for Constructive Interference (Maxima) for a Diffraction Grating**

For the _nth order maxima_,

\[d\sin\theta=n\lambda\]

where \(d\) : separation between the slits

\(\theta\) : angular position of the bright fringe from the principle axis

\(n\) : order number (_n=0, 1, 2, 3,..._)

\(\lambda\) : wavelength of light passing through the grating

Commercially available gratings are labelled by the _no. of lines per unit length, N_. The relationship between \(N\) and \(d\) are given by

**Note :**

In this case, we _do not define_ the conditions for _destructive interference_ as the width of the region between the bright fringes is very large.

For most of the gratings in the laboratory, the slit separations are much smaller than that of the double slits. Hence, _you will notice that the positions of the first and higher orders of the bright fringes lie much further away from the central bright fringe and hence small angle approximation (that \(d\) is small) does not hold_. Therefore, in most questions for diffraction grating it is not meaningful to talk about the _fringe separation_ as the angular separation between consecutive fringes are not constant, in fact _they increase as the order increases_.

Although the formula for constructive interference for the double slit and the diffraction grating is the same, the formula for fringe separation for double slits, \(\Delta y=\frac{\lambda L}{d}\), CANNOT

be used in a grating, unless the fringes are shown to be regularly spaced.

**3 Grating vs. Young's Double Slit**

The grating is often the preferred choice over the double-slit for the following reasons. For a diffraction grating,

* Fringes are sharper and positions are more precisely determined. There is therefore less uncertainty in measuring the position of the fringes, and less uncertainty in the computation of wavelength.

* Typically the angular displacements are large, so percentage uncertainty in measuring the angular displacement becomes relatively lower. This translates to a relatively lower percentage uncertainty in measuring wavelength as well.
* 4 Determination of Wavelength Using Grating4
* **Advantages and disadvantages of using the higher orders to determine the wavelength as compared to first order:*
* Using \(d\sin\theta=m\lambda\)**, if we know the value of the slits separation \(d\), we can generally determine the wavelength of the light used by measuring the value of \(\theta\) for a particular order of fringe. There are both advantages and disadvantages in using the higher orders to determine this wavelength.
* **Advantages :*
* angular displacement \(\theta\) is larger, therefore there is less percentage uncertainty in measuring the angle.
* **Disadvantages :*
* May not be as bright as the first order bright fringe.

**Example 10.6.1**: **: Diffraction Grating**

White light from a source passes through a filter which transmits only wavelengths of 400 nm to 600 nm. When the filtered light falls normally on a diffraction grating, light of wavelength 600 nm in one order of the spectrum is diffracted at the same angle, 30\({}^{\circ}\), as the 400 nm light in the adjacent order.

Find the number of lines per mm for the grating. [Ans: 417 lines per mm]

**Solution:**

**Example 10.6.2**: **: Maximum no. of Fringes Observable.**

A monochromatic source of 495 nm is incident normally on a diffraction grating which has 500 lines per mm. How many diffraction lines can be observed on the screen?. [Ans: 9]

**Strategy:** The maximum angular deviation from the principle axis is 90\({}^{\rm o}\). Using this condition, we can determine the maximum order and hence find the theoretical maximum number of fringes observable on the screen.

### 10.7 Diffraction of Waves

What is diffraction?

Diffraction is the _spreading_ of a wave (into the "geometrical shadow") after passing through a slit or around an obstacle.

Diffraction effects become more apparent when the width of the opening is small enough compared to the wavelength.

#### 10.7.1 Diffraction of water waves

When waves meets a barrier in which there is an opening, if the width of the opening is much larger than the wavelength of the waves, the wave emerging from the opening continues to move in a straight line (apart from some small spreading at the edge). If the width of the opening is comparable or smaller than the wavelength, then the bending is a lot more obvious, and emergent wave becomes more circular.

What is meant by "Geometrical Shadow"

Consider a series of particles projected (diagram below) separately into an aperture and obstacle.

Diffraction is also observed for waves meeting an obstacle in its path. Again, **the relative size of the obstacle to the wavelength will determine the effect of diffraction** as shown in Figure 10.7.3. It is found that in order for the waves to spread around the edges of the obstacle to extend into the geometric shadow of the obstacle, the width of the obstacle should be small enough compared to the wavelength.

Figure 10.7.2:

Figure 10.7.1: Waves of identical wavelengths meet gaps of different widths. When the **width of the gap** is **comparable** to the **wavelength**, diffraction effects are more obvious.

Since light and sound demonstrate diffraction effects, they are said to behave like waves. This diffraction effect cannot be explained by particle theory (i.e. diffraction effect is unique to waves).

### 10.7.2 Single Slit Diffraction Pattern

#### Diffraction Pattern of a Single Slit

We might expect that light passing through a small aperture would result in a broad region of light on a screen, due to the spreading of the light as it passes through the opening.

We actually find something more interesting.

A diffraction pattern consisting of light and dark areas is observed (see Figure 10.7.4), somewhat similar to the interference pattern discussed earlier.

This pattern consists of a broad intense central band (called the central maximum), flanked by a series of alternating bright and dark bands.

Figure 10.7.4:

Figure 10.7.3: The waves will bend if the length of the obstacle is comparable to the wavelength of the waves.

In a single slit diffraction, **light waves of wavelength \(\lambda\)** passing through a **single slit of width \(b\)** undergoes diffraction to produce a broad intense central band with an intensity profile that is maximum at the centre, and tapers off towards both sides as shown in Figure 10.7.5.

You are not required to explain formally these observations for the A-level Physics syllabus.

Nonetheless, for those interested, these observations can be explained by means of Huygen's Principle, which explains how the slit can be modeled as row of secondary point sources, the waves from which interfere with one another to create an interference pattern.

A detailed explanation can be found in Appendix A.

The **first minimum intensity of the single slit diffraction pattern** occurs at **angle \(\theta\)** from the central maximum where

\[\sin\,\theta=\frac{\lambda}{b}\]

This angle \(\theta\) is important because it tells us the angular spread (\(2\theta\)) which contains most of the energy of the wave. It can be seen from this that as \(b\) **(the slit width) is reduced, \(\theta\) gets larger and the pattern is more spreads out**. The **pattern also gets dimmer as less light energy passes through a smaller slit**. A more complete analysis of the diffraction pattern can be found in Appendix B.

### Width of the single slit pattern

For small angles the **angular spread of the diffraction pattern** is inversely proportional to the **slit width \(b\)** or, more precisely, to the **ratio of \(b\) to the wavelength \(\lambda\)**. Figure 10.7.6 shows graphs of intensity / as a function of the angle for three values of the ratio \(b\,/\lambda\).

Figure 10.7.5:

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:382]

## 10.7.3 Resolving Power and Rayleigh's Criterion

The resolving power of an optical instrument is the ability of the instrument to differentiate clearly between the images of two close objects, i.e., the two images are seen as two distinct images. The resolving power is measured in terms of angular separation (units in radians) of the two images.

As most images are viewed through an aperture as in the case of microscoppes and telescopes, it is identical to viewing the diffraction pattern produced. Hence, the diffraction of light affects greatly or limits the resolving power of an optical instrument.

To understand this limitation, let us consider two light sources far away from a narrow slit of **slit width**\(b\)**, with angular separation of \(\alpha\).

Since the two sources are usually incoherent (such as two distant stars), let's assume that no interference occurs between the two light passing through the slit. So each light source simply produces its own diffraction pattern on the screen. What is observed on the screen will be the summation of two diffraction patterns, one from each source. If the sources are close together, their diffraction patterns overlap; if their angular separation is small enough, their diffraction patterns overlap almost completely and cannot be distinguished. (see Fig. 10.7.8 part c)

Figure 10.7.8: Individual diffraction patterns of two point sources (solid curves) and the resultant patterns (dashed curves) for various separation of sources as light passes through a circular aperture. In each case, the dashed curve is a summation of the two solid curves.

The generally accepted criterion for whether two images are distinguishable is the **Rayleigh criterion**, which states that **two images are just resolved or distinguishable when the central maximum of one image coincides with the first minimum of the other image** (see Fig. 10.7.8 part b).

Hence according to the Rayleigh criterion, **two images are just resolved or distinguishable** when the **angular separation between the two sources, \(\alpha\)** is (approximately) equal to the **angular separation \(\theta_{min}\)** between the central maximum and the first minimum of the images (See Fig. 10.7.9).

From section 10.5.2 (single slit diffraction pattern), we learnt that the **first minimum** for a single slit diffraction occurs at an angle \(\sin\theta_{\rm min}=\frac{\lambda}{b}\) where \(b\) is the slit width.

When \(\theta_{\rm min}\) is small, we can use the approximation \(\sin\theta_{\rm min}\approx\theta_{\rm min}\). The **Rayleigh criterion for the resolving power of a single aperture** is thus given by

\[\theta_{\rm min}\approx\frac{\lambda}{b}\]

where \(b\)**is the slit width and \(\theta_{\rm min}\) is in radians**.

Hence we can also say that **the angle subtended by the two sources, \(\alpha\) must be greater than \(\frac{\lambda}{b}\) if the images are to be resolved**.

**Note:**

1. The resolving power of a telescope can be improved by using an objective lens of wide aperture (i.e. large diameter). Besides reducing the diffraction effects, more light is also transmitted through the telescope and a brighter image is observed.
2. In microscopes, the resolving power is improved by using radiation of much smaller wavelengths than visible light, such as ultra-violet. In electron microscopes, the wavelength of the electron beam is \(10^{5}\) times smaller than visible light, resulting in much higher resolution in the images. The wavelength associated with the electron beam will be covered in Chapter 17 Quantum Physics.
3. For circular lens aperture (e.g. telescope), the formula becomes \(\sin\theta_{\rm min}=\frac{1.22\lambda}{D}\), where \(D\) is the diameter of the circular lens. **Not required for A Level, for information only.**

**Example 10.7.2**

The resolving power of the eye may be determined by drawing two parallel lines at a distance of say 2 mm apart on a piece of card. The card is slowly moved away from the eye until the eye just cannot see the two lines as separate lines. The distance of the card from the eye is measured. Suppose for a particular person, the distance of the card from his eye is 5 m when his eye just fail to see the two lines distinctly. [Ans: (a) 0.0004 rad (b) 1.25 mm] (a) Determine the angle subtended at the eye by the two lines. (b) By approximating the wavelength of the visible light to be 500 nm, estimate the aperture of the pupil of the eye.

## 10.8 Stationary Waves

Consider two identical waves moving in opposite directions overlapping in the same region of space. Figure 10.8.1 shows wave P moving towards the right and wave Q moving towards the left. By applying the principle of superposition, we know that during the time the two waves overlap, the resultant displacements is given by the vector sum of the displacements of the primary waves at that location.

Because the wave pattern does not appear to move in either direction along the wave, the resultant waveform is known as a **standing wave** or **stationary wave**.

We can observe from the diagram that amplitude of vibration for every point of the resultant wave varies.

* There are particular points called **nodes** (\(N\)) that never move, i.e. the amplitude of vibration is zero.
* Midway between the nodes are points called **antnodes** (\(A\)), where the amplitude of vibration is greatest.

### Formation of Stationary Wave (or Standing Wave)

**Stationary Waves**

When two identical waves of the **same amplitude**, **frequency** and **speed** but travelling in **opposite directions** are superposed together, the resultant wave obtained is called a stationary wave.

### Characteristics of Stationary Wave

Let us examine the properties of the stationary wave by comparing it with a travelling wave.

**Example 10.8.1** : **Stationary Waves**

Fig 10.8.2 shows a car driven at a speed of 30 m s-1 along a straight road between 2 radio transmitters. The transmitters T\({}_{1}\) and T\({}_{2}\) are sending out the same programme, using a frequency of 1.50 MHz. The radio is heard to fade and strengthen regularly.

What is the period of this regular fading?

**Solution:**

#### Stationary Waves in Strings

Consider a string, fixed at one end, and the other end attached to an oscillator. If the oscillator moves up and down in simple harmonic motion, it will produce a continuous wave-train down the string. As the wave-train reaches the fixed end, it gets reflected back. The reflected wave-train will interfere with the wave-train from the source to form a resultant waveform on the string. It is observed that at certain frequencies of vibration of the source, we will be able to see some unique waveforms on the string as illustrated in Fig. 10.9.3(a)-(c).

The frequencies at which standing waves are produced are known as the natural frequencies or resonant frequencies of the string.

The different standing wave patterns shown in Fig. 10.8.3 are the different "resonant modes of vibration". When the driving frequency matches that of the natural frequency of the string, the amplitude of oscillation generated are the largest.

This principle is very important as it is used in the generation of music in many stringed instruments like guitar and violin.

### Resonant modes of vibrations in a stretched string fixed at two ends

Consider a wire stretched between 2 points and plucked in the middle, a transverse wave travels along the wire and is reflected at the ends. The reflected and re-reflected waves from the ends will continually interfere with each other to produce a stationary wave on the string.

The two _ends of the strings are fixed and thus must have zero displacement_ and hence must be displacement nodes.

This additional constraint or boundary condition results in the string being allowed to have only certain wavelengths and frequencies of oscillations.

Figure 10.8.4:Fig. 10.8.4 shows the largest possible wavelength of stationary wave that can be produced on the wire - corresponding to the smallest frequency. This mode of oscillation is known as the **fundamental mode** and the lowest frequency of vibration \(f_{i}\) is known as the **fundamental frequency**.

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|} \hline
**Mode of Vibration** & **Wavelength** & **Frequency** & **Harmonic** & **Overtone** \\ \hline \(\lambda_{1}=2L\) & \(f_{i}=\frac{\nu}{\lambda_{1}}=\frac{\nu}{2L}\) & 1st & - \\ \hline \(\lambda_{2}=L\) & \(f_{2}=\frac{\nu}{\lambda_{2}}=\frac{\nu}{L}\) & 2nd & 1st \\ \hline \(\lambda_{3}=\frac{2}{3}L\) & \(f_{3}=\frac{\nu}{\lambda_{3}}=\frac{3\nu}{2L}\) & 3rd & 2nd \\ \hline \end{tabular} Generally the _nth_ harmonic is given by: \(f_{n}=n\bigg{(}\frac{\nu}{2L}\bigg{)}\), where \(n\) = 1, 2, 3, 4,...

**Note:**

1. **Fundamental Frequency and Harmonics**

All resonant frequencies of vibrations that can be generated are called harmonics. The harmonics are numbered according to the ratio of their frequencies to the first natural frequency \(f_{i}\). Thus if the 1st harmonic is 110 Hz, then 220 Hz, 330 Hz, 440 Hz etc. are the 2nd, 3rd, 4th  etc harmonics respectively.

The first natural frequency is the lowest possible frequency and is known as the _fundamental frequency_ (or 1st harmonic)

The frequencies of the harmonics are related to the fundamental frequency \(f_{i}\) by \(f_{n}=nf_{i}\) where \(f_{n}\) is the frequency of the _nth_ harmonic.

Note that all harmonics are present for the string shown above.

2. **Overtones**

Overtones are the frequencies (excluding the fundamental) that can be produced by an instrument accompanying the 1st harmonic that is played.

The tuning fork and frequency generator are the only examples that can produce a pure note.

The lowest overtone is known as the 1st overtone, the next overtone is the 2nd overtone. Hence, in this case, the 1st overtone of the string corresponds to the 2nd harmonic of the string.

3. **Speed of a wave on a string**

The speed of a wave on a string is given by \(\nu=\sqrt{\frac{T}{\mu}}\) where \(T\) is the tension in the string and \(\mu\) is the mass per unit length of the string. **Not required for A Level, for information only.**

**Example 10.8.2: Resonant Wavelengths of a Wire**

A 1.0 m wire stretched between 2 points is plucked near one end. What are the three longest wavelengths present on the vibrating wire? [Ans: 2.0 m, 1.0 m, 0.67 m]

**Solution:**

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:396]

### Resonant Frequencies of Air Columns

There are generally 2 types of air columns we want to concern ourselves with:

* open pipe
* closed pipe ( closed at one end)

Recall that the open end of the pipe, we have a displacement antinode, and at the closed end of the pipe, we have a displacement node.

### Resonant Vibrations in an Open Pipe

The _nth_ harmonic can be expressed as: \(f=n\bigg{(}\dfrac{\nu}{2L}\bigg{)}\), where \(n\) = 1, 2, 3, 4,...

### Resonant Vibrations in a Closed Pipe

The _nth_ harmonic is given by: \(f_{n}=n\bigg{(}\dfrac{\nu}{4L}\bigg{)}\), where \(n\) = 1, 3, 5,...

**Note:**

1. The fundamental frequency of an open pipe is twice that of a closed pipe of the same length.
2. Only odd harmonics are present in closed pipe.
3. Assuming that we have a closed pipe and an open pipe with characteristics the same in all aspects inclusive of length, the following table presents a possible situation for the combination of frequencies emitted.

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|} \hline Harmonics & Frequency emitted from a Closed & Frequency emitted from an Open \\  & Pipe /Hz & Pipe / Hz \\ \hline
1 & 256 & 512 \\ \hline
2 & - & 1024 \\ \hline
3 & 768 & 1536 \\ \hline
4 & - & 2048 \\ \hline
5 & 1280 & 2560 \\ \hline \end{tabular} The quality of sound emitted is a mixture of these harmonics for each system. Hence we see that the "note" from an open pipe is "richer" than that from a closed pipe.

**Example 10.8.3 Serway p18.37.**

**Solution:**

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:400]

#### What about the pressure?

Earlier in Waves topic, we discussed the pressure variations in a progressive sound wave; now we can consider how pressure varies in a stationary sound wave.

Fig. 10.8.7(a) shows the two extreme curves of the displacement-position graph for a stationary wave for times when the displacements are greatest. As before, we will take displacements of air molecules to the right to be positive.

How does the pressure vary at displacement node N?

* Consider the instant in time when the wave corresponds to the dashed line in Fig. 10.8.7 (a).
* At position node N\({}_{1}\), air molecules to the left of N\({}_{1}\) are displaced positively and hence to the right towards N\({}_{1}\); air molecules to the right of N\({}_{1}\) has a negative displacement and hence to the left toward N, as well; air molecules at N\({}_{1}\) has zero displacement and remain at their equilibrium positions. **At this instant in time, the air at N\({}_{1}\) is compressed and the pressure is greater than normal.**
* Half a period later, the wave would correspond to the solid line in Fig. 10.8.7 (a),
* At position node N\({}_{1}\), air molecules to the left of N\({}_{1}\) are displaced negatively and hence to the left away from N\({}_{1}\); air molecules to the right of N\({}_{1}\) has a positive displacement and hence to the right away from N\({}_{1}\) as well. Air molecules at N\({}_{1}\) has zero displacement and remain at their equilibrium positions. **At this instant in time, the air at N\({}_{1}\) is rarefied and the pressure is lower than normal.**
* This illustrates the fact that **pressure variation is greatest at displacement nodes.**
* **Displacement node** is subjected to large pressure changes and hence it is a **pressure antinode.**

How does the pressure vary at displacement antinode A\({}_{1}\)?

* At position antinode A\({}_{1}\), air molecules to the left of A\({}_{1}\), to the right of A1 and at A1 are always displaced in the same direction. This means that at antinode A\({}_{1}\), the separation between air molecules is maintained constant and **the pressure remains at normal all the time**.
* **Displacement antinode** is subjected to zero pressure changes and hence it is a **pressure node.**

Figure 10.8.7: Pressure variation for a stationary sound wave

**Example 10.8.5: End Corrections**

A source of sound of frequency 250 Hz is used with resonant tube, closed at one end, to measure the speed of sound in air. The two shortest resonant lengths are found to be 0.30 and 0.96 m. Calculate

(a) the speed of the sound, and

(b) the end correction of the tube. [Ans: (a) 330 m s-1 (b) 3.0 cm]

**Solution:**

#### Investigating the speed of sound using stationary waves

We can determine the speed of sound wave by setting up a stationary wave and measure the corresponding frequency and wavelength as described by the experiment below. A stationary sound wave is set up by reflection from a reflector.

The experimental setup is shown in Fig. 10.8.9.

* The signal generator (See Appendix E, Pg. 49) connected to a speaker delivers a note of frequency \(f\) towards a reflector (e.g. a metal sheet).
* The sound wave gets reflected off the reflector and interference occurs between the forward and reflected waves and a stationary wave pattern with nodes and antinodes is established between the speaker and reflector.
* The positions of antinodes are determined using a microphone connected to the oscilloscope (See Appendix A of waves lecture notes for the write-up on oscilloscopes). The microphone is slowly moved away from the reflector until a trace of maximum amplitude is obtained. This denotes the position of a pressure antinode. The distance \(x_{1}\) of the microphone from the reflector is measured using a metre rule.
* The microphone is next moved slowly further away from the reflector until the amplitude of the trace on the C.R.O. is once again maximum. The distance of the microphone from the reflector, \(x_{2}\), is again measured. Therefore, Distance between 2 successive pressure antinodes, \(d=x_{2}-x_{1}=\lambda/2\) Waelength of the sound wave, \(\lambda=2d\)
* If the frequency \(f\) of the sound wave is known, the speed of sound \(\nu\) can be determined from \(\nu=f\lambda\)

### D3 N2017/1/17

The speed of a wave on a stretched string is proportional to the square root of the tension in the string. The string is held under tension between a clamp and a pulley 90 cm apart by a mass \(m\) of 400 g hanging from the end of the string.

When the frequency \(f\) of the mechanical oscillator close to the clamped end is 15 Hz, the stationary wave shown is set up between the clamp and the pulley. The hanging mass \(m\) and frequency \(f\) are varied until another stationary wave is formed.

## Appendices

### Appendix A: Huygens' Principle

But how can one explain the bending of waves due to diffraction? Why does the spreading of waves become increasingly more obvious with the width of the aperture decreases to about the same order as the wavelength? This phenomenon may be explained using _Huygens' Principle_.

The _Huygens' Principle_ is a geometrical method for finding, from the known shape of a wave front at some instant, the shape of the wave front at some later time. Huygen assumed that

**every point of a wave front may be considered the source of secondary wavelets that spread out in all directions with a speed equal to the speed of propagation of the wave**.

The new wave front at a later time is found by constructing a surface _tangent to the secondary wavelets_, called the _envelope_ of the wavelets.

The following diagram shows how Huygens' construction is used to determine the new wavefronts for a plane wave and for a spherical wave.

Through Huygens' construction, we can now see how the subsequent wavefronts'reconstruct' themselves when incident plane waves pass through a slit.

Figure 1: Huygens’ construction for (a) a plane wave propagating to the right and (b) a spherical wave propagating to the left.

Let us now apply Huygens' construction to explaining diffraction.

Consider first the case where the obstacle or opening is much larger than the wavelength of the waves (Fig. 2), we find that the wavelets emerging forms wavefronts that is essentially straight. Diffraction is not very apparent.

If, however, the size of the opening becomes comparable to the wavelength, the waves proceed to "bend through" or around the opening or obstruction as shown in Fig. 3.

Finally, as the obstruction or opening equals the wavelength, the diffraction becomes quite pronounced as shown in Fig 4.

## Appendix B Single Slit Diffraction Pattern

To analyze the diffraction pattern of the single slit, let us divide the slit into two halves as shown.

Consider ray 1 and 3. As the two rays travel towards the screen, ray 1 travels an additional path difference of \(\dfrac{b}{2}\text{sin}\theta\) where \(b\) is the width of the slit and \(\theta\) is the angle with the principle axis. Similarly, the path difference between rays 2 and 4, as well as between rays 3 and 5, is also \(\dfrac{b}{2}\text{sin}\theta\).

If this path difference is exactly half a wavelength, then destructive interference occurs. This cancellation occurs for any two rays that originate at the points separated by half a slit width because the phase difference between 2 such points is 180\({}^{\circ}\). Therefore the waves from the upper half of the slit interfere destructively with the waves from the lower half when

\[\dfrac{b}{2}\text{sin}\theta=\pm\dfrac{\lambda}{2}\] \[\text{or}\;\;b\text{sin}\theta=\pm\lambda\]

Dividing the slit into 4 equal parts and using the same reasoning, we find that destructive interference also occurs when \(\dfrac{b}{4}\text{sin}\theta=\pm\dfrac{\lambda}{2}\) or \(b\text{sin}\theta=\pm 2\lambda\).

This same argument can be applied when the slit is divided into 6, 8 and so on equal parts, and we obtained the general condition for **destructive interference** (or **dark region**) to be

\[b\text{sin}\theta=m\lambda\text{ where m = }\pm 1,2,3,...\]

## Appendix C: Ripple Tank

One way to observe interference of water waves is in a ripple tank. Generally a ripple tank could be used to investigate various properties of water waves.

1. **Eccentric:** An eccentric (off-centre) metal disc on the axle of the motor causes the beam to vibrate at the same frequency as the revolutions of the motor. The speed of the motor is controlled by a rheostat in series with a low-voltage d.c. supply, or a dry battery (usually 3.0 or 4.5 V).
2. To generate continuous straight wave, a vibrating beam just touching the water is used.
3. To generate circular waves, a small spherical dipper is fixed to the beam instead.
4. The speed of the motor may be adjusted to vary the frequency and wavelength of continuous wave train.
5. The progressive waves move quite quickly across the water surface and any attempt to measure the wavelength or draw the wave diagrams from the moving water shadows would be very difficult. A standard method of freezing or slowing down rapid motion would be to use a stroboscope.

Figure 1: Set-up for the ripple tank

Figure 2: Observations of wavefronts in a ripple tank.

## Appendix D Spectrometer

The grating or double slit is usually mounted on a device known as a _spectrometer_ to allow us to easily take measurements of \(\theta\) so that we can study about the light source. Fig. 1 below shows you a typical laboratory spectrometer and Fig. 2 shows a schematic sketch of the spectrometer.

When used with a grating,

* Angular position of _m\({}^{\textit{m}}\)_ order bright fringe}\right|\] \[\Rightarrow\qquad\theta\ =\left|\theta_{o}-\theta_{m}\right|\] Alternatively, by noting the angular positions of the _mth_ order bright fringe at either side of the central maximum (\(\theta_{m,_{\textit{left}}}\) and \(\theta_{m,_{\textit{right}}}\)), we can also determine the angular displacement \(\theta\) of _m\({}^{\textit{m}}\)_ order maximum from the central maximum. In this case, \[2\ \theta\ =\left|\theta_{m,_{\textit{left}}}-\theta_{m,_{\textit{right}}}\right|\] \(\circ\) We also move the telescope to each side of this central maximum to check that several orders of _diffraction_ can be seen and there is some symmetry about this central maximum. If not, the plane of the surface of the grating is not perpendicular to the plane in which telescope moves and tilt of the table needs to be adjusted.

## Introduction to Thermal Physics

_Defining Our System_

When we are studying a physical phenomenon, the first thing we can do is to do some kind of 'isolation' i.e. we 'pluck' some part of that thing out from its surroundings. This 'plucked out' part is what we commonly call the'system'. The surface that separates the system from its surroundings is called the boundary. It is important to be strict about the boundary between the system and its surroundings i.e. we should not be sloppy or hazy when it comes to defining the system boundary at the outset of our study.

_Thermodynamics Properties of A System - Macroscopic vs Microscopic_

After we have defined our system, the next thing is of course to decide which aspect(s) of the system we wish to observe. In science, people are keen on those aspects that can be studied in the laboratory. Furthermore, we try to quantify such aspects i.e. ascribe numbers to them. In Thermodynamics, some of the aspects of the system we usually deal with are: length, volume, density, energy, pressure, temperature, mass etc. We call them properties or physical quantities of the system.

Such properties are separated into two categories: macroscopic and microscopic. Taking energy for example: macroscopic forms of energy are those in which a system possesses as a whole with respect to some outside reference frame, such as kinetic and potential energies of the centre-of-mass of the system. The microscopic forms of energy, on the other hand, are those related to the molecular structure of the system and the degree of molecular activity. They are independent of outside reference frames. The sum of all the microscopic forms of energy of a system is its _internal energy_.

_State of A System - A Set of Its Properties_

If a system is not undergoing any change, the set of all the properties of the system that can be measured or calculated will specify the condition of this system. We call this the _state_ of the system. At a given state, all the properties of a system have fixed values. If the value of even one property changes, the state will change to a different one. The state of a system is hence a condition of the system specified in terms of the totality of its properties.

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:419]

### Temperature Measurement & Temperature Scales

#### From an Empirical Scale1 to an Absolute Scale

Footnote 1: See Appendix B: Empirical Scale

_The Problem with the Empirical Scale_

Consider this scenario: two different thermometers working on different thermometric properties2 X and Y are calibrated on the same fixed points - melting ice and boiling water.

Say we assign the number 0 and 100 at these two fixed points for the two thermometers, so we have an empirical Centigrade Scale. Now, so long as the two thermometers measure the temperature of melting ice and boiling water we will get perfect agreement in temperature readout from these two thermometers but what if we use them to measure other temperatures? Clearly, the two different thermometric properties X and Y do not have to vary with temperature linearly and certainly not in the same way.

_Ideal Gas Scale_

This disagreement between thermometers using different thermometric properties is clearly a disadvantage of the empirical scale. One way of solving this is to take one scale as a standard in which all temperatures are expressed. This specially chosen standard scale must be independent of the thermometric property used hence such a scale is sometimes known as an **absolute scale**.

An ideal gas is one that follows the gas laws at all conditions of temperature and pressure. To do so, the gas needs to completely abide by the kinetic-molecular theory. There is no such thing as an ideal gas in real life. A real gas deviates most from an ideal gas at low temperatures and high pressures. Gases are most ideal at high temperature and low pressure. The figure below shows a graph of PV/RT plotted against pressure for 1 mol of a gas at three different temperatures of 200 K, 500 K, and 1000 K. The magnitude of the deviations from ideality is greatest for the gas at 200 K and least for the gas at 1000 K.

One way to minimize disagreement between thermometers is to use the gas under conditions when it behaves approximately like an ideal gas where the ideal gas equation of state (\(PV=nRT\)) holds. In this case, the volume of a fixed mass of gas \(V\) will be directly proportional to the absolute temperature \(T\) if the gas pressure \(P\) is kept constant. This relationship works for any gas under ideal conditions (hence independent of the type of gas) which in theory gives the most undisputed temperature measurement. Temperature measurement here is read in the Ideal Gas Scale.

The unit for this scale is kelvin. The symbol is K. The reference temperature (fixed point) is set at zero kelvin (0 K) - the _absolute zero_. This is a theoretical temperature as it has not been attained experimentally. How about another fixed point? The state in which ice, liquid water, and water vapour coexist in equilibrium - a state known as the triple point of water was chosen as this temperature can be accurately and reproducibly measured. It was assigned the value 273.16 K.

So the interval between the two fixed points is 273.16 K. If you remember the basic SI unit for temperature, does this strike a bell? The kelvin, unit of thermodynamic temperature, is the fraction 1/273.16 of the thermodynamic temperature of the triple point of water.

#### Other Absolute Scales

The ideal gas scale represents a big advancement as it relies on the universal property of any gas under ideal behaviour (rather than on a particular gas). It is hence an absolute scale.

_Thermodynamic Scale_

Another absolute scale known is the _Thermodynamic Scale_. It is based on the theoretical efficiency of a perfectly reversible heat engine. This engine can work on any working fluid hence this is the foundation for an absolute scale (as opposed to an empirical scale).

The thermodynamic scale is equivalent to the ideal gas scale.

_Celsius Scale_

If the temperature of ice is 0\({}^{\circ}\) on the Centigrade Scale (most of us roughly have an idea how cold it is), then on the thermodynamic scale, it would be 273.15 K which is a totally unfamiliar number to most people. To make the numbers on the thermodynamic scale resemble those in the empirical scale more familiar to us, an arithmetical adjustment is made to it and the _Celsius Scale_ is created. Thus the Celsius Scale is actually a "displaced" Thermodynamic Scale made to look like the familiar Centigrade Scale. Note that Celsius is an absolute scale designed to produce the temperature readout like the (familiar) empirical Centigrade Scale.

To convert temperature measured in degree Celsius (_Celsius Scale_) to kelvin (_Thermodynamic Scale_):

T/K = f/oC + 273.15

## 2 Specific Heat Capacity and Internal Energy

### Heat Transfer

We have talked about the concept of heat transfer between two systems being driven by the temperature difference between them. In this section, we will focus on quantifying this amount of heat. Heat transfer can potentially affect the state of matter. We know that matter normally exists as either a solid, a liquid or a gas.

The formula to quantify the amount of heat depends on:

i) the physical state (or phase) of the object, and

ii) whether the object undergoes a change in phase.

Below shows changes in phase without a change in temperature.

The **specific heat capacity** of a substance \(c\) is the energy per unit mass required to raise the temperature of the substance by one unit of temperature.

Sl unit : J kg-1

The **specific latent heat of fusion \(L_{r}\)** is defined as the _enerv per unit mass_ required to change a substance from solid to liquid _without a change in temperature_.

Sl unit : J kg-1

The **specific latent heat of vaporisation**\(L_{r}\) is defined as the _enerv per unit mass_ required to change a substance from liquid to gas _without a change in temperature_.

Sl unit : J kg-1

_solid \(\rightarrow\) liquid \(\rightarrow\) gas \(\rightarrow\) heat absorbed gas \(\rightarrow\) liquid \(\rightarrow\) solid \(\rightarrow\) heat lost_

### Conservation of Energy

Heat transfer is one form of energy transfer. Hence to solve any problem involving heat transfer, we always consider conservation of energy, presented in a simple word equation as follows:

**Total energy or power supplied = total energy/power consumed + energy/power lost**

It is important for us to identify the supplier and consumer of energy/power during the energy exchange.

_Example 1_

Suppose 0.400 kg of water initially at 40.0 \({}^{\circ}\)C is poured into a 0.300 kg glass beaker having a temperature of 25.0 \({}^{\circ}\)C. A 0.500 kg block of aluminum at 37.0 \({}^{\circ}\)C is placed in the water and the system is insulated. Calculate the final equilibrium temperature of the system. [37.8 \({}^{\circ}\)C]

Specific heat capacities of water, glass and aluminum are 4186, 837 and 900 J kg\({}^{-1}\) K\({}^{-1}\) respectively.

_Example 2_

A 5.00 kg block of ice at 0 \({}^{\circ}\)C is added to an insulated container partially filled with 10.0 kg of water at 15.0 \({}^{\circ}\)C.

(a) Find the final temperature, neglecting the heat capacity of the container. [0 \({}^{\circ}\)C]

(b) Find the mass of the ice that has melted. [1.89 kg]

Specific heat capacity of water is 4186 J kg\({}^{-1}\) K\({}^{-1}\), specific latent heat of fusion of ice is 3.33 x 10\({}^{5}\) J kg\({}^{-1}\)

**Example 3**: In an electrical method to determine the specific latent heat of vaporisation of a liquid, the liquid was heated by means of a heating coil and the steady-state quantities measured under two different operating conditions are given:

\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|}  & Trial 1 & Trial 2 \\ \hline Current in heating coil & 2.5 A & 3.0 A \\ Potential difference across coil & 15.0 V & 18.0 V \\ Mass of liquid vaporised in \(t\) = 250 s & 38.5 g & 59.6 g \\ \end{tabular}

(a) Calculate the specific latent heat of vaporisation of the liquid. [1.95 x 10\({}^{5}\) J kg\({}^{\text{-}}\)]

(b) Estimate the rate of loss of heat to the surroundings. [7.39 W]

### Microscopic View of Energy

What type of changes will occur to a system when heat enters or leaves its boundary? To answer this question, we need to adopt a microscopic view of our system. The internal mechanism of a system is explained by the kinetic theory of matter - it states that all matter is made up of a large number of tiny atoms or molecules which are in continuous motion.

A neat way to present the molecular information of a system is to use the concept of energy - in this case, energy related to the molecules within the boundary of our system. At the molecular level, we are concerned primarily with two types of energy:

1. the kinetic energy due to the random movement of the molecules - microscopic kinetic energy, and
2. the potential energy among molecules due to the intermolecular forces between them - microscopic potential energy. Gases have zero potential energy (or close enough to zero for real gases and zero for ideal gases). In relation to this, solids and liquids have negative potential energy. When heat is supplied to a solid or liquid, potential energy increases, so the value of potential energy becomes less negative and gets closer to zero.

#### Internal Energy

Energy is a scalar quantity. If we sum up all the above two types of energy for all molecules within the boundary of our system, the result of this summation is known as the _internal energy_.

The internal energy \(U\) is the summation of microscopic kinetic energy due to random motion of the molecules and the microscopic potential energy due to intermolecular forces.

#### Microscopic Kinetic Energies

_Due to the random movement of molecules._

_The microscopic potential energies arise from intermolecular forces between the molecules_

_Average microscopic K.E. of the molecules_

_\(\propto\) Absolute temperature of the system._

Using this concept of internal energy and its associated concepts, we can explain the following:

1. At different phases, the molecules within the system exhibit different characteristics. The existence of three phases of matter is determined primarily by the intermolecular forces and the type of motion which the molecules will have because of their internal energy.
2. The temperature of a body is a measure of the _average kinetic energy_ of the molecules that make up the body. Increases in this microscopic kinetic energy of a body can be detected by a rise in its temperature. Increases in microscopic potential energy, on the other hand, does not result in any rise in temperature. This is most dramatically demonstrated by boiling water; despite all the heat being supplied, the reading on the thermometer remains constant.

We are now ready to explain what heat transfer does to our system.

The diagram below shows how the temperature of a solid varies as heat is transferred to it at some initial temperature below its melting point as it turns into a liquid and then into a gas over time.

We can easily explain the feature of this graph using the concept of internal energy.

Note that as time progresses, heat is continuously supplied to the same matter in every part of the graph above.

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|} \hline
**Part** & **Phase** & **Temperature** & **K.E.mic** & **P.E.mic** & **Internal Energy** \\ \hline
**A** & Solid & Increases & Increases & Marginal change & Increases \\ \hline
**B** & Solid-liquid & Constant at melting point & Constant & Increases & Increases \\ \hline
**C** & Liquid & Increases & Increases & Marginal change & Increases \\ \hline
**D** & Liquid-Gas & Constant at boiling point & Constant & Increases & Increases \\ \hline
**E** & Gas & Increases & Increases & Increases & Increases \\ \hline \end{tabular}

## 3 Ideal Gas

_Kinetic Theory_

The kinetic theory of matter states that all matter is made up of a large number of tiny atoms or molecules which are in continuous motion. We can explain the three phases of matter and their various macroscopic properties in terms of the behaviour of their constituent molecules (microscopic properties).

_Why Study Ideal Gases_

The study of the three phases of matter is not an easy task as it involves various branches of knowledge in physics like mechanics (whether classical or quantum) and statistics etc. Among the three phases of matter, the gaseous phase presents itself as the easiest one to be studied especially when the gas molecules are spaced far apart from each other and not interacting with each other. Hence we will attempt to explain some macroscopic properties of such a gas via the collective behaviour of the gas molecules. This simplified gas system is known as the **ideal gas** and it has the following microscopic properties:

_Assumptions/Properties of an Ideal Gas_

1. A gas consists of a very large number of molecules.
2. The gas molecules are moving randomly.
3. Collisions of the gas molecules with one another and with the walls of the container are perfectly elastic.
4. There are no intermolecular forces of attraction.
5. The volume of the gas molecules is negligible, compared to the volume of the container, which is the volume of the gas.
6. The duration of collisions is negligible, compared to the time interval between collisions.

_Ideal Gas Equation of State_

For an ideal gas, the equation of state is:

\[\begin{array}{l}pV=\ nRT\end{array}\]

which can be expressed as \(pV=\ NkT\), since \(R=\ kN_{A}\),

where

pressure \(p\), volume \(V\), absolute temperature \(T\), amount of ideal gas in moles \(n\), amount of ideal gas in number of molecules \(N\), molar gas constant \(R=8.31\) J K\({}^{-1}\) mol\({}^{-1}\) and Boltzmann constant \(k=1.38\) x \(10^{-23}\) J K\({}^{-1}\) are linked.

### A Really Huge Number - The Avogadro Number, \(N\)

In the microscopic regime, we are going to deal with a large number of molecules. In fact, one mole of any substance is that amount of substance that contains 6.02 x \(10^{23}\) of constituent particles (whether atoms, molecules or ions).

6.02 x \(10^{23}\) is known as the Avogadro's number \(N_{A}\). If we are given 0.012 kg of carbon-12, there will be 6.02 x \(10^{23}\) of atoms in it - this is the technical definition of the Avogadro's number. Similarly, in the case of helium-4 atoms, its molar mass is 4.0 x \(10^{-3}\) kg. If we are given 4.0 x \(10^{-3}\) kg of helium gas, we know that there are \(6.02\times 10^{23}\) helium-4 atoms in it. In the case of oxygen gas, we have to be a bit more careful because oxygen gas is made up of oxygen molecules (two oxygen atoms). So one mole of oxygen gas contains \(6.02\times 10^{23}\) oxygen molecules and this gas has a mass of 32 g.

\[\begin{array}{l}number\ of\ mole,n=\ \ \frac{mass\ of\ sample}{Molar\ mass\ of\ sample}\end{array}\]

Looking at the periodic table, you would have noticed that the molar mass of each ATOM very closely resembles the mass number of that atom (the number of protons and neutrons).

Note that \(R\), \(k\) and \(N_{A}\) are provided in the constants list.

**Example 4**

Show numerically that \(k\) is related to \(R\) via \(k\ =\ \frac{R}{N_{A}}\).

**Example 5**

A cylinder, 0.50 m long and of cross-sectional area S, closed at each end, is fitted with a smooth thermally insulating piston, separating two gases **A** and **B** into two compartments as shown.

Initially, the piston is in equilibrium at a distance of 0.20 m from one end of the cylinder, and the gas in each compartment is at a temperature of 27 \({}^{\circ}\)C.

The temperature of the smaller volume of gas, **A**, is now increased to 177 \({}^{\circ}\)C, while that of the gas in the larger volume **B** is maintained at 27 \({}^{\circ}\)C. The piston moves through a distance \(x\) until a new position of equilibrium is obtained.

1. State the equation relating the initial and final pressures, volumes and temperatures of the gas in **A**.
2. State the equation relating the initial and final pressures, volumes and temperatures of the gas in **B**.
3. Hence find the new position of equilibrium. [0.25 m from the left]

### Molecular Interpretation of Pressure

#### How Kinetic Theory Explains the Nature of Pressure Exerted by Gas

According to the kinetic theory, a gas confined in a container is made up of a large number of gas molecules moving randomly and colliding with each other as well as with the walls of the container.

When the gas molecules collide elastically with the container of the gas, they rebound off the wall with the same speed. Clearly, the walls of the container exert a force on the gas molecules to cause their momentum to change in direction. By Newton's 2\({}^{nd}\) Law, this force is equal to the rate of change of momentum of the molecule. By Newton's 3\({}^{rd}\) Law, the molecules exert an equal but opposite force on the walls.

Since there is a large number of molecules, the number of collisions at any instant is very large and practically constant, resulting in a constant gas pressure.

The **pressure by the gas on the container** is the **average force per unit area exerted by the molecules on the walls of the container.**

The pressure \(P\) due to the gas molecules on a wall of the container can be written as

\[P = \frac{\text{average force exerted on the wall by molecules}}{\text{area of the wall}}\] \[= \frac{\text{(no. of collisions per unit time)(change of momentum per collision)}}{\text{area of the wall}}\]

We can now explain how the following factors can lead to an increase in pressure of a gas:

* **No. of molecules in the container.** All other conditions being constant, a larger number of molecules will imply more collisions made with the wall of the container.
* **Volume of container.** Having a smaller container implies that the molecules need to travel less distance to reach the next wall after rebounding from the opposite wall. Therefore, the no. of collisions they make with the walls per unit time increases.
* **Mass of the molecule.** The type of gas used will determine the mass of a molecule which in turn determines the momentum that each molecule possesses. The larger the mass of a molecule, the greater the momentum it will have. Thus, the change of momentum of the molecules per collision will be greater.
* **Velocities of the molecules.** The momentum of each gas molecule is determined by its velocity. A molecule possessing a larger velocity will have a greater momentum and hence its change in momentum will correspondingly be larger per collision.

#### Example:

There are equal numbers of molecules at the same temperature in each of the enclosed containers as shown. As the volume of the gas decreases, the number of molecules per unit volume increases. The number of molecules striking a given area of the walls per unit time also increases. Thus increasing the force on that area. This force per unit area is the pressure and hence the pressure increases.

#### 3.2.1 Derivation of \(pV=\frac{1}{3}\ Nm\left<c^{2}\right>\)

We shall attempt to relate the macroscopic quantity, pressure, with the microscopic model of gases as a collection of atoms moving in random motion in a vessel.

[_Need to know the derivation of the relationship \(pV=\frac{1}{3}\ Nm\left<c^{2}\right>\)_ as stated in LO_]

**Step 1 Resolve the motion of molecule along \(x\)-\(y\)-\(z\) directions**

Consider a gas of \(N\) molecules in a cubical container of side \(L\) (Fig. F1). Suppose the mass of a molecule is \(m\). Consider a molecule moving with a velocity \(c_{1}\). The velocity \(c_{1}\) of the molecule can be resolved into \(x\), \(y\) and \(z\) directions as \(u_{1}\), \(v_{1}\) and \(w_{1}\) respectively.

Using Pythagoras' theorem, \(c_{1}^{\ 2}=u_{1}^{\ 2}+\nu_{1}^{\ 2}+w_{1}^{\ 2}\).

**Step 2 Find the change of momentum upon collision with a wall**

Consider the component of velocity \(v_{I}\) along the positive \(y\)-axis. After colliding with the wall A, the molecule rebounds with a velocity \(-v_{I}\) since the collision is perfectly elastic.

\begin{tabular}{l l} Momentum before collision & = \(mv_{I}\) \\ Momentum after collision & = \(-mv_{1}\) \\ \(:\). change of momentum & = \(-mv_{1}\) -\(mv_{1}\) \\  & = \(-2mv_{1}\) \\ \end{tabular}

**Step 3 Find the average force on the wall due to the bombardment of molecules on the wall**

Assuming that the molecule does not collide with other molecules, the time interval \(t\) between a collision of the molecule with the wall A and its next collision with the same wall is the same as the time the molecule takes to move from wall A to wall B and back and is given by:

\[\Delta t=\frac{2L}{v_{1}}\]

Hence, the number of collisions made by the molecule with wall A per unit time \(=\frac{1}{\Delta t}=\frac{v_{1}}{2L}\)

the average force exerted on the molecule by wall A \(=\frac{\Delta(mv)}{\Delta t}=-2mv_{1}\times\frac{v_{1}}{2L}=-\frac{mv_{1}^{ \ 2}}{L}\)By Newton's 3\({}^{\text{rd}}\) Law, the force exerted on wall A by the molecule = \(\dfrac{mv_{1}^{2}}{L}\)

During its passage back and forth across the container, the molecule may collide with the top and bottom and sides of the container, but this does not alter its component of momentum and thus does not alter our result. It may also collide elastically with other molecules which may change its \(v_{l}\). However, any loss (or gain) of momentum is acquired by other molecules, and because we will eventually sum over all the molecules, this effect will be included. So our result above is not altered.

The actual force due to one molecule is a spike, but because a huge number of molecules are striking the wall per second, the force is, on average, nearly constant. To calculate the force due to all the molecules in the container, we have to add the contribution of each.

Since there are \(N\) molecules, each with the component of velocity along the \(y\)-axis as \(v_{1}\), \(v_{2}\), \(v_{3}\),..., \(v_{N}\) respectively, then the total force on wall A due to the collision of these \(N\) molecules is

\[F=\dfrac{mv_{1}^{2}}{L}+\dfrac{mv_{2}^{2}}{L}+\dfrac{mv_{3}^{2}}{L}+\dots+ \dfrac{mv_{N}^{2}}{L}\]

### Step 4

**Find the pressure on the wall**

Pressure on wall A,

\[p=\dfrac{F}{L^{2}}=\dfrac{\dfrac{mv_{1}^{2}}{L}+\dfrac{mv_{2}^{2}}{L}+\dfrac{ mv_{3}^{2}}{L}+\dots+\dfrac{mv_{N}^{2}}{L}}{L^{2}}=\dfrac{m}{L^{3}}\left(v_{1}^{2 }+v_{2}^{2}+v_{3}^{2}+\dots+v_{N}^{2}\right)\]

where \(L^{3}\) = volume of container.

Let \(V=L^{3}\)

Since \(v_{1}^{2}+v_{2}^{2}+v_{3}^{2}+...v_{N}^{2}=N\left\langle v^{2}\right\rangle\), \(p=\dfrac{Nm\left\langle v^{2}\right\rangle}{V}\)

### Step 5

**Express \(\left\langle v^{2}\right\rangle\) along the y-axis in terms of mean-square speed \(\left\langle c^{2}\right\rangle\)**

Each molecule has a different velocity. Following the square speed equation (using Pythagoras' theorem) for a molecule in Step 1, we denote the square speed equations for \(N\) molecules in the container as follows:

\(c_{1}^{2}=u_{1}^{2}+v_{1}^{2}+w_{1}^{2}\)

\(c_{2}^{2}=u_{2}^{2}+v_{2}^{2}+w_{2}^{2}\)

\(c_{N}^{2}=u_{N}^{2}+v_{N}^{2}+w_{N}^{2}\)

Adding all \(N\) square speed equations and dividing by \(N\), we have

\[\dfrac{c_{1}^{2}+c_{2}^{2}+c_{3}^{2}+\dots+c_{N}^{2}}{N}=\dfrac{u_{1}^{2}+u_{ 2}^{2}+u_{3}^{2}+\dots+u_{N}^{2}}{N}+\dfrac{v_{1}^{2}+v_{2}^{2}+v_{3}^{2}+ \dots+v_{N}^{2}}{N}+\dfrac{w_{1}^{2}+w_{2}^{2}+w_{3}^{2}+\dots+w_{N}^{2}}{N}\]

## 4 State of A System

We started this topic by introducing the concept of a system. If a system is not undergoing any change, the set of all the properties that can be measured or calculated throughout the entire system will specify the condition of this system. We call this the state of the system.

For this course, there are a few properties of a system that we are interested in: pressure \(p\), volume \(V\), temperature \(T\), internal energy \(U\).

_pV Diagram_

One way to monitor how a system changes its state is to chart the properties on a diagram. One such diagram is known as an indicator diagram. We will use mainly the pressure vs volume graph (pV diagram). A point on the pV diagram indicates a particular state of the system.

_Process_

A process occurs when a system changes from one state to another state. In our course, we indicate a process using a line with an arrow that connects the initial state to the final state.

### First Law of Thermodynamics

The study of any system is centred on the concept of energy conservation. We will now develop this concept in the context of thermodynamics.

Here are the two forms of energy we have dealt with so far:

\begin{tabular}{l l}
1) & Heat transfer \(Q\) \\
2) & Internal energy \(U\) \\ \end{tabular} We have shown that if heat enters or leaves the boundary of a system, the internal energy could change.

So the first link between these two forms of energy could be: \(\Delta U\ =\ Q\)

A positive sign for \(Q\) means heat enters the system and the internal energy \(U\) increases (leading to a positive sign for \(\Delta U\)).

This link between \(\Delta U\) and \(Q\) may appear correct. However it is incomplete. Your experience would have told you that the internal energy could change even when there is no heat flow. Can you describe one?

There are certainly other forms of energy transfer (other than heat) that could affect the internal energy.

We use the term 'work' (symbol \(W\)) to represent these alternative energy transfers.

So our energy transformation relationship becomes: \(\Delta U\ =\ Q\ +\ W\)

This is known as the _First Law of Thermodynamics_:

The increase in the internal energy of a system is the sum of the heat supplied to the system and the work done on the system.

We will limit work \(W\) mainly to the energy transfer via some form of force or pressure.

Remember that in mechanics, if a force \(F\) acting on a system causes the point of application to move by a distance \(x\) in the direction of \(F\), we say that positive work \(Fx\) is done on the system. So there is an attempt by the agent exerting the force \(F\) to transfer energy of magnitude \(Fx\) into the system.

This can be applied to a gas system.

Suppose an external pressure \(P_{ext}\) is exerted on a gas and the gas is compressed by a tiny distance \(x\) at constant cross-sectional area \(A\). In this case, work done by external agent, \(W\ =\ +P_{ext}(Ax)\ =\ +P_{ext}V\).

One immediate advantage of using a \(\mathrm{pV}\) diagram is that it allows us to visualize the work done \(W\) on our system. The magnitude of \(W\) for any process is the area between the line due to this process and the volume axis. How about the sign of \(W\)? If the system contracts (volume decreases), \(W\) is positive and vice versa.

_Summary of Each Term in First Law of Thermodynamics & its sign convention_

The increase in the internal energy of a system is the sum of the heat supplied to the system and the work done on the system.

\(\Delta U\ =\ Q\ +\ W\)

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|} \hline  & \(\Delta U\) & \(\boldsymbol{Q}\) & \(\boldsymbol{W}\) \\ \hline \multirow{2}{*}{**Definition**} & Increase in internal energy & Heat energy supplied to & \\  & of system & system & Work done on system \\ \hline \multirow{2}{*}{**Sign**} & +: \(U\) increases & +: heat enters system & +: system contracts \\  & -: \(U\) decreases & -: heat leaves system & -: system expands \\ \hline \multirow{2}{*}{**magnitude**} & May be deduced from & May be deduced from & Area between \(\mathrm{pV}\) graph and \\  & question & question & V-axis \\ \hline \end{tabular}

### _Four Basic Thermodynamic Processes_

A system can change from one state to another via many processes. There are, however, four of them that are particularly well-known:

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|} \hline
**Process** & **Characteristic** \\ \hline Isothermal & Constant temperature \\ \hline Isovolumetric & Constant volume \\ \hline Adiabatic & No heat transfer (Q = 0) \\ \hline Isobaric & Constant pressure \\ \hline \end{tabular}

_Isothermal Process (Constant Temperature Process)_

Imagine an ideal gas undergoing isothermal expansion at constant temperature \(T_{1}\) from state \(i\) to state \(f\).

\[pV\ =\ nRT_{1}\ \ \ \Rightarrow\ \ p\ =\ \ (nRT_{1})\left(\frac{1}{V}\right)\]

Plotting \(p\) against \(V\) gives a reciprocal graph.

We have already proven that the internal energy of an ideal gas is a function of its absolute temperature. Hence internal energy of an ideal gas remains constant during an isothermal process; i.e. \(\Delta U\ =\ 0\).

To maintain constant temperature throughout the process, the expansion or compression should be done in a good conductor, and very slowly, to allow for effective heat exchange with the surroundings and hence for temperature to stay constant.

By the first law of thermodynamics, \(Q\ =\ -W\)

Magnitude of \(W\) is represented by the shaded area under the graph.

_Isovolumetric Process (Constant Volume Process)_

This process is represented by a vertical line on a PV diagram.

Clearly the area under an infinitesimally thin line is zero.

Hence \(W\ =\ 0\).

\(\Delta U\ =\ Q\)

Applying First Law: \(Q\ =\ \Delta U\ >\ 0\)

i.e. heat is supplied to the gas to increase internal energy.

_Adiabatic Process (No Heat Transfer Process)_

As the name implies, \(Q~{}=~{}0\).

\(\Delta U~{}=~{}W\)

Magnitude of \(W\) is represented by the shaded area under the graph.

Two ways to achieve an adiabatic process is by _insulating_ the system or performing the process _rapidly_ (contrast this to an isothermal process).

_Isobaric Process (Constant Pressure Process)_

An isobaric process is represented by a horizontal line on a PV diagram.

The magnitude of \(W\) can be computed from the rectangular area under the graph.

\(\Delta U~{}=~{}Q~{}\pm~{}(area\ of\ rectangular\ area)\)

Example: The p-V graph shows gas expansion at constant pressure.

\(\Delta V\) > 0 \(\Rightarrow\) work done on gas is negative, \(W\) < 0

\(T_{f}\) > \(T_{i}\) \(\Rightarrow\) \(\Delta U\) > 0

Applying First Law: \(Q\) = \(\Delta U\) - \(W\)

Heat is supplied to the gas to increase internal energy and allow gas to expand, to do work against the atmosphere.

### Cyclic Process

A series of processes that eventually returns a system to its initial state is called a cyclic process. On the PV diagram on the right, the system starts from state \(1\), undergoes a process \(A\) to state \(2\) and goes back to state \(1\) via another process \(B\).

_Net Change in Internal Energy_

Since the internal energy depends only on the state (i.e. the position on a PV diagram), the overall change in internal energy for a cyclic process must be zero; i.e. \((\overline{\Delta U})_{net}=(\Delta U)_{A\to B}+(\Delta U)_{B\to A}~{}=~{}0\)

_Net Work Done on System_

Since work done on the system \(W\) is given by the area under the graph, it is easy to see that

\begin{tabular}{|c|l|} \hline Process & Work done on the system, \(W\) \\ \hline _A (expansion)_ & \(W_{A}~{}=~{}-|\)Area under graph \(A|\) \\ \hline _B (compression)_ & \(W_{B}~{}=~{}+|\)Area under graph \(B|\) \\ \hline _A and B_ & \(W_{net}~{}=~{}-|\)Area enclosed in the cycle \\ \hline \end{tabular}

_Net Heat Transfer_

Applying the first law of thermodynamics to the cyclic process: \((\Delta U)_{net}~{}=~{}Q_{net}~{}+~{}W_{net}\)

\[Q_{net}~{}~{}=~{}-W_{net}\]

Hence for this cycle, there is a net heat transfer into the system. Deduce for yourself that if the cyclic process were in the opposite direction, there would be a net heat transfer out of the system.

**Example 8**: A quantity of 4.00 moles of a monatomic ideal gas expands from an initial volume of 0.100 m\({}^{3}\) and pressure of \(1.0\times 10^{5}\) Pa to a final volume of 0.300 m\({}^{3}\) and pressure of \(2.5\times 10^{5}\) Pa. Compute the **a)**: work done on the gas, **b)**: change in internal energy of the gas, and **c)**: thermal energy transferred to the gas. **Example 9**: A gas is taken through the cyclic process described in the figure. Find the net energy transferred to the system by heat during one complete cycle. [12000 J]

## Appendix A Temperature Measurement & Temperature Scales

### Thermometric Properties

Therometers are devices for measuring temperature. All thermometers are based on some material's thermometric property. A thermometric property is a physical quantity which varies continuously with temperature in a repeatable manner.

\begin{tabular}{|p{56.9pt}|p{56.9pt}|p{56.9pt}|p{56.9pt}|} \hline
**Thermometer** & 
\begin{tabular}{c} **Thermometric** \\ **Property** \\ \end{tabular} & \multicolumn{2}{c|}{**Advantages (+) / Disadvantages (-)**} \\ \hline Liquid-in-glass thermometer & Length of liquid in a capillary & + & Portable, cheap, simple to use, direct reading \\ \hline Thermocouple thermometer & E.m.f. between junctions of a wire at different temperatures & + & Wide range, small, robust and compact, quick response, widely used in industry for measuring rapidly changing temperatures and temperatures at a 'point'. \\ \hline Thermistor semiconductor & Resistance of a semiconductor & + & Can be linked directly to other circuits or computer. \\ \hline Platinum resistance resistance thermometer & Resistance of a coil of wire & + & Wide range, highly accurate, sensitive. \\ \hline Constant-volume gas thermometer & Pressure of a fixed mass of gas at constant volume & - & No direct reading, slow in response, not suitable for varying temperatures. \\ \hline Pyrometer & Colour displayed will vary with temperature & - & Very wide range, very accurate and sensitive, can be used as a standard to calibrate other thermometers. \\ \hline \end{tabular}

Other than thermometric property, a thermometer also need two more components to produce meaningful indication of temperature:

* some references known as fixed points.
* a set of number assigned to the thermometric property

Once these three components are in place, we have established a **Temperature Scale**, a set of number (with appropriate units) that is commonly understood to represent certain temperatures. For example a number 40 (degree centigrade) that appears in your oral digital thermometer after you have taken out of your mouth indicates that your fever has not subsided.

## Appendix B Empirical Scale

_Calibrating A Thermometer To Read Temperature On Centigrade Scale_

We will first illustrate one simple temperature scale here and explain how it is established.

\begin{tabular}{c} _Fixed mass of gas_ \\ _enclosed in tube of_ \\ _constant cross-_ \\ _sectional area._ \\ _Gas submerged into liquid_ \\ _both kept at a fixed_ \\ _temperature. Length of_ \\ _gas column is_ \(L\)_._ \\ _Mercury to keep_ \\ _the pressure of gas_ \\ _constant._ \\ \end{tabular}

i)In 1781, Jacques Charles discovered that under certain conditions, the volume of a given mass of gas is related to its temperature if its pressure is constant. This is the well-known Charles's law. Hence the volume of such a gas is a thermometric property. If this gas is kept in a tube of constant cross-section area as shown, the length \(L\) of the gas is related to the temperature.

ii)Allow this system to reach thermal equilibrium with pure melting ice. Measure the length of gas and called it \(L_{0}\). We can arbitrarily assign a number to represent the temperature of this pure melting ice but historically people have commonly use the number zero. The temperature represented by this number zero is known as ice point. This is one of the fixed points. So we say that the thermometric property has the length \(L_{0}\) at 0.

iii)We need another reference (fixed point). Allow this system to attain thermal equilibrium with steam from boiling water at standard atmospheric pressure at sea level (defined as 101.325 kilopascals). Measure the length of gas and let it be \(L_{100}\). For the same reason, we assign number 100 to represent this temperature which is also known as steam point. The thermometric property has length \(L_{100}\) at 100.

iv)We now have information on the thermometric properties at two different situations - melting ice and boiling water. How about any other temperature? We can of course use different objects at different temperatures to calibrate the length of the gas. But what if we don't. We can simply ASSUME a linear relationship joining the two references we have.

v)Using the tube of gas together with the calibration graph, we can tell the temperature of any unknown object \(\theta\) by allowing this gas to attain thermal equilibrium with it, measure its length \(L_{0}\) and read the corresponding temperature \(\theta\) from the graph. It is not difficult to show mathematically that

If we calibrate our thermometer in this way, the numbers that represent the temperature will take the unit degree configrade and we say this thermometer measure temperature in _Centigrade Scale_.

### Review of Basic Concepts

#### Electrical Charges

Many of us could have encountered such an experiment in our secondary school years. When a glass rod that has been rubbed with a silk cloth is brought near another rubber rod which has been rubbed with fur, they attract each other. However, when two rubber rods which have been rubbed with fur are brought together, they repel each other (Fig. 1).

2.1 **There are two kinds of charges - positive charge and negative charge.** These labels are _arbitrary_, i.e. there is no particular reason why positive charges are called positive charges and not negative charges. (It was later discovered that electrons carry negative charge while protons carry positive charge.)

2.2 **Charges of the same sign repel one another.** Charges with opposite signs attract one another.

#### 1.2.3 **Atomic Structure**

All materials are made up of atoms. The structure of atoms can be described in terms of three particles - the negatively charged electron, the positively charged proton and the neutral neutron.

The protons and neutrons in an atom make up a small, very dense core called the **nucleus**, which is approximately 10-15 m in size (Fig. 2). Surrounding the nucleus are electrons, extending out to distances of approximately 10-10 m from the nucleus. These negatively charged electrons orbit the nucleus and the attractive electrical force on the electrons by the protons provides the force required to keep the electrons in orbit.

2.4 **The electrical charge** and the **mass** of the electrons, protons and neutrons are given in the table below:

\({}^{*}e\) is known as the fundamental charge or the elementary charge.

Figure 1: (a) A negatively charged rubber rod is attracted to a positively charged glass rod. (b) A negatively charged rubber rod is repelled by another negatively charged rubber rod. (Jewett & Serway, 2008)

Figure 2: The structure of an atom. The particular atom depicted here is lithium. (Young & Freedman, 2007)

### Neutral Atoms, Positive Ions and Negative Ions

A **neutral atom** is one in which the **number of electrons equals the number of protons**. If one or more electrons are removed from this atom, the atom becomes positively charged and is known as a **positive ion**. A **negative ion** is an atom that has _gained_ one or more electrons. This process of gaining or losing electrons is called **ionisation**.

Furthermore, when the total number of protons in a body equals the number of electrons in the body, the total charge is zero and the body is on the whole electrically neutral. To charge a body negatively, we add electrons to the originally neutral body so that it has excess negative charges. Similarly, to positively charge a body, we can remove electrons. Hence, when we speak of charge of a body, we always mean its net charge.

### Principles of Conservation and Quantisation of Charge

Implicit to the discussion above are two principles:

* Principle of Conservation of Charge
* Principle of Quantisation of Charge

**The _principle of conservation of charge_ states that charge cannot be created or destroyed_. Hence, for any closed system, the algebraic sum of all electric charges must be constant. For example, suppose we rub a plastic rod with a piece of fur, both initially uncharged. The plastic rod acquires a positive charge and the fur a negative charge. The principle of conservation of charge tells us that the positive charge acquired by the rod must be equal in magnitude to the charge on the fur. The rod has acquired a positive charge as it has transferred its electrons to the fur. Hence, in the charging process, charge is not created or destroyed; it is merely _transferred_ from one body to another.

**The _principle of quantisation of charge_ states that electric charge always occurs as **integral multiples of a fundamental amount of charge e which is also known as the elementary charge.** Charges are therefore said to be quantized1, i.e. any charge \(q\) must be equal to \(\pm Ne\)  where \(N\) is some positive integer. This was discovered in 1909 by Robert Millikan (1868 - 1953)2.

Footnote 1: “Quantum” means “smallest discrete quantity”. Thus, if something is quantised, it comes in (multiples of) _fixed amounts_.

Footnote 2: See [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oil_drop_experiment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oil_drop_experiment)

Figure 3: (a) A neutral lithium atom has equal number of protons and electrons. (b) A positive lithium ion has a deficit of electrons. (c) A negative ion has an excess of electrons. (Young & Freedman, 2007)

### The Electric Field

How do objects not in contact with each other affect each other's behaviour? How does a proton exert a pull on an electron at a distance? To explain 'action at a distance', physicists developed the idea of a **field**. You have learnt about the gravitational field that results from the presence of a mass. In this chapter you will learn about the electric field, which comes about due to the presence of charge.

The electric force between charged objects is an example of action at a distance. One charged object exerts a force on another even though they are not in physical contact. Object A sets up a (force) field in the space around it. When a second object B is in the field set up by A, object B experiences a force as it is in the field set up by A, it also generates an electric field around itself and hence A experiences a force by B as it is in the electric field set up by B.

#### 12.2.1 Electric Field Strength

**Definition: Electric Field Strength, \(E\)**

The electric field strength \(E\)**at a point** is the electric force per unit _positive_ charge acting on a **small test charge** placed at the point.

\[E=\frac{F}{q}\]

Electric field strength is a **vector quantity**.

The _direction of the electric field_ at a point is the **direction of the electric force experienced by a positive test charge** if placed at that point.

The S.I. unit of electric field strength is newton per coulomb (N C\({}^{-1}\)).

Rearranging the equation above,

\[F=qE\]

Therefore:

* the **magnitude of the force** on the charge placed in the field is given by \(F=\left|qE\right|\)
* The **direction of the force on the charge is the same as that of** the electric field at the point if the charge \(q\)**is positive**.
* The **direction of the force on the charge is opposite to that of** the electric field if the charge \(q\)**is negative**.

Figure 4: When the charged object B is placed in the electric field set up by charged object A, it experiences a force. Similarly, A experiences a force as it is in the field of B. (Young & Freedman, 2007)

**Example 1**

An isolated electron (in a vacuum) near the surface of the earth was found to be accelerating directly away from the surface with an acceleration \(a\) = 2.63 x 10\({}^{6}\) m s\({}^{-2}\).

[elementary charge, \(e\) = 1.60 x 10\({}^{-19}\) C, mass of the electron, \(m_{e}\) = 9.11 x 10\({}^{-31}\) kg]

(a) What is the direction of the electric field near the surface of the earth at the location of the electron?

(b) Calculate the magnitude of the electric field near the surface.

#### 12.2.2 Electric Field Lines

Just as for a gravitational field, field lines are used to represent an electric field.

The electric field lines must be able to represent the variations in the **magnitude** and **direction** of the electric field in a region of space:

* **Magnitude of the Strength of the Electric Field:*
* The _number of field lines per unit area_, through a surface perpendicular to the lines, is proportional to the _magnitude_ of the electric field.
* Hence, where the lines are close together, the electric field is strong, while where the lines are far apart, the field is weak (Fig. 6).
* **Direction of the Electric Field:*
* The _direction of the electric field strength \(E\)_ **at a point in an electric field is tangent to the electric field line at that point (Fig. 7). It is the direction of the force experienced by a positive charge if placed at that point.
* **Rules for Drawing Electric Field Lines3:*
* Electric field lines are directed from higher potential (more positive) to lower potential (more negative). Footnote 3: There are also rules associated with drawing field lines from equipotential lines. We will cover that in a later section and summarize all the rules there (see pg 25)
* The number of lines drawn leaving a positive charge or approaching a negative charge is proportional to the magnitude of the charge. Footnote 3: The _number of lines drawn leaving a positive charge_ or _approaching a negative charge_ is proportional to the magnitude of the charge. Footnote 4: The _number of lines drawn leaving a positive charge_ or _approaching a negative charge_ is proportional to the magnitude of the charge. Footnote 5: Field lines do not intersect because \(E\) at a point can only point in one direction.
* **Direction of the Electric Field:*
* The _direction of the electric field strength \(E\)_ **at a point in an electric field is tangent to the electric field line at that point (Fig. 7). It is the direction of the force experienced by a positive charge if placed at that point.
* **Rules for Drawing Electric Field Lines**3:*
* Electric field lines are directed from higher potential (more positive) to lower potential (more negative). Footnote 3: There are also rules associated with drawing field lines from equipotential lines. We will cover that in a later section and summarize all the rules there (see pg 25)
* The _number of lines drawn leaving a positive charge_ or _approaching a negative charge_ is proportional to the magnitude of the charge. Footnote 4: The _number of lines drawn leaving a positive charge_ or _approaching a negative charge_ is proportional to the magnitude of the charge. Footnote 5: Field lines do not intersect because \(E\) at a point can only point in one direction.
* **Direction of the Electric Field:*
* The _direction of the electric field strength \(E\)_ **at a point in an electric field is tangent to the electric field line at that point (Fig. 7). It is the direction of the force experienced by a positive charge if placed at that point.
* **Rules for Drawing Electric Field Lines**3:*
* Electric field lines are directed from higher potential (more positive) to lower potential (more negative). Footnote 3: There are also rules associated with drawing field lines from equipotential lines. We will cover that in a later section and summarize all the rules there (see pg 25)
Electric field lines are not real. They are only used as a pictorial representation to provide a qualitative description of the electric field. Only a finite number of lines from each charge can be drawn, which makes it appear as if the field only exists in certain parts. The field, in fact, is continuous, existing at every point in space.

#### 12.2.3 Force between Two Point Charges (Coulomb's Law)

As stated earlier, when a charge \(Q_{i}\) is placed near another charge \(Q_{2}\), each of them will experience a force as they are in the field set up by the other charge. If \(Q_{i}\) and \(Q_{2}\) are point charges, the magnitude of the force can be determined by **Coulomb's Law**.

**Coulomb's Law**

The magnitude of the electrical force acting between two point charges is proportional to the product of the magnitude of the charges and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them.

\[\boxed{F=\frac{1}{4\pi\varepsilon_{0}}\frac{Q_{i}Q_{2}}{r^{2}}}\]

where \(F\) : magnitude of the force between charges \(Q_{i}\) and \(Q_{2}\)

\(\varepsilon_{0}\) : permittivity of free space, and

\(r\) : the distance between \(Q_{2}\) and \(Q_{2}\)

**Notes:**

**(i)**: There is one force acting on \(Q_{i}\) and another force acting on \(Q_{2}\). These two forces are an _(Newton's Third Law) action-and-reaction pair_.
**(ii)**: Permititivity:

In the S.I. system of units, the constant of proportionality in Coulomb's Law is usually written as _1/4\(\pi\varepsilon\)_. The constant \(\varepsilon\) is known as _permittivity_. Permititivity is a property of the medium, i.e. its value depends on the medium in which the charges are placed. If the space between the charges is _'free space'_ (or _vacuum_), its permittivity (known as permittivity of free space) will be denoted as \(\varepsilon_{0}\).

\[\boxed{\varepsilon_{0}=8.85\times 10^{-12}\text{ F m}^{-1}}\]

The S.I. unit for permittivity is farad (F) per meter (m). Farad is the unit for capacitance (which is not in the H2 syllabus). 1 F = 1 C V\({}^{-1}\).

For most practical purposes the permittivity of 'air' is the same as that of 'free space'.

When using Coulomb's Law, just **substitute the magnitude of the charges** (without the signs) to find the **magnitude of the force.**

Indicate the direction of the force (or whether it is attractive or repulsive) separately.

Figure 9: The force \(F\) between two point charges is determined by Coulomb’s Law.

### What happens if there are more than two charges?

The force between any two charges in a group of charges is independent of the presence of the other charges. Hence, when more than two charges are present, the force between any pair of them is still governed by Coulomb's law.

**The resultant force on any one of them is equal to the vector sum of the forces exerted by the other charges.**

For example, if four charges are present, the resultant force exerted by particles 2, 3 and 4 on particle 1 is given by

\[\vec{F}=\vec{F}_{12}+\vec{F}_{13}+\vec{F}_{14}\,.\]

**Example 2:**

Two small equal charges 2 x 10\({}^{8}\) C, one positively and the other negatively charged, are placed at A and B as shown in Fig. 10. AB is 6 cm.

Calculate the force acting on a charge +1 x 10\({}^{8}\) C placed at P, where P is 5 cm from both charges.

Figure 10:

#### 12.2.4 Electric Field around a Point Charge

With the electric field strength \(E\) defined, and _Coulomb's Law_, we can now quantitatively describe the electric field around a point charge.

Consider an isolated point charge \(Q\) that is placed in free space. An electric field is set up by \(Q\), in the space around it. If a small positive charge \(q\) is brought into the space and is placed at a distance \(r\) from \(Q\), a force \(F\) will be exerted by the field of \(Q\) on the charge \(q\).

According to Coulomb's law, the magnitude of repulsion or attraction between \(Q\) and \(q\) is

\[F=\frac{1}{4\pi\varepsilon_{0}}\frac{Qq}{r^{2}}\]

Hence, the magnitude of the electric field strength at a distance \(r\) away from the point charge \(Q\),

\[E=\frac{F}{q}\]

\[E=\frac{1}{4\pi\varepsilon_{0}}\frac{Q}{r^{2}}\]

\[E\propto\frac{1}{r^{2}}\]

**Notes:**

**(i)**: \(E\) is a vector quantity, and its direction at a point is given by the direction of the force experienced by a positive charge if it is placed at that point.
**(ii)**: In calculating the electric field strength, **just substitute the magnitude of the charge** (without the sign). **Indicate the direction separately.**
**(iii)**: The field is radial for a point charge. It is directed uniformly in all directions outward from the centre if \(Q\) is a positive charge and inward toward the centre if \(Q\) is a negative charge. At all points that are an equal distance away from \(Q\) the magnitude of \(E\) is the same.

Figure 11: Determining the electric field of a point charge

Figure 12: Electric field of a point charge \(Q\)

**What if there are multiple charges?**

The resultant electric field \(\ddot{\mathbf{E}}\) at a point \(P\) in an electric field is the _vector sum_ of the fields at \(P\) due to each point charge in the system.

\[\ddot{\mathbf{E}}=\ddot{\mathbf{E}}_{1}+\ddot{\mathbf{E}}_{2}+\ddot{\mathbf{E}}_{3}+......\]

**Example 3**

A charge +1.4 \(\mu\)C and a charge +2.6 \(\mu\)C are separated at 15 cm from each other.

At what point P, other than a point at infinity, is the resultant electric field zero? _This point is known as the neutral point in the field between the two charges._

Figure 13:

### Electric Potential Energy and Electric Potential

#### 12.3.1 Electric Potential Energy, \(U\)

The electric potential energy, \(U\), of a system of charges is the **work done** by an external force in assembling the system where the charges were originally at infinity, **without any change in the kinetic energy** of the charges.

Potential Energy of a System of Two Point Charges

The potential energy \(U\) of a system of two point charges \(Q_{t}\) and \(Q_{2}\) separated by a distance \(r\) is given by

\[U=\frac{Q_{t}Q_{z}}{4\pi\varepsilon_{o}r}\]

Notes: **(i)**: \(U\) is a scalar quantity. When calculating its value, **substitute the sign of the charges** into the expression (unlike for force and field). **(ii)**: If \(Q_{t}\) and \(Q_{2}\) are both positive (or both negative) the electric force is repulsive and the external force (which is opposite in direction to the electric force) would be in the same direction as the displacement from infinity to the position set and hence does positive work to bring the charges to the position set. \(U\) is positive. **(iii)**: If \(Q_{t}\) and \(Q_{2}\) are of opposite signs, the electric force is attractive. The external force will do negative work since its direction will now point towards infinity and is opposite to the direction of displacement from infinity. \(U\) is negative. _Note the similarity of this situation with gravitational potential energy_.

Figure 14: Two charges \(Q_{t}\) and \(Q_{2}\) are separated by a distance \(r\).

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:475]

#### Electric Potential

**Definition: Electric Potential, \(V\)**

The electric potential at a point in an electric field is the **work done per unit _positive_ charge, by an external force, in bringing a **small test charge** from infinity to that point, **without any change in kinetic energy**.

\[V=\frac{W}{q}\]

The SI unit of potential is J C\({}^{-1}\) or more commonly, the volt V.

**Notes:**

**(i)**: Electric potential, \(V\)is a scalar quantity.
**(ii)**: The work done in this definition refers to the work done by the external force that is needed to overcome the electric force that acts on the test charge and is commonly referred to as the "work done on the system". Some questions in A-levels will ask you to look for "work done by the system" instead - this would refer to the work done by the electric force on the test charge. You can simply find it by using:

Work done on system (by external force) = - Work done by system (by the electric force)

**Electric Potential due to a Point Charge**

Imagine a field created by a point charge \(Q\). If a test charge \(q\) were brought from infinity to a distance \(r\) from \(Q\), the work done by the external agent is given by \(W=\frac{Qq}{4\pi\varepsilon_{o}r}\).

The electric potential in the field of a point charge5\(Q\) is given by

Footnote 5: The derivation can be referred to in Appendix A.

\[V=\frac{W}{q}=\frac{1}{4\pi\varepsilon_{o}}\frac{Q}{r}\]

where \(V\)is the potential at a point in the electric field, at a distance \(r\) away from the point charge \(Q\).

**Note:**

**Substitute for the sign of the charge into the expression.** If \(Q\) is positive, then the potential \(V\)around it is positive. If \(Q\) is negative, then the potential \(V\)around it is negative.

**if I have two or more point charges, how do I determine the potential at a point in the electric field set up by these point charges?**

Since the electric potential is a scalar quantity, the potential at a point in such an electric field is the _scalar sum_ of the potentials contributed by each charge at the point.

\[V=V_{t}+V_{2}+V_{3}+......\]

Remember to keep the signs in your substitution.

**Example 4**

Four charges are placed at the corners of a square as shown. Each side has a length a. Find the resultant electric potential at P, the centre of the square.

**Moving between Two Points in an Electric Field**

The **change in potential energy in moving a charge \(q\) from point A to point B** in an electric field is given by

\[\Delta U=U_{B}-U_{A}=q(V_{B}-V_{A})\]

where \(V_{A}\) and \(V_{B}\) are the potentials of the field at A and B respectively.

**Notes:**

**(i)**: The change in potential energy is the work done by the external agent in moving \(q\) from A to B.
**(ii)**: The change in potential energy may be positive (meaning gain) or negative (meaning loss), depending on the sign of \(q\) and \((V_{B}-V_{A})\).
**(iii)**: The electrical field is a conservative field (like a gravitational field is). This means that

\(\Rightarrow\) work done on a charged particle in moving it from one point to another depends only on the particle's initial and final positions and is **independent of the path taken.**

\(\Rightarrow\) the change in potential energy is therefore independent of the path taken.

**Example 5**

An electron in the vacuum of a cathode ray tube moves from rest at a point where the potential is \(-1400\) V to a point where the potential is zero.

Calculate

(a) the change in its potential energy,

(b) the change in its kinetic energy, and

(c) its final velocity.

Fig. 17.

### Relation between Electric Potential Energy and Electric Force

The relationship between the electric force \(F\) and the potential energy of the charge \(U\) can be written as

**Note:** This equation gives us both the magnitude and direction of the force acting on the charge placed at a point in an electric field.

* The _magnitude_ of the force is given by: \[F=\left|\frac{dU}{dr}\right|=\left|\text{gradient of the }U\text{ vs. }r\text{ graph}\right|\] \[\circ\] The direction of the force on the charge is given by the negative (-) sign i.e. **the force on the charge points in the direction of decrease in potential energy.6**

Footnote 6: In fact, this is something fundamental in physics. To achieve greater stability charges would try to move to a location such that the system will end up with lower potential energy.

#### 12.4.1 Relation between Potential Gradient and Electric Field Strength

From above, \[F=-\frac{dU}{dr}\] \[\Rightarrow qE=-\frac{d(qV)}{dr}\] where \(q\) is the charge placed at the point in the electric field with field strength \(E\) and potential \(V\). Dividing both sides by \(q\), we get the relationship

**Note:**

* \(\frac{dV}{dr}\) is known as the _potential gradient_ of the field.

#### 12.5.1 Charges in Equilibrium on Conductors

An electrical conductor contains charges that are free to move. Hence, when a conductor is charged, the charges will always redistribute themselves until the excess charge resides on the surface (they try to move out of the conductor as they repel each other). When the charges are no longer moving about, i.e. they have settled down in equilibrium, they experience no net force. This implies that the electric field in the conductor is zero.

Since the charges at the surface experience no force parallel to the surface (else they will continue to move along the surface),

From \(F_{\neq}=qE_{\neq}=0\)

\(\Rightarrow\) **Electric field along the surface is zero, \(E_{\neq}=0\)**.

From \(E=-\dfrac{dV}{dr}\)

\(\Rightarrow\) \(\dfrac{dV}{dr}=0\) along the surface of the conductor

\(\Rightarrow\) **The surface of a conductor is an equipotential surface.**

\(\Rightarrow\) **Electric field lines emerging or ending on a conductor are perpendicular to the surface.**

Furthermore, since the electric field within a conductor is zero, there is no potential gradient within the conductor all the way to the surface

\(\Rightarrow\) **The potential in the conductor is constant everywhere inside the conductor and is equal to its value at the surface.**

\(\Rightarrow\) **No field lines exist within the conductor.**

Figure 18: Equipotential and field lines.

To be clear, the electric field in a neutral uncharged conductor placed in an external electric field is also zero. The free electrons in the neutral conductor redistribute themselves such that the (net) electric field within the conductor is zero! One can imagine the separated charges within the conductor producing an internal electric field that balances the external electric field. See Fig. 19.

Every point in and on the surface of the conductor is at the same potential; in other words, it is an equipotential region!

We summarise below a more complete set of rules for drawing electric field lines and equipotential lines for charged systems. We will include the previous rules for completeness.

**Rules for Drawing Electric Field Lines and Equipotential lines:**

1. Electric field lines are directed from higher potential (more positive) to lower potential (more negative).
2. The number of lines drawn leaving a positive charge or approaching a negative charge is proportional to the magnitude of the charge.
3. Field lines do not intersect, because \(\mathbf{E}\) at a point can only point in one direction.
4. Equipotential lines/surfaces are lines/surfaces that join all points of equal potential.
5. Equipotential lines/surfaces are drawn at equal intervals of potentials (e.g. 10 V, 20 V, 30 V etc.). Hence, the closer the equipotential lines or surfaces, the stronger the field.
6. Electric field lines are always perpendicular to lines of equal potential, e.g. to the surface of a conductor.
7. Electric field lines always point towards the direction in which potential is decreasing.
8. The electric field in a conductor is zero. No field lines are drawn.

Fig. 19:

### Electric Field between Two Charged Parallel Plates

Consider two large metal plates that carry equal but opposite charges. This can be done by connecting them to the opposite terminals of a constant voltage supply. It is reasonable to suppose that within each plate, except at the edges, the charges on each plate are spread uniformly over the inside surface of each plate, because of their mutual repulsion and the attraction by the opposite charges on the other plate.

The electric field lines are straight, parallel to each other and equally spaced (except at the fringes - see Fig. 8(f)). **The electric field in the space between the two plates is said to be uniform.**

Suppose that in Fig. 20 the potential difference between two large charged metal plates is \(V\) and the plate separation is \(d\). Since the electric field strength between the plates is constant, from \(\textbf{ }E=-\dfrac{dV}{dr}\) we have

* **Magnitude of the electric field strength:**

* **Direction of the electric field:** \(E\) is directed from the plate with the higher potential to the plate with the lower potential.

#### 12.6.1 Motion of Charged Particles in a Uniform Electric Field

Consider a particle of mass \(m\), carrying charge \(q\), that is placed in a uniform electric field \(E\).

The field exerts a force \(qE\) on it, giving it an acceleration \(a\) in the direction of the force.

By Newton's second law, \(ma=qE\). The acceleration of the charge is therefore given by \(a=\dfrac{qE}{m}\).

In most questions, the mass is so small that the electric force overwhelms the gravitational force on the mass (weight). Hence the weight can be ignored.

For example, if you are considering an electron:

Its weight is 9.11 \(\times 10^{31}\)\(\times\) 9.81 = 8.94 \(\times\) 10\({}^{-30}\) N

If it is between parallel plates of potential difference 1.0 V and separation 10 cm, the electric force it experiences is (1.60 \(\times\) 10\({}^{-19}\)) \(\times\) 1.0/0.10 = 1.6 \(\times\) 10\({}^{-18}\) N.

However, you should not assume that it is always the case that the weight can be ignored. You might get a question where the mass is large enough to make the weight significant compared to the electric force. (e.g. the Millikan oil drop experiment).

Figure 20: Electric Field between two parallel, oppositely charged plates.

A positively charged particle will accelerate in the direction of \(E\). A negatively charged particle will accelerate in the direction opposite to \(E\).

In general, the motion is that of an object moving under constant acceleration. There are two possible paths:

i. If its initial velocity is zero or parallel to the direction of \(E\), the charged particle will move in a straight line parallel to \(E\). ii. If its initial velocity is inclined to the field \(E\), it will travel in a parabolic path.

**Example 8**

A beam of electrons, travelling at 1.35 x 10\({}^{7}\) m s-1, enters a uniform electric field between two plates of length 0.060 m, which are separated by a distance of 0.020 m. The top plate is at +50 V while the lower plate is at -50 V. Find the angular deflection of the beam as electrons emerge from between the plates, assuming that the electrons never reach the upper plate.

### Deriving the Potential Energy and the Potential of an Electric Field by a Point Charge

**[Adapted from: Duncan, 2000, p 204]**

Consider a point charge +\(Q\). To find the potential of the electric field at **A** a distance \(r\) away from +\(Q\), we bring a very small test charge +\(q_{o}\) from infinity to the point **A** (allowing for no gain in kinetic energy) and find the work done by the external force to carry out this action.

We note that when the test charge is moving in the field set up by the source, it experiences a varying electrical force \(F_{E}\). An external force needs to move it from infinity to the point.

Now, the work done _dW_ by the external force to move a small distance of _dx_ towards the source charge is

\[dW=F_{ext}dx\]

Since the test charge is moved at a constant velocity, \(F_{ext}\) = -\(F_{E}\). Therefore,

\[dW=-F_{E}dx\]

The electric force experienced by the test charge a distance \(x\) away from the source charge is

\(F_{E}=\dfrac{Qq_{o}}{4\pi\varepsilon_{o}x^{2}}\). Therefore, we have the work done by the external force,

\[W=-\overset{\prime}{\underset{\infty}{\int}}F_{E}dx=-\overset{\prime}{\underset {\infty}{\int}}\dfrac{Qq_{o}}{4\pi\varepsilon_{o}x^{2}}dx=-\dfrac{Qq_{o}}{4 \pi\varepsilon_{o}}[-\dfrac{1}{r}]=\dfrac{Qq_{o}}{4\pi\varepsilon_{o}r}\]

By definition of the electrical potential, the potential at point A is therefore,

\[V=\dfrac{W}{q_{o}}=\dfrac{Q}{4\pi\varepsilon_{o}r}\]

## Appendix B Deriving the Relationship between Force and Potential Energy

The relationship between a (conservative) force \(F\) and the associated potential energy is given by

\[F=-\frac{dU}{dx}\]

This is a general relationship that applies to all conservative forces, of which the gravitational force and the electric force are examples.

To get this relationship, it is best to look at a specific case. In this case we will look at the electrical force \(F_{E}\) experienced by a charge in an electrical field.

By conservation of (mechanical) energy, assuming that no dissipative forces act on the system,

Work done by an external force on the system \(W\) = Increase in P.E. + Increase in K.E. of system

Assuming we move the object in the field at a constant velocity

\(\Rightarrow\) Increase in K.E. of system = 0

Now, let us move the object (a small charge in this case) by a small distance of \(\hat{\alpha}\)x in the direction of the external force, the small amount of work done \(\hat{\alpha}W\) by the external force is this case can be written as

\[\hat{\alpha}W=F_{ext}\,\hat{\alpha}x\]

Since the object is moving with constant velocity, \(F_{ext}\) = -\(F_{E}\)

Hence, we have

\[\hat{\alpha}W=F_{ext}\,\hat{\alpha}x\]

\[\Rightarrow\qquad\hat{\alpha}W=\mbox{ - }F_{E}\,\hat{\alpha}x\]

Now, as stated above, the work done by the external force results in the gain of potential energy of the system, hence we have

\[\Rightarrow\qquad\hat{\alpha}U=\hat{\alpha}W=\mbox{ - }F_{E}\,\hat{\alpha}x\qquad\mbox{ where }U\mbox{ is the potential energy}\]

which can be written as

\[\Rightarrow\qquad F_{E}=-\frac{dU}{dx}\qquad\mbox{(derived)}\]

### Practical Circuits

Symbols for various circuit elements

#### Circuit Essentials

Most complete electric circuits contain 6 parts:

1. An _energy source_ to provide the voltage needed to drive current through the circuit.
2. _Conductors_ through which the current can travel.
3. _Insulators_ to confine the current to the desired paths.
4. A _load_ to control the amount of current and convert the electrical energy supplied by the energy source.
5. A _control device_, often a switch, to start and stop the flow of current.
6. A _protection device_ to interrupt the circuit in case of a circuit malfunction

The first 4 of the above 6 parts are essential parts. All complete circuits use them. The control device is occasionally omitted. Protection devices are often omitted from circuits.

## 13.2 Electric Current

**Electric current** is the rate of flow of electric charge. It can be due to the flow of positive charges or negative charges or both.

Consider some charges moving through a cross-sectional area, which is perpendicular to the flow of charges. Suppose the electric charge \(\delta\) Q flows through the area in time \(\delta\) t.

The electric current \(I\) through the area is the **rate of flow** of the electric charges through the cross-sectional area of the surface. \(I=\dfrac{\delta Q}{\delta}\)

If the charge flows at an irregular or non-linear rate, then the current \(I_{i}\) due to this flow of charge is

\[I_{i}=\dfrac{dQ}{dt}\qquad\text{(Formula for instantaneous current)}\]

If the charges flow such that in a time interval \(t\), the total charge which crosses that area is \(Q\), the average current \(I_{av}\) due to this flow of charge is

\[I_{av}=\dfrac{Q}{t}\qquad\text{(Formula for average or constant current)}\]

### 13.2.1 Units of Current & Charge

**Current**

Sl unit for electric current is **ampere (A)**, named after the French scientist who established the laws of electromagnetism. It was previously defined in terms of the magnetic forces that act between current-carrying conductors.1 This magnetic force is explained in the topic Electromagnetism.

Footnote 1: From May 20, 2019, the ampere has been redefined to be based on the elementary charge (\(\epsilon\)). See this link for more info: [https://www.nist.gov/sl-redefinition/ampere-introduction](https://www.nist.gov/sl-redefinition/ampere-introduction)

### Charge

Sl unit for charge is **coulomb (C)**, after the French scientist who first investigated the forces acting between electric charges. The unit is defined in terms of Sl base units, ampere (A) and second (s).

One **coulomb (C)** is the quantity of electric charge that pass a given point in a circuit when a steady current of one ampere flows through that point for one second.

1 coulomb = 1 ampere-second

1 C = 1 A s

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:503]

For a given current \(I\), a good conducting material is one for which \(n\) is large and \(\nu\) therefore small. Copper is one of the best conductors, having in the region of 10\({}^{29}\) free electrons per m\({}^{3}\). Using the equation, we can estimate a typical value for \(\nu\) when a current of 1 A flows through a copper wire of cross sectional area 2.0\(\times\)10\({}^{-7}\)m\({}^{2}\) (about 0.5 mm diameter).

\[\begin{split}\nu&=\frac{I}{nAe}\\ &=\frac{1}{10^{29}\times 2\times 10^{-7}\times 1.6\times 10^{-19} }\\ &=3.1\times 10^{-4}\,\mathrm{m}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}\end{split}\]

The actual values of the velocity \(\nu\) are amazingly small! However, it is worth noting that this slow drift starts almost **instantaneously in all parts** of an electrical circuit completed when, for instance, a switch is closed. (Hence there is clearly no delay between closing a switch in one part of a room and the light in another part coming on.)

## 13.3 Potential Difference and Electromotive Force

### 13.3.1 Energy considerations of an electric current

The circulation of an electric current in a complete circuit leads to the continual dissipation of energy throughout the circuit in the form of heat and other forms of energy (e.g. light energy in a filament lamp, mechanical energy in an electric motor, etc.). All this energy must be continuously supplied by an e.m.f. source e.g., battery, dynamo, etc.

### 13.3.2 Electromotive Force (e.m.f.)

The sources of e.m.f. (stands for electromotive force) required in any complete circuit to generate electric current are therefore primarily means of _converting other forms of energy to electrical form_. E.g. a dry cell converts chemical energy to electrical energy, a dynamo converts kinetic energy to electrical energy, a microphone converts vibrational energy of a sound wave to electrical energy, etc.

The term e.m.f. has historical origins, but it is _NOT a force_, despite its name. It is more a measure of energy (i.e., electrical potential energy) rather than force.

The **electromotive force (e.m.f.)**, _E_**, of a source is defined as the _energy converted per unit electric charge to electrical energy in driving charge round a complete circuit._

The SI unit for e.m.f. is volt (V), after the Italian scientist Alessandro Volta, who first investigated the action of electric batteries.

If charge \(Q\) flows in a circuit containing a source of e.m.f. \(E\), the electrical energy supplied by the source to the whole circuit is

\[W=QE\]

The power \(P\) of the source varies with the current it drives and hence, we normally specify the power of the source with reference to the current, i.e. its power to current ratio. This ratio which is a constant of the electrical source is the e.m.f. of the source.

### 13.3.3 Potential Difference

A source of e.m.f. produces an _electric field_ between its terminals. The electric force will act on charge carriers in the circuit and a complete conducting path between the terminals allows the charge carriers to flow through the circuit.

Inside the conductors, the electric force does work on the moving charged particles. As a result, electrical potential energy is converted into heat and other forms of energy.

We can define the electric potential at a point in the circuit. The **conventional current will flow from a point of higher electric potential to a point of lower electric potential in the circuit.** The potential difference (p.d.), between two points in the circuit is the work done by the electric field to drive a unit charge from one point to the other.

The p.d. across a conductor is sometimes described as "voltage" or "potential drop" across the conductor.

Most of the time, it is only differences of potential (i.e., p.d.) and NOT the potentials of points in a circuit that are of any significance in electric circuits.

To determine the electric potential at a point in a circuit, it would be necessary to first identify a point to be at _conventional zero potential_. This point is used as a reference to which the potentials of other points in the circuit can be determined. Many electrical circuits have a point in the circuit that is connected to Earth. By convention, _Earth is taken to be at zero potential_. Electrical apparatus that is connected to the earth is said to be "earthed".

Circuit symbol to represent earthing of a point of a circuit (i.e. the point is at 0 V potential).

The _potential difference V between two points_ in a circuit is defined as the _energy converted per unit electric charge_ from electrical energy to other forms of energy when charge moved between the two points.

If the electrical energy \(W\) converted is for charge \(Q\) moved between the two points, then, **potential difference**_V_ between two points is

\[V=\frac{W}{Q}\]

Thus, if a charge \(Q\) flows in a part of a circuit across which there is a p.d. _V, the electrical energy supplied_ is given by _W_= _QV_.

The SI unit for potential difference is volt (V).

#### 13.3.4 Distinction between e.m.f. and Potential Difference

Energy conversion

e.m.f. is a measure of the _energy converted per unit electric charge to electrical energy in driving charge round a complete circuit_.

Potential difference is a measure of energy converted _per unit electric charge_ from electrical energy to other forms of energy when charge moved between the two points.

There will be no potential difference across any part of the circuit without an e.m.f. in the circuit.

An e.m.f. exists, regardless of whether current flows or not; e.g. a left-alone cell has e.m.f.

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:507]

### 13.5 Resistance and Resistivity

If a potential difference is applied across a conductor, then a current \(I\) will flow through the conductor. The potential difference required to produce a given current depends on a property of the conductor called its resistance. Resistivity is a property of the material of the conductor. Example: _resistance_ of copper wire, _resistivity_ of copper.

#### 13.5.1 Resistance

The resistance, \(R\), of a device is the **ratio** of the potential difference \(V\) across the device to the current \(I\) flowing through it.

\[R=\frac{V}{I}\]

The electrical resistance of a conductor is due to its atoms obstructing the drift of electrons past them. Resistance is thus a measure of the obstruction to the movement of charge carriers.

Unit for resistance \(R\) is **ohm (Q)**.

#### 13.5.2 Ohm's Law (Review of High School Physics)

Georg Simon Ohm, a German physicist, was the first person to distinguish clearly between the two concepts, p.d. and current, and to investigate the relation between them. Ohm determined that there is a _direct proportionality_ between the potential difference applied across a metallic conductor and the resultant electric current through the conductor (known as Ohm's Law). From the results of his experiment, Ohm was able to define the fundamental relationship between voltage, current and resistance.

Thus, **Ohm's Law states that**:

A _steady current_ flowing through _a metallic conductor_ is _proportional to the potential difference across it_, provided the _temperature and other physical conditions are constant._

As a consequence of Ohm's Law, the resistance for a given metallic conductor under steady physical conditions is a constant. Such conductors are also known as **ohmic conductors.**

The current in a metallic conductor depends on a number of factors beside the p.d. across it. The most important of these is the temperature. But other physical conditions will also affect the current through it.

In addition, for electrolytic conduction, the relation between p.d. and current is complicated by the e.m.f that arises at the electrodes, accompanying the conversion of electrical energy to chemical energy. The same situation arises in other cases where the conductor is itself the site of an e.m.f. (e.g. the armature coil of a motor, or a coil in which a rapidly changing current induces an e.m.f. by self-induction).

#### 13.5.3 Resistivity

The resistance of a uniform conductor is

(i) proportional to its length \(L\)

(ii) inversely proportional to its cross-sectional area \(A\)

(iii) dependent on a property of the material of the specimen known as its resistivity, \(\rho\).

The relationship between resistance and the above factors is given by

\[R=\rho\frac{L}{A}\]

Unit for resistivity is \(\mathbf{\Omega}\)\(\mathbf{m}\).

The table shows the resistivity of some common materials.

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|} \hline
**Material** & **Resistivity at 20\({}^{\circ}\)C/\(\mathbf{\Omega}\)\(\mathbf{m}\)** \\ \hline silver & 1.6 x 10\({}^{\circ}\)\({}^{\circ}\) \\ \hline copper & 1.7 x 10\({}^{\circ}\)\({}^{\circ}\) \\ \hline gold & 2.2 x 10\({}^{\circ}\)\({}^{\circ}\) \\ \hline iron & 10.1 x 10\({}^{\circ}\)\({}^{\circ}\) \\ \hline nichrome & 110 x 10\({}^{\circ}\)\({}^{\circ}\) \\ \hline skin (dry) & 3 x 10\({}^{4}\) \\ \hline \end{tabular}

The diagram shows a rectangular block with dimensions x, 2x and 3x. Electrical contact can be made to the block between opposite pair of faces (P, Q and R). Between which two faces would the maximum electrical resistance be obtained?

#### Determination of resistance using an ammeter and a voltmeter

In principle, the resistance \(R\) of a resistor can be found by measuring the current \(I\) which flows through it as a result of there being a potential difference, \(V\), across it, and substituting the measured values of \(I\) and \(V\) into the equation \(R=V/I\).

Whenever **an ammeter** is put into a circuit, it is put **in series** with the circuit components, and therefore it must have **zero resistance** if it is not to affect the current in the circuit.

**A voltmeter**, on the other hand, is always placed **in parallel** with a circuit component, and therefore must have **infinite resistance** if it is not to draw current through itself and alter the current in the circuit.

**An "ideal" ammeter has zero resistance; an "ideal" voltmeter has infinite resistance.**

A real ammeter has a resistance which can range from near zero to 1 \(\Omega\); a real voltmeter has a resistance, which can range from 20 k\(\Omega\) to 2 M\(\Omega\).

#### Effective Resistance for Combination of Resistors

**Resistors in series**

Consider two resistors \(R_{1}\) and \(R_{2}\) which are connected in series across A and B.

For \(n\) resistors connected in series:

\[R_{eq}=\sum R_{n}\]

Characteristics of circuits consisting of _resistors in series_ are;

1. the **same current** flows through each of the resistors.
2. the total p.d across all resistors in series. = sum of individual p.d. across each resistor.
3. individual p.d. is directly proportional to individual resistors.
4. **equivalent resistance = sum of individual resistances**.

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:511]

**Example 4** (N89/l/14)

The circuit diagram shows a network of resistors each of resistance \(R\).

What is the effective resistance between the points X and Y?

(A) \(\dfrac{2R}{7}\) (D) \(\dfrac{2R}{3}\)

(B) \(\dfrac{R}{2}\) (E) \(\dfrac{3R}{4}\)

(C) \(\dfrac{5R}{8}\)

**Example 5** (J89/l/15)

Three resistors are connected as shown in the diagram using connecting wires of negligible resistance. What is the approximate resistance between points P and Q?

The connecting wires are taken as ideal conductors (i.e., \(R=0\)\(\Omega\)), unless otherwise stated. Thus two points joined by a connecting wire would be at the same potential.

Type

#### 13.5.6 Power dissipation in resistors (Joule heating)

From the definitions of resistance and potential difference, we have learnt:

For an electric device of resistance \(R\) carrying a steady current \(I\):

The potential difference \(V\) across the device is: \(V=IR\)

The power dissipated by the device is: \(P=IV\)

When an electric current passes through a resistor, electrical energy is irreversibly transformed into thermal energy (Joule heating). The following two equations describe the **rate of transfer of electrical energy** to heat generated in a resistor:

\[P=I(IR)=I^{2}R\]

\[P=\frac{V}{R}V=\frac{V^{2}}{R}\]

Therefore, we have three expressions for the power dissipated by the device, \(P\):

\(P=VI=I^{2}R=V^{2}/R\)

The last two of these formulae (\(P=I^{2}R=V^{2}/R\)) can apply _only to the production of heat_ in resistors. The formula (\(P=VI\)) can be applied to _determine the rate of production of energy in any form_ in a circuit component in which a current \(I\) flows at a potential difference \(V\).

The power output at a power station is 500 MW at a p.d. of 132 kV. If the total resistance of the complete power line is 4.0 \(\Omega\), calculate

1. the current flowing in the power line,
2. the voltage drop caused by the power line, and
3. the percentage loss of power in transmission.

Before solving, sketch a schematic representation of this circuit and label all given values in your schematic.

Students often apply the wrong formula to compute the required power dissipated by a particular component in a circuit as they fail to identify the correct \(V\), \(I\) or \(R\) in the circuit.

Note that \(V\) is the p.d. across the identified component. In questions asking to determine the power loss across the transmission cables, the power loss (through heating) in cables is usually determined using \(P=I^{2}R\) (where \(I\) is the current flowing in the cables and \(R\) is the resistance of the cables) as it is often not possible to determine \(V\) across the transmission cables.

If the value of \(V\) across the transmission cables can be measured, the power loss in the cable can then also be determined using \(P=V^{2}\)/\(R\).

### 13.6 \(I\)-\(V\) Characteristics of Various Electrical Components

It is often useful to understand how an electrical component (e.g. resistor, diode, etc) would behave or function in an electrical circuit. This information is often obtained from the I-V characteristics graphs of the required electrical component. Thus it is often useful and critical (for GCE A Level exams) to be able to understand and interpret the I-V characteristics graphs of different electrical components.

It is important to note that for any I-V characteristics graph, the \(I\) represents the current passing through the component and \(V\) represents the p.d. across the component. Thus, the resistance of the component (for a particular set of \(I\) and \(V\) values) is obtained by directly dividing \(V\) by \(I\).

Microscopically, the resistance of the metal conductor is due to collisions between the free electrons and the metal ions in the lattice. When the temperature of the conductor is kept constant, the amplitude of lattice ion vibrations will remain the same. This means that the hindrance to the flow of electrons is fixed and the resistance will remain constant.

When a larger p.d. is applied, the temperature of the filament increases due to the heating effect of the current. The **resistance of the filament increases with temperature** at larger values of p.d. and current.

The collisions between the electrons and lattice ions cause energy to be transferred to the lattice ions, enabling the ions to vibrate with larger amplitudes - this implies an increase in the temperature of the filament, and beyond a certain point, the filament glows. The increased vibration of the lattice ions presents a greater hindrance to the flow of electrons, resulting in an increase in the resistance of the filament. Hence at any particular value of p.d. (except at low values of p.d. where there is no significant increase in temperature - any energy gained by the filament is dissipated to the surroundings quickly enough), the current in a filament is lower than that in an ohmic conductor.

The thermistor's response is rapid and most sensitive to changes to temperature in the region of 200 K to 600K; it is a more limited range compared to thermocouples or resistance thermometers.

The thermistor is commonly used in very low temperature measurements as the high sensitivity (_dR/dT_) at low temperature enables more accurate measurements to be made. It can also be used to operate fire alarms and thermostats.

A _p-n junction diode_ is a semiconductor which conducts well in one direction of p.d. (**forward-bias** direction) but conducts poorly when the p.d. is reversed (**reverse-bias** direction). In an ideal diode (which does not exist in real life), if the diode is reverse biased, the current flowing through it is zero. The ideal diode starts conducting at 0 V and for any positive voltage an infinite current flows and the diode acts like a short circuit (a "perfect" wire).

A real diode needs a minimum positive voltage, called the turn-on voltage, before it conducts any significant current. The diode has very small resistance. If the p.d. is applied in the opposite direction (_reverse biased_), almost zero current flows, and the diode has very high resistance.

Note that if the reverse-biased p.d. is too high, the diode may break down, resulting in a short circuit.

A diode is used as a rectifier for changing an alternating current to a direct current (greater detail is in the topic Alternating Current).

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:516]

## 13.7 Internal resistance of a source of e.m.f.

All practical sources of e.m.f. have internal resistance. The chemicals within a cell offer a resistance to current flow, known as the internal resistance of the cell.

### 13.7.1 Terminal potential difference, e.m.f and internal resistance

Consider a simple circuit with a cell of e.m.f. \(\mathcal{E}\) and a load of resistance \(R\). From the energy point of view, the cell is the supplier while the load is the consumer of electrical energy. However, the cell has internal resistance which would consume part of the energy. Hence, less energy is available to drive each coulomb round the external circuit.

A cell can be represented as an ideal source of e.m.f. in series with a resistor representing the internal resistance of the cell. This internal resistance _cannot be_ separated out or measured directly.

By the law of conservation of energy,

Energy supplied by the e.m.f. = total energy consumed by the load and internal resistance of the cell

Since energy is supplied continuously, it follows that:

Power supplied by the e.m.f. = total power consumed by the load and internal resistance of the cell

\[P_{\mathit{eff}}=P_{\mathit{load}}+P_{\mathit{loss}}\] \[I\mathcal{E}=IV_{R}+IV_{r}\] \[I\mathcal{E}=IV_{R}+I^{2}r\] \[\mathcal{E}=V_{R}+Ir\] \[V_{R}=\mathcal{E}-Ir\]

Thus, the _potential difference across the terminals of a cell_ (_terminal p.d._) of a source supplying current to an external circuit is always _smaller than its e.m.f._ due to the presence of the internal resistance, \(r\).

If the circuit is open, no current will flow through the circuit and the terminal p.d. of the source will be equal to the e.m.f. of the source.

The output efficiency of the above circuit is given by:

\[\mathit{Efficiency}=\frac{\text{useful power output}}{\text{power input}}\] \[\mathit{Efficiency}=\frac{P_{\mathit{load}}}{P_{\mathit{off}}} =\frac{I^{2}R}{IE}=\frac{IR}{E}=\frac{\left(\frac{E}{R+r}\right)R}{E}=\frac{ R}{R+r}\]

**Example 8**

A complete circuit consists of a 24.0 V battery, a 5.60 \(\Omega\) resistor and a switch. The internal resistance of the battery is 0.28 \(\Omega\). The switch is opened. What does a voltmeter read when placed

1. across the terminals of the battery?
2. across the resistor?
3. across the switch?

Repeat (a), (b) and (c) for the case when the switch is closed.

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:519]

Instead of two resistors, a **rheostat** can be used as in Figure 13.8.2 as a source of variable potential difference.

By sliding the contact/slider \(Y\) on the rheostat \(R\), \(V_{AC}\) can be made to vary from 0 (when \(Y\) is tapped at the point of zero resistance) to \(\mathcal{E}\)(when \(Y\) is tapped at the point of maximum resistance), assuming the driver cell has negligible internal resistance.

#### Use of thermistors and light dependent resistors in potential dividers

Thermistors

One of the resistors in Figure 13.8.1 can be substituted with a thermistor. When the temperature increases, the resistance of the thermistor decreases, which in turn causes a decrease in the p.d. across the thermistor

\[(V_{thermistor}=\frac{R_{thermistor}}{R_{thermistor}+R_{resistance}}\,\varepsilon\,)\]

 and an increase in the p.d. across the other resistor

\[(V_{ resistor}=\frac{R_{ resistor}}{R_{thermistor}+R_{ resistor}}\,\varepsilon\,).\]

One application of a thermistor is its use as a temperature sensor in a fire alarm. When hot conditions are detected, \(V_{resistor}\) increases, causing a fire alarm circuit to be triggered.

Light Dependent Resistors

One of the resistors in Figure 13.8.1 can be substituted with a light dependent resistor (LDR). A LDR is a device whose resistance decreases as the intensity of light incident on it increases. Under bright conditions, the p.d. across the LDR

\[(V_{ LDR}=\frac{R_{LDR}}{R_{ LDR}+R_{ resistor}}\,\varepsilon\,)\]

 decreases, while the p.d. across the other resistor in the circuit increases ( \[V_{ resistor}=\frac{R_{ resistor}}{R_{ LDR}+R_{ resistor}}\,\varepsilon\,).\]

One could use a LDR to control lighting circuits which are switched on automatically in the evening when illumination falls below a certain intensity.

**Example 9** (J86/1/15)

**A**: 0 and 25 mV
**B**: 5 mV and 25 mV
**C**: 0 and 20 V
**D**: 0 and 25 V
**E**: 5 V and 25 V

**Example 10**

(a) Determine the potential difference across the junction AC in the following circuit.

(b) Determine the reading of a voltmeter of resistance 200 \(\Omega\) placed across AC.

(c) Determine the reading of an ammeter of resistance 10 \(\Omega\) placed in the path BD.

### The Potentiometer

The potentiometer comprises a resistance wire AB and a jockey that is connected to the wire which can be shifted up and down the wire. It is usually connected to a driver circuit and a secondary circuit (the secondary circuit will be elaborated in a later section). In its most basic form, the driver circuit consists of a driver cell, \(\mathcal{E}\) and a long resistance wire, shown as AB below.

A voltmeter connected across AC will measure a fraction of the potential difference \(\mathcal{E}\). The fraction of \(\mathcal{E}\) measured out depends on where point C - a metallic contact called a jockey - is placed along AB.

The principle on which a potentiometer works is exactly the same as for a potential divider. Assuming that the resistance wire AB has a uniform cross-sectional area and a length \(l_{AB}\), the resistance \(R_{AC}\) will be proportional to the length \(l_{AC}\), since \(R=\frac{\rho^{I}}{A}\), or \(R\propto l\). Therefore,

\[V_{AC}=\frac{R_{AC}}{R_{AC}+R_{CB}}\,\mathcal{E}=\frac{l_{AC}}{l_{AB}}\, \mathcal{E}\]

A Balanced PotentiometerThe potentiometer is said to be **balanced** when the jockey is at a position on AB such that there is **NO current** through the galvanometer (essentially an ammeter). This means that there is no current or charge flow between the driver circuit and the secondary circuit, i.e. the driver circuit and secondary circuit are electrically isolated. The applications of the potentiometer that we will discuss in the next section rest on finding this balanced point.

#### Applications of the potentiometer

The secondary circuit can take on many forms, depending on the application of the potentiometer.

**Application 1: To determine the unknown e.m.f. of a cell**

The secondary circuit is just composed of the unknown e.m.f. source \(\mathcal{E}_{1}\).

By adjusting the length \(l_{{}_{AC}}\), we change the p.d. \(V_{{}_{AC}}\).

At the point where the galvanometer shows null deflection (no current flows through it and the potentiometer is balanced),

\[\mathcal{E}_{1}=V_{XY}=V_{AC}\] \[\mathcal{E}_{1}=\ \frac{l_{AC}}{l_{AB}}\,\mathcal{E}\]

The length \(l_{{}_{AC}}\) is known as the balanced length. By measuring \(l_{AC}\), with known \(l_{AB}\) and \(\mathcal{E}\), \(\mathcal{E}_{1}\) can be found.

Since there is no current flowing through the galvanometer, the potentiometer essentially functions as an ideal voltmeter!

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:524]

**Example 11**

In the circuit shown below, cell \(\mathcal{E}\) has an e.m.f. of 2.0 V and negligible internal resistance. AB is a uniform wire of length 1.00 m and resistance 5.0 \(\Omega\). Cell \(\mathcal{E}_{\mathcal{I}}\) has an e.m.f. of 1.5 V and internal resistance of 0.80 \(\Omega\). Calculate the length AC required to produce zero deflection in the galvanometer

(i) in the circuit as shown above,

(ii) when a resistor of 1.0 \(\Omega\) is placed _in series_ with \(\mathcal{E}_{\mathcal{I}}\) as shown below.

(iii) when a resistor of 1.0 \(\Omega\) is connected with \(\mathcal{E}_{\mathcal{I}}\) as shown below.

Practical pointers on the potentiometer

* The e.m.f.s of both the driver cell and the unknown cell should be constant throughout. If not, the balance length will fluctuate.
* The jockey should not be scraped along wire AB to determine the balance point, because doing so could damage the uniformity of the wire. Instead gently taps the jockey along the wire AB.
* A very sensitive galvanometer is needed if precise locations of the balance points are to be made. Such a galvanometer should be protected, by a large (typically 1 M\(\alpha\)) series resistance, from the relatively high current which would flow through it when the jockey is far away from the balanced point. The presence of this resistor will not affect the balance length since at balanced point, no current flows through the galvanometer (and the resistor of large resistance).

Advantages of using a potentiometer to measure voltage

* It draws no current. Therefore, it functions as an ideal voltmeter. When used to measure an unknown e.m.f., the value obtained at balanced point is the true e.m.f. If a practical voltmeter of resistance 1000 \(\Omega\) is used across an e.m.f. source of 10 V and internal resistance 5 \(\Omega\), the practical voltmeter will read only \(V=\frac{1000}{1005}\times 10=9.95\) V.
* which would be 9.5 V for the circuit below. If a practical voltmeter of resistance 1000 \(\Omega\) is used instead to measure the terminal p.d., the effective external resistance would be \((\frac{1}{95}+\frac{1}{1000})^{-1}\) and the voltmeter would read only 9.46 V.

Disadvantages of using a potentiometer to measure voltage

* It is slow in operation. It cannot be used to monitor rapidly changing voltages.
* The resistance wire may not be uniform due to wear and tear.

It should be appreciated that the measurement using a potentiometer is basically a method of comparison.

Appendix A Two different arrangements of voltmeter and ammeter to find a more accurate value of the resistance of an unknown resistor.

If the meters are not ideal, the significance of the error in the meter readings can be reduced by using the following circuit arrangements:

If the unknown \(R\) is expected to be low

The voltmeter reads the correct value of p.d. across \(R\).

While the ammeter reads the sum of the current flowing through both \(R\) and the voltmeter, because \(R\) is low, most of the current actually passes through \(R\) rather than the voltmeter - hence the error in the ammeter reading will not be too great.

If this circuit were used for a high \(R\) (perhaps comparable to the resistance of the voltmeter) instead, the ammeter will not be measuring a value of current close to the current actually flowing through \(R\) - the error in the ammeter reading will be more significant (the voltmeter still reads the p.d. across \(R\)).

If the unknown \(R\) is expected to be high

The ammeter reads the correct value of current flowing through \(R\).

While the voltmeter reads the sum of the p.d. across both \(R\) and the ammeter, because \(R\) is high, most of the p.d. actually falls across \(R\) - hence the error in the voltmeter reading will not be great.

If this circuit were used for a low \(R\) (perhaps comparable to the resistance of the ammeter) instead, the error in the voltmeter reading will be more significant (the ammeter still reads the current through \(R\)).

## Appendix B - The Wheatstone bridge (good to know)

Unknown resistances can be accurately measured using a circuit known as a Wheatstone bridge.

This circuit consists of the unknown resistance A, three known resistors B, C and D (where C is a variable resistor), a galvanometer, and a source of e.m.f.

Resistor C is varied until the galvanometer reading is zero (null deflection), i.e. there is no current flowing through the galvanometer between points \(b\) and \(d\). Under this condition of null deflection, the bridge is said to be balanced, and the current which flows in A flows in B as well; the current which flows in C flows in D as well.

Since point \(a\) is common and the potential at \(b\) = the potential at \(d\), the potential difference across \(ab\) = potential difference across \(ad\). Likewise, the potential difference across \(bc\) = potential difference across \(dc\).

\[i_{i}A=i_{2}C \tag{1}\] \[i_{i}B=i_{2}D \tag{2}\]

(1)/(2) \[\frac{A}{B}=\frac{C}{D}\]

Since B, C and D are known, A can be found.

Advantages

* Variation in the e.m.f. of the supply does not affect the balance point.

Disadvantages

* This method is unreliable for finding small resistances (< 1 \(\Omega\)) because the unknown resistances of the (real) wires used to connect the resistors into the bridge are significant.
* This method is insensitive for high resistances (-10\({}^{6}\)\(\Omega\)) unless a highly sensitive galvanometer is used. This is because the presence of high resistances in the circuit causes the current through the galvanometer to be near zero even when the potentials of points \(b\) and \(d\) are far from each other.

## Chapter 14 Electromagnetism

This picture shows Shanghai Maglev, the world's first high-speed commercial magnetic levitation line, whose trains run on non-conventional tracks and reach a top speed of 430 km/h (267 mph). In comparison, conventional railway speed is below 100 km/h, and commercial aircraft cruise at around 800 km/h.

Maglev (derived from magnetic levitation) is a system of train transportation that uses two sets of magnets: one set to repel and push the train up off the track, and another set to move the elevated train ahead, taking advantage of the lack of friction. Along certain "medium-range" routes (usually 320 to 640 km), maglev can compete favourably with high-speed rail and airplanes.

With maglev technology, there is just one moving part: the train itself. The train travels along a guideway of magnets which control the train's stability and speed. Propulsion and levitation require no moving parts. This is in stark contrast to electric multiple units that may have several dozen parts per bogie. Maglev trains are therefore quieter and smoother than conventional trains and have the potential for much higher speeds.

## 14 Introduction

More than 2000 years ago, the Chinese discovered magnetic phenomena and they have since been using them for navigation. However, it was only in the 1700s that magnetic properties and phenomena were studied in greater depth. Major discoveries made in the last 300 years have made a significant impact on our lives today. Scientists who have contributed significantly to our understanding of magnetic phenomena include Ampere, Oersted, Gauss, Henry and Faraday.

Magnetism has many useful applications in our everyday lives. Earth's magnetic field not only allows us to find our way around, but also enables birds to navigate when they migrate South during winter in the North. Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR), which makes use of atoms' magnetic moments, allows us to capture images of our body. Mobile phones, speakers and microphones make use of the concept of electromagnetic induction. The Great Industrial Revolution would not have been possible without knowing that the cutting of magnetic flux can generate electricity.

In this topic, you will learn that magnetic fields can be generated by electric currents and how magnetic forces act on moving charges as well as current-carrying conductors. In the next topic on Electromagnetic Induction (EMI), you will learn how electric currents can be created by changing magnetic fields.

### The Magnetic Field and Magnetic Flux Density

Just like the gravitational and electric fields, the magnetic field is an example of a _'field of force'_. The concept of a field illustrates _'action at a distance'_, which means that a suitable object placed in the field can experience a force. A magnetic field is a region of space where a magnetic material or a moving charge/current-carrying conductor experiences a magnetic force.

As with electric fields, we can illustrate magnetic fields by drawing magnetic field lines. The pictorial representation of magnetic field lines is very useful in visualizing the strength and direction of the magnetic field. Field lines can be visualized quite easily in the real world. This is commonly done with iron filings scattered on a surface around a magnet. Each iron filling is magnetized and acts like a tiny compass needle with north and south poles. Thus, the filings rearrange themselves along the magnetic field lines.

Unlike gravitational field and electric field, we associate the direction of magnetic field lines with the direction of the north pole on a compass, rather than the direction of magnetic force.

* Magnetic field lines 'appear' to originate from the north pole and end on the south pole of a magnet. But to be exact, **magnetic field lines have no start or end point**. The field lines actually continue on within the magnet to form a complete loop.
* The _direction of a magnetic field at any point_ is indicated by the **tangent to the magnetic field line** at that point. The direction of the magnetic field at any point in space is the direction indicated by the north pole of a small compass needle placed at that point.
* Magnetic field lines **do not cross each other**.
* The **strength of the magnetic field is indicated by the density of the field lines**; the magnetic field is stronger in regions where the field lines are relatively close together and weaker where they are relatively far apart.

Figure 14: Plotting of magnetic field lines of a magnet using a compass.

We use the **direction of the field lines at a point to define the direction of a vector quantity called magnetic flux density B** (it will be defined later on pg 15.)

Furthermore, the **magnitude of this quantity will indicate the strength of the magnetic field**. Nearer to the source, the magnetic field is stronger and thus B will have a greater magnitude.

The SI unit for magnetic flux density is the **tesla (T)**.

The magnetic field is sometimes called the B-field.

### 14.2 Currents can generate Magnetic Fields

Before the 1800s, magnetism and electricity were considered to be two independent topics. Although there were a number of scientists who thought the two topics were related, they were unsuccessful in finding the link. It was only in 1820 that a Danish physicist, Hans Christian Oersted, discovered the link. He observed that a compass needle swung almost perpendicular to a current-carrying conductor as if attracted by a powerful magnet. This discovery prompted Ampere to work out the mathematical relationship between currents and magnetic fields known as Ampere's force law (not required in the 'A' level syllabus). It also inspired Faraday's work on electromagnetic induction. Oersted's discovery, which linked the motion of electric charges with the creation of a magnetic field, marked the beginning of an important discipline called electromagnetism.

Two important observations were made about the **magnetic field due to current-carrying conductors**:

1. The direction of the magnetic field is always perpendicular to the direction of the current.
2. The strength of the magnetic field produced is dependent on the magnitude of the current.

Previously, we detected the presence of a magnetic field of a magnet by observing how the iron filings align themselves when sprinkled around the magnet. A similar effect is observed when we sprinkle iron filings around a current-carrying wire.

Figure 14.2.1: Compasses deflected when the current is on.

The direction of the magnetic field lines can be easily determined using the Right-Hand Grip Rule.

#### Magnetic-Field Patterns

##### Long Straight Current-Carrying Conductor

Figure 14.2.3 shows the magnetic-field pattern produced by a long straight current-carrying conductor.

##### Magnetic-field pattern

Figure 14.2.2: Using the right-hand grip rule to determine the direction of the magnetic field due to a current-carrying conductor.

Figure 14.2.3: Magnetic-field pattern due to a long straight current-carrying conductor.

2. When drawing the lines, it is extremely important to show the _field lines spreading further and further apart as \(d\) increases_. This is because the B-field is getting weaker as we move away from the source (i.e. the wire).

The magnetic flux density, \(B\), at a distance, \(d\), from a long straight wire carrying a current, \(I\), is given by

\[B=\frac{\mu_{o}I}{2\pi d}\]

where \(\mu_{o}\) is the _permeability of free space_, which has the value 4m x 10\({}^{-7}\) H m\({}^{-1}\).

Thus, \(B\) is _directly proportional_ to \(I\) but is _inversely proportional_ to the perpendicular distance \(d\) from the wire.

#### 14.2.1.2 Flat Circular Coil

The right-hand grip rule can still be used to determine the direction of the magnetic field lines produced by a current in circular coils. In general, there are 2 different methods that can be used:

1. For the straight-current scenario, the thumb represents the current and the coiling fingers representing the B-field.
2. For "circular" currents, we can exchange the fingers and the thumb to let the coiling fingers represent the direction of the currents in the circular coils and the thumb the direction of the magnetic-field lines passing through the cross-sectional area of the circular coils.

1. Using the thumb to represent the B-field also allows us to determine the "north" pole of the circular coil, since B-field lines originate from the "north" pole of the magnet. This will be very useful later.
2. It is sometimes difficult to tell from the diagram which part represents the "front" of the coils. Standard conventions include using a thicker / bolder line for the "front" and a dotted line for the "back" of the coil.

The magnetic flux density, \(B\), at the _centre of a flat circular coil_ of \(N\) turns, radius, \(r\), and carrying current, \(I\), is given by

\[B=\frac{\mu_{o}NI}{2r}\]

where \(\mu_{o}\) is the **permeability of free space** which has the value 4\(\mathrm{\SIUnitSymbolMicro x}\)\(10^{-7}\)\(\mathrm{H}\)\(\mathrm{m}^{-1}\).

Again, we observe the same relationship as the magnetic field due to a long straight current-carrying conductor, that is, \(B\)**is _directly proportional_ to \(I\) but is _inversely proportional_ to the radius of the **circular coil, \(r\).**

Figure 14.2.4 Magnetic-field pattern of current flowing in circular loop.

1. The magnetic field produced by a long current-carrying solenoid is **uniform** for the length of the solenoid except for the ends of the solenoid. This is represented by the **parallel, equally-spaced lines along the axis of the solenoid.
2. The solenoid also has a "north" and a "south" pole. In fact, its field pattern is very similar to that of a bar magnet.
3. The magnetic flux density **at the ends is half the magnetic flux density at the center** of the solenoid.

The magnetic flux density, \(B\), at the _centre of a long solenoid_ with \(n\) turns per unit length and carrying current, \(I\), is given by

\[B=\mu_{o}nI\]

where \(\mu_{o}\) is the **permeability of free space** which has the value 4\(\pi\) x 10-7 H m-1.

Here, \(B\) is _directly proportional_ to \(I\) and \(n\) (the number of turns per unit length).

Note that \(n\) (lower-case \(n\)) is the _number of turns per unit length_, whereas \(N\) (capital \(N\)) is the _total number of turns_.

For the A-level examination, the above formulae (magnetic flux density due to a long straight wire, a flat circular coil and a long solenoid) are provided in the formulae list and you are expected to know what the symbols mean.

### Effect of a ferrous core

One way of strengthening the magnetic field of a solenoid is to insert a piece of soft iron (ferrous core) into the solenoid. The resultant magnetic flux density of the solenoid will be enhanced.

The magnetic domains in the soft iron cause the magnetic field to strengthen. Inserting the soft iron causes the permeability of free space, \(\mu_{o}\), to change to permeability of iron, \(\mu\). Materials that strengthen magnetic field in this manner are described as _ferromagnetic_.

Examples of ferromagnetic materials include soft iron, cobalt and nickel. They can all be magnetized.

### 14.3 Currents Experiencing a Force when in a Magnetic Field

Since currents can generate a magnetic field and magnetized conductors behave like magnets, maybe a current-carrying wire will experience a magnetic force when placed in a magnetic field too. Figure 14.3.1 shows the results of such an experiment.

Observations from this experiment show that there is a relationship between the magnetic flux density of the magnetic field present and the force experienced by the current-carrying wire.

**Maximum force** is experienced by the wire when the magnetic flux density \(B\) and the wire are **perpendicular to each other**. The direction of the force that results is perpendicular to both \(B\) and the wire. Quantitatively, in this orientation, we have

\[F_{n}=BIL\]

where \(F_{B}\) is the force exerted on the wire, \(I\) is the current in the wire and \(L\) is the length of the wire.

The relative directions are easily determined using **Fleming's Left-Hand Rule**,

Figure 14.3.2: Fleming’s Left-Hand Rule.

#### Calculating the Force on a Current in an External Magnetic Field

Fleming's Left-Hand Rule allows you to determine the direction of the magnetic force \(F_{B}\) on a current-carrying conductor placed perpendicular to a magnetic flux density \(B\). However, in general, the angle between \(B\) and \(I\) can be any angle \(\theta\). The magnetic force \(F_{B}\) experienced by the conductor is _always perpendicular_ to the plane containing \(B\) and \(I\). Fleming's Left-Hand Rule can still be applied in such instances to determine the orientation of \(F_{B}\).

In Figure 14.3.3, the component of the magnetic flux density perpendicular to the conductor is given by

\[B_{\perp}=B\sin\theta\]

where \(\theta\) is the angle between \(B\) and \(I\).

Hence, the magnetic force on the straight conductor is given by

\[F_{B}=B_{\perp}IL\]

where \(L\) is the length of the conductor carrying current, \(I\), in the magnetic field, \(B_{\perp}\) is the magnetic flux density perpendicular to the current carrying conductor.

By Fleming's Left-Hand Rule, the magnetic force is directed into the page.

### Defining the Magnetic Flux Density and the Tesla

We may now define quantitatively the magnetic flux density, \(B\).

Definition of Maquetic Flux Density, \(B\):

The **magnetic flux density** is defined as the **force per unit length per unit current acting on a **straight** current-carrying conductor placed **perpendicular to a magnetic field.

Definition of Tesla (T):

The magnetic flux density of a magnetic field is 1 tesla if the force per unit length per unit current which acts on a straight current-carrying conductor placed perpendicular to the magnetic field is 1 newton per metre per ampere.

Magnetic flux density, \(B\), is a **vector** quantity and the **S.I. unit is the tesla (T)**.

For different shapes of current-carrying wires, the magnetic fields around the wires will in general be different. There are ways to measure experimentally the value of \(B\), which generally depends on the current that is generating the magnetic field as well as the distance from the wire.

#### Measuring Magnetic Flux Density using a Current Balance

How a current balance works:

1. A wire frame AXYC is balanced on 2 knife edges through which a current \(I\) can pass from a battery. The frame is arranged such that the side AC of the frame (of length \(L\)) lies within the magnetic field whose flux density \(B\) is to be determined.

Figure 14.4.1: Current balance.

2. When there is no current, the frame is horizontal, as the force acting on AC is zero. When current flows through, a magnetic force acts on AC and pushes that side of the frame downwards (by Fleming's Left-Hand Rule).
3. A known mass is loaded on the right side to restore the frame to its horizontal position.
4. Consider the forces acting on the wire frame, taking moments about the knife edges, clockwise moments = anticlockwise moments \((mg)v\)\(=(BIL)u\)\(=\)\(B=\frac{mgv}{ILu}\)

### Forces Between 2 Long Parallel Current-Carrying Conductors

Now that we know that a currents can generate magnetic fields like magnets, and that they can also experience a magnetic force when they are near other magnets, let's consider what happens if we replace the magnet with another current-carrying wire.

When 2 parallel long wires are placed in a vacuum, **each wire experiences a force as it will be in a magnetic field generated by the other wire**.

Current \(I_{X}\) sets up a magnetic field that interacts with current \(I_{Y}\). Therefore the force acting on \(I_{Y}\) due to the magnetic field \(Bx\) (generated by \(Ix\)) is \(F_{xx}=B_{x}I_{Y}I\) (\(l:\text{length of the wire}\))

Recall that \(B_{X}\) is given by \(B_{x}=\frac{\mu_{0}I_{x}}{2\pi}\)

Hence the force \(F_{xx}=\frac{\mu_{0}I_{x}I_{Y}l}{2\pi}\)

The direction of the force on \(Ix\) can be found using Fleming's Left-Hand Rule. In this case, the force on \(I_{Y}\) due to \(I_{X}\) is towards \(I_{X}\). We can go through the same analysis to understand the force acting on \(I_{X}\) as a result of \(I_{Y}\), or we can simply apply **Newton's 3\({}^{\text{rd}}\) law** and conclude that the force on \(I_{X}\) due to \(I_{Y}\) is of the same magnitude but in the opposite direction.

Hence the force on \(I_{X}\) due to \(I_{Y}\) is also \(F_{XY}=\frac{\mu_{0}I_{x}I_{Y}l}{2\pi}\).

Figure 14.5.1: Two long parallel current-carrying conductors.

It is interesting to note that in this case where the two currents are flowing in the same direction, the force between them is attractive. We can apply a similar analysis to currents flowing in opposite directions and find that the force between them is repulsive.

A simple way of remembering the conclusion is

"LIKE CURRENTS ATTRACT, UNLIKE CURRENTS REPEL."

Figure 14.5.2 Sketch showing the magnetic fields and forces on parallel current-carrying wires.

### Revisiting the DC Motor

Consider a rectangular coil PQRS of \(N\) turns pivoted so that it can rotate freely about a vertical axis which is perpendicular to a uniform horizontal magnetic field of flux density \(B\). Let the normal to the plane of the coil make an angle \(\theta\) with the field (Figure 14.6.1 (b)).

The side PS of length \(h\) is perpendicular to the magnetic field (from N to S) and so the magnetic force \(f\) on it is given by

\[f=BIh\]

If the coil has \(N\) turns, the length of the conductor is increased \(N\) times and so the force acting on side PS is

\[F=NBIh\]

The force acting on side QR is also given by \(F=NBIh\), but its direction is opposite to that on PS, as shown in Figure 14.6.1 (b). The force on side PQ cancels out the force on side SR as these two forces are equal in magnitude but opposite in direction.

The two forces on sides PS and QR tend to turn the coil about a vertical axis passing through the middle of the coil. These two forces together form a couple and the torque due to this couple is given by

\[\tau=F(b\mathrm{sin}\theta)\]

But \(h\) x_b_ = Area, \(A\) of the coil. So

\[\tau=NBIA\,\mathrm{sin}\,\theta\]

To provide continuous rotating motion in one direction, the current in the coil must periodically reverse direction.

### Magnetic Force on a Moving Electric Charge

If we look into the microscopic view of the charges moving in a magnetic field, an expression for the magnitude of the force acting on a charge \(Q\) moving with velocity \(\mathbf{v}\) in a magnetic field of flux density \(B\) is given by

\[F_{B}=B_{\perp}Q\mathbf{v}\]

where \(B_{\perp}\)is the component of the magnetic flux density perpendicular to the velocity of the moving charges.

Note:

1. The magnetic force is maximum when the charge is moving perpendicularly to the magnetic field.
2. A charge in a magnetic field does not experience any force when

* it is moving parallel to the direction of the magnetic field,
* it is stationary in the field.
3. If the direction of the magnetic flux density and the velocity of the charged particles are perpendicular, the direction of the magnetic force on a charge moving in a magnetic field can be determined using Fleming's Left Hand Rule. By convention, the direction of conventional current is given by the direction of flow of positive charges.

Figure 14.7.2 Applying Fleming's Left-Hand Rule on the motion of positive and negative chargeExample: For a particle with a positive charge \(Q\) moving with a velocity \(v\) at an angle \(\theta\) to the magnetic field as shown below:

Magnetic force \(F\) acting on the moving charge is directed into the plane of the paper (_Fleming's Left-Hand Rule_)

\[\begin{array}{l}F=(B\sin\theta)\,Q\,v\\ =B\Omega_{v}\,\sin\theta\end{array}\]

### Motion of a Charged Particle in a Uniform Magnetic Field

Let's now look at how moving charges that are not confined within a wire are affected by a magnetic field. We will again use Fleming's Left-Hand Rule to find the direction of this force.

Consider a positively charged particle moving at velocity \(v\) in a uniform magnetic field \(B\).

Figure 14.8.1 Charge moving at a velocity \(v\) in a uniform magnetic field

Using Fleming's Left Hand Rule, and the concept that the direction of the convention current is the direction of motion of the positively charged particle, we can deduce that the direction of the magnetic force acting on the charged particle at this instant is upwards within the plane of the plane. This causes the particle to be deflected from its initial path.

However, the direction of the force remains perpendicular to the directions of both velocity and magnetic field (Fleming's Left Hand Rule) even as the charged particle deflects, hence the charged particle will move in a circular path! The **magnetic force acting on the moving charge provides the centripetal force** for it to move in a circular path.

The magnetic force on the positive charge provides the centripetal force:

\[Bqv=\frac{mv^{2}}{r}\,\]

where r is the radius of the circular path

\[r=\frac{mv}{Bq}\]

From this equation for the radius of the path, we can deduce that for particles entering the magnetic field with the **same velocity**, the **radius would be proportional to the mass-to-charge ratio** of the particle (i.e. \(\frac{m}{q}\)). The ratio of the charge on a particle to the mass of the particle (i.e. \(\frac{q}{m}\)) is known as the _specific charge_.

If \(T\) is the time taken to complete one revolution of the circular path and \(v\) is the constant speed of the charge,

\[v=r\omega\] \[v=r\frac{2\pi}{T}\] \[v= \left(\frac{mv}{Bq}\right)\frac{2\pi}{T}\] \[T=\frac{2\pi m}{Bq}\]

The **period _T_** is dependent on the mass, the magnetic flux density, and the charge of the particle. It is independent of the speed of the particle or the radius of the circular path.

Figure 14.8.2 A positively charged particle performing circular motion in a magnetic field

1. Similar to the force acting on a straight current-carrying conductor placed in the magnetic field, we have to remember that the _angle \(\theta\) is the angle between the direction of motion and the magnetic field lines_. Examiners may try to trick you by defining a different \(\theta\).
2. For negatively charged particles moving in a magnetic field, the magnitude of the force is still the same. However, when determining the direction of the force, for _positively charged particles, the direction of \(I\) is the direction of \(\nu\), but for negatively charged particles, the direction of \(I\) is opposite to the direction of \(\nu\)_.
3. It is very common in exam questions to be asked to draw the path taken by moving charges in a magnetic field. Apply Fleming's Left Hand Rule (remember the sign of the charge is important) to find the direction of the magnetic force, which is also the direction of the centripetal force. The centripetal force acts towards the centre of the circular motion, and hence deflects the moving charge in the direction of the force, or imagine where the centre of the circular motion is, and you should be able to draw the path correctly. Please ensure that the path is as circular as possible, that is, you should draw with a set of compasses. If you really don't have one in the exam, then label the path drawn as 'circular path'.
4. The **magnetic force does no work on the charged particle during the circular motion** as it is perpendicular to \(\nu\). Hence, the speed and kinetic energy of the charge remain the same as it moves along the circular path.

\end{tabular}

For an electric field of \(10^{4}\) N C-1, the ratio of the magnitude of the electric force \(qE\) to the magnitude of the gravitational force \(mg\) is of the order of \(10^{14}\) for an electron and \(10^{11}\) for a proton.

\begin{tabular}{|p{142.3pt}|p{142.3pt}|} \hline
**Tips** & Thus, we can consider an electron only experiences an electric force in an E field. Once it leaves the E field, it will obey Newton's first law of motion and continue to move in a straight line at constant speed.

It is possible for a charged particle to move into a region where a uniform electric field and a uniform magnetic field are applied. The charged particle will experience an electric force and a magnetic force simultaneously.

**We will use Newton's laws of motion to determine the resultant force acting on the charged particle, to predict its motion.**

In the special case where the electric force and magnetic force are of **equal magnitude and opposite in direction**, the charged particle will travel in a straight line as the resultant force is zero.

Let us take a closer look at a practical example as follows.

### 14.10 Velocity Selector

In many experiments involving moving charged particles, it is important that all particles move with essentially the same speed. This can be achieved by applying a combination of a uniform electric field and a uniform magnetic field oriented as shown in Figure 14.10.

It experiences an electric force \(qE\) that is downwards (in the same direction as the electric field) and a magnetic force \(Bqv\) that is upwards (Fleming's Left Hand Rule). By adjusting the magnitudes of the electric and magnetic fields, we can set up a scenario so that \(qE=Bqv\) and **the particle experiences no resultant force**, and moves through the fields in a straight horizontal line

\[\begin{array}{c}\Sigma F=0\\ F_{B}=F_{E}\\ Bqv=qE\\ v=\frac{E}{B}=\frac{V}{Bd}\end{array}\]

When we have **many particles of**_different speeds_ **being projected into this region**, **only particles of velocity**\(v=\frac{E}{B}\) **will pass through undeflected**.

For particles with speeds **greater than this**, the **magnetic force will be larger than the electric force** and deflect upwards.

For particles with **speeds less than this**, the **magnetic force will be less than the electric force**, and they deflect downwards.

Not all uniform E and B fields that are perpendicular to each other will work as a velocity selector. It is important to note that the concept behind this application is that the **particle experiences no resultant force when travelling in the crossed fields**. Hence it is important to ensure that the **direction of the electric force is opposite to the direction of the magnetic force** set up by the two fields.

## APPENDIX A: Earth as a Magnet

A suspended magnet or compass points northward because Earth itself is a huge magnet. The compass aligns with the magnetic field of the Earth. The magnetic poles of the Earth, however, do not coincide with the geographic poles - in fact, the magnetic and geographical poles are widely separated. The magnetic pole in the northern hemisphere, for example, is now located nearly 1800 km from the geographic pole, somewhere in the Hudson Bay region of northern Canada. The other pole is located south of Australia. This means that compasses do not generally point to the true north. The discrepancy between the orientation of a compass and true north is known as the _magnetic declination_.

Also, Earth's magnetic field lines are not parallel to the surface at all points. Near the magnetic poles, the field lines are almost perpendicular to the surface of the Earth. At the magnetic Equator, the magnetic field lines are almost parallel to the surface of the earth. The angle that the magnetic field makes with respect to the surface at any point is known as the _angle of dip or inclination_.

We do not know exactly why Earth itself is a magnet. The configuration of Earth's magnetic field is like that of a strong bar magnet placed near the centre of Earth. But Earth is not a magnetized chunk of iron like a bar magnet. It is simply too hot for individual atoms to hold to a proper orientation. So the explanation must lie with electric currents deep in the interior. About 2000 km below the outer rocky mantle (which itself is almost 3000 km thick) lies the molten part that surrounds the solid centre. Most Earth scientists think that moving charges looping around within the molten part of Earth create the magnetic field. Some Earth scientists speculate that the electric currents are the result of convection currents from heat rising from the central core and that such convection currents combined with the rotational effects of the Earth produce Earth's magnetic field. Because of the Earth's great size, the speed of moving charges need only be about a millimetre per second to account for the field. A firmer explanation awaits more study.

Whatever the cause, the magnetic field of the Earth is not stable; it has wandered throughout geologic time. Evidence of this comes from the analysis of magnetic properties of rock strata. Iron atoms in a molten state are disoriented because of thermal motion, but a slight predominance of the iron atoms align with the magnetic field of the Earth. When cooling and solidification occurs, this predominance records the direction of the Earth's magnetic field in the resulting igneous rock. It is similar for sedimentary rocks, where magnetic domains in grains of iron that settle in sediments tend to align themselves with Earth's magnetic field and become locked into the rock that forms. The slight magnetism that results can be measured with sensitive instruments. As samples of rock are tested from different strata formed throughout geologic time, the magnetic field of the Earth for different periods can be charted. This evidence shows that there have been times when the magnetic field of the Earth has diminished to zero, followed by reversal of the poles. More than twenty reversals have taken place in the past 5 million years. The most recent occurred 700,000 years ago. Prior reversals happened 870,000 and 950,000 years ago. Studies of deep-sea sediments indicate that the field was virtually switched off for 10,000 to 20,000 years just over 1 million years ago. We cannot predict when the next reversal will occur because the reversal sequence is not regular. But there is a clue in recent measurements that show a decrease of more than 5% of the Earth's magnetic field strength in the last 100 years. If this change is maintained, we may well have another reversal within 2000 years.

The reversal of magnetic poles is not unique to the Earth. The Sun's magnetic field reverses regularly, with a period of 22 years. This 22-year magnetic cycle has been linked, through evidence in tree rings, to periods of drought on Earth. Interestingly enough, the long-known, 11-year sunspot cycle is just half the time during which the Sun gradually reverses its magnetic polarity.

Varying ion winds in Earth's atmosphere cause more rapid but much smaller fluctuations in Earth's magnetic field. Ions in this region are produced by the energetic interactions of solar ultraviolet rays and X-rays with atmospheric atoms. The motion of these ions produces a small but important part of Earth's magnetic field. Like the lower layers of air, the ionosphere is churned by winds. The variations in these winds are responsible for nearly all of the fast fluctuations in the Earth's magnetic field.

## APPENDIX B: The Cyclotron

A cyclotron is a device that can accelerate charged particles to very high speeds. The energetic particles produced are used to bombard atomic nuclei and thereby produce nuclear reactions of interest to researchers.

Both electric and magnetic forces play a key role in the cyclotron. The charges move inside two semi-circular containers D\({}_{1}\) and D\({}_{2}\), referred to as Rees. A high frequency alternating potential difference is applied across the Rees and a uniform magnetic field is directed perpendicularly to them. A positive ion released near the centre of the magnet in one Ree moves in a semi-circular path and arrives back at the gap in a time interval of 7/2 where \(T\) is the time needed to make one complete trip around the Rees.

The frequency of the applied potential difference is adjusted so that the polarity of the Rees is reversed at the same time interval during which the ion travels around one Ree. The ion then accelerates across the gap from D\({}_{1}\) to D\({}_{2}\) and its kinetic energy increases by _qV_ where \(V\) is the potential difference set up across the Rees.

It now moves with a larger radius in D\({}_{2}\) due to the increase in speed. After 7/2, it arrives at the gap again, coinciding with the reversing of the polarity of the potential difference set up across the Rees. The ion thus accelerates again across the gap and the cycle repeats itself. Every time the ion passes the gap, it gains an energy of _qV_. By the time it exits the cyclotron, it would have garnered about 20 MeV.

## APPENDIX C: Charges moving in non-uniform magnetic fields

When charged particles move in a non-uniform magnetic field, the motion becomes complex. An example of such field is one where it is strong at the ends and weak in the middle as shown in Figure 1 below. This configuration is known as the magnetic bottle. A charged particle starting at one end spirals along the field lines until it reaches the other end, where it reverses its path and spirals back. The charged particle is therefore trapped within it.

Charged particles originate mainly from the sun (and other stars and heavenly bodies) and are commonly known as cosmic rays; they consist of protons, alpha particles, and other atomic nuclei, as well as some high-energy electrons. In any event, they travel through space at fantastic speeds and make up the cosmic radiation that is hazardous to astronauts. This radiation is intensified when the Sun is active and contributes added energetic particles. Cosmic rays are also a hazard to electronic instrumentation in space; impacts of heavily ionizing cosmic-ray nuclei can cause computer memory bits to "flip" or small microcircuits to fail. Fortunately for those of us on Earth's surface, most of these charged particles are deflected away by the magnetic field of the Earth.

Due to the Earth's non-uniform magnetic field, some of these particles are trapped and spiral around the field lines from pole to pole, making the Van Allen belts. When the particles are located near the poles, they sometimes collide with the atoms in the atmosphere, causing atoms to emit visible light. Such collisions are the origins of the beautiful Aurora Borealis (Northern Lights) and Aurora Australis (Southern Lights).

### Introduction

In the previous chapter, we discussed the production of magnetic fields due to electric currents. As nature is often symmetric, this led scientists to suspect that the reverse (i.e. the production of electric currents due to magnetic fields) could also be possible. Experiments conducted by Michael Faraday and independently by Joseph Henry in 1831 showed that a changing magnetic field could indeed produce electric current in a circuit. These results led to a fundamental law known as Faraday's Law. In this chapter, we will discuss Faraday's Law and see how his experimental findings have helped set the foundation for many of modern world's technologies.

### Magnetic Flux and Magnetic Flux Linkage

We have learnt that magnetic flux density, \(\mathbf{B}\), is a measure of magnetic fields. Before we learn about electromagnetic induction, we need to understand what is meant by the term magnetic flux.

Definition of Magnetic Flux, \(\phi\): The **magnetic flux** through a plane surface is the product of the area and the component of the magnetic flux density perpendicular to that area,

\[\phi=\mathbf{B}_{\perp}\mathbf{A}\]

where \(\phi\): magnetic flux through the plane surface

\(\mathbf{B}_{\perp}\): magnetic flux density perpendicular to the plane surface

\(\mathbf{A}\): area of the surface

The magnetic flux for two different cases is given below.

Definition of weber (Wb): One weber is the amount of magnetic flux through a surface if a magnetic field of flux density of one tesla exists perpendicularly to an area of 1 m\({}^{2}\).

1 Wb = 1 T x 1 m\({}^{2}\)

In the previous chapter, we learnt that the S.I. unit for the magnetic flux density, \(B\), is the tesla (T). An alternative unit for \(B\) is Wb m\({}^{2}\).

Note that magnetic flux density, \(B\), is a vector, but magnetic flux, \(\phi\), is a scalar.

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:595]

### Induced e.m.f. in a Moving Conductor (Motional e.m.f.)

In the previous topic on Electromagnetism, we learnt that the magnetic force experienced by a current-carrying conductor in a magnetic field is given by \(F_{B}=BIL\sin\theta\), where \(\theta\) is the angle between \(B\) and \(I\).

Similarly, the magnetic force acting on a moving charge \(Q\) with velocity \(\nu\) in a magnetic field of flux density \(B\) is given by \(F_{B}=BQ\nu\sin\theta\), where \(\theta\) is the angle between \(B\) and \(\nu\).

Next, we shall look at the effects of a moving conductor in a magnetic field.

Figure 15.3.1 shows a copper rod that moves between the poles of a magnet, while being connected in series to a sensitive ammeter.

* When the copper rod is moved downwards, the pointer on the meter flicks to a particular direction suggesting that an e.m.f. has been induced.
* When the rod is moved upwards, the meter flicks to the opposite direction, suggesting that an e.m.f. has now been induced in the opposite direction.
* If the rod is held stationary in the field or made to move along the magnetic field lines, there is no induced e.m.f.
* The **faster** the copper rod is moved, the **larger** the current.

It appears that _an e.m.f. is induced in a moving conductor if it is moving through a magnetic field._**The _magnitude of this induced e.m.f. is proportional to the speed._**

We shall now derive an expression for the induced e.m.f. for a moving conductor. Consider a straight conductor or moving rod of length \(L\) moving perpendicularly at a constant velocity \(\nu\) under the influence of some external agent through a uniform magnetic field \(B\) directed into the page as shown in Figure 15.3.2.

The electrons in the conductor experience a magnetic force \(F_{B}=BQ\nu\) that is directed along the length \(L\), perpendicular to both \(\nu\) and \(B\), where \(Q\) is the charge of the electron. Under the influence of this force, the electrons move to the lower end of the conductor and accumulate there, leaving a net positive charge at the upper end. As a result of this charge separation, an electric field \(E\) is produced inside the conductor.

The electrons accumulate at \(D\), leaving a net positive charge at \(C\), until the downward magnetic force \(F_{B}=BQv\) is balanced by the upward electric force \(F_{E}=QE\). At this point, the electrons stop moving.

The condition for equilibrium requires that

\[BQv = QE\] \[E = Bv\]

In the topic on electric fields, you have learned that the electric field between two charged parallel plates is given by \(E=\Delta V/\ L\), where \(\Delta V\) is the potential difference between the plates and \(L\) is the distance between the plates. Thus, the electric field produced in the conductor in Figure 15.3.2 (once the electrons stop moving and \(E\) is constant) is related to the **potential difference across the ends of the conductor** by

\[V_{CD}=EL=BLv\]

where the upper end \(C\) **is at a higher electric potential than the lower end \(D\). Thus, from the above equation, we can see that a potential difference is maintained between the ends of the conductor as long as the conductor continues to move through the uniform magnetic field. If the direction of the motion is reversed, the polarity of the potential difference is also reversed.

In the scenario above, **only an e.m.f. is induced across the rod.** As the circuit is not complete or closed, there is _no induced current_ flowing in the rod.

Now suppose the moving rod slides along a stationary U-shaped conductor, forming a complete circuit. Using the knowledge from Figure 15.3.2, the charges move in the moving part CD, causing a current to flow in an anti-clockwise direction as shown in Figure 15.3.3. We call this e.m.f. a motional electromotive force, denoted by \(\varepsilon\). The magnitude of this e.m.f. is given by the rate of change of magnetic flux, \(\Phi\) (see discussion on Faraday's Law in section 15.4.2)

\[\varepsilon=\frac{d\phi}{dt}=B\frac{dA}{dt}=BLv\]

If the total resistance of the U-shaped conductor and the sliding rod is \(R\), the induced current \(I\) in the circuit is given by \(BLv=I\ R\).

#### (i) Factors affecting magnitude of induced e.m.f.

From the formula \(\varepsilon=BLv\), we can easily infer that increasing one or more of the following factors will increase the magnitude of the induced e.m.f..

* The magnetic field strength \(B\);
* The length of the moving conductor within the magnetic field \(L\);
* The speed at which the conductor is moving \(v\).

Conversely, decreasing one or more of these factors will lead to a decreased magnitude of the induced e.m.f..

**(ii) Direction of motional e.m.f.**

The direction of motional e.m.f. (and induced current, if any) can be predicted by **Fleming's Right-Hand Rule**.

Often we are asked to state the polarity of the induced e.m.f., or which end of the conductor is at the higher/lower potential. To answer that question correctly, we must keep in mind that when the Fleming's Right-hand rule is used, we are _modelling the conductor as an e.m.f. source, with its two ends acting like the two terminals of a battery_.

**Example 3**: **Magnitude and polarity of induced e.m.f.**

An airplane is travelling at 100 m s-\({}^{\ast}\) in a direction which is horizontal. Calculate the e.m.f. induced between the tips of its wings, which have a span of 20 m. Take the Earth's magnetic flux density to be 5.0 x 10-5 T and the angle of dip at the place to be 71\({}^{\circ}\). Indicate which tip is at a higher potential with a "+".

**Wing span \(I=20\) m**

**Figure 15.3.4**: Fleming’s Right-Hand Rule.

### 15.4 Laws of Electromagnetic Induction

#### Faraday's Experiment and Findings

In the last section we saw that relative motion between a magnetic field and a conductor can induce an e.m.f. in the conductor. An experiment carried out by Michael Faraday in 1825 showed how the same effect can be achieved with no apparent relative motion. Figure 15.4.1 shows the setup that led to his discovery.

A primary coil is connected to a battery and a switch. The coil is wrapped around a wooden core, and a current in the coil produces a magnetic field when the switch is closed.

A secondary coil also is wrapped around the wooden core and is connected to a sensitive galvanometer. No battery is connected in the secondary circuit and the secondary coil is not connected to the primary coil.

Faraday observed that:

* At the instant the switch is closed, the galvanometer needle deflects in one direction and returns to zero.
* When there is a steady current in the primary coil, the galvanometer always shows null deflection, no matter how large the current is.
* At the instant the switch is opened, the galvanometer needle deflects in the opposite direction and returns to zero.

In order to explain these observations, Faraday invoked the concept of changing magnetic flux linkage between the coils. His given explanation was:

1. When the switch is closed, the **magnetic field produced by the current in the primary circuit** increases from zero to a constant value over some finite time. The **secondary coil experiences this changing magnetic flux linkage produced by the primary circuit** and the induced current only exists for a short time while the magnetic flux linkage through the secondary coil is increasing.
2. Once the magnetic field produced by the primary coil reaches a steady value, the **magnetic flux linkage through the secondary coil is constant** and there is no current in the secondary coil.
3. When the switch is opened, the opposite occurs - the **magnetic field produced by the current in the primary circuit decreases** from the constant value to zero over some finite time. Again, the **secondary coil experiences this changing magnetic flux linkage produced by the primary circuit** and the induced current flows [in the opposite direction to that in (1)] while the magnetic flux linkage through the secondary coil is decreasing.

In effect, when induced current flows in the secondary coil, the secondary circuit behaves as though a source of e.m.f. were connected to it. Hence, Faraday concluded that **there will be an induced e.m.f. in the secondary circuit if it experiences a changing magnetic flux linkage.**

With further experiments, he concluded that the **induced e.m.f. is directly proportional to the rate of change of magnetic flux linkage,** which led to the Law of electromagnetic induction.

Figure 15.4.1: Faraday’s experiment.

#### Faraday's Law

The _magnitude_ of the induced e.m.f. \(\varepsilon\) is _directly proportional_ to the _rate of change_ of magnetic flux linkage or rate of cutting of magnetic flux._

\[\varepsilon\propto\frac{d\phi}{dt}\]

The S.I unit for induced e.m.f., \(\varepsilon\), is the volt (V). An alternative unit for induced e.m.f. is Wb turns s\({}^{-1}\).

#### 15.4.3 Lenz's Law

The Russian physicist Heinrich Lenz (1804 - 1865) made a discovery that allows the polarity of the induced e.m.f. to be determined. This discovery led to Lenz's Law.

Lenz's Law states that the **polarity of the induced e.m.f.** is such that it tends to produce a current that **creates a magnetic field so as to oppose the change in magnetic flux.**

Consider the following scenario:

If the bar magnet is moved rightwards towards the stationary metal loop (Figure 15.4.2), the flux through the loop increases with time. The increasing flux induces an e.m.f. in the metal loop (Faraday's Law), and since the loop forms a closed circuit, a current is produced. This induced current produces its own magnetic field. By Lenz's law, the direction of the induced current must be such as to produce a magnetic field directed in the **opposite direction** to the **strengthening external field.**

If the magnet is moved to the left (Figure 15.4.3), the flux through the loop decreases with time. The decreasing flux again induces an e.m.f. in the metal loop (Faraday's Law). However, this time the direction of the induced current is such as to produce a magnetic field that is directed in **the same direction** as the **weakening external field.**

Figure 15.4.3 Magnet moving away from loop.

Notice also that the interaction of the two magnetic fields (produced by the magnet and the loop, respectively) produces magnetic forces. Note that **the direction of the induced current is such that the magnet experiences a repulsion force when approaching the loop and an attractive force when moving away from the loop.**

This leads to the important insight that **Lenz's Law is merely a re-statement of the law of conservation of energy**. The direction of induced current is always such as to (produce a magnetic force to) oppose the motion of the magnet (which was the cause of the electromagnetic induction). Since the motion of the magnet is opposed, work must be done in order to maintain the motion of the magnet. This mechanical work enables the conversion of energy into electrical energy. This is further illustrated in Figure 15.4.4.

In summary,

1. **Faraday's Law** enables us to determine the **magnitude** of induced e.m.f. (applicable to both open and closed circuits).
2. **Lenz's Law** allows us to determine the **polarity** of induced e.m.f. or **direction of induced current** (applicable only to closed circuits). If circuit is open, we usually think in terms of what would happen if it was closed and hence find the direction of the induced current)

Combining both Faraday's and Lenz's Laws, we get:

\[\varepsilon=-\frac{d\phi}{dt}\]

The **negative sign** in the above equation is a **consequence of Lenz's law**.

Figure 15.4.4: Illustration of Lenz’s Law in view of the law of conservation of energy.

**Example 4** **Determination of average induced e.m.f.**

A flat circular coil of diameter 30 mm has 500 turns and is situated so that the plane of the coil is perpendicular to a uniform magnetic field of flux density 20 mT. The flux density is reduced to zero and then increased to 20 mT in the opposite direction at a constant rate. The time taken for the whole operation is 60 ms.

What is the average value of the e.m.f. induced in the coil?

**Example 5** **Graphs of varying magnetic flux and e.m.f. induced**

The magnetic flux \(\phi\) through a coil varies with time as shown in the diagram. Which graph best represents the variation with time of the induced e.m.f. \(E\) in the coil?

**Example 6** **Application of Lenz's Law**

In the figure below, there is a constant magnetic field in a rectangular region of space. This field is directed perpendicularly into the plane of the paper. Outside this region, there is no magnetic field. A copper ring slides through the region, from position 1 to position 5. For each of the five positions, determine if an induced current exists in the ring and, if so, find the direction of the current.

### Practical Applications of Electromagnetic Induction

#### 15.5.1 Electric Generator (rotating coil in uniform magnetic field)

A coil of \(N\) turns, with area \(A\), rotates at a constant angular velocity \(\omega\) in a uniform magnetic field \(B\).

As the coil rotates in the magnetic field, it experiences a _changing magnetic flux linkage_ as the component of the magnetic field perpendicular to the plane of the coil keeps changing. By Faraday's law, an e.m.f. is induced in the coil.

Derivation of an expression for the induced e.m.f.

1. Magnetic flux linkage through the coil \[\phi=NB_{\perp}A=NBA\cos\theta=NBA\cos\omega t\]
2. Induced e.m.f. \[\varepsilon=-\frac{d\phi}{dt}=-\frac{d}{dt}(NBA\cos\omega t)=-NBA\frac{d}{dt}( \cos\omega t)\] \[\varepsilon=NBA\omega\sin\omega t\]

Hence the induced e.m.f. is dependent on \(N,B,A\) and \(\omega\). By Lenz's law, the direction of the induced e.m.f. is such that it sets up an induced current to oppose the rotation of the coil.

Figure 15.5.1: Rotating coil in a magnetic field, generating a current.

#### Speedometer of a Car

A permanent magnet is attached to the wheel of the car. A sensor consisting of a coil of wire is connected to the frame of the car. When the car moves, the magnet rotates with the wheel. As the magnet passes over the sensor, the magnetic flux in the coil rises and then falls. This induces an e.m.f. and a current in the coil. The induced current, in the form of pulses, is sent to an electronic device which counts the number of turns performed by the wheel in each second. With this information, the speed of the car can be calculated if the radius of the wheel is known and the speed can thus be displayed on the speedometer.

Figure 15.5.2 Speedometer.

#### Ground Fault Interrupters

The ground fault interrupter is a safety device that protects people against an electric shock when they touch appliances and power tools. In the diagram below, wire 1 leads from the wall outlet to the appliance to be protected and wire 2 leads from the appliance back to the wall outlet. An iron ring surrounds the two wires to confine the magnetic field set up by each wire. A sensing coil, which can activate a circuit breaker when changes in magnetic flux occur, is wrapped around part of the iron ring.

Since the currents in the wires are in opposite directions, the net magnetic field through the sensing coil due to the currents is zero. However, if a short circuit occurs in the appliance so that there is no returning current, the net magnetic field through the sensing coil is no longer zero. This can happen for example if one of the wires loses its insulation, providing a path through the person to ground if the person happens to be touching the appliance. As the current is alternating, the magnetic flux through the sensing coil changes with time, thus inducing an e.m.f. in the coil. This induced e.m.f. will trigger the circuit breaker, stopping the current quickly in about a millisecond before it reaches a level that might be harmful to the person using the appliance.

#### Electric Guitar

The pickup coil is placed near the vibrating guitar string, which is made of a metal that can be magnetized. The permanent magnet inside the coil magnetizes the portion of the string nearest the coil. When the guitar string vibrates at some frequency, its magnetized segment produces a changing magnetic flux through the pickup coil. The changing magnetic flux induces an e.m.f. in the coil. This induced e.m.f. or voltage is fed to an amplifier, the output of which is sent to the loudspeakers.

Figure 15.5.4: How the electric guitar works.

Figure 15.5.3: How the around fault interrupter works.

### Eddy Currents

As we have seen, e.m.f. and current can be induced in a circuit by a changing magnetic flux. This also results in eddy currents being induced in bulk pieces of metal moving through a magnetic field.

Consider a flat copper or aluminium plate attached to a rigid rod which swings back and forth through a magnetic field.

As the plate enters the field, the increasing magnetic flux induces an e.m.f. in the plate, which in turn causes the free electrons in the plate to move, producing swirling currents (eddy currents). Similarly, as the plate leaves the field, the decreasing magnetic flux causes eddy currents in the opposite direction. As the currents flow, the plate will heat up; its internal energy will increase. By the principle of conservation of energy, this means that the mechanical energy in the oscillating plate must reduce. This loss in mechanical energy will eventually bring the plate to rest.

Alternatively, according to Lenz's law, the eddy currents give rise to repulsive forces that opposes the motion of the plate. This retarding magnetic force will eventually bring the plate to a rest.

In order to reduce the amount of energy transformed from mechanical energy into internal energy, slots are cut into the plate, reducing the eddy currents and the corresponding retarding force. Also, conducting parts in devices are often laminated, which means they are built up in thin layers separated by a non-conducting material. This layered structure greatly increases the resistance of eddy current paths and effectively confines the currents to individual layers. Such a laminated structure is used in transformer cores.

However, eddy currents are often used in the braking system of many subway and rapid-transit cars. An electromagnet attached to the train is positioned near the steel rails. The braking action occurs when a large current is passed through the electromagnet. The motion of the magnet relative to the rails induces eddy currents in the rails, and the direction of these currents produces a drag force on the moving train. As the train slows down, the eddy currents decrease, hence the braking effect is quite smooth.

[style=] **Example 8**: **Magnetic Braking**

A copper disc spins freely between the poles of an unconnected electromagnet as shown. Describe and explain what will happen to the speed of rotation of the disc when a direct current flows in the electromagnet.

_Answer:_

_As the copper disc rotates, different parts of the copper disc pass through the magnetic field due to the electromagnet._

_Regions of the copper disc which are entering the electromagnet's magnetic field experience strengthening flux, leading to induced e.m.f. proportional to the rate of flux change (by Faraday's law). The induced e.m.f. causes the free electrons in the disc to move, producing eddy currents. The disc will heat up, and by the principle of conservation of energy, it will slow down and eventually come to rest. The polarity of the induced e.m.f. and current is such that it creates a magnetic flux in a direction opposite to the electromagnet's magnetic field, creating a repelling pole (by Lenz's law)._

_Regions of the copper disc leaving the electromagnet's magnetic field experience weakening flux, leading to an induced e.m.f. proportional to the rate of flux change (by Faraday's Law). The polarity of the induced e.m.f. and current is such that it creates a magnetic flux in the same direction as the electromagnet's magnetic field, creating an attracting pole (by Lenz's law)._

_For both regions, the direction of the magnetic force is always opposite to the direction of motion. The magnetic force retards the motion and slows down the spinning._

## Appendix 1 A Faraday's Disc with area \(A\) rotating with a frequency \(f\) in a magnetic field \(B\)

The Faraday's disc, an example shown in Figure 1A, is the first homopolar generator. A homopolar generator is a DC electrical generator comprising an electrically conductive disc or cylinder rotating in a plane perpendicular to a uniform static magnetic field.

### Derivation of expression for induced emf

(method one)

Consider an elemental strip

Magnetic flux it cuts in time \(t\), where \(A\) is area of sector mapped out in time \(t\),

\[\phi=B_{\perp}A=B\bigg{(}\frac{1}{2}R^{2}\theta\bigg{)}\]

The induced e.m.f. is given by the rate at which magnetic flux is cut by the conductor. The magnitude is

\[\mathcal{E}=\frac{d\phi}{dt}=\frac{d}{dt}\bigg{(}\frac{1}{2}BR^{2}\theta\bigg{)} =\frac{1}{2}BR^{2}\frac{d\theta}{dt}=\frac{1}{2}BR^{2}\omega\]

For a complete revolution, since \(\omega=2\pi\)_f_ and \(A=\pi R^{2}\),

\[\mathcal{E}=\frac{1}{2}BR^{2}\omega=BAf\]

(method two)

Consider a free electron on the line OP. As the disc rotates,

the electron moves in an anticlockwise circle resulting in a clockwise current in the magnetic field. As such, the electron experiences a magnetic force \(F_{B}\) directed towards the outer rim of the disc, pushing the electron outwards.

The accumulation of electrons on the outer rim of the disc led to a potential difference being set up between the center O and the outer rim of the disc. This led to an electric force \(F_{E}\) on those electrons still in the disc.

At steady state, for any electron still in the disc, the electric force on it is balanced by the magnetic force,

\[F_{E}=F_{B}\]

\[-q\frac{dV}{dr}=Bqv=Bq\omega r\]

\[-\int_{\xi}^{0}dV=\int_{0}^{R}Bqdr\]

\[\xi=\frac{1}{2}B\omega R^{2}\]

## Appendix 2 Volcanic Eruption as a Consequence of Eddy Currents in Action

(Extracted from Young and Freedman, University Physics, 12\({}^{\text{th}}\) edition)

A particularly dramatic example of eddy currents in action is Jupiter's moon Io, which is slightly larger than the earth's moon. Io moves rapidly through Jupiter's intense magnetic field (Figure 2A), and this sets up strong eddy currents within Io's interior. These currents dissipate energy at a rate of 10\({}^{12}\) W, equivalent to setting off a one kilo-ton nuclear weapon inside Io every 4 seconds! This dissipated energy helps to keep Io's interior hot and so helps to cause volcanic eruptions on its surface, like those in Figure B. (However, note that gravitational effects from Jupiter cause even more heating.)

Figure 2: A Powerful magnetic field lines of Jupiter induce eddy currents in its moon Io, as Io moves in its orbit around Jupiter.

## Chapter 16 Alternating Current

Engineers design transmission networks to transport the energy as efficiently as feasible, while at the same time taking into account economic factors, network safety and redundancy. These networks use components such as power lines, cables, circuit breakers, switches and transformers. The transmission network is usually administered on a regional basis by an entity such as a regional transmission organization or transmission system operator.

Transmission efficiency is hugely improved by devices that increase the voltage, and proportionately reduce the current in the conductors, thus keeping the power transmitted nearly equal to the power input. The reduced current flowing through the line reduces the losses in the conductors.

### Sinusoidal AC

The electricity supply generated for consumers' use is a sinusoidal AC.

The time-variation of a sinusoidal current or voltage can be represented by the equation

\[x=\pm x_{0}\sin\omega t\quad\quad\text{or}\quad\quad x=\pm x_{0}\cos\omega t\]

where \(x_{0}=\text{peak (or maximum) value}\)

\(\omega=\text{angular frequency of the supply (rad s^{-1})}\).

Note that \(\omega=2\pi\ f\) where \(f\) is the frequency of the supply in hertz (Hz). Frequency is also related to the period \(T\) through the expression \(f=\dfrac{1}{T}\).

**Example 2:**

The AC supply found in Singapore homes have peak voltage of 330 V and frequency of 50 Hz. Write down an expression for the voltage and sketch the waveform.

### What does the root-mean-square (r.m.s.) value mean?

If a _steady DC_ passes through a resistive load \(R\), the power \(P\) dissipated can be calculated by \(P=VI\), \(P=I^{2}R\), or \(P=\dfrac{V^{2}}{R}\). Since \(V\) and \(I\) are unchanging for a DC, there is no difference between instantaneous and average power dissipated in the resistive load.

If the current through the load is _alternating current (AC)_, the **instantaneous power** dissipated must be changing with time, since \(V\) and \(I\) are changing with time. In practice, we are often only interested in the **average power** dissipation. Interestingly, the average power can be calculated by the same set of equations (\(P=VI\), \(P=I^{2}R\) or \(P=\dfrac{V^{2}}{R}\)), as long as we use the **root-mean-square** values \(V_{mn.}\) and \(I_{mn.}\).

So, what is the root-mean-square value then?

Suppose a periodic alternating current \(I\) passes through an electrical load of resistance \(R\), its instantaneous power \(P\) dissipated will be changing with time \(t\). The peak current is \(I_{0}\).

Instantaneous power \(P=VI=I^{2}R=\dfrac{V^{2}}{R}\)

Peak power \(P_{0}=V_{0}I_{0}=I_{0}^{2}R=\dfrac{V_{0}^{2}}{R}\)

In general,

mean power \(<P>=<I^{2}R>\)

\(=<I^{2}>R\) (since \(R\) is constant)

where \(<I^{2}>\) is the mean-squared current \(I\).

We define the root-mean-squared current \(I_{rms}=\sqrt{<I^{2}>}\),

then the mean power can also be expressed as \(<P>=(I_{rms})^{2}R\)

The **root-mean-square** value of an alternating current is that **equivalent constant direct current** that will **dissipate the same average power in a given resistive load**.

In other words, a direct current of 1 A and an alternating current of r.m.s. value of 1 A have **the same heating effect**, i.e. both currents dissipate the same power in a given resistor.

Mean power \(<P>=V_{rms}I_{rms}=I_{rms}^{2}R=\dfrac{V_{rms}^{2}}{R}\) [1]

Based on the above equation in [1], we can derive that \(\dfrac{V_{rms}=I_{rms}R}{R}\)

Note that the above relationships are not restricted to sinusoidal AC. They are applicable to non-sinusoidal AC as well.

Last but not least, for a periodic current with period \(T\), the mean-squared current \(<I^{2}>\) is computed using

\[<I^{2}>\ =\dfrac{\int\limits_{0}^{T}I^{2}\ dt}{T}=\dfrac{1}{T}\int\limits_{0}^{ T}I^{2}\ dt\.\]

In the next section, you will learn how to compute the r.m.s. values and the mean power for a sinusoidal AC.

(a) the mean potential difference

(b) the r.m.s. potential difference and

### Transformer

The transformer is a device which makes use of electromagnetic induction to produce a large alternating e.m.f. from a small one, or a small alternating e.m.f. from a large one. The primary and secondary coils are formed by winding insulated wires on a soft iron core, either one on top of the other or on separate limbs (as shown in the figures below). There is no electrical connection between the coils but they are linked magnetically via the soft iron core; i.e. the flux is the same in both coils.

Below are circuit symbols of transformers.

#### 16.4.1 Induced e.m.f.s in a transformer

When an alternating e.m.f. \(V_{p}\) is applied to the primary coil, alternating currents in both primary coil and secondary coil set up a resultant alternating flux \(\dot{\phi}\) in the core.

If \(N_{p}\) and \(N_{s}\) are the number of turns in the primary and secondary coils, their linkages with the flux \(\phi\) are

\[(\mathcal{O}_{\text{\tiny{infkagap}}})_{p}=N_{p}\,\phi\qquad\qquad\text{ and }\qquad\qquad(\mathcal{O}_{\text{\tiny{infkagap}}})_{s}=N_{s}\,\phi\]

The alternating flux induces an alternating e.m.f. \(E_{p}\) in the primary coil as well as an alternating e.m.f. \(E_{s}\) in the secondary coil. By Faraday's law, the magnitudes of \(E_{p}\) and \(E_{s}\) are given by

\[E_{p}=\frac{d(\mathcal{O}_{\text{\tiny{infkagap}}})_{p}}{dt}=N_{p}\,\frac{d \phi}{dt}\qquad\qquad\text{and }\qquad\qquad E_{s}=\frac{d(\mathcal{O}_{\text{\tiny{infkagap}}})_{s}}{dt}=N_{ s}\,\frac{d\phi}{dt}\]

Dividing the above two equations, we have

\[\frac{\text{e.m.f.\,induced in secondary}}{\text{e.m.f.\,induced in primary}}=\frac{E_{s}}{E_{p}}=\frac{N_{s}}{N_{p}}\]

Thus the transformer steps voltage up or down according to its 'turns-ratio' \(\frac{N_{s}}{N_{p}}\).

If \(V_{s}\) is the output p.d. across the secondary coil, then for an _ideal transformer_ that has _zero-resistance coils_. \(V_{p}=E_{p}\quad\text{and}\quad V_{s}=E_{s}\), giving

\[\frac{V_{s}}{V_{p}}=\frac{N_{s}}{N_{p}}\]

**Note that**

1. When the secondary coil is open-circuited, the same analysis can still be applied and resultant alternating flux \(\phi\) in the core will be due to the current in the primary coil.
2. \(V_{p}\) must be an alternating e.m.f.. If not, the flux in the primary coil would not change (except for a short time immediately after the e.m.f. is first applied) and there would be no induced e.m.f. in the secondary coil.
3. The induced e.m.f. \(E_{s}\) has the same frequency as the applied voltage \(V_{p}\).
4. If \(N_{s}>N_{p}\), the transformer is called a _step-up transformer_ because \(V_{s}>V_{p}\). A step-down transformer has \(N_{s}<N_{p}\).

#### 16.4.2 Power transmission in a transformer

If the transformer is ideal, i.e. _100% efficient_,

\[\textbf{output power}=\textbf{input power}\]

\[V_{s}I_{s}=V_{p}I_{p}\]

Thus, turns ratio \(\begin{array}{c}\framebox{$N_{s}=\frac{V_{s}}{N_{p}}=\frac{I_{p}}{V_{p}}= \frac{I_{p}}{I_{s}}$}\\ \end{array}\)

The above relationship is _only applicable to an ideal transformer_. In the A levels, transformers are assumed to be ideal unless otherwise stated.

Note that the relationship is obtained from the Principle of Conservation of Energy.

**Example 5:**

A step-up transformer has 200 turns on its primary coil and 3000 turns on its secondary coil. The primary coil is supplied with a 30 A alternating current at 90 V.

(a) What is the voltage in the secondary circuit?

(b) What current flows in the secondary circuit?

(c) What is the power in the primary circuit?

(d) What is the power in the secondary circuit?

#### Efficiency

The efficiency of commercial transformers are very high - typically in the range of 95% to 99%. The four most important sources of power loss are listed below.

(a) Resistance of windings

Some energy is dissipated as heat in both coils (\(I^{2}R\)). This can be reduced to an acceptable level by using suitably thick wires. (The coil which has the smaller number of turns, carries the larger current. And thus, it usually requires thicker wires.)

(b) Eddy Currents

The alternating magnetic flux induces eddy currents in the iron core and causes heating. The effect is reduced by having a laminated core.

(c) Hysteresis

Each time the direction of magnetization of the core is reversed, some energy is wasted. This is known as hysteresis loss and it produces heating in the core. It is minimized by using special alloys (e.g. Permalloy which is an alloy of nickel and iron) for the core material.

(d) Flux Leakage

The flux due to the primary coil may not link to the secondary coil completely if the core is badly designed.

### Rectification

The \(I\)-\(V\) characteristic of rectifiers (or diodes) are such that they present a very low resistance to current flow in one direction (when forward biased), and a very high resistance in the opposite direction (when reverse biased).

(a) Resistance of windings

In the forward biased connection, the diode offers negligible resistance and current flows through it easily.

In the reverse biased connection, the diode offers infinite resistance and no current flows in the circuit.

#### Half-wave rectification

Rectification is the conversion of AC to DC. A simple half-wave rectifying circuit is shown below. For simplicity, the resistor \(R\) is used to represent a load which requires a DC power source.

As the applied potential difference to the rectifier and load is a sinusoidal wave, the diode is forward biased during one half-cycle, and reverse biased during the next half-cycle.

During the half-cycle when the rectifier is forward biased, current flows round the circuit, creating a potential difference across \(R\). This p.d. will have almost the same value as the applied p.d. if the forward resistance of the diode is small compared with \(R\).

During the half-cycle when the diode is reverse biased, little or no current flows and the potential difference across \(R\) is zero.

This is repeated for each cycle of AC input. The current flow is unidirectional and so is the potential difference across \(R\). Although it fluctuates, it never changes direction.

**Example 6:**

Consider the half-wave rectifying circuit above.

The variation with time \(t\) of the potential difference from the AC supply is

\[V=V_{0}\sin(\omega t)\]

a) Sketch the waveform for the potential difference across the load \(R\) after the half-wave rectification.

b) Determine the r.m.s voltage across the load in terms of \(V_{0}\). (Ans: \(\dfrac{V_{0}}{2}\))

c) Hence, find the power dissipated in the load in terms of \(V_{0}\) and \(R\). (Ans: \(\dfrac{V_{0}^{2}}{4R}\))

## Appendix

### Full-wave Rectification

Full-wave rectification can be accomplished with a bridge rectifier consisting of 4 diodes. During any half cycle, two of the four diodes are forward biased.

* When the upper terminal of \(V_{S}\) is positive with respect to the lower terminal, diodes B and D are forward biased, while diodes A and C are reverse biased.
* When the lower terminal of \(V_{S}\) is positive with respect to the upper terminal, diodes A and C are forward biased, while diodes B and D are reverse biased.
* Hence, current will always flow in the direction from X to Y through the load resistor \(R\), and the output voltage \(V_{R}\) is unidirectional.

## 2 Smoothing output voltage

Smoothing is the process of reducing the fluctuations of the rectified DC output. In other words, it is to make the output more constant. This is done by connecting a special device, known as a capacitor, in _parallel_ with the load R.

The output of the rectifier is'smoothed' by connecting a capacitor across the output.

## Introduction

In the mid-19th century, classical physics (Newtonian mechanics and electromagnetic theory) dominated scientific understanding, confidently explaining many phenomena. However, by the late 19th century, it became evident that classical physics struggled to account for certain observed phenomena, including:

**(1)**: blackbody radiation and the ultraviolet catastrophe (not in the syllabus)
**(2)**: the photoelectric effect
**(3)**: the Compton effect (not in the syllabus)
**(4)**: the spectrum of bright lines from gas discharge tubes.

In response, several eminent scientists embarked on a quest to understand these anomalies which lead to the development of quantum theory. This revolutionary theory, spearheaded by eminent figures like Max Planck, Albert Einstein, and Niels Bohr, introduced the concept of discrete energies and fundamental constants such as the Planck constant. Their seminal contributions not only earned them Nobel Prizes1 but also lay the groundwork for the development of quantum mechanics.

Footnote 1: Max Planck received his Nobel Prize in 1918, for resolving the issue of blackbody radiation and the ultraviolet light catastrophe by introducing the concept of discrete energies (quantum theory) and a crucial constant \(h\), now known as Planck constant. Albert Einstein received his Nobel Prize in 1921 for using Planck’s proposal of discrete energies for electromagnetic radiation to successfully explain the photoelectric effect. Niels Bohr was honoured with a Nobel Prize in 1922 for explaining the spectrum of bright lights using the quantum theory of light.

The impact of quantum theory extends far beyond theoretical physics, underpinning modern technologies like lasers and nanotechnology. As we delve into topics in quantum mechanics, it is crucial to appreciate the profound influence of these concepts on our understanding of the universe and our technological advancements.

### The Photoelectric Effect

#### Background

In 1887, Heinrich Hertz discovered the **photoelectric effect** - electrons were emitted when he shone UV light on a freshly polished zinc plate.

The **photoelectric effect** is a phenomenon in which **electrons** are liberated from a **cool metal surface** when **electromagnetic radiation** of sufficiently high **frequency** is incident upon it.

Figure 1:The mere existence of the photoelectric effect is not, as is sometimes assumed, a difficulty for classical physics.

Electrons that are the charge carries in the metals which are "able to move freely" are still bound inside the metal and do not spontaneously spill out at room temperature. A minimum amount of energy \(\phi\)is still needed to free an electron from the metal's crystal lattice. Some electrons are deeper than others in the lattice structure of the metal and may require more energy than \(\phi\) to escape from the surface of the metal, but all will require _at least_\(\phi\). This minimum amount of energy \(\phi\)is known as the work function of the metal. Different metals have different work functions and work functions are characteristic of the metal.

**Work Function \(\phi\):**

The **work function** is the minimum amount of energy required to remove an electron from the metal surface (i.e., the energy required to remove the least strongly held electron).

One way to liberate electrons is through a process called _thermionic emission_ where the metal is heated to high temperatures. Heating a metal, increases the thermal energy of the electrons. At a sufficiently high temperature, the kinetic energy of a small percentage of the electrons may exceed the work function. These electrons can then leave the metal.

Classical physics explains photoelectric effect in a way that is similar to thermionic emission. When light is shone on the surface, the electromagnetic waves spread out across the area of illumination and heat the electrons and increases their kinetic energy which is transferred to the crystal lattice, via collisions. But if the light is sufficiently intense, the electron's kinetic energy may be sufficiently high to cause the emission of the electrons. Hence in the 1900s, scientists thought it was plausible that an intense light source might be able to cause the thermal emission of the electrons.

However, in 1902, Philipp Lenard conducted a series of detailed experiments to explore the photoelectric effect further. It was his findings that presented a significant challenge to classical physics and the prevailing wave theory of light. It was not until 1905 that Albert Einstein provided a groundbreaking explanation to the observations. Einstein's revolutionary proposal, which introduced the particulate nature of light, not only resolved the discrepancies observed in the photoelectric effect experiments but also laid the foundation for the development of quantum mechanics.

#### The Photoelectric Effect Experiments

##### The Experimental Setup

We start off our exploration on photoelectric effect by looking at a typical experimental setup (Fig. 2) which was used by Lenard in his experiments.

Two metal plates are located at two ends of an evacuated tube. The potential difference between the plates can be varied by the rheostat, while the polarity can be changed by changing the connections across the battery.

Light of various **frequencies** and **intensities** is shone on one of the metal plates - the emitter which is often also called the cathode. In doing so, electrons may be ejected from the emitter and travel to the other metal plate - the collector which is often called the anode.

If electrons reach the collector, a current (called the photocurrent) will be registered and measured by the ammeter as shown in the diagram.

The ejected electrons are called **photoelectrons**.

An explanation of the photoelectric effect can also be found in the following video:

Photoelectric Effect Explanation [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ef3f3AWXMmk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ef3f3AWXMmk)

Figure 2: Experimental set-up

**17.1.2.2 Experiment 1: Varying the Applied Voltage**

With the understanding of the setup, we can now explore the experiments that were conducted by Lenard.

In this first experiment, a monochromatic source of e.m. radiation of a sufficiently high frequency and constant intensity is shone on the metal plate (emitter) such that photoelectrons are liberated from the emitter. The photoelectrons will liberate from the emitter with a range of kinetic energies and directions.

**Case 1 : When \(V=0\)**

When the potential difference \(V\) across the collector and emitter is set to zero. A current is detected by the ammeter.

This current may not be the maximum possible current as the photoelectrons are emitted with various speeds in all directions, and some reaches the collector but some will not.

**Case 2 : When \(V>0\)**

When the collector is set at a **higher** potential than the emitter, the photoelectrons will feel an electric force towards the collector (Fig. 3.2 (a)), more electrons will reach the collector - the current is higher than before.

**Fig. 3.2 (a)**

**Fig. 3.2 (b). \(V>0\): A higher potential at the collector attracts the photoelectrons to the collector**

As \(V\) is increased further, there will come a time where the current \(I\) reaches a maximum. This is because all the emitted photoelectrons are collected at the collector i.e. rate of emission of photoelectrons is equal to rate of photoelectrons reaching the collector. Increasing \(V\) further does not increase \(I\).

This maximum current is known as the **saturation current \(I_{s}\)**.

**Note**: In many A-Level questions, the saturation current is reached at \(V=0\). This is possible - it happens when all the emitted photoelectrons are reaches the collector even without a potential difference applied across the plates.

**Note on Saturation Current:**

Since saturation current happens when **all the electrons emitted are collected at the collector**,

\(I_{s}=\) Charges emitted per unit time = (No. of electrons emitted per unit time)(\(e\))

Hence, the no. of electrons emitted per unit time, \(\dfrac{N_{electrons}}{t}=\dfrac{I_{s}}{e}\)

### Case 3 : When \(V<0\)

When the potential difference is adjusted such that collector is at a **lower** potential than the emitter, the photoelectrons will feel an electric force away from the collector (Fig. 3.3 (a)). However, the more energetic electrons can still reach the collector. Hence, a current can still be detected by the ammeter if the potential difference is not large enough.

* **Stopping Potential \(V_{s}\)** If, however, the potential of the collector is continually lowered, there comes a point where the current will fall to zero. This corresponds to the potential difference whereby even the **most energetic** photoelectrons cannot reach the collector. This magnitude of potential difference across the collector and the emitter at this point is called the **stopping potential \(V_{s}\)**. Lowering the potential of the collector further therefore yields zero current as there are no more photoelectrons reaching the collector.

* **Results of the Three Cases Represented in \(I\)-\(V\) Graph** Fig.4 summarises the above observations in an \(I\)-\(V\) graph* **Relationship between Stopping Potential \(V_{s}\) and the Maximum Kinetic Energy of the Photoelectrons** Recall that at the stopping potential \(V_{s}\), even the photoelectrons that are liberated with the most kinetic energy (\(KE_{max}\)) will not be able to reach the collector plate. This happens because the kinetic energy of these electrons converts to electrical potential energy just before the electrons reaches the collector.

Applying conservation of energy to the system of the field and these photoelectrons, we can write

\(\Rightarrow\) Initial kinetic energy + Initial electrical potential energy

\(=\) Final kinetic energy + Final electrical potential energy

\(\Rightarrow\)\(KE_{max}+(\) - \(eV_{i})=0+(\)- \(eV_{j})\)

\(\Rightarrow\)\(KE_{max}=e(V_{i}-V_{j})=eV_{s}\)

since \((V_{i}-V_{j})\) is the potential difference between the collector and emitter plates and it is at a value of the stopping potential \(V_{s}\).

Hence, we see that the stopping potential \(V_{s}\) is a measure of the maximum kinetic energy \(KE_{max}\) of the emitted photoelectrons and relationship between them is

\(KE_{max}=eV_{s}\)

In the setup, the adjustable DC supply is used as a means to determine the \(KE\) possessed by the most energetic photoelectrons (i.e., \(KE_{max}\)) when they are first ejected from the metal surface. The applied potential difference \(V\) does not alter the \(KE_{max}\) in any way.

Now that we have a way of measuring \(KE_{max}\) of the photoelectrons, we can investigate how \(KE_{max}\) changes with other factors like the intensity and frequency of the incident light. This will be the focus of the next two experiments.

Figure 5:

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:652]

#### 17.1.2.4 Experiment 3: Varying the Applied Voltage for Different Frequencies of Light

Lenard also performed experiments by shining lights of different frequencies on the emitter plate. The following results were obtained.

**(3) Almost instantaneous emission of photoelectrons.**

* **Classical Prediction: Because the light energy is distributed over the area where the light is incident on, at very low light intensities, a measurable time interval should pass between the instant the light is incident on the emitter and the time an electron is emitted from the metal. This time interval is required for the electron to absorb the incident radiation before it acquires enough energy to escape from the metal.**
* **Experimental Result: Electrons are emitted from the surface of the metal almost _instantaneously_ (within ~1 ns) after the surface is illuminated, even at very low light intensities.
**(4) Existence of Threshold Frequency of Light.**

* **Classical Prediction: Electrons should be ejected from the metal at any incident light frequency, as long as the light intensity is high enough, because energy is transferred to the metal regardless of the incident light frequency.**

* **Experimental Result: For any given metal, electrons are emitted only when the frequency of incident light is above some minimum value** \(f_{\alpha}\)**. It is found that If the frequency of light is below** \(f_{\alpha}\) **regardless of how intense the light is no electrons are emitted. This frequency is know as the threshold frequency and is characteristic of the metal being illuminated.**

**Threshold frequency** \(f_{\alpha}\)**:**

* **The threshold frequency is the minimum frequency of the electromagnetic radiation required to liberate photoelectrons from a metal surface.**
**(5) Dependence of maximum kinetic energy of photoelectrons on light frequency**

* **Classical Prediction: There should be** _no relationship_ **between the frequency of the light and the maximum kinetic energy of the photoelectrons. The maximum kinetic energy should be related to the intensity of the light instead.**

* **Experimental Result: The stopping potential** \(V_{s}\) **and hence the maximum kinetic energy** \(KE_{max}\) **of the electrons was found to increase with increasing light frequency. (Fig.** 7**)**

**From the experimental results above, you can see that although classical physical was able to offer an explanation for the existence of the photoelectrons, it was unable to explain the observed behaviors of the photoelectrons in the experiments.**

Figure 7: The stopping potentials and hence \(KE_{max}\) of the photoelectrons increase with with higher frequencies of light.

### Einstein's Explanation for Photoelectric Effect

#### The Quantum Theory of Light - the Photon

A successful explanation of the observations of the photoelectric effect was finally given by Einstein in 1905, the same year he published his special theory of relativity.

As part of a general paper on electromagnetic radiation, for which he received a Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921, Einstein extended Max Planck's concept of quantization to electromagnetic waves.

Einstein suggested that light is not really a continuous wave but, instead, arrives in small packets or bundles of energy. Einstein called each packet of energy a **light quantum** and he postulated that the energy of one light quantum to be directly proportional to the frequency of the light. We now call these light quanta **photons**.

**Photon :**

A **photon** is a quantum of electromagnetic radiation. Its energy \(E\) is given by

\[E=hf\]

where \(h\) is the Planck constant (\(h=6.63\times 10^{34}\) J s) and \(f\) the frequency of the light.

Since each photon travels at the speed of light \(c=f\lambda\), where \(\lambda\) is the wavelength. \(E\) can also be written as

\[E=h\frac{c}{\lambda}\]

#### An Alternative Unit for Energy - eV

The magnitude of the energies involved is in this topic are often on the atomic scale and very small compared to everyday applications. Hence, we find it convenient to use an alternative unit of energy, called the **electron volt** (eV).

The electron volt is defined as the energy the charge-field system gains or loses when a charge of magnitude \(e\) is moved through a potential difference of one volt. In other words, when a particle of charge \(e\) moves through a potential difference of 1 V, the change in the potential energy is 1 eV.

\[\begin{array}{c}1\text{ eV = 1.6 x 10^{-19} J }\\ \end{array}\]

An introduction to the Quantum Theory of Light can be found in the following YouTube

video:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1TYZlBi?UA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1TYZlBi?UA)

The following video attempts to explain what exactly a photon is, besides a packet of energy.

What the HECK is a Photon? [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73XdlgzKws](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73XdlgzKws)

**Example 1**

The eye is most sensitive to light of wavelength 550 nm. What is the energy of photons with this wavelength? Express your answer in electron volts (eV).

**Example 2**

A source emits monochromatic light of wavelength 550 nm at a power of 1.25 W. How many photons are emitted in one second?

### Einstein's Postulates

To explain the findings in the photoelectric effect experiments by Lenard, Einstein postulated the following:

**(1) Light of frequency \(f\) consists of discrete quanta, known as photons, each of energy _E = hf_. Each photon travels in vacuum at the speed of light \(c\).
**(2) A photon of the incident light gives all its energy _hf_ to a single electron in the metal.**

Therefore, the absorption of energy by the electrons is not a continuous absorption process as envisioned in the wave model; rather; it is a discontinuous process in which energy is delivered to electrons in discrete bundles. The energy transfer is accomplished via a one photon-one electron event.2 An electron in the metal must absorb the entire quantum of light at once, it cannot absorb two or more photons. Nor can it absorb a fraction of a quantum.

Footnote 2: In principle, an electron can absorb two photons. However, the probability of it happening is very low.

### Einstein's Photoelectric Effect Equation

Electrons ejected from the surface of the metal and not making collisions with the other metal atoms before escaping will possess the maximum kinetic energy _KEmax_ upon liberation.

Recall that the minimum energy required to free an electron from its bond to the metallic lattice is known as the work function \(\phi\). Hence, by conservation of energy, for those photoelectrons that are liberated with maximum kinetic energy _KEmax_

Energy of photon absorbed = Work function of metal + maximum kinetic energy of photoelectrons

\(\Rightarrow\)_hf = \(\phi\)+ _KEmax_

Rearranging this gives Einstein's photoelectric effect equation:

\(KE_{max}\) = hf - \(\phi\)

* This equation is **only valid for the photoelectrons that are liberated with maximum kinetic energy**. They come from the surface of the metal. Due to collisions with other atoms, those below the surface emerge with smaller kinetic energy.
* In words, the maximum kinetic energy _KEmax_ of the photoelectrons is equal to the energy gained by absorbing a single photon _hf_ minus the work function energy \(\phi\) (i.e. work done to escape the metal).

### How Einstein's "Photon" Model Explains the Observations of the Photoelectric Effect

Using the photon model of light, one can now explain the observed features of the photoelectric effect that are incorrectly predicted by classical concepts. We will now relook at each of the observations above that wave theory of light failed to explain.

* **Observation 1 : Maximum kinetic energy of photoelectrons is independent on the intensity of light.*
* **Wave Theory:*
* When light intensity increases, there is more energy incident on the electrons, the maximum kinetic energy of the photoelectrons should have been higher too.
* **Photon Model:*
* A more intense light means _more photons_, but the energy of each photon is still the same. These additional photons eject a greater number of photoelectrons and cause the larger saturation current. However, since the energy of each photon is still the same and the interaction between the photon and electron is one to one, hence the maximum kinetic energy of the photoelectrons remains the same.
* **Observation 2 : Almost instantaneous emission of photoelectrons.*
* **Wave Theory:*
* For low intensities of light, a measurable time interval should have passed between the light is incident on the emitter and the time an electron is emitted as time is need for the electron to absorb the incident radiation.
* **Photon Model:*
* The near instantaneous emission of photoelectrons observed is consistent with the photon model of light. Since each photon transfers its energy to just one electron, if that electron immediately has energy to escape, the current should begin instantaneously. If the incident light has very low intensity, it just means that there are very few photons arriving per unit time. The interaction between the photon and electron is still one-to-one and instantaneous.
* **Observation 3 : Existence of threshold frequency of light.*
* **Wave Theory:*
* If the intensity of the incident light is sufficiently high, electrons should have been ejected regardless of the frequency. There should not be a threshold frequency.
* **Photon Model:*
* To be liberated from a metal, an electron needs to absorb a photon of energy that is at least the work function \(\phi\) of the metal. Because the energy of each photon is given by _hf_ where \(f\) is the frequency of the photon, the photoelectric effect therefore cannot be observed if the frequency of the photon is below a minimum value - the threshold frequency \(f_{o}\). If the frequency of light is below this threshold frequency, an electron cannot be ejected from the surface, even if many photons per unit time are incident in a very intense light beam. **Relationship Between threshold frequency \(f_{o}\) and work function \(\phi\) of the emitter metal : \(\phi\)= \(hf_{o}\)*
* This also explains why for different metals (hence different work functions), the threshold frequency of the incident light differs.
* **Observation 4 : Dependence of maximum kinetic energy of photoelectrons on light frequency*
* **Wave Theory:*
* There should be _no relationship_ between the frequency of the light and the maximum kinetic energy of the photoelectrons.
* **Photon Model:*
* A photon of higher frequency carries more energy and therefore ejects a photoelectron with greater maximum kinetic energy when incident on the same metal (hence, same work function energy) than does a photon of lower frequency.

### More on Einstein's Photoelectric Effect Equation - Graphical Representation

Not only do Einstein's postulates explain all of Lenard's observations, they also made a new prediction - there is a linear relationship between the maximum kinetic energy of the photoelectrons with the frequency of light the metal is illuminated with since,

\[KE_{max}=hf-\phi\]

where \(\phi\) is the work function of the metal that is illuminated.

Lenard had not verified this relationship for different light frequencies, so Einstein offered this as an untested prediction of his postulates. Robert Millikan subsequently took up the challenge and measured the stopping potentials for various metals and validated this relationship.

Fig. 8 shows the graphs of \(KE_{max}\) for photoelectrons _vs._ frequency \(f\) of incident light for a typical photoelectric effect experiment with different metals.

### Key Features of the Graphs

From the equation, \(KE_{max}=hf-\phi\),

1. **Gradient:** Gradient of each graph = Planck constant \(h\). This is why all the graphs are parallel to each other.
2. **Vertical intercept:** Vertical intercept = - \(\phi\) where \(\phi\) is the work function of each metal. Since the work function is a characteristic of the metal illuminated, it would be unique for each metal. Note that the work function is usually given as a positive number. So, for example, if the vertical intercept is -2.80 eV, the work function = 2.80 eV.
3. **Horizontal intercept:** The horizontal intercept happens when the maximum kinetic energy \(KE_{max}\) of the photoelectrons is zero, the energy \(hf_{0}\) of the incident photon must be equal to the work function \(\phi\) of the metal: \[hf_{o}=\phi\Rightarrow f_{o}=\frac{\phi}{h}\] Hence, the horizontal intercept of each graph gives the threshold frequency of the metal. This threshold frequency is also equals to \(\frac{\phi}{h}\). For different metals, the work functions are different, hence the threshold frequency is different.

Hence, although Einstein's idea that light comes in discrete light quanta that cannot be divided, and that the energy of one quantum is delivered to one electron seems trivial. They were not only able to explain the observations of the photoelectric experiments that classical physics failed to explain, they are crucial for understanding the new ideas that will lead to quantum physics for they are completely at odds with the concepts of classical physics, where energy can be continuously divided and shared.

### Atomic Structure and Line Spectra

#### Bohr's Model of Atomic Quantization

Rutherford's Planetary Model of Atom and its Flaws

Throughout mankind's history, the quest to understand the composition of matter and the structure of the atom has evolved through various theories3. By the 20th century, Ernest Rutherford's nuclear model was the most successful of all the various proposals.

Footnote 3: Around 500 BC, Democritus proposed the concept of atoms, suggesting that matter consists of indivisible particles. Later, Joseph John Thomson introduced the plum-pudding model, envisioning electrons embedded within a positively charged mass. This model was challenged by the gold-foil experiment conducted by Geiger and Marsden, leading Ernest Rutherford to propose a new “planetary model” featuring a dense, positively charged nucleus surrounded by orbiting electrons, akin to a miniature solar system. We will learn more about J1 Thomson’s plumbuding model and Rutherford’s planetary model of atoms in our study of Nuclear Physics.

In Rutherford's model of atom, the atom was made up of a massive, positive central nucleus, with electrons orbiting around this nucleus. However, although this model provided crucial insights into the atomic structure of the atom, it also faced significant flaws.

According to Maxwell's classical theory of electromagnetism, any accelerating electrical charge radiates electromagnetic waves. An electron orbiting in an atom would always have a centripetal acceleration and so should always be emitting electromagnetic radiation. With the electron continuously losing energy, the radius of the orbit should decrease continuously, and the electron should spiral into the nucleus with a fraction of a second. (Fig. 9.2)

Furthermore, in the 1800s, Michael Faraday had conducted a series of experiments and observed that atoms emit (and absorbs) only certain frequencies of electromagnetic radiation that were characteristics of the element - producing discrete line spectra. (Fig. 10)

According to classical theory, the _frequency_ of the electromagnetic waves emitted by the orbing electrons is equal to the frequency of revolution. As the electron spiral towards the nucleus, its frequency of revolution continuously increases and hence should emit a _continuous_ spectrum (a continuous variation of all frequencies). Classical theory, hence, could not explain the line spectrum emitted or absorbed by atoms.

Figure 10: The absorption and emission line spectral of sodium and nitrogen.

### Bohr's model of the atom

In 1913, Niels Bohr presented a new model of the atom to address this problem. Bohr applied Planck's idea of quantized energy levels in blackbody radiation, Einstein's concept of the photon, Rutherford's planetary model of the atom, and Newtonian mechanics to arrive at a semiclassical model4 based on some revolutionary ideas. **The postulates of the Bohr theory as it applies to the hydrogen atom are as follows**:

Footnote 4: Although Bohr’s model is now considered obsolete and has been completely replaced by a probabilistic quantum-mechanical theory, it is historically important as the Bohr model developed the notions of energy quantization and angular momentum quantization as applied to atomic-sized systems.

1. The electron moves in circular orbits around the nucleus under the influence of the electric force of attraction. However, **only certain electron orbits are stable. These states are called the stationary states.** When in one of these stationary states, the electron does not emit energy in the form of radiation, even though it is accelerating. Hence, the total energy of the atom remains constant. Furthermore, because the electron does not continuously emit radiation, or lose energy, it will not eventually spiral into the nucleus.
2. **The atom emits radiation, in a single photon, when the electron makes a transition from a more energetic initial stationary state,** at a higher orbit, **to a lower-energy stationary state** at a lower orbit. The frequency \(f\) of the photon emitted in the transition is related to the change in the atom's energy and is not equal to the frequency of the electron's orbital motion.

### De-excitation and Excitation

When an electron in an initial orbit with a larger energy \(E_{i}\) changes to a final orbit with a smaller energy \(E_{i}\), the emitted photon has an energy of \(E_{i}-E_{b}\) consistent with the law of conservation of energy,

\[hf=E_{i}-E_{f}\]

where \(f\) is the frequency of the emitted light. This process is known as **de-excitation**.

Electrons in the atom can also jump from a lower-energy orbit to a higher-energy orbit by acquiring energy. This process is known as **excitation**.

Excitation can occur

* through **collision of the atom** with another particle, where the colliding particle will impart energy to the atom equal to the difference between two energy levels in the atom, while any remaining energy is retained by the colliding particle as its kinetic energy;
* through **absorbing a photon** of energy **exactly** equal to the energy difference between two levels of the atom. Upon absorption, the photon disappears and the atom makes a transition to the higher energy state.

The Bohr model is sometimes known as the semi-classical model of the atom, as it adds some primitive quantization conditions to what is otherwise a classical-mechanics treatment. The Bohr model is certainly not a full quantum-mechanical description of the atom. The full quantum-mechanical model, or electron-cloud model, describes the electron as a three-dimensional shape ("cloud") where there is at least a minimal probability of finding the electron.

Figure 11:

### Application of Bohr's Model to the Hydrogen Atom

The simplest Bohr model would be that of the hydrogen atom, which consists of just one electron and one proton. Bohr was able to derive the energy levels \(E_{n}\) for the hydrogen atom5:

Footnote 5: You are not required to memorise this formula or know how Bohr arrived at it. In fact, you are not required to know the energy levels or spectra for any particular element.

\[E_{n}=-\frac{13.6}{n^{2}}\;\;\mathrm{eV}\]

where \(n\) is known as the principal quantum number and is a positive integer (i.e., 1, 2, 3,...).

The electron normally occupies the energy level corresponding to \(n=1\), also known as the **ground state**,** At the **ground state**, the **electron has the lowest energy**, -13.6 eV, and orbits nearest to the proton (hydrogen nucleus).

The higher energy levels are called **excited states**. Fig. 12 shows how the energies of the excited states come closer and closer together as \(n\) increases.

The electron in a hydrogen atom at room temperature spends most of its time in the ground state. To raise the electron from the ground state (\(n=1\)) to the highest possible excited state (\(n=\infty\)), 13.6 eV of energy must be supplied. Supplying this amount of energy removes the electron from the atom, producing the positive hydrogen ion H\({}^{+}\). 13.6 eV is known as the **ionisation energy** of the hydrogen atom.

The following video is about the energy levels in the hydrogen atom:

Electron Energy Levels - A Level Physics [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzKOMiMfb-w](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzKOMiMfb-w)

In general, for a multi-electron atom,

The **ionisation energy** is the minimum energy needed to remove the outermost electron from the atom.

When the electron is given an amount of energy equal to the ionisation energy, the electron is just able to become a "free" electron. If the electron is given an amount of energy greater than the ionisation energy, the excess energy becomes the kinetic energy of the free electron outside the atom. **The free electron outside an atom can have a continuous range of energies. Inside the atom, however, an electron can only have an energy that is characteristic to that atom.**

Evidence that the energy states of the atoms are discrete and quantised is provided by the existence of atomic line spectra, the subject of the next two sections.

Figure 12:

#### Emission Line Spectra

When gases such as hydrogen, neon or sodium are placed inside a narrow discharge tube at low pressure (so that the gas atoms are effectively isolated from one another), a high voltage (e.g., 1 kV) applied across its ends causes the gas atoms to ionise, forming ions and electrons. The ions and electrons accelerate towards opposite ends of the tube, under the applied electric field. **Collisions between the electrons and atoms result in transfer of energy from the electrons to the atoms and the atoms are excited from their ground state.** Excited states are not stable, and **an excited atom will quickly de-excite to a lower-energy state emitting a photon of energy corresponding to the difference between the initial higher energy level and final lower energy level. The excited atom can, but may not de-excite directly to ground state immediately. It may make a series of jumps through intermediate energy states to ground state, releasing more than one photon in the process.

The photons emitted by the gas discharge tube are passed through a collimator slit, to produce a narrow beam of photons. Next, the photons are passed through a diffraction grating to produce an **emission line spectrum** on a dark screen behind the grating (Fig. 13).

The frequency \(f\) of an emitted photon depends on the energy difference between the initial and final energy states, as given by _hf = E: - E_f_. The frequency or wavelength of the photons emitted can be determined by studying the spectrum seen on the screen.

The emission line spectrum consists of a series of **distinct coloured lines on a dark background.** The different colours or frequencies are unique to the gas, i.e., no two different gases emit the same set of discrete frequencies of light, and atoms of the same element always emit the same set of discrete frequencies of light.

Using his model for the energy levels of the hydrogen atom, Bohr was able to account for the spectral pattern of hydrogen gas. For hydrogen gas, several distinct groups of lines can be detected, though only one group is in the visible range (Fig. 14(a)).

The Lyman (ultraviolet) series of lines corresponds to electron transitions down to the level \(n\) = 1, the Balmer (visible) series is produced by transitions down to \(n\) = 2, and the Paschen (infrared) series are produced by transitions down to \(n\) = 3; each series is named after its discoverer. The Balmer series is shown in Fig. 14(b).

You may find a YouTube video about the Atomic Line Spectrum of Hydrogen here:

Atomic Line Spectrum H [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5aCWCn9Dhqs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5aCWCn9Dhqs)

The following video talks about different spectra:

Emission and Absorption Line Spectra [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xhaDuAkpF8A](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xhaDuAkpF8A)

Figure 13:Typically, gas at low pressure is used for spectral analysis, as the atoms are sufficiently far apart and have minimal interaction with one another. When the atoms are close together, the discrete energy levels will become several continuous energy _bands_ due to interactions between the atoms, and the distinctive spectral lines will no longer be observable.

You may read on "band theory" on your own if you are interested. It forms the foundation of the understanding of all solid-state devices (transistors, solar cells, etc.).

Figure 14:

#### Absorption Line Spectra

An absorption spectrum is formed when the continuous spectrum emitted from an incandescent lamp (or white light) passes through a cool gas. The electrons in **the gas absorb the photons with frequencies corresponding to the energies they need to jump from a lower energy state to a higher energy state**. These reduction of the photons of these frequencies show up as "black lines" in the otherwise continuous spectrum of colours. An absorption spectrum, in a sense, is the inverse of an emission spectrum of the same series.

In the set-up shown in Fig. 15(a), a filament lamp emits a continuous spectrum of light, which is incident on a tube containing _cool_ atomic vapour at low pressure ("cool" meaning atomic vapour in the ground state). As a photon is incident on an atom, if its energy corresponds to the energy difference between the ground state and an excited state, it may be absorbed by the atom. As such, the atomic vapour absorbs photons of specific energies/frequencies.

What is observed on the screen is the original **continuous spectrum emitted by the hot filament lamp with darker lines corresponding to the absorbed frequencies**. Since excited states are not stable, the atoms eventually return to the ground state. However, **the photons are emitted in all directions** and not just in the forward direction. Hence, the parts of the spectrum corresponding to these photon frequencies appear darker in comparison to the other frequencies (see Fig. 15(b)).

#### Explanation of X-ray Emission Spectra

Two distinct processes are involved in X-ray emission (corresponding to the two distinct features of the X-ray spectrum in Fig. 17). The first process accounts for the bremsstrahlung, while the second accounts for the characteristic lines.

BremsstrahlungIn the first process, some of the electrons pass through the electric field of the atomic nuclei in the metal target. As a result of the interaction with the atomic nuclei, part or all of the kinetic energy of these electrons is converted directly to a **continuous spectrum** of photons, including X-rays. The electrons are slowed down or stopped by the target as a result. Because the electrons are slowed down in the process, this radiation is known as _bremsstrahlung_ (German word for 'braking radiation'.)

The intensity of the continuous background radiation decreases gradually for increasing wavelength, but is cut off sharply at the other end of the spectrum with a minimum wavelength \(\lambda_{min}\).

Cutoff Wavelength, \(\lambda_{min}\)Using the quantum theory of light, one can explain the existence of \(\lambda_{min}\) (which is often known as the _cutoff wavelength_).

When the bombarding electrons interact with the metal atoms in the target, they can lose any fraction of their initial energy, up to the maximum in a single interaction. If the electron loses all its energy in a single interaction, based on quantum theory, a single quantum of electromagnetic radiation (photon) is produced with maximum energy, and hence **minimum wavelength** (and **highest frequency**).

If the accelerating voltage of the X-ray tube is \(V\), and an electron has charge -\(e\), the electron gains kinetic energy \(eV\). Since, the most energetic photons are produced when this entire electron's kinetic energy is converted into a single photon, then, by conservation of energy,

Energy of photon emitted = Kinetic energy of the electron \(\implies\hbar\frac{c}{\lambda_{min}}=eV\)

Hence, the **cutoff wavelength \(\lambda_{min}\)**:**

\(\lambda_{min}=\frac{hc}{eV}\)

(for an electron completely stopped in its first interaction with the metal target)

From, the derivation, we can also see that the minimum wavelength \(\lambda_{min}\) in the bremsstrahlung process is _independent_ of the target material. It only depends on the accelerating voltage.

### The Characteristic Lines

The second process accounts for the peaks in the X-ray spectrum at certain frequencies (i.e., the characteristic X-rays in Fig. 17).

Electrons in atoms are grouped in various energy states called "shells." The shell nearest to the nucleus is known as the K shell. This is followed by the L shell, the M shell, the N shell and so on. (Fig 18 (a),(b))

In the X-ray tube, highly energetic electrons which have been accelerated by tens to hundreds of kilovolts of potential difference bombard the metal target. These highly energetic bombarding electrons can eject electrons from the _inner shells_ (i.e., closer to the nucleus) of the atoms of the metal target. The vacancies created will be quickly filled by electrons dropping down from higher levels, emitting X-rays with sharply defined frequencies associated with the difference between the atomic energy levels of the target atoms.

If \(E\) is the difference in energy between the two shells where the electron transition occurs, the frequency \(f\) of the radiation emitted is related to \(E\) by

\[E=hf.\]

As \(E\) is very high for electronic transitions between the K, L and M shells, the frequency \(f\) of the emitted radiation is also very high and the wavelength correspondingly short, typically of the order of \(10^{-9}\) m or less (i.e., in the X-ray region of the electromagnetic spectrum).

The K series of X-ray lines, \(K_{\alpha}\), \(K_{\beta}\), \(K_{\nu}\), etc. is due to the transition of electrons from the L, M, N... shells to the K shell (Fig. 18(a)). Similarly, L lines can be produced from transitions to the L shell (Fig. 18(b)).

### The Characteristic Lines

The second process accounts for the peaks in the X-ray spectrum at certain frequencies (i.e., the characteristic X-rays in Fig. 18(c). If a vacancy in the K shell is filled by an L-shell electron, a photon is emitted that contributes to the characteristic \(K_{\alpha}\) line; if it is filled by an M-shell electron, a \(K_{\beta}\) photon is emitted, etc.

Thus, **energy changes (de-excitation) in electrons close to the nucleus of metals** result in the characteristic X-rays. In contrast, the emission and absorption spectra we studied in section 17.2 are due to energy changes within the outermost shell of the atom, and the energy changes producing optical spectra are about 1000 times smaller than those producing X-rays. Hence, the frequencies of the optical lines are about 1000 times smaller, that is, their wavelengths are about 1000 times longer than those of X-rays.

Fig. 19(b) shows the characteristic lines \(K_{\alpha}\) and \(K_{\beta}\) and the continuous background radiation (bremsstrahlung) for two values of the accelerating potential, 40 kV and 32 kV, for a certain X-ray tube, i.e., the target material is the same for both spectra.

Two observations can be made from Fig. 19(b):

1. The wavelengths of the characteristic lines are independent of the applied potential difference - they are characteristic of the metal.
2. \(\lambda_{min}\) for the 40 kV spectrum is smaller than that for the 32 kV spectrum - this is to be expected as photons produced by electrons accelerated through a potential difference of 40 kV would have a greater maximum energy than those produced by electrons accelerated through a potential difference of 32 kV.

### Wave-Particle Duality and the Uncertainty Principle

What is the Wave/Particle Duality? Part 1 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_h4loPIXZw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_h4loPIXZw)

The Wave/Particle Duality - Part 2 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ririY-v2Ym8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ririY-v2Ym8)

#### Introduction

We have seen evidence that light can behave like a particle. But can Einstein's particulate theory of light explain the interference and diffraction of light? Unfortunately, it cannot. Such behaviour can only be explained using the wave theory of light. Hence, light also exhibits wave-like properties like diffraction, interference and polarization. (Experiments like Young's double-slit experiment clearly demonstrate this wave behavior.)

Therefore:

\[\boxed{Light\text{behaves}\textbf{both}\text{as particles and as a wave.}}\]

In fact, the equation \(E=hf\) contains this contradictory nature of light. The energy of a photon - a _particle_ of light - depends on the _frequency_ of the light. Light can have a frequency only if it is a wave.

#### De Broglie's Hypothesis - Matter Waves

As a graduate student in 1923, Louis de Broglie made an astounding suggestion. Since light can exhibit particle-like behaviour, then the converse should be true. Particles (like electrons) should also exhibit wave-like behaviour.

**De-Broglie Relationship:**

De Broglie boldly proposed that a relationship between momentum (of the particle) and wavelength (of the **associated matter wave**) exists for **all particles**:

\[\lambda=\frac{h}{p}\text{ where }p\text{ is the momentum of the particle}\]

\(\lambda\) is known as the _de Broglie wavelength_ of the particle.

\[\boxed{Example 9 (J77/l/33)}\]

Calculate the de Broglie wavelength of a rifle bullet of mass 0.02 kg moving at a speed of 300 m s\({}^{-1}\).

#### Evidence of the Wave-like Nature of Particles

To exhibit diffraction with light, we had to make very narrow slits that are **approximately equal to the wavelength of light (10\({}^{7}\) m for visible light).** For his experiment, Young used a razor blade to scratch slits on a piece of glass that had been blackened with soot.]

In order to validate de Broglie's hypothesis, we must be able to observe wave-like behaviour of particles (e.g., electrons).

The **de Broglie wavelength of electrons** is determined to be even shorter than the wavelength of visible light. In fact, it **is of the same order of magnitude as the size of a typical atom (10\({}^{\text{-10}}\) m).** This holds the key to showing diffraction of electrons. Diffraction experiments were successfully conducted using a metal crystal. The **regularly arranged atoms of the crystal acted as a diffraction grating for the electron "waves".** A number of important experiments conducted in the 1930s was based on this principle and clearly demonstrated the wave-like nature of moving electrons.

Clinton Davisson and Lester Germer directed beams of electrons onto nickel. The surface of a crystal of nickel acted like a diffraction grating and it was observed that the electrons exhibited diffraction behaviour.

Further experiments to demonstrate the wave nature of electrons were conducted by G.P. Thomson. He targeted mono-energetic beams of electrons at a thin metal foil (Fig. 20). A photographic plate placed behind the foil revealed a bright central maximum surrounded by diffraction rings (Fig. 21).

G.P. Thomson is the son of J.J. Thomson, who discovered the electron. The father was awarded a Nobel Prize for demonstrating that the electron was a particle. The son was awarded one for showing that electrons can behave like waves!

The following video tells us how to use an electron diffraction tube

Using an electron diffraction tube [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MilAnxIZKQo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MilAnxIZKQo)

Figure 21: Image on the fluorescent screen (the portions hit by electrons will light up)

Figure 20: Schematics of a basic electron diffraction experimentThese **electron diffraction experiments clearly show that electrons can behave like waves**, and detailed calculations show that de Broglie's equation is valid. The wave nature of electrons is something that we now take for granted, and has been put to practical use in devices like the electron microscope.

We conclude **that matter or radiation cannot be completely described by the wave or particle model alone. The wave and particle descriptions are complementary**, even though in explaining any particular phenomenon we just need to invoke one model.

Assume that the uncertainty in the mass is negligible.

The barrier contains a single slit of width \(w\). Beyond the slit there is a detector that counts electrons. This can be moved in the \(y\)-direction to compare the rate of arrival of electrons at different values of the angle \(\theta\)from the original direction of the beam.

**(a)**: **(i)**: Louis de Broglie suggested that some aspects of the behaviour of electrons can be explained using a wave model. Describe the main features of de Broglie's model of the electron.
**(ii)**: Use the wave model to explain how the electron beam spreads out beyond the slit.
**(b)**: State and explain one aspect of this experiment that cannot be explained using the wave model.
**(c)**: Werner Heisenberg used a different approach involving what is now known as the uncertainty principle. This can also be used to explain why the electron beam spreads out after passing through the slit. One version of this involves the equation

\[\Delta p\Delta y\geq h\]

Explain how the terms below apply to electrons as they pass through the slit.
**(i)**: \[\Delta y\]
**(ii)**: \[\Delta p\]
**(d)**: Hence use the uncertainty principle to explain why
**(i)**: the beam spreads out,
**(ii)**: the beam is spread out more when the slit is narrower (smaller \(w\)),
**(iii)**: the beam is spread out less when the incoming electrons have smaller de Broglie wavelength. (You might find it helpful to include a vector diagram).

### 18.2 Rutherford's Alpha-Particle Scattering Experiment

Mini Lecture 1.1 - Rutherford's Alpha-Particle Scattering Experiment, [https://for.edu.sg/bvocd](https://for.edu.sg/bvocd).

_Hans Geiger_ and _Ernest Marsden_ carried out a series of experiments under the direction of _Ernest Rutherford_ in 1908-1913 at the _University of Manchester_ in England, where they shot helium nuclei at a thin layer of gold foil. The results of the experiments disproved Thomson's plum pudding model.

### 18.2.1 Details of Rutherford's Experiment

\(\circ\)**Aim:** To probe the internal structure of the atom.

\(\circ\)**Description**

In Rutherford's alpha(\(\alpha\))-particle scattering experiment, \(\alpha\)-particles (helium-4 nuclei) from a radioactive source were directed towards a sheet of gold foil in a vacuum chamber.

\(\bullet\)The _vacuum_ is necessary because alpha particles only have a short range of about 5 cm in air.

\(\bullet\)The gold foil, being very ductile, is rolled into a very thin sheet of 0.00004 cm (about 100 atoms) thick, so that the high-energy alpha particles can pass through it, instead of being absorbed by it.

\(\bullet\)The angular deflection of alpha particles is measured using a microscope that has a glass screen coated with zinc sulphide (Fig. 3). A charged particle impacting with the screen will produce a tiny flash of light, called a **scintillation**.

\(\circ\)To determine how the alpha particles are scattered, the number of scintillations \(N\) is obtained for each angular deflection \(\theta\). Fig. 4 shows the results of the alpha-particle scattering experiment. Note that the vertical axis is marked in powers of 10. If a linear scale were used, no deflections over angles larger than 10 or 20 degrees would be visible, and the relevant fact that about 1 in 8000 alpha particles are backscattered would be lost.

\(\circ\)**Predicted Alpha Scattering Based on Thomson's Model (Hypothesis)**

The positive charge and the negative electrons are distributed throughout the whole atom. Hence, the electric field inside the atoms should be quite small.

\(\bullet\)Alpha particles are doubly charged helium ions. As the electrical force on an \(\alpha\)-particle that enters the atoms should be quite weak, the maximum deflection \(\theta\) observed should at most be only a few degrees.

\(\circ\)**Actual Observation**

_More than 99% of \(\alpha\)-particles passed through with little or no angular deflection._

_A few \(\alpha\)-particles (~1 in 8000) backscattered, i.e., suffered deflections of more than 90\({}^{\circ}\). A very small number were even deflected backwards._

These results were so unexpected that Rutherford later wrote:

\({}^{\ast}\)_It was quite the most incredible event that ever happened to me in my life. It was almost as incredible as if you had fired a 15-inch shell at a piece of tissue paper and it came back and hit you."_

Figure 4: Graph showing the results of the \(\alpha\)-particle scattering experiment. Note that the vertical axis is marked in powers of 10.

Figure 3: Set up of Rutherford’s Scattering Experiment.

Fig. 5 shows how alpha particles are scattered, depending on how close they pass the nucleus of a gold atom. **1**: Alpha particles that pass outside the gold atom altogether will experience it as an uncharged sphere and are not deflected at all. **2**: Alpha particles that pass through a gold atom's electron cloud experience a net positive charge and are deflected by the repulsive Coulomb force. **3**: The closer the alpha particle passes the nucleus, the greater the angle of deflection. **4**: About 1 in 8000 alpha particles hit a gold nucleus almost face-on, with the result that they are backscattered, i.e., scattered over angles larger than 90 degrees. About 1 in a million even get reflected in almost the same direction as where they came from.

#### 18.2.2 Rutherford's Nuclear Model of an Atom1
Footnote 1: **Drawbacks of Rutherford’s model of the atom:**

(i): It does not obey the Maxwell theory of electrodynamics which dictates that “an accelerated charged particle continuously emits energy.” If an electron were to do this, it would continuously lose energy and spiral inwards, ultimately falling into the nucleus. However, atoms are observed to be quite stable. (ii): It could not explain the discontinuous nature of the line spectrum of the hydrogen atom.

These problems were overcome by Niels Bohr's model of the atom, as outlined in the chapter on Quantum Physics.

Based on his experiment, Rutherford put forward his nuclear model of the atom, which had the following properties (Fig. 6).

(i): There is a positively charged centre in an atom called the nucleus. Nearly all the mass of the atom resides in the nucleus. (ii): The electrons revolve around the nucleus in well-defined orbits. (iii): The size of the nucleus is very small compared to the size of the atom.

Figure 6: Atomic structure proposed by Rutherford.

**Example 1: Rutherford Experiment**

_Young and Freedman 11th Edition - Page 1461 Example 38.5_

An \(\alpha\)-particle is aimed directly at a gold nucleus. An \(\alpha\)-particle has two protons and a charge of +2e, while a gold nucleus has 79 protons and a charge of +79e.

What minimum kinetic energy must the alpha particle have to approach to within 5.0 \(\times\) 10-14 m of the centre of the gold nucleus?

Assume that the gold nucleus, which has about 50 times the mass of an alpha particle, remains at rest.

a) Estimate the size of the full stop at the end of this sentence.

b) If this dot represents the nucleus of a gold atom, how large, on this scale, would the atom be?

c) What is in the space around the nucleus?

### Basic Building Blocks of the Nucleus

The basic building blocks of the nucleus are the **proton** and the **neutron**.

\(\circ\) Experiments show that we can model a nucleus as a sphere with a radius \(R\) that depends on the total number of _nucleons_ (neutrons and protons) in the nucleus (Fig. 7).

\(\circ\) In a **neutral** atom, the **number of protons in the nucleus is equal to the number of electrons orbiting the nucleus**.

\(\circ\) The masses and charges of these particles are given below:

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|} \hline  & **Proton**, **ip** & **Neutron**, **in** & **Electron**, **\({}_{1}^{\circ}\)e** \\ \hline \multirow{3}{*}{**Mass**} & \(m_{p}\) & \(m_{n}\) & \(m_{e}\) \\  & 1.007276 u & 1.008665 u & 0.000548580 u \\  & (1.672622 x 10\({}^{-27}\) kg) & (1.674927 x 10\({}^{-27}\) kg) & (9.10938 x 10\({}^{-31}\) kg) \\ \hline \multirow{2}{*}{**Charge**} & \(+\ e\) & 0 (neutral) & - \(\ e\) \\ \hline \end{tabular}

**Elementary charge e = 1.60 x 10\({}^{-19}\) C**

**Unified atomic mass u = 1.66 x 10\({}^{-27}\) kg (see next page)**

\(\circ\) From the table above, we can see that the nucleus contains over 99.9% of the mass of an atom.

### Nucleide Notation

\(\circ\) A **nuclide** is a species of atom characterized by the specific constitution of its nucleus, i.e., its _number of protons_ and its _number of neutrons_.

\(\circ\) The _proton number_, \(Z\), is the number of protons in the nucleus. \(Z\) is also called the _charge number_ or the _atomic number_.

\(\circ\) The _nucleon number_, \(A\), is the total number of **nucleons**. A nucleon is either a neutron or proton in the nucleus. \(A\) is also known as the _mass number_.

\(\circ\) Therefore, the number of neutrons in the nucleus is _N = A -Z_

\(\circ\) The **notation** for a nuclide \(X\) with proton number \(Z\) and nucleon number \(A\) is \({}_{2}^{A}X\).

### Isotopes

\(\circ\)**Isotopes** are atoms that have the same number of _protons_ but different numbers of _neutrons_.

\(\circ\) Examples of isotopes of hydrogen: \({}_{1}^{1}\)H (hydrogen); \({}_{1}^{2}\)H (deuterium); \({}_{1}^{3}\)H (tritium).

Examples of isotopes of carbon:

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|} \hline  & _Abundance in Nature_ & _Remarks_ \\ \hline \({}_{6}^{11}\)C & Trace & Radioactive: half-life of 20.4 minutes \\ \hline \({}_{6}^{12}\)C & 98.90 \% & Stable \\ \hline \({}_{13}^{13}\)C & 1.10 \% & Stable \\ \hline \({}_{6}^{14}\)C & Trace & Radioactive: half-life of 5730 years \\ \hline \end{tabular}

\(\circ\) Isotopes have nearly identical chemical properties (same proton number), but different physical properties (different nucleon number).

Figure 7: The nucleus is approximately spherical and contains protons & neutrons.

#### 18.3.4 Common Units used in Nuclear Physics

* **Atomic Mass**: atomic masses are usually expressed in terms of the unified atomic mass unit, u.
* **Atomic Mass Unit (u)**: one unified atomic mass unit is one-twelfth the mass of the carbon-12 atom. Hence, 1 u = \(\frac{1}{12}\)\(\left(\frac{\text{mass of 1 mole of carbon-12}}{\text{Avogadro's number}}\right)\) = \(\frac{1}{12}\)\(\left(\frac{0.012\text{ kg}}{6.02\times 10^{23}}\right)\) = \(1.66\times 10^{-27}\) kg. Notes:
* The mass number \(A\) should not be confused with the atomic mass. Mass number is an integer, specific to a nuclide, and has no unit - it is simply a count of the number of nucleons.
* **The Electron-Volt**: in nuclear physics, the unit of energy called an electron-volt (eV) is often used: 1 eV = (1.60 x 10\({}^{\text{-19}}\) C)(1 J/C) = 1.60 x 10\({}^{\text{-19}}\) J Usually, slightly larger units are more convenient, such as: 1 keV = 1.0 x 10\({}^{3}\) eV and 1 MeV = 1.0 x 10\({}^{6}\) eV (= 1.60 x 10\({}^{\text{-16}}\) J) (= 1.60 x 10\({}^{\text{-13}}\) J)

### Nuclear Reactions

The nuclei of atoms can change, or be made to change, in various ways. Changes to the nuclei of atoms are called nuclear reactions.

#### Examples

* **Radioactive decay** Radioactive decay is a process where an unstable nucleus _spontaneously_ and _randomly_ emits radiation, changing into a more stable nucleus.
* **Nuclear fission** Nuclear fission occurs when a massive nucleus splits into two less massive nuclei of approximately the same nucleon number.
* Nuclear Fusion: [https://for.edu.sq/b86k00](https://for.edu.sq/b86k00).

Nuclear fusion occurs when two less massive nuclei combine (fuse) to form a single more massive nucleus.

This can only occur when the nuclei have very high energy (e.g., at very high temperatures). The reason for this is that, as the nuclei approach each other, kinetic energy is converted into electrical potential energy. If the nuclei lose all their kinetic energy before they bind, fusion cannot occur (see Example 1).

#### Nuclear Reactions and Conservation Laws

Mini Lecture 1.3 - Nuclear Reactions: [https://for.edu.sg/3uli87](https://for.edu.sg/3uli87).

Nuclear reactions may be shown in a form similar to chemical equations, for example

\[{}^{1}_{0}\textbf{n}\ \ +\ \ ^{14}_{7}\textbf{N}\ \ \rightarrow\ ^{14}_{6}\textbf{C}\ \ +\ \ ^{1}_{1}\textbf{p}\]

The transformations of particles must follow certain conservation laws. In all nuclear reactions, **the following quantities** must be equal on each side of the equation:

* Sum of nucleon numbers
* Sum of proton numbers
* Net electric charge
* Total momentum
* Total energy
* It is observed that in a nuclear reaction, the total mass of reactants and products is different. A decrease in mass is always accompanied by a release of energy, whereas an increase in mass is always accompanied by an absorption of energy.
* The energy \(E\) associated with a change of mass \(m\) is given by the mass-energy equivalence relation _E = mc\({}^{2}\)_, where \(c\) is the speed of light.

**Example 3: Nuclear Reaction Equations**

_Mini SAA 1.5 and SAA 1.6_

* The nuclear equation for a particular fission process is given by: \({}^{235}_{92}\textbf{U}+^{1}_{0}\textbf{n}\ \rightarrow\ ^{14}_{55}\textbf{Cs}+^{2}_{ 0}\textbf{Rb}+2\ ^{1}_{0}\textbf{n}\)
* The nucleon number, and ii) the proton number of the _rubidium_ atom
* Two deuterium nuclei can fuse to produce a tritium nucleus and a proton. Write a nuclear equation for this reaction.

**Answer:**

**Example 4: Energy-Mass Equivalence**

What is the energy equivalent, in MeV, of one unified atomic mass, 1 u?

**Answer:**

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:701]

An atomic nucleus consists of positively charged protons and neutral neutrons, all concentrated in a tiny volume in space. Electrostatic repulsion between the positively charged protons should have caused the disintegration of the nuclei spontaneously. However, we know that most nuclei are very stable, except for radioactive nuclei.

It dawned on physicists that there must be another force, other than the electrostatic force, which holds the nucleons together. This is now known as the strong nuclear force.

#### Strong Nuclear Force & the Stability of Nuclei

\(\circ\) **Nature and Range of the Strong Nuclear Force**

\(\bullet\): At typical nucleon separations of 1.3 fm (1.3 x 10\({}^{\text{-15}}\)m), it is a very strong attractive force: -10\({}^{4}\) N. \(\bullet\): At much smaller separations between nucleons, the force becomes repulsive. \(\bullet\): Beyond about 1.3 fm separation, the force quickly drops to zero. \(\bullet\): Thus, the nuclear force is a **short-range force**. \(\bullet\): The much smaller Coulomb force between protons has a much longer range and becomes the only significant force between protons when their separation exceeds about 2.5 x 10\({}^{\text{-15}}\) m. \(\circ\) **The nuclear force is independent of charge**

The nuclear forces associated with proton-proton, proton-neutron and neutron-neutron interactions are the same.

Figure 8: Graph of forces between two \(n\)

### Stability of a Nucleus

Apart from the nucleus of the \({}^{1}_{,}\)H atom, _there is a very delicate balance between the strong nuclear forces that act between adjacent nucleons and the electrostatic forces that act between the protons_. This determines how **stable** a particular nucleus is.

Out of the 339 naturally occurring nuclides, 254 are stable and 85 are unstable. Beyond the 339 naturally occurring nuclides, more than 3000 radionuclides have been artificially produced.

A plot of \(N\) vs. \(Z\) for a number of stable nuclides is given in Fig. 9.

\(\circ\) Note that for **light nuclides**, they are _most stable if they contain almost equal numbers of neutrons and protons_ (i.e. _N = Z_).

\(\circ\)**Heavier nuclides** are _more stable_ if _N > Z_

This difference can be partially understood by recognizing that as _the number of protons increases, the electrostatic repulsive force increases_. Hence, _more neutrons are needed to keep the nucleus stable_ as neutrons are affected only by the attractive strong nuclear force.

\(\circ\)**Beyond _Z = 83_**, there are no stable nuclides. This is because the repulsive forces between the protons can no longer be compensated by the addition of neutrons.

Nuclides with more than 83 protons are unstable and tend to decay or disintegrate into other nuclides.

#### Nuclear Binding Energy

\(\circ\) Like the ionisation energy (also known as electron binding energy), that has to be supplied to an atom in the ground state (lowest energy level) to completely liberate an orbital electron, work has to be done against the strong nuclear force to disassemble a nucleus into individual unbound protons and neutrons. This _nuclear binding energy_ is typically about a million times larger than a typical electron binding energy.

\(\circ\) This binding energy is also the _energy that is released when free protons and neutrons are bound together in a nucleus_ (Fig. 11).

Figure 11: If the nucleons bind together to form a nucleus, energy will be released.

Figure 10: Energy must be supplied to break up a nucleus into its constituent neutrons and protons.

Figure 9: A plot of the neutron number \(N\) versus the proton number \(Z\) for the stable nuclides (solid points). The dashed line corresponds to _N = Z_. The plots are centred on the so-called line of stability. The shaded area shows radioactive (unstable) nuclides.

#### 18.5.4 Mass Defect

Recall that _mass_ and _energy_ are equivalent and are related by Einstein's equation \(E=mc^{2}\).

Since energy is released when the individual protons and neutrons bind to form a stable or semi-stable nucleus, **the nucleus will have a smaller mass than the total mass of the separate neutrons and protons.**

This difference in mass \(\Delta m\) is known as the _mass defect._

To calculate the mass defect \(\Delta m\) for a _nucleus_ that has \(Z\) protons and \(N\) neutrons:

\(\Delta m\) = (_Sum of mass of constituent nucleons_) - (_Mass of nucleus_)

\(\Delta m\) = (\(Zm_{p}+Nm_{n}\)) - (\(M_{nucleus}\))

where \(m_{p}\) is the mass of a proton, \(m_{n}\) is the mass of a neutron and \(M_{nucleus}\) is the mass of the nucleus.

It therefore follows from Einstein's mass-energy-equivalence relationship that:

\(\Delta m\) is the mass defect.

**Example 7: Binding Energy of Deuterium**

_Serway College Physics p943_

The nucleus of a deuterium atom, called a deuteron, consists of one proton and one neutron.

Calculate the deuteron's binding energy in MeV, given that its nuclear mass is 2.013 553 u.

Mass of proton \(m_{\rm b}\) = 1.007 276 u

Mass of neutron \(m_{\rm b}\) = 1.008 665 u

### Binding Energy per Nucleon (B.E./A)

Although the larger an atomic nucleus, the greater its total binding energy, it is the **binding energy per nucleon that determines the stability of the nucleus.**

The **binding energy per nucleon** represents _the average energy required to remove a nucleon from the nucleus._

Therefore, the **greater the binding energy per nucleon, the more stable the nucleus**.

A _graph of binding energy per nucleon against the number of nucleons (Fig. 12b)_ shows several interesting features:

1. Very small nuclei and very large nuclei are both less stable than nuclei of intermediate sizes.
2. The average binding energy per nucleon is about 8 MeV.
3. \({}^{56}\)Fe is one of the most stable and abundant nuclei. It resides close to the top of the curve, with a binding energy per nucleon of 8.8 MeV. The most stable nucleus of all is that of nickel-62.
4. Very small nuclei tend to form more stable heavier nuclei through **fusion**.
5. Similarly, very large nuclei can be split into smaller, more stable nuclei through **fission.**

**Example 8: Binding Energy per Nucleon**

_TYS NS6/III (part, modified - graph from Aktil, Benet and Millar)_

The binding energy per nucleon varies with nucleon number in the way shown in the figure. During one particular fission process, a uranium-236 nucleus gives, among its fission products, a strontium-90 nucleus and a xenon-143 nucleus.

* Use the values on the figure to calculate the energy released during this fission process.
* What other fission particles are produced by this process? Why do these particles not have to be taken into account in the calculation in (a)?
* Why does a release of energy occur when there is an increase in the binding energy?

### Radioactivity

As we have seen, the stability of a nucleus is determined by its binding energy per nucleon. One of the possible routes via which unstable nuclei can be transmuted into more stable nuclei is via _radioactive decay_.

* Radioactive decay is a **spontaneous** and **random** process where an unstable nucleus changes into a more stable nucleus, emitting radiation as it does so.
* **Spontaneous Process**: When we say that radioactive decay is a _spontaneous_ process, it means that radioactive decay is not triggered by external factors or influences and that the rate of decay is not affected by environmental conditions.
* **Random Process**: When we say that radioactive decay is a _random_ process, it means that it is not possible to predict which nucleus will decay or when a particular nucleus will decay, while the _probability of decay per unit time_ is constant and the same for all nuclei in the sample.
* Hence, the decay of a radioactive atom _is not affected by any chemical reaction_. It _can neither be sped up nor slowed down_ and is _independent of physical conditions_ such as temperature, pressure and the decay of other atoms.
* **Evidence of Randomness of Radioactivity*
* The random nature of radioactive decay can be demonstrated by observing the fluctuations in _count rate_. The _activity_ (see 18.6.2 below) of a source is the rate at which a source of unstable nuclei decays. If you use a detector to measure the number of emissions, you will only record a fraction of the total emission. This is because normal detectors do not usually surround the radioactive source. However, the detected _count rate_ will generally be _directly proportional_ to the _activity_ of the source.
* When a Geiger-Muller tube (see appendix A) is placed near a source, the fluctuations in the count rate recorded by the tube show the randomness of radioactive decay (Fig. 13).

Figure 13: The fluctuations in the count rate of a radioactive decay demonstrate its random nature.

#### Alpha Decay

\(\circ\) An \(\alpha\)-particle is the nucleus of a helium-4 (\({}^{4}_{2}\)He ) atom, with a charge of +2e. It may be emitted from an unstable nucleus.

\(\circ\) Alpha decay occurs when an unstable heavy nucleus (the "parent") ejects an alpha particle, transforming itself into a different nuclide (the "daughter") after losing two protons and two neutrons (Fig. 14).

\(\circ\) Alpha decay can be written symbolically as: \({}^{A}_{Z}\)X \(\rightarrow\)\({}^{A-4}_{Z-2}\)Y \(+\)\({}^{4}_{2}\)He where \({}^{A}_{Z}\)X is known as the **parent nucleus** and \({}^{A-4}_{Z-2}\)Y is known as the **daughter nucleus**, e.g. \({}^{238}\)U is an alpha emitter and decays according to the scheme \({}^{238}_{92}\)U \(\rightarrow\)\({}^{234}_{90}\)Th \(+\)\({}^{4}_{2}\)He (Fig. 14).

\(\circ\) Alpha-emitting nuclei tend to be very heavy nuclei (with a very high proton number).

\(\circ\) **Energy and Momentum in Alpha Decay**

Energy is released during an alpha decay. By the mass-energy equivalence principle, the combined mass of the daughter nucleus and the alpha particle is smaller than the mass of the parent nucleus. The energy released shows up in the _kinetic energy of the daughter nucleus and the \(\alpha\)-particle.

Since the total linear momentum is conserved, if the parent nucleus was initially at rest, **the daughter nucleus and the \(\alpha\)-particle must have momenta that are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction.** Since the \(\alpha\)-particle has a much smaller mass, it carries away most of the kinetic energy.

(Useful alternative expression of the kinetic energy of a particle: KE = \(\frac{p^{2}}{2m}\).

**Example 10: Alpha Decay**

\(\bullet\) _YYS 1834713 (part)_

A stationary radon atom may decay spontaneously into a polonium atom and a helium atom: \({}^{222}_{86}\)Rn \(\rightarrow\)\({}^{218}_{84}\)Po \(+\)\({}^{4}_{2}\)He The masses of these atoms are: \({}^{222}\)Rn: 222.0176 u; \({}^{218}\)Po: 218.0090 u; \({}^{4}\)He: 4.0026 u.

a) Explain carefully how energy is conserved in this decay. Assuming that no \(\gamma\) ray is emitted, calculate the total kinetic energy of the decay products.

b) Explain carefully how momentum is conserved.

### Beta Decay

\(\circ\) **Beta decay** is a type of radioactive decay in which a \(\beta\)-particle is emitted.

\(\circ\) **A** \(\beta\)**-particle can be**

\(\bullet\) **a high-speed electron ejected from an unstable nucleus, referred to as a** \(\beta\)**-particle, or**

\(\bullet\) **a high-speed positron2 ejected from an unstable nucleus, referred to as a** \(\beta\)**-particle. (For the purpose of the A-level, a** \(\beta\)**-particle is an electron.)**

Footnote 2: The positron is the antiparticle of the electron. For most kinds of particles, there is an associated antiparticle with the same mass and opposite charge. Thus, the positron has a mass \(m_{\rm e}\) and a charge \(+e\).

\(\circ\) **Beta decay can be:**

\(\bullet\) **Beta-minus (\(\beta\)) decay**, where an **unstable neutron in the nucleus** _transforms into a proton and an electron and ejects the electron (Fig. 15a)._

This decay process can be written as:

\(\bullet\) **Beta-plus (\(\beta\)) decay**, where an **unstable proton in the nucleus** _transforms into a neutron and a positron_ **and ejects the positron (Fig. 15b)._

The decay process can be written as:

\(\circ\) **In both cases:**

1. **As the proton number has changed, the parent nucleus** **transmutes into another nucleus**2**. Although the respective numbers of protons and neutrons in the nucleus change during beta decay, the nucleon number remains the same.**
3. **Although** \(\beta\)**-decay results in an electron being ejected from the nucleus, the electron** _does not_ **exist within the nucleus prior to the** \(\beta\)**-decay. It is created during the radioactive decay process. (This process is** _not_ **ionisation, where an orbital electron is freed from an atom.)**

Figure 19:

Figure 18:

**Activity (A) of a Radioactive Decay**

The _rate of decay_ or _activity_ of a radioactive sample is the number of disintegrations per unit time.

\[A=-\frac{dN}{dt}\]

where \(N\) is the number of radioactive nuclei present.

**S.I. unit of activity:** s\({}^{-1}\) or Bq (becquerel)

**Notes:**

\(\frac{dN}{dt}\) is a negative number, since \(N\), the number of undecayed nuclei, decreases with time. The activity is reported as a positive number, since it represents the number of nuclei that decay per unit time.

1 Bq = 1 disintegration per second.

Another commonly used unit of activity is **curie** (Ci), defined as 1 Ci = 3.7 x 10\({}^{10}\) Bq.

The curie is a very large unit. Most of the activity of radioactive substances is measured in millicurie (mCi) or microcurie (uCi).

**The Geiger-Muller Tube**

_(Refer to appendix A for more information about Geiger-Muller Tube)_

A Geiger-Muller tube, **when connected to a counter**, measures the **count rate**_C_ instead of the activity. This is because the detector only captures _a portion_ of the radioactive emissions from a sample of radioactive nuclides.

The **count rate is a fraction of the activity, so _C & A_

When ionising radiation passes through the tube, each ionising particle produces a pulse voltage in the external circuit of a Geiger-Muller tube detector.

In **order to measure the number of pulses from the detectors, a counter or a ratemeter must be connected to the Geiger-Muller tube.**

A scaler counts the actual number of pulses while a ratemeter gives directly the average number of pulses per second or _count rate_.

Figure 20: Geiger-Müller TubeBackground Radiation

\(\circ\)In the absence of a specific radioactive source, a radiation detector still picks up a non-zero count rate (typically 20 to 50 counts per minute) from the environment. This measurement is known as the **background count**.

\(\circ\)Background count is due to **ionising radiation** that is constantly present in the environment. This radiation is known as **background radiation** and its sources can be natural or man-made.

\(\circ\)Naturally occurring sources account for about 80% of our exposure, and is contributed by things such as rocks, radon (a colourless and odourless gas that is easily trapped in buildings) and cosmic radiation. Man-made sources include those used in nuclear medicine, nuclear power plants and in consumer products (such as tobacco, which contains radioactive Pb-210). For more information on background radiation, refer to appendix B.

\(\circ\)In experiments to study radioactivity, the background count is usually subtracted from the measurement, to eliminate the systematic error in the count rate.

### Decay Constant

Although radioactive decay is a random process, if the _number of radioactive nuclei is large_, we can associate a probability of decay to the nuclei.

\(\circ\)The rate at which a particular decay process occurs in a sample is proportional to the number of radioactive nuclei present:

\[\frac{dN}{dt}=-\lambda N\ \........................\ (1)\]

where \(\lambda\) is the proportionality constant known as the **decay constant**.

Note:

1. Since Activity \(A=-\frac{dN}{dt}\), we can also write equation (1) as \[\boxed{A=\lambda N}\ \........................\ (2)\]
2. Equation (1) can also be written as: \(\lambda=\frac{(-\frac{dN}{dt})}{N}\)

The _decay constant_ is the probability per unit time that a nucleus will decay.

3. Rewriting equation (1), we can also have: \[\frac{dN}{N}=-\lambda dt\] Integrating, \(\int_{N_{o}}^{N}\frac{1}{N^{\prime}}dN^{\prime}=-\lambda\int_{0}^{t}dt^{\prime}\) \[\Rightarrow \ln(\frac{N}{N_{o}})=-\lambda t\] \[\Rightarrow \boxed{N=N_{o}\,e^{-\lambda t}}........................\ (3)\] where \(N\) is the number of radioactive nuclei present at time \(t\) and \(N_{o}\) represents the number of undecayed radioactive nuclei at \(t=0\).

Equation (3) shows that _the number of undecayed radioactive nuclei in a sample decreases exponentially with time_ (Fig. 21).

Figure 21: Plot of the exponential decay law for radioactive nuclei. The curve is jagged (see Fig. 13). The smooth curve is fitted to represent the trend of the decay. The time \(T_{{}_{12}}\) is the half-life of the sample, the average time it takes for half of the nuclei to decay.

Figure 23: Carbon-14 Dating.

### Radiation Hazard

Radioactive emissions can cause damage to the cells in our bodies. Most of this damage is due to **ionisation** when the radiation passes. If levels of radiation are high enough, there can also be damage due to heating effects as the body absorbs the energy from the radiation.

\(\circ\) **Ionising Radiation**

Ionising radiation encompasses energetic subatomic particles, ions and atoms moving at high speeds and electromagnetic waves at the high-energy end of the electromagnetic spectrum. During an interaction with an atom, the ionising radiation may remove electrons from the atom, causing the atom to be electrically charged or ionised (Fig. 24).

\(\circ\) **Damage to Cells**

The nucleus of a biological cell has been shown to be the part of the cell most vulnerable to radiation damage. This is because the nucleus contains the DNA molecules which carry the organism's genetic code.

\(\circ\) **Types of damage to cells**

Damage may be **direct** or **indirect**.

1. Ionisation may cause **direct damage** to the DNA within the nucleus, when the whole DNA molecule may either be broken into fragments or have sections of it removed.
2. **Indirect damage** occurs when the radiation interacts with other molecules in the cell, producing ions and radicals (H+, OH+, H+, OH+), which can then "attack" other cell structures and DNA. The radicals can also combine to form toxic substances like H\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{2}\) which could initiate harmful reactions within the cells.

\(\circ\) **Effects of Damage to DNA**

**Cell death**: If the damage within the cell is great, then **cell death** occurs immediately or within a very short time.

**Cell is unable to replicate**: The DNA in the cell nucleus may have been damaged so badly that the **cell is unable to replicate itself by **cell division**. This may have serious long-term consequences for the organism.

**Cancer, genetic mutation and sterility**: At low doses, cellular reproduction may continue for many cell generations, giving rise to delayed effects such as **enhanced risk of developing cancer**. Rapidly multiplying cells are far more susceptible to damage, so special attention is paid in the use of ionising radiation on whom children and young persons. The reproductive system may also be affected, giving rise to an **increased risk of genetic mutations**. If the damage is severe enough, it can cause **sterility**.

Figure 24: Incoming radiation interacting with a neutral atom, causing ionisation

## Appendix A Detecting Radiation

Nuclear radiation may come from the following:

1. Naturally occurring radioactive materials, such as compounds of uranium, thorium and potassium.
2. Purified or man-made sources, which are stronger than the natural sources. The ones you find in the school laboratory are sealed and are called _closed_ sources. They are stored in lead-lined boxes, as most radiation is reduced considerably by a layer of lead.
3. Space: High-energy particles, such as muons and pions, reach the earth's surface from space. Such exotic, high-energy particles are also produced artificially in particle accelerators. All these particles decay into other ionising particles very quickly. It is unlikely that you will be able to detect the original particles in the laboratory, but the effects of the daughter particles contribute to the background radiation.

### Wilson Cloud Chamber

A cloud chamber (Fig. 25) is a device that makes the paths of ionising radiation entering it visible. Water is introduced into chamber Y. If sufficient time is given, the air in the chamber becomes saturated with water vapour.

A series of adiabatic expansions is carried out to cool the air in chamber Y. As the air cools, the water condenses on the dust particles in the air and will fall off as water droplets. After a series of controlled adiabatic expansions, the air can be made dust-free and supersaturated, i.e. the vapour pressure is greater than the saturated vapour pressure at the reduced temperature reached, but no water vapour condenses.

An ionising particle that enters chamber Y will collide with the air and water molecules to produce many ions. Each of these ions may act as a nucleating centre on which water can condense. Hence, a passing ionising particle will leave a track of water droplets, showing the route the particle took. Light that is scattered from the tracks makes them visible.

### Glaser's Bubble Chamber

In the same way that air can be super-saturated with water vapour, a liquid under pressure can be heated to a temperature higher than that at which boiling normally takes place; it is then said to be superheated. If the pressure is suddenly reduced, bubbles may not form in the liquid for a certain time interval. During this quiet period, if the liquid is exposed to ionising radiation, nucleating centres are obtained for bubble formation and the liquid quickly evaporates into bubbles which grow rapidly. Hence, the bubble track reveals the path of the ionising radiation.

Fig. 26 shows a schematic diagram of a bubble chamber. The magnetic field acts on charged particles and causes them to travel in helical paths, whose radii are determined by the particles' charge-to-mass ratios and their velocities. Because the magnitude of the charge of all known, charged, long-lived subatomic particles is the same as that of an electron, their radius of curvature must be proportional to their momentum. Thus, by measuring a particle's radius of curvature, its momentum can be determined.

Figure 26: A bubble chamberA Geiger-Muller (GM) tube consists of a tube filled with a low-pressure inert gas, such as helium, neon or argon, and an organic vapour or a halogen gas (see Fig. 27). The tube contains electrodes, between which there is a potential difference of several hundred volts, but no current flowing. The walls of the tube are either entirely metal or have their inside surface coated with a conductor to form the cathode, while the anode is a wire passing up the centre of the tube.

When ionising radiation passes through the tube, some of the gas molecules are ionised, creating positively charged ions and electrons. The strong electric field created by the tube's electrodes accelerates the ions towards the cathode and the electrons towards the anode. The ion pairs gain sufficient energy to ionise more gas molecules through collisions on the way, creating an avalanche of charged particles. This results in a short, intense pulse of current which passes from the negative electrode to the positive electrode and is measured or counted.

The usual form of a GM tube is an _end-window tube_. This type is so named, because the tube has a window at one end through which ionising radiation can easily penetrate. The other end normally has the electrical connectors. There are two types of end-window tubes: the _glass-mantle_ type and the _mica-window_ type. The glass-window type will not detect alpha radiation, since alpha-particles are unable to penetrate the glass, but is usually cheaper and will usually detect beta radiation and X-rays. The mica-window type will detect alpha radiation but is more fragile.

The ideal GM tube should produce a single current pulse on entry of every ionising particle. It must not give any spurious pulses and must recover quickly to the passive state. Unfortunately for these requirements, when positive argon ions reach the cathode and become neutral argon atoms again by obtaining electrons from it, the atoms can acquire their electrons in enhanced energy levels. These atoms then return to their ground state by emitting photons, which can in turn produce further ionisations and cause spurious secondary pulse discharges. Some form of quenching of the ionisation is therefore essential. The disadvantage of quenching is that for a short time after a discharge pulse has occurred (the so-called _dead time_, which is typically a few microseconds), the tube is rendered insensitive and is temporarily unable to detect the arrival of any new ionising particles. This effectively causes a loss of counts at sufficiently high count rates.

_External quenching_ uses control electronics to temporarily remove the high voltage between the electrodes. _Self-quenching_ or _internal-quenching_ tubes stop the discharge without external assistance, by means of the addition of a small amount of an organic vapour or a halogen such as bromine or chlorine. In the latter case, the choice of quencher molecules is important. If a poor gas quencher is introduced in the tube, the positive argon ions have multiple collisions with the quencher gas and transfer their charge and some energy to them. Neutral argon atoms are then produced and the quencher gas ions reach the cathode, get excited and decay by photon emission, thereby producing spurious tube discharges as before. However, effective quencher molecules, when excited do not lose their energy by photon emission, but by dissociation into neutral quencher atoms. No spurious output pulses are then produced.

Figure 27: Geiger-Müller Tube

### _Counters - Scalers and Ratemeters_

Each ionising particle or radiation produces a pulse voltage in the external circuit of a GM detector. In order to measure the number of pulses from the detectors, some form of counter must be used (Fig. 27). A scaler counts the actual number of pulses while a ratemeter gives directly the average number of pulses per second or _count rate_.

### _Scintillator_

Gas-filled detectors like the GM tube are inefficient as gamma detectors as the probability of an interaction is low. A scintillator is a "solid" detector which addresses this shortfall. The incoming ionising radiation interacts with the scintillator to produce many electronic transitions. The decay of these transitions produces many photons of low energy, i.e., the scintillator material _fluoresces_.

Each emitted photon travels through the transparent scintillator material and ejects an electron from a photosensitive surface. Each of these electrons goes on to emit more secondary electrons: the numbers of electrons are multiplied by a photomultiplier and turn into a voltage pulse. The pulse amplitude is a measure of the energy of the incident ionising radiation.

Figure 27: (b) Connection of a scaler to a G-M tube for detection of nuclear particles.

## Appendix B Background Radiation

Background radiation is the ionising radiation that is constantly present in the environment. Sources of such radiation can be natural or man-made (Fig. 29).

### Natural Sources of Radiation

Naturally occurring radiation accounts for about 80% of our exposure. Most of the exposure is from indoor radon, followed by radiation from outer space and from the Earth's crust.

\(\circ\) **Radon**

Approximately 55% of our exposure to radiation comes from radon, which is a _colourless_, _odourless_ and _relatively inert_, naturally occurring radioactive gas. Radon-222 is one of the elements in the long radioactive decay chain from uranium-238 (Fig. 30) and the less common isotope radon-220 is part of the decay series from thorium-232 (Fig. 31), both of which can be found in rocks and soil.

\(\bullet\) **Dangers of Radon Gas**

Radon is the second leading cause of lung cancer in the United States, with only smoking causing more lung-cancer deaths. Key dangers associated with radon gas are not so much the radon itself, but its radioactive daughters, which are solid particles that easily attach themselves to dust particles, which may be inhaled. When inhaled, these particles stick to the surfaces of the bronchial tubes and the \(\alpha\)-particle emitted in the decay of the radon daughters damage the cells they are attached to, causing cancer.

\(\bullet\) **How Does Radon Get Into Homes?**

Radon usually migrates into homes and other buildings from the ground through openings in the floor or wall. Buildings trap radon inside, where it accumulates and may become a health hazard. Any home or building may have a radon problem, be it a new or an old home, a well-sealed or a draughty one, as well as homes with and without basements.

\(\circ\) **Soil and Buildings**

Natural radioactive material in rocks and soil account for about another 8% of the radiation dose a person typically receives in a year. The earth's crust contains small amounts of uranium, thorium and radium, as well as radioactive isotopes of several elements, including potassium. The radiation dose also comes from some building materials (such as bricks and concrete).

Figure 31: The \({}^{220}\)Th series

Figure 29: Sources of radiation exposure* Cosmic Radiation Yet another 8% of our exposure comes from cosmic radiation Cosmic radiation
* Cosmic radiation mainly originates from the sun and outer space. Radioactive nuclides (mainly carbon-14) are produced through interactions of the cosmic rays with atoms in the atmosphere.
* Cosmic rays are extremely energetic particles, primarily protons, which originate in the sun, other stars and from violent cataclysms in the far reaches of space. Cosmic-ray particles interact with the upper atmosphere of the earth and produce showers of lower-energy particles. Many of these lower-energy particles are absorbed by the earth's atmosphere, but a considerable fraction reaches the surface of the earth.
* The cosmic-radiation exposure varies with altitude. The exposure of an individual to cosmic rays is greater at higher elevations than at sea level. For example, a passenger in a jetliner travelling at 37,000 feet would receive about 60 times as much cosmic radiation as a person standing at sea level for the same length of time.
* Natural Radioactivity in the Body Small traces of many naturally occurring radioactive materials are present in the human body. These come mainly from naturally occurring radioactive nuclides present in the food we eat and in the air we breathe. These isotopes include tritium (\({}^{3}\)H), carbon-14, and potassium-40.

### Man-Made Sources

Since the discovery of radiation, people have benefited from the use of radiation in medicine and industry.

Man-made sources of radiation account for about 20% of our total exposure to radiation.

* **Medicine** The radiation used in medicine is the largest source of man-made radiation to which people in most countries are exposed. Most of the exposure is from diagnostic X-rays. Physicians use X-rays in more than half of all medical diagnoses to determine the extent of a disease or physical injury. Radiation is also used in cancer treatment, where precisely targeted radiation destroys diseased cells without killing nearby healthy cells. Furthermore, radiopharmaceuticals are used to locate tumours in a patient's body and to treat cancer. One-third of all successful cancer treatments involve radiation.
* **Consumer Products** Small amounts of man-made background radiation can be attributed to consumer products like televisions, smoke detectors, gas-lantern mantles, natural-gas heating and mining and agriculture products.
* **Nuclear-Power Plants** Nuclear-power reactors, which use radioactive uranium, reduce the reliance on fossil fuels. Nuclear-power plant operations account for less than a hundredth of a percent of the average American's total radiation exposure.

* **Nuclear Fallouts*
* Nuclear weapons derive their explosive power from the uncontrolled radioactive breakup of plutonium and uranium. This yields many radioactive daughter products that are blown high into the atmosphere and are carried around the earth. These radioactive elements gradually fall back to earth (fallout) over a period of many years. During the 1950s and early 1960s, many test explosions were carried out in the atmosphere. In 1963, an Atmospheric Test Ban Treaty was signed, and most subsequent tests have been conducted underground. The peak year for radioactive fallout was 1963 and levels have been declining since then. Levels of fallout are now less than ten per cent of what they were at their peak.

* The tobacco in cigarettes contains Pb-210. Pb-210 is a naturally occurring radionuclide that precipitates out of the atmosphere and deposits on the leaves of tobacco. When the tobacco is inhaled, the smoker receives a dose from the inhaled Pb-210 as well as Po-210, the decay product of Pb-210. Pb-210 is deposited on the surfaces of bones and Po-210 is deposited in the liver, kidney, and spleen.

## Appendix C Uses of Radioactive Nuclides

Radioactive nuclides are used in some industries and in nuclear medicine for their chemical properties and as sources of radiation. Some examples are listed below.

* **In Medicine:*
* As a tracer. Any radioactive nuclide which is to be used as a tracer for diagnostic nuclermedicine purposes must be incorporated into a pharmaceutical product which can be administered to the patient. The pharmaceutical product and the radioactive nuclide which it incorporates should have the following properties:
* They should concentrate in the organ or system which is to be imaged or assessed.
* They should not change the functioning of the organ, i.e., the pharmaceutical behaves in the same way as the substance it is replacing.
* The half-life of the radioactive nuclide should be as short as possible to reduce radiation damage, but sufficiently long to enable measurements to be made. Some examples of the use of radioactive tracers in medicine are listed below:
* **Thrombosis (blood clots).*
* A radioactive tracer, iodinated fibrinogen, is introduced into the blood. If there is a blood clot forming in some part of the body, a concentration of the radioactive fibrinogen will occur at that point. The concentration can be located using a radiation detector.
* **Haemorrhage inside the body.*
* Like thrombosis, the radioactive tracers are used to locate the precise site of haemorrhage in an emergency. Radioactive chromium is injected into the body and is taken up by the red blood cells and carried uniformly throughout the body. However, there will be more blood accumulating at the haemorrhage site and the greater activity there can be located using a radiation detector.
* Cancer treatment, Immature cells and cells that are growing or dividing most rapidly are most sensitive to radiation. This is used in radiation treatment of cancer. Often, cancer cells are growing rapidly. Hence, they are much more likely to be killed by a high dose of gamma radiation from a cobalt-60 source than normal cells that divide less frequently.
In Industry:

As a tracer, Tracers are used to detect leaks in underground pipes by doping the water in the pipes and using a detector to check where the water flows. Tracers are also used to check the wear of a machine part. For example, we can check the wear of a piston if it has been doped with a radioactive material during manufacture by checking the activity in the oil that is used with the piston.

To check for cracks and imperfections

Gamma rays can be used in place of X-rays to photograph solid objects. Gamma rays are directed at the object and the image is captured on a photographic film placed at the other side of the object. The film can reveal any imperfections such as cracks. The technique has an advantage over X-rays as no high-voltage electrical sources are needed.

Radiation can also be used to check and control the thickness of paper or plastic during the manufacturing process. The thickness of rolled sheets of plastic can be controlled by placing a beta source on top of the sheet and a detector beneath it. If the sheet is too thin, the count rate will rise. This rise in count rate can then be directly coupled to the rollers, so that their separation is increased.

In Agriculture:

Suppose a plant research centre wishes to investigate the ability of a particular plant to take up magnesium through its roots. This is possible by watering the plant with a fertiliser containing a known, extremely low concentration of radioactive magnesium-28. If a detector is placed in contact with the leaves of the plant, an increased count rate soon after watering in the fertiliser indicates that the magnesium has travelled through the plant to the leaves. This can happen within a time as short as 20 minutes.

As a sterilisation tool:

Radiation can also be used as a means of preserving food, because exposure to high levels of radiation can destroy or incapatate bacteria and mould spores. Techniques include exposing foods to gamma rays, high-energy electron beams and X-rays. Food preserved this way can be placed in a sealed container (to keep out new spoiling agents) and stored for long periods of time.

## Appendix D Calculating Radiation Doses

* **Radiation dosimetry** is the quantitative description of the effect of radiation on living tissue.
* **Absorbed dose**:
* The **absorbed dose*
* of radiation is defined as the energy delivered to tissue per unit mass.
* The SI unit of absorbed dose is the _gray_ (Gy):
* 1 Gy = 1 J/kg
* Another commonly used unit is the _rad._
* 1 rad = 0.01 J/kg = 0.01 Gy
* **Relative Biological Effectiveness (RBE)**:
* The absorbed dose by itself is not an adequate measure of biological effect, because equal energies of different radiation may cause different extents of biological effect. This variation is described by a numerical factor called the **Relative Biological Effectiveness (RBE)*
* or the **quality factor (QF)*
* of each specific radiation.
* RBE is defined as the ratio of a dose of standard radiation to the dose of test radiation to produce the same biological effects. As such, RBE is a dimensionless quantity.
* The table below shows some approximate values of RBE for several types of radiation. These values are obtained from experimental observation. All these values depend on the kind of tissue in which the radiation is absorbed and on the energy of the radiation.
* & RBE
* X-rays, \(\gamma\)-rays, \(\beta\)-particles, muons & 1
* Protons, charged pions & 2
* Slow neutrons & 3 - 5
* Fast neutrons & 10
* \(\alpha\)-particles, nuclear fission products, heavy nuclei & 20
* **Biologically Equivalent Dose**:
* The biological effect is described by the quantity **biological equivalent dose**, or simply the **equivalent dose**. The equivalent dose \(H\) is defined as the product of the absorbed dose \(D\) of ionising radiation and a dimensionless factor \(Q\) (the quality factor):
* _H = D x Q_ The SI unit of equivalent dose for humans is the **sievert (Sv)**:
* 1 Sv = RBE x 1 Gy
* An alternative unit of equivalent dose for humans is the **roentgen equivalent man (rem)**:
* 1 rem = 0.01 Sv
* In summary: the **gray*
* is the unit for \(D\), the **absorbed dose**. 1 Gy = 1 joule/kilogram, a physical quantity. 1 Gy is the deposit of one joule of radiation energy per kilogram of matter or tissue. The **sievert*
* is the unit for \(H\), the **equivalent dose**. 1 Sv = 1 joule/kilogram, a biological effect. 1 sievert represents the equivalent biological effect of the deposit of one joule of radiation energy in a kilogram of human tissue. The ratio of equivalent dose to absorbed dose is denoted by \(Q\), where \(Q\) = \(H\) / \(D\).

**1. thorium nuclei (label this line T),**

**2. protactinium nuclei (label this line P).**

**(iii)**: Using Fig. 8.1 or otherwise, deduce the age of the sample of radioactive material when**

**(b)**: For many unstable parent nuclei, the daughter product is itself radioactive. This gives rise to a radioactive series, where there may be ten or more different radioactive daughter products.

The parent nucleus has a daughter nucleus and, in turn, this daughter produces a further daughter. Initially, there are 1.2 x 10\({}^{15}\) nuclei of the parent isotope in the sample and the daughter products are not present. The parent isotope has a half-life of 3.0 years, and the daughter product D has a half-life of 15 years, decaying to form the further daughter S, which is stable.

**(i)**: On Fig. 8.2, label with the letter S the line representing the variation of the number of nuclei of the stable further daughter S. Give an explanation for your choice. [1]
**(ii)**: 1. State the time after which the daughter product D has its maximum activity.

**(iii)**: Suggest why the number of nuclei of the daughter product D increases to a maximum and then decreases. [4]
**(iv)**: The relative activities of the parent isotope and the daughter products may be used as a means of determining the age of the sample. Suggest why this technique may provide reliable results for ages up to about 30 years, but for an age of about 100 year the method will be far less reliable. [2]

### 0.d8 N02/III/5 (parts) Carbon Dating

**(a)**: Explain why the random nature of radioactive decay makes it difficult to measure the values of the _half-life_ to a high degree of accuracy. [2]
**(b)**: Measurements are made of the activity of a specimen of carbon from pieces of wood found in a fireplace at an archaeological site. The specimen is found to contain one carbon-14 atom per 8.6 x 10\({}^{10}\) carbon-12 atoms. In similar carbon from a modern fire, the concentration of carbon-14 atoms is greater at one carbon-14 atom per 3.3 x 10\({}^{10}\) carbon-12 atoms. The difference between these two figures is due to the fact that carbon-14 is radioactive and some atoms have decayed over the years.

Calculate the age of the wood from the ancient fire. The half-life of carbon-14 is 1.8 x 10\({}^{11}\) s. Carbon-12 is stable. [6]
**(c)**: The technique of dating described in (b) is difficult to do accurately. This difficulty can be minimised by using all the carbon-14 atoms rather than just those which happen to undergo radioactive decay when the dating is being carried out. Carbon atoms from the wood can be ionised by removing one electron from each atom. They are then formed into a beam which is passed through a magnetic field as shown.

**(i)**: Explain why the paths of the two ion types are different.
**(ii)**: Explain why the three sections of each path followed by the ions are straight, circular, straight and why there is no change in the speed of an ion throughout.
**(iii)**: Suggest why this method of measuring the ratio of carbon-14 to carbon-12 atoms is more reliable. [6]

### D9 N03/ll/8. Data Analysis (continued from Tutorial 18A D4)

\begin{tabular}{c c c c}  & 67 hour & \(2\times 10^{5}\) year & \\ \({}^{99}_{42}\)Mo & \(\longrightarrow\) & \({}^{99}_{43}\)Tc & \(\longrightarrow\) & \({}^{99}_{44}\)Ru (stable solid) \\
16 second & 1.1 minute & 13 day & 40 hour \\ \({}^{140}_{54}\)Xe & \(\rightarrow\) & \({}^{140}_{55}\)Cs & \(\rightarrow\) & \({}^{140}_{56}\)Ba & \(\rightarrow\) & \({}^{140}_{57}\)Ca \\ \end{tabular} Consider equal amounts of these two fission products.

Suggest why there are very different problems for the storage for this nuclear waste. [3]

**(i)**: plutonium-239 (label this graph P),
**(ii)**: uranium-X (label this graph U).

Your graphs should cover the range from \(t\) = 0 to \(t\) = 5.0 x 10\({}^{4}\) years.

**(c)**: In the nuclear reaction in (a), 5.26 MeV of energy is released. The energy of the emitted \(\alpha\)-particle is 5.15 MeV. Suggest and explain why these two values are different.

### Challenging Question

**C1 N88/Il/12 (part)**

Radioactive iron, \({}^{59}\)Fe, is a radioactive nuclide with a half-life of 46 days. It is used medically in the diagnosis of blood disorders. Measurements are complicated by the fact that iron is excreted, i.e., removed from the blood, at a rate such that 69 days after administering a dose, half of the iron atoms in the dose have been excreted. That is to say, iron has a biological half-life of 69 days.

**(i)**: If the count rate from a blood sample is 690 counts per minute, what will it be from a similar blood sample taken 138 days later?
**(ii)**: How long after the first sample was taken would a similar sample give a count rate of 480 counts per minute?
**(iii)**: Derive the relationship between

\(T\), the effective half-life of the radioactive nuclide in the body,

_T_\({}_{b}\) the biological half-life, and

_T_\({}_{n}\), the radioactive half-life.
