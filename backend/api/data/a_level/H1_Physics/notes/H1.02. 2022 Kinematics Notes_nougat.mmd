#### Introduction

Today, we use electronic stopwatches, video recorders and other sophisticated instruments to analyse motion, but it has not always been so. Galileo, who in the early 1600s was the first scientist to study motion experimentally, used his pulse to measure time! Galileo made a useful distinction between the _cause_ of motion and the _description_ of motion. "Kinematics" is the modern term for the mathematical description of motion without regard to causes. The term comes from the Greek word _kinema_, meaning "movement". This chapter begins with visualising motion and developing the representations for describing the position, displacement, velocity and acceleration of moving objects in space as a function of time. We will begin our study of kinematics with motion in one dimension, followed by two dimensions.

#### Essential Questions

* How do we describe the motion of objects?
* How can the motion of objects be represented, quantified and predicted?
* How can we tell if an object is moving with a constant acceleration?
* How would an object experiencing constant acceleration in one direction and constant velocity in a perpendicular direction move?
* How would an object falling in a uniform gravitational field move?24 REGULINEAR MOTION

Rectilinear motion means motion in a straight line.

#### 2.1.1 Displacement vs Distance

**Displacement** is the straight-line distance of an object or a point, in a specified direction, from some reference point. The specified direction is directed from the reference point to that object's position or that point. Displacement is a _vector_ quantity.

**Example 1**

Consider a car moving to the left. The positions of the car at various instances in time \(t\) are represented as dots in a straight line. This straight line serves as a reference to a coordinate axis, just like the x-axis.

To make the discussion of _displacement_ meaningful,

A _reference point_ must be defined. For example,

If \(t=0\) s is taken as the reference point, then at time \(t=2\) s, the displacement _from_ that point is \(20\) m.

If \(t=1\) s is taken as the reference point, then at time \(t=2\) s, the displacement _from_ that point is \(10\) m.

Additionally, a _positive direction_ must be defined.

If the positive direction is defined to be leftwards and \(t=1\) s is taken as the reference point, then at time \(t=0\) s, the displacement _of the car from the reference point_ is -10 m.

The negative sign is a mathematical representation to say that it is in the opposite direction to the positive direction.

Note that **since displacement is a vector, both magnitude and direction are specified**.

Since distance is a scalar quantity while displacement is a vector quantity, the displacement of an object **may or may not** be equal in magnitude to the distance it travels.

**Distance** is the _total length of the actual path travelled by a moving object, irrespective of the direction of motion_. It is a _scalar_ quantity.

**Example 2**:

Suppose the car in Example 1 reversed direction after travelling 40 m and returned to its initial position at \(t=10\) s.

Motion diagram:

#### 2.1.2 Speed and Velocity

Definition:

**Speed** is the rate of change of distance with respect to time.

Speed is a _scalar_ quantity.

Sl unit: metre per second, m s-1

**In Example 2**,

The spacing between dots becomes smaller from \(t=3\) s to \(t=5\) s, indicating that the **change in** displacement **per unit time** decreases, hence speed decreases.

The spacing between dots becomes wider from \(t=5\) s to \(t=7\) s, indicating that the **change in** displacement **per unit time** increases, hence speed increases.

The lengths of the arrows in the motion diagram represents the speed. If the spacing is wider for adjacent dots, the higher the speed of the car.

From \(t=0\) s to \(t=3\) s, the lengths of the arrows are the same. In addition, they are also the same as the lengths of the arrow between \(t=7\) s to \(t=10\) s. Therefore, the speed of the car within these timings is the same. However, travelling to the left is different from travelling to the right, thus, a _vector representation_ of how fast the car is moving in a particular direction is required.

Definition:

**Velocity** is the rate of change in displacement with respect to time.

Velocity is a _vector_ quantity.

Magnitude of velocity equals speed.

Therefore, if the car in Example 2 is moving at 10 m s-1 between t = 0 s to t = 3 s, then, it is travelling at -10 m s-1 between t = 7 s to t = 10 s. [Note that positive direction was defined earlier as leftwards.]

**Example 3**

Car A is moving to the left at 10 m s-1 and car B is moving to the right at 10 m s-1.

Car A and car B are said to have the _same speed_ but _different velocity_ because the direction of their velocities are different.

Note:

Velocities of the two cars are represented by arrows.

The length of the arrows represent the magnitude. Since the two car are travelling at 10 m s-1, the magnitude of the velocity vectors are the same.

Directions of velocity: car A point towards the left and car B point towards the right.

**Example 4**

A bus travels 50 m due east and makes a U-turn back to travel a further distance of 30 m. The total time taken is 100 s. Determine its

(i) average speed

(ii) average velocity

(i) Ave speed = \(\frac{\text{total change in distance}}{\text{total time}}\) (ii) Ave vel = \(\frac{\text{change in displacement}}{\text{total time}}\)

= \(\frac{80}{100}\) = \(\frac{20}{100}\)

= 0.8 m s-1

= 0.2 m s-1 due east 

#### 2.1.3 Motion Diagram with Velocity Vectors

Before reference point to be the initial position, and, direction to the right as positive.

_Average speed_ of the car between \(t=1\) s and \(t=8\) s is (50 m / 7 s) = 7.1 m s\({}^{1}\).

_Average velocity_ of the car in the same time interval is determined as follows:

Displacement at 1 s, \(s_{1}=\) -10 m

Displacement at 8 s, \(s_{2}=\) -20 m

Change in displacement, \(\Delta s=s_{2}-s_{1}=\) (-20) - (-10) = -10 m (i.e. 10 m to the left)

Average velocity = -10 m / 7 s = -1.4 m s\({}^{1}\) (i.e. 1.4 m s\({}^{1}\) to the left)

_Average velocity_ of the car between \(t=0\) s and \(t=10\) s is 0 m s\({}^{1}\) as the change in displacement is 0.

_Instantaneous velocity_ of the car between \(t=0\) s and \(t=10\) s is varying in magnitude, and, direction could be to the left or right.

#### 2.1.4 Acceleration

Definition:

**Acceleration** is the rate of change of velocity with respect to time.

Acceleration is a _vector_ quantity.

Sl unit: metre per second per second, m s\({}^{2}\)

**Average acceleration** is defined as the _ratio_ of the _change in_ velocity to the time interval.

**Average acceleration**, _<a>_ = \(\frac{\text{change in velocity}}{\text{time taken}}=\frac{\Delta\nu}{\Delta t}\)

**Instantaneous acceleration** is the acceleration at a particular instant in time.

**Instantaneous acceleration**, \(a\) = \(\frac{d\nu}{dt}\)

where: \(\nu\) is the velocity

\(t\) is the time taken

In the motion diagram representation,

**Motion diagram with only velocity vectors drawn:**

**Use vector subtraction to determine \(\Delta\nu\): \(\Delta\nu=\nu_{2}-\nu_{1}\)**

\(\Delta\nu=\nu_{2}+\left(-\nu_{1}\right)\)

**Direction of \(\Delta\nu\) is also the direction of the average acceleration vector \(a\).

Return to the original motion diagram. Draw the acceleration vector as an arrow beside the dot and this completes the motion diagram:

#### Quiz

A cyclist riding at 7 m s-1 sees a stop sign and comes to a complete stop in 4 s. He then, in 6 s, returns to a speed of 5 m s-1. Which of the following shows his motion diagram?

\begin{tabular}{l c c c} \hline \hline \multicolumn{4}{l}{Solution:} \\ Answer is either & & based on the & directions of the acceleration and \\ velocity vectors.

#### Quiz

Let us define eastward as positive and westward as negative. Are the following statements _True or False?_

1. If a car is traveling eastward, its acceleration must be eastward.
2. If a car is slowing down, its acceleration may be positive.

Solution:

1. False. Velocity of car must be eastward but acceleration can be either eastward or westward. If acceleration is directed eastward, car is speeding up. If westward, car is slowing down.
2. True. A car slowing down indicates that its acceleration and velocity vectors have opposite directions. If the car is travelling westward and is slowing down, its acceleration must be directed eastward, that is, acceleration is positive.

#### Graphical Representation of motion

A _motion diagram_ tells us only the positions of an object at a few discrete instants of time, and only allows us to determine the average values of velocity.

A _graph_ would allow us to obtain the position of the object at all instants in time and the instantaneous values of velocity and acceleration.

**Example 6 (N04/1/3 modified)**

A train travelling at 2.0 m s\({}^{-1}\) passes through a station. The variation with time \(t\) of the speed \(v\) of the train after leaving the station is shown below.

Determine the speed of the train when it is 150 m from the station.

Solution:

Area per small square represents 20 m.

150 m is equivalent to 7.5 small squares.

By counting number of squares under the graph starting from t = 0 s, when the train is 150 m from the station,

t = 30 s, \(v\) = 8 m s\({}^{-1}\)

### (C) Acceleration - Time graph (\(a\)-t graph)

From the definition of acceleration, \(a=\frac{dv}{dt}\)

Integrating, \(\int a\,dt=\int dv=v_{f}-v_{i}=\Delta v\), _change in velocity_

Thus, _change in velocity_ is determined from the area under the acceleration-time graph.

The car speeds up from rest until

it reaches a steady cruising speed. This is a realistic graph for a car leaving a stop sign.

The gradient is not constant but becomes less and less positive. Thus, acceleration is not constant but becomes less and less positive in value.

This is the acceleration-time graph for the car

with positive and decreasing values of

_Average_ acceleration between \(t_{1}\) and \(t_{2}\)

## Chapter 2 Multi-task

A car is travelling along a straight road at a constant velocity initially for 1 minute. After that, the driver steps on the accelerator, causing the car's speed to increase uniformly for 30 s. It then travels at constant velocity again for another minute before the driver slows down uniformly for 30 s to a momentary stop and then makes a U-turn back with the same acceleration for 30 s. Sketch the displacement-time, velocity-time and acceleration-time graphs to illustrate the motion of the car.

#### 2.1.6 Mathematical Representation of motion (Kinematic Equations)

Using equations allows for description of relationship between variables more precisely and allows for manipulations that allows us to make calculations and predictions. Equations thus build more meaning on top of the graphical representations that have been discussed thus far.

##### 2.1.6.1 Derivation of Kinematic Equations for UNIFORMLY ACCELERATED MOTIONS in a STRABITH LINE

_** Knowledge of the following derivation is expected in the A-level syllabus._

Consider an object moving in a **straight line** with **uniform acceleration** _(a)_ from an initial velocity (\(u\)) to a certain velocity (\(v\)) in time (\(t\)). During this time interval, the object undergoes a change in displacement (\(s\)).

_Uniformly accelerated motion_Consider the velocity-time graph of an object moving with uniform acceleration. The \(v\)-\(t\) graph is a straight line with non-zero gradient equal to \(a\) and vertical-intercept equal to \(u\).

By definition of acceleration,

\(a=\frac{dv}{dt}=\)gradient of \(v\) - \(t\)graph = \(\frac{v\) - \(u}{t}\)

Rearranging, we obtain a linear equation for the velocity v at any time t:

This is the _1st equation of motion_.

Average velocity, <v>, is midway between u and v

\(\left\langle v\right\rangle=\frac{u+v}{2}\)

By definition of average velocity,

<v> = change in displacement / time taken

change in displacement = <v> x time

:.5 = <v> x t

\(s=\frac{\left(u+v\right)t}{2}\)

Alternatively, we arrive at the same result by considering

area under the \(v\)-\(t\) graph:

change in displacement = \(f\)v \(dt\)

= area under the \(v\)-\(t\) graph

\(s=\frac{t}{2}(u+v)\) \(t\)

Substituting (\(v=u+\alpha t\)) into this equation gives:

This is the _2nd equation of motion_.

Eliminate t from (\(v=u+\alpha t\)) and \(s=\frac{\left(u+v\right)}{2}t\) :

\(s=\frac{u+v}{2}\).v - \(u\)

= \(\frac{v^{2}-u^{2}}{2\alpha}\)

\(v^{2}=u^{2}+2\alpha s\)

This is the _3rd equation of motion_.

**Example 9**:

A car is speeding along a straight country road at a speed of 25 m s-1 when the driver sees a farm vehicle just starting to cross the road at a point 40 m ahead. The driver's reaction time (i.e. the time interval between seeing the obstacle and actually applying the brakes) is 0.80 s, and he decelerates with a constant maximum (brakes fully applied) acceleration of 5.5 m s-2. If the car can be assumed to decelerate uniformly at this rate without swerving, calculate

1. the distance travelled by the car during the driver's reaction time.
2. the car's velocity when it reaches the position of the farm vehicle.
3. the total time which has elapsed from first sighting until the car reaches the farm vehicle.
4. the minimum constant velocity of the farm vehicle so that the car does not collide with it, given the width of the road is 3.0 m and the length of the farm vehicle is 2.0 m.

**Question analysis:**

1. There are two stages of motion 1. Constant speed during the driver's reaction time 2. Constant deceleration after the driver applies the brake fully Therefore, the equation of motion have to be applied separately.
2. Clear label pictorial representation:

Solution:(i) distance travelled by car during First stage = 25 x 0.80 = 20 m (ii) Take direction to the left as positive. In the Second stage of the car: \(\text{s}=40-20=20\) m \(\text{u}=25\) m \(\text{s}^{-1}\) \(\text{a}=-5.5\) m \(\text{s}^{-2}\) To find: v at \(\text{s}=20\) m Use \(\text{v}^{2}=\text{u}^{2}+2\text{as}\) \(\text{v}^{2}=25^{2}+2(\text{-5.5})(20)\) \(\text{v}=20.1\) m \(\text{s}^{-1}\) (iii) To find: t in Second stage Use \(\text{v}=\text{u}+\text{at}\) \((20.1)=(25)+(\text{-5.5})\)t t = 0.891 s Total time = 0.891 + 0.80 = 1.69 s (iv) Maximum time allowed for farm vehicle to cross the road without being hit by car = 1.69 s To completely clear-off the road, farm vehicle must travel a distance of \((3.0+2.0)=5.0\) m Minimum constant speed of farm vehicle required = 5.0 / 1.69 = 2.96 m \(\text{s}^{-1}\) or \(3.0\) m \(\text{s}^{-1}\)

**Example 10**The spacecraft shown is travelling forward with a velocity of 3250 m s\({}^{\text{-1}}\). Suddenly the retrorockets are fired in opposite direction to the velocity, and the spacecraft begins to slow down with a constant acceleration whose magnitude is 10 m s\({}^{\text{-2}}\). What is the velocity of the spacecraft when the displacement of the craft is 215 km in the direction of initial velocity, relative to the point where the retrorockets began firing?

\begin{tabular}{l} Solution: \\ \end{tabular}

Since velocity is positive, and the object slows down, the acceleration is negative.

Use v\({}^{\text{2}}\) = u\({}^{\text{2}}\) + 2as

v\({}^{\text{2}}\) = 3250\({}^{\text{2}}\) + 2(-10)(215 000)

v = \(\pm\) 2500 m s\({}^{\text{-1}}\)

**Note:** There are 2 possible answers to a variable. Visualize the different physical situations to which the answers correspond. -2500 m s\({}^{\text{-1}}\) arises after the retro-rockets bring the craft to a momentary halt and the craft reverses in direction and moves back to the position where displacement is +215 km.

#### 2.1.6.3 Motion under gravity without air resistance

An object is said to be **free falling** if the _only force_ that acts on it is its own weight_. Air resistance is zero. The **acceleration of the free falling object is equal to \(g\)** = 9.81 m s\({}^{-2}\) downwards**. Since the **acceleration** of the object is **constant** in free fall, the equations of motion can be used.

"Free falling" does not necessarily mean an object is moving down. A free falling object is moving either upward or downward as long as it is solely under the influence of gravity alone. In other words, a free-falling object always experiences the same constant _downward acceleration_ due to gravity.

**Example 11**

A lunar landing module is descending at a steady velocity of 10 m s\({}^{-1}\) to the surface of the Moon. At an altitude of 120 m, a small object becomes detached from its landing gear. The gravitational acceleration of the Moon may be taken as 1.6 m s\({}^{-2}\).

What is the speed of the object when it strikes the Moon?

**Question analysis:**

1. **Identify the state of motion:** Note that there are two objects in the question. As the question wanted us to find the speed of the object, we focus on the motion of the object. The motion of the object is initially together with the lunar landing which is at a constant velocity. After which, it falls at an acceleration of 1.6 m s\({}^{-2}\).
3. Since the motion is entirely downwards, we set downwards as positive.
4. Quantity that we need to find is the speed of the object as it strikes the moon, that is the final speed of the motion. Therefore, we use \(\mathbf{v^{2}=u^{2}+2as}\) Solution: Let downwards be positive. 

**Example 12**

A ball is thrown vertically upwards with an initial velocity of 30 m s\({}^{1}\).

Find (i) the maximum height reached, (ii) the time taken for the ball to return to the ground.

**Question analysis:**

Though this looks like a two-part motion, it is actually just ONE motion with constant acceleration, i.e. 9.81 m s\({}^{2}\) downwards.

Solution:

Hence time taken for ball to return to the ground is 6.1 s.

#### 2.1.6.4 Falling motion under gravity with AIR Resistance

Consider a small spherical ball falling through a column of viscous oil in a long tube as shown in the schematic diagram of Fig. 2.1(a) of the set up as well as the motion diagram of the ball.

Likewise, when an object falls under gravity, it moves through air in the atmosphere. Its motion diagram is similar to the diagram that represent the falling sphere in the column of oil in Fig. 2.1 (b). The motion diagram and the displacement-time (\(s\)-\(t\)) graph are translated to describe the velocity-time graph of the object,

Figure 2.1: (a)* Gradient of the s-t graph is always negative and increasing. Therefore, the velocity of the object is getting larger in the negative direction to a maximum value.
* Gradient of the v-t gradient at each point on the curve represents the object's acceleration, the velocity of the object increases downward with decreasing acceleration.
* Since the gradient of the v-t graph is the steepest at \(t=0\), the acceleration of the object is the greatest when the object is just released.
* When the time taken and distance fell for the object are long enough, the gradient of the v-t graph decreases to zero, indicating that the acceleration of the object reaches zero.
* terminal velocity
- for the rest of the falling motion.

### Explanation of falling motion under gravity with air resistance.

An explanation of a motion is only complete with the application of Newton's law of motion.

When an object moves through a fluid (e.g. gas, liquid, molten substances etc.), it experiences a resistive force in opposition to its motion. This resistive force, also known as the **drag force or viscous drag**.

Consider a body that is dropped from rest in air. Its initial velocity is zero, hence the drag force \(F_{0}\) is also zero initially. The body has an acceleration a = g initially.

The direction of drag force is _always opposite to the direction of velocity of the object and its magnitude increases with the speed of the object.

As the body moves downwards, the drag force acting upwards (opposite to velocity) on it increases with its speed. If mg is larger than \(F_{0}\), then there is a resultant downward force and hence a downward acceleration. The resultant downward force gradually decreases as \(F_{0}\) increases. Thus the body speeds up at a decreasing rate.

\[\begin{array}{c}\text{mg}-F_{0}=\text{ma}\\ \text{a}=\left(\text{mg}-F_{0}\right)/\text{m}\end{array}\]

Eventually, the drag force reaches a magnitude equal to the weight of the body. Since drag force always acts opposite to the body's weight, the resultant force on the body becomes zero. Hence, acceleration of the body becomes zero. As a result, the velocity of the body reaches a maximum and constant magnitude, called the **terminal velocity** vr.

\[\begin{array}{c}\text{mg}-F_{0}=\text{ma}\\ \text{mg}-F_{0}=0\end{array}\qquad\text{(since mg}=F_{0}\text{, a}=0)\]

This is a motion with **non-uniform acceleration**. The acceleration starts with value g, but acceleration decreases to zero at the time when terminal velocity is achieved.

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:31]

**Example 13a**

A stone is thrown _upwards_ from a tall building with an initial velocity of 10 m s\({}^{-1}\). It then falls towards the ground. Sketch the v-t graph when air resistance is significant and taking upwards as positive.

When the stone moves upwards and then changes its direction downwards, there must be an instant where the stone's velocity is zero at the very top of its motion. As such, when the stone's velocity is zero, it is a context of a stone falling from rest and the graphs that represent such a motion have been discussed earlier.

1. As the stone moves upwards with initial speed of 10 m s\({}^{-1}\), it slows down with decreasing magnitude of acceleration until it comes to instantaneous rest (0 m s\({}^{-1}\)) at some time \(t=t^{\prime}\).
2. After \(t=t^{\prime}\), the stone continues to fall, and its speed increases with decreasing magnitude of acceleration. The graph is similar to Fig. 2.1b.
3. Since the context of the question is a _tall_ building, it suggests that the stone falls a distance long enough for it to reach terminal velocity. The terminal velocity is graphically represented as a horizontal straight line. Acceleration equals 0 m s\({}^{-2}\) when terminal velocity is reached.
4. The stone's acceleration is the maximum in magnitude at the start, decreases to the acceleration of free fall at t = t\({}^{\prime}\) where v = 0 m s\({}^{-1}\), and continues to decrease to a = 0 m s\({}^{-2}\) when the stone reaches terminal velocity.

Note:

_Why is the stone's speed decreasing with decreasing magnitude of acceleration from t = 0 to t = t\({}^{\prime}\) but increasing with decreasing acceleration from t = t\({}^{\prime}\) onwards?_

Newton's laws provide an explanation of motion through the concept of net force.

_While moving upwards from (t = 0 to t = t):_

While the stone is moving upwards, drag force acts downwards in the same direction as its weight, thus, the net force is larger than the weight. By Newton's 2\({}^{nd}\) law, the magnitude of acceleration is greater than g. Hence the gradient of the v-t graph is steeper than the value of g before v = 0. Since acceleration is opposite direction to the velocity, the stone slows down.

As the stone's speed decreases, the magnitude of _When stone is at the highest point at t = t':_

Eventually, when v = 0, the stone's speed from 0 m s-t. Bin. Only force acting on stone is its weight. Drag force equals 0. Hence, acceleration (as seen from the gradient of the v-t graph) at that point equals to g.

_After the maximum height beyond t = t':_

Stone's weight increases the stone's speed from 0 m s-t. Bin. Only force acting on stone is its weight. Drag force equals 0. Hence, acceleration (as seen from the gradient of the v-t graph) at that point equals to g.

_is lesser than the stone's weight, the acceleration is lesser than g. As the stone's speed is increasing, drag force is increasing and the acceleration continues to decrease. Eventually, when drag force (which is acting opposite direction to the weight) equals to the magnitude of the weight, stone's acceleration ceases, and thus the stone continues moving downwards with constant maximum speed (i.e. terminal velocity reached)._

_Example 13b_

If the stone in example 13a is falling through the same height in a vacuum with the same initial upward velocity, sketch the v-t graph when air resistance is negligible. Take upwards as positive.

When the ball falls in vacuum, its acceleration is constant and equals to the acceleration of free fall g. Therefore, the v-t graph for it is a straight line that is tangent to the given graph for motion in air at v = 0. This is because when in air and v = 0, air resistance equals zero. Hence the net force equals ball's weight and thus acceleration at that instant equals to g as well.

**(b)**

The gradient of the ball's velocity-time graph represents the ball's acceleration.

Drawing the tangent to the point at \(t\) = 0.20 s,

Gradient = \(\frac{3.7-0.5}{0.74-0.02}=4.44\)

Therefore, the acceleration is 4.44 m s\({}^{2}\).

**(c)(i)**

The free-body diagram below shows the forces acting on the ball as it falls. The maximum resistive force occurs when the speed of the ball is maximum at the constant speed of 2.4 m s\({}^{-1}\). At this instant, the acceleration of the ball is 0 m s\({}^{-2}\), which means that the upward resistive force is numerically equal to the ball's weight. Therefore,

Maximum resistive force = \(mg=0.015\times 9.81=0.15\) N

mg

mg

From (b), at t = 0.20 s, a = 4.44 m s\({}^{-2}\)

Using \(F_{\mathrm{net}}\) = ma

mg - \(F_{0}\) = ma

F0 = m (g - a)

= (15 x 10\({}^{-3}\))(9.81 - 4.44)

= 0.081 N

which is approximately equal to 0.083 N.

Note: As graph reading and drawing of tangent line is subjective. As long as the application of physics principle is sound, full credit will be awarded.

#### 2.2.1 Projectile Motion

When an object moves in both the x- and y-directions simultaneously under a constant acceleration, the object moves in a two-dimensional path that is parabolic in shape.

Consider a ball that is kicked at an angle above the ground. The motion picture of the ball is shown in Fig 2.2, where instantaneous pictures of the ball is taken at regular time intervals.

Consider the forces acting on the ball that was kicked. For the above motion, air resistance is negligible and so the only force acting on the ball during its flight is its own weight.

By Newton's Second Law, since the resultant force on the ball is its weight (mg) downwards, its acceleration is constant and equal to the acceleration due to gravity g directed downwards.

**By definition, a _projectile_ is any object upon which the only force is gravity, i.e. air resistance is considered negligible. An object dropped from rest, OR thrown vertically upward, OR thrown horizontally or upward/downward at an angle to the horizontal, are all called projectiles (provided air resistance is negligible). The trajectory (path travelled) by a projectile is either linear or parabolic in shape.

Figure 2.3: Free Body Diagram of the ball

Figure 2.2: Motion diagram showing a parabolic path moved by the ballIn general, for an object to move in a parabolic path, it fulfils the following two conditions:

1. the acceleration remains constant (in both magnitude and direction) throughout the motion; and
2. the INITIAL velocity is not parallel (nor anti-parallel) to the acceleration.

##### Displacement, Velocity and Acceleration vectors in 2-D projectile motion

The trajectory can be analysed at 5 separate points of the path: A, B, C, D and E, where A is the point _just after_ the ball is kicked and point E is _just before_ the ball touches the ground again as shown in Fig. 2.4.

##### Setting up the stage

Set the positive x-direction to be horizontal and to the right, and the y-direction to be vertical and positive upward.

Resolve the motion into two perpendicular directions: _horizontal and vertical motions, which are independent of each other._ This means that motion in one direction has no effect on motion in the other direction.

Figure 2.4: The trajectory in 5 different points as in A, B, C, D and E

Figure 2.5a and 2.5b represents the horizontal movement of the ball. As shown in Fig. 2.3, the only acceleration on the ball is the acceleration due to gravity which acts in the vertical direction. Therefore, the horizontal velocity of the ball is unchanged (both in magnitude and in direction). As a result, from the point of view as in Fig. 2.5a, the ball seems to be moving in a horizontal straight line with a _constant velocity_. This will therefore give rise to the motion diagram as shown in Fig. 2.5b.

If the ball is tossed in a parabolic path, as in Fig. 2.2, from the point of view in Fig. 2.6, the motion in the \(\nu\)-direction will look like a ball tossed vertically upward under the influence of gravity (vertical motion with _constant acceleration_). This is depicted in Fig. 2.6a and Fig. 2.6b for the upward and downward flights.

In addition, in the absence of air resistance, the paths for the upward and downward flights are symmetrical. The vertical velocity vectors will decrease in length on the upward flight, whereas the velocity vectors increases in length on the downward flight. This is expected as the acceleration vector due to gravity is constant and directed downwards throughout the downward and upward flights.

### Quiz

For the scenario of a ball being projected in a parabolic path from point A, draw vectors to represent the displacement, velocity and acceleration at positions A, B, C, D and E.

Figure 2.6a: Motion diagram for the vertical upward path

#### 2.2.1.2 Mathematical Representation of the displacement, velocity and acceleration of a projectile

Following the pictorial representation in the above sections, we now delve deeper, analysing the projectile motion using the mathematical representation.

Fig 2.7 depicts the path of a projectile together with the velocity vectors along the trajectory.

Consider a projectile, launched at point A at an angle \(\theta\)to the horizontal with a velocity of \(u\). Resolving velocity \(u\) into a horizontal x-component and vertical y-component gives:

\[u_{x}{}^{x}=u\;cos\;\theta\qquad\text{and}\qquad u_{y}{}^{x}=u\;sin\;\theta\]

When drawing the velocity vectors:

1. Subscript "x" denotes the horizontal component and subscript "y" denotes the vertical component.
2. The y-component of the velocity \(v_{y}\) changes in magnitude with time, caused by the acceleration due to gravity directed vertically downwards.
3. The x-component of the velocity \(v_{x}\) remains constant and equal to its initial velocity \(u_{x}\).
4. \(v_{y}\) equals to zero at the peak of the trajectory.

**Instantaneous velocity \(\nu\)** is **tangential** to the parabolic path and it is the **vector sum** of its components. At any instant,

**Magnitude of \(\nu\)** is given by: \(\nu=\sqrt{{v_{x}}^{2}+{v_{y}}^{2}}\)

**Direction of \(\nu\)** can be given by: \(\theta=tan^{-1}\left(\dfrac{v_{y}}{v_{x}}\right)\), measured from the horizontal vector.

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:42]

**Problem-Solving Strategy for Projectile Motion**

1. **Select** a coordinate system and **sketch** the path of the projectile, including initial and final positions, velocities, and accelerations.
2. **Resolve** the initial velocity vector into \(x\)- and \(y\)-components.
3. **Treat** the horizontal motion and the vertical motion independently.
4. **Follow** the techniques for solving problems with constant velocity to analyse the horizontal motion of the projectile.
5. **Follow** the techniques for solving problems with constant acceleration to analyse the vertical motion of the projectile.

**Example 19**

A long jumper leaves the ground at an angle of \(20.0^{\circ}\) to the horizontal and at a speed of \(11.0\) m s\({}^{\text{-1}}\).

1. How long does it take for him to reach maximum height?
2. What is the maximum height?
3. How far does he jump? (Assume his motion is equivalent to that of a particle, disregarding the motion of his arms and legs.)

Solution:

**[Thought processes]**

_We take the projectile equations, fill in the known quantities, and solve for the unknowns._

_At the maximum height, the velocity in the \(y\)-direction is zero, so setting "\(\nu_{y}=u\ sin\ \theta-gt\)" equal to zero and solving gives the time it takes the jumper to reach his maximum height. By symmetry, his trajectory starts and ends at the same height, doubling this time gives the total time of the jump._

Part Strategy Solution

1. Find the time \(t_{\text{max}}\) taken to reach maximum height. Set \(\nu_{y}=u\ sin\ \theta-gt=0\)

0 in "\(\nu_{y}=u\ sin\ \theta-gt\)" and solve for \(t_{\text{max}}\):

2. Substitute the time \(t_{max}\) into "\(S_{y}=(u\ sin\ \theta)t-\frac{1}{2}gt^{2}\)":

3. First find the time for the jump, \(t=2t_{max}\)

Substitute this result into the \(s_{x}=(u\ cos\ \theta)(2t_{max})\)

=(11 cos 20.0)(2\(\times\)0.384)

displacement: \(s_{y}=(u\ sin\ \theta)t_{max}\cdot\frac{1}{2}gt_{max}^{2}\)

=(11 sin 20.0)(0.384)

=0.722 m

#### 2.2.1.3 Other scenarios for Projectile Motion

In the previous sections the trajectory of a ball kicked from a level ground is analysed and one of the many different scenarios that can use the kinematics equations is discussed. Further scenarios are discussed in this subsection.

##### Alternate Scenario 1: Object initially projected horizontally

A body is projected horizontally from an elevated platform.

##### Example 20

An Alaskan rescue plane drops a package of emergency rations to stranded hikers, as shown in the figure. The plane is travelling horizontally at 40.0 m s\({}^{-1}\) at a height of 100 m above the ground.

##### Neglect air resistance.

(a) Where does the package strike the ground relative to the point at which it was released?

(b) What are the horizontal and vertical components of the velocity of the package just before it hits the ground?

(c) What is the angle of the impact?

##### Solution:

**[Thought processes]**

_Here, we're just taking kinematics equations, filling in known quantities, and solving for the remaining unknown quantities._

_In part (a), set the \(\gamma\)-component of the displacement equations equal to -100 m -- we take the \(s_{\gamma}\) to be 0 at the point of release and the ground level where the package lands -- and solve for the time it takes the package to reach the ground. Substitute this time into the displacement equation for the x-component to find the range. "Range" usually refers to the maximum horizontal displacement travelled by the object in projectile motion._

_In part (b), substitute the time found in part (a) into the velocity components. Notice that the initial velocity has only an x-component, which simplifies the math. Solving part (c) requires the inverse tangent function._

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:45]

### Alternate Scenario 2: Object initially projected at an angle on an elevated platform

When an object is projected at a angle on an elevated platform, there is a possibility to have the object finally land at a negative displacement, as shown in the following example.

#### Example 21

A ball is thrown upward from the top of a building at an angle of 30.0\({}^{\circ}\) above the horizontal and with an initial speed of 20.0 m s\({}^{\text{-1}}\), as shown in the figure.

The point of release is 45.0 m above the ground.

(a) How long does it take for the ball to hit the ground?

(b) Find the ball's speed at impact.

(c) Find the horizontal range of the ball. Neglect air resistance.

Solution:

**[Thought processes]**

_Choose the axes as in the figure, with the origin at the point of release._

_For **(a)**: fill in the constants of the kinematics equations for the y-displacement and set the displacement equal to -45.0 m, the y - displacement when the ball hits the ground._

_Using the quadratic formula, solve for the time. To solve part **(b)**, substitute the time from part **(a)** into the components of the velocity, and substitute the same time into the equation for the x-displacement to solve part **(c)**._

\begin{tabular}{l l l} Part & Strategy & Solution \\ (a) & Find the \(y\)-displacement, taking & \(s_{y}=\) -45.0 m. \\ \multicolumn{3}{l}{Reorganize the equation into standard form to find the positive root of the time:} \\ \multicolumn{3}{l}{(b)} & The speed is essentially the magnitude of the instantaneous velocity at that point. \\ \multicolumn{3}{l}{Substitute the value of \(t\) found in part (a) into "\(v_{y}=u_{y}+a_{y}t\)" to find the \(y\)-component of the velocity at impact:} \\ \multicolumn{3}{l}{Use this value of \(v_{y}\), and the Pythagorean theorem "\(v=\sqrt{{v_{x}}^{2}+{v_{y}}^{2}}\)", and the fact that \(v_{x}\) = \(u_{x}\) to find the speed of the ball at impact:} \\ \multicolumn{3}{l}{(c)} & Substitute the time of flight into the range equation: \\ \multicolumn{3}{l}{(d)} & \(s_{x}=u_{x}t\) \\ \multicolumn{3}{l}{(e)} & \(=(20.0\cos 30.0)(4.22)\) \\ \multicolumn{3}{l}{(f)} & \(=73.1\) m \\ \multicolumn{3}{l}{(Note to calculate range, the time used should be the total flight time of the projectile.)} \\ \end{tabular}

## Appendix A Appendix

### Acceleration-time graph for an object moving under gravity WITH air resistance

Notice that the a-t graph is a curve not a straight line, why is this so?

* Taking downwards as positive: From Newton's 2nd law: \(\text{mg}-\text{kv}=\text{ma}\) (1)
* Differentiate equation (1) with respect to time t -k(dv/dt) = m(da/dt) [dv/dt = a] -ka = m(da/dt) da/dt = -ka/m
* Note that da/dt represents the gradient of the a-t graph. The negative sign indicates that the graph is downward sloping.
* As t increases with time, a decreases from g to 0.
* Hence the value of gradient da/dt decreases with time, and ultimately gradient = 0 when terminal velocity is reached.

Hence a-t graph is a curve whose gradient is negative and decreases with time.
