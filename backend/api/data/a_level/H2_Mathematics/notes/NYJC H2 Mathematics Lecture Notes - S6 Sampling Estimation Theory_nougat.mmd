## Chapter 6 Sampling and Estimation Theory

**Objectives:**

At the end of this chapter, students should be able to:

(a) understand the concepts of population, random and non-random samples;

(b) understand the concept of sample mean \(\overline{X}\) as a random variable with \(\operatorname{E}\!\left(\overline{X}\right)\!=\mu\) and

\[\operatorname{Var}\!\left(\overline{X}\right)\!=\!\frac{\sigma^{2}}{n}\]

(c) understand that the sample mean (denoted by \(\overline{X}\)) is a random variable which follows a normal distribution if the population of \(X\) follows a normal distribution;

(f) solve real-life problems involving the sampling distribution.

### 6.1 Introduction

Statistics can be broadly classified into two major categories: descriptive statistics and inferential statistics.

**Descriptive statistics** uses the data to provide descriptions of the population, through either numerical calculations or graphs or tables. Typically, there are two general types of statistic that are used to describe data: measures of central tendency (e.g. mean) and measures of spread (e.g. variance).

**Inferential statistics** makes inferences and predictions about a population based on a sample of data taken from the population in question.

In the 2015 Singapore General Election, The Election Department of Singapore

decided to made public, the results of sample count, after some trials.

What is sample count?

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXniISMvghA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXniISMvghA)

One reason for this move is to prevent unnecessary speculation and reliance on unofficial sources of information before all the votes are tallied and the final results are announced. Sample counts proved accurate in the 2015 general election, with actual results coming well within the error margin around what was predicted, especially for larger wards.

In this chapter, we will discuss what is meant by random (or probabilistic) and non-random (non-probabilistic) sampling.

### Some Terminologies

A _population_ is the entire set of items/group of individuals under consideration. The population size can be small, large or infinite.

A _sample_ is a subset of the population that is available for analysis. The purpose of sampling is to obtain a _representative_ sample of a population and use it to make an inference about the population. For example, to determine the mean lifetime of a batch of batteries, the manufacturer tests only a sample of batteries rather than the entire batch.

The _sample size_ is the number of observations obtained for the sample.

A _sampling unit_ is that element or set of elements considered for selection in some stage of sampling.

A _sampling frame_ is a complete list of all the sampling units of the population. The sampling frame provides a base for the selection of the sample.

As an illustration,

To make valid inferences about the population under study, it is important that we obtain a **representative** sample which reflects the population characteristics. Acquiring a representative sample requires the use of random sampling techniques that avoid bias in the sample. **Biasedness** occurs when some members of the population are more likely to be selected than other members of the population, causing some group(s) to be over represented. **Random sampling** ensures that every member of a population has an equal chance of being selected and that the sample obtained is not biased.

**Chapter S6 Sampling and Estimation Theory**

**Example 1:**

The NYJC Math Department wants to find out the average battery life of a particular graphing calculator model, and needs to acquire a sample from approximately 700 students. Assume that every student owns the same model of a graphing calculator. Consider the following sampling methods, how can a random sample be formed?

1. The department randomly picks 2 students from each Supplementary Programme class.
2. The department randomly picks a student from each Lecture Theatre group. You may assume that the population is evenly distributed into all three LTs.
3. A Google Form is set up and publicized on the Math noticeableard, accepting the first 50 responses.
4. All math tutors randomly pick a student from each class.

**Example 2:**

A company sells a certain brand of baby milk powder and wishes to randomly reward 5 customers with free milk vouchers through a lucky draw. Suppose that 2000 customers qualify for the draw. Explain (with appropriate calculations) if there will be equal probability of a particular customer being the first to be selected or the third to be selected for the free milk vouchers.

**Solution:**

(i)

P(a particular customer is the first to be selected to win the prize) =

P(a particular customer is the third to be selected to win the prize) =

Hence, there will be equal probability of a particular customer being the first to be selected or the third to be selected for the free milk vouchers.

### Introduction to Estimation Theory

Suppose we want to obtain the mean yearly income of all working Singaporeans in the 21-60 age group. A direct way is to get all the Singaporeans in this age group to report their yearly income and then calculate the (actual) mean yearly income. However, this method is infeasible as one has to deal with a large amount of data and some may not be easily obtainable (especially Singaporeans who work overseas). An alternative is to estimate the mean yearly income using a sample. From this sample, one can easily compute the mean yearly income which should turn out to be a reasonably good estimation of the actual mean we are interested to find out. This leads us to the next discussion on _Estimation Theory_.

#### 6.3.1 Population Parameters and the Sample Statistic

A **population parameter** is a value that describes a population. The population mean, denoted by \(\mu\) and the population variance, denoted by \(\sigma^{2}\) are two common examples of a population parameter. A **sample statistic** is a random variable that describes a sample. The sample statistic is used to estimate the population parameter when the parameter is unknown.

The sample mean, denoted by \(\bar{X}\) and the sample variance are two examples of a sample statistic.

**Note on notation:**\(\bar{X}\) (uppercase) is a random variable used to denote the sample mean and \(\bar{x}\) (lowercase) denotes the value of \(\bar{X}\) based on the sample chosen.

#### 6.3.2 Sample Mean and Variance

For a given sample of \(n\) observations \(x_{1}\), \(x_{2}\),..., \(x_{n}\), (i.e. sample size is \(n\))

\((1)\) the **sample mean**, \(\overline{x}\), is given by

\(\overline{x}=\dfrac{\sum x}{n}\),

\(\text{or}\ \overline{x}=\dfrac{\sum\big{(}x-a\big{)}}{n}+a\),

where \(a\) is a constant (called the **assumed mean**)

\((2)\) the **sample variance**,

\(\text{Sample variance}=\dfrac{\sum x^{2}}{n}-\overline{x}^{2}\),

\(\text{equivalently, sample variance}=\dfrac{1}{n}\Bigg{[}\sum x^{2}-\dfrac{ \big{(}\sum x\big{)}^{2}}{n}\Bigg{]}\),

or \(\text{sample variance}=\dfrac{1}{n}\sum(x-\overline{x})^{2}\).

#### 6.3.3 Unbiased Estimators of the Population Mean and Variance

Let \(T\) be a sample statistic derived from a sample used to estimate a population parameter \(\theta\). We say that \(T\) is an **unbiased estimator** of \(\theta\) if \(\text{E}\big{(}T\big{)}=\theta\), i.e. the mean of the distribution of the statistic \(T\) is equal to the parameter \(\theta\).

For example, \(\overline{X}\) is an unbiased estimator of \(\mu\) since \(\text{E}\big{(}\overline{X}\big{)}=\mu\), i.e. the sample mean is an unbiased estimator of the population mean (refer to Annex for the proof). Note that the sample variance, however, is not an unbiased estimator of the population variance. This is because the sample variance underestimates the population variance and an adjustment is needed to give an unbiased estimate of the population variance. The proof is beyond the scope of the syllabus and we will just apply the formula when it is appropriate for all questions.

Let's consider a random sample of size \(n\) be taken from a population.

1. The ungrouped data \(x_{1}\), \(x_{2}\), \(x_{3}\),..., \(x_{n}\) is usually presented in summarized form: \(\sum x\), \(\sum x^{2}\) or \(\sum\big{(}x-\overline{x}\big{)}^{2}\).

I. The **unbiased estimate of the population mean**\(\mu\) is the sample mean given by

\(\overline{x}=\dfrac{\sum x}{n}\).

**Chapter S6 Sampling and Estimation Theory** 5

\begin{tabular}{c c} \hline \(\Pi\). & The **unbiased estimate of the population variance**\(\sigma^{2}\), denoted by \(s^{2}\), is given by \\ \hline \(s^{2}=\frac{n}{n-1}\times\)sample variance, \\ equivalently & \(s^{2}\)=\(\frac{n}{n-1}\Bigg{[}\frac{\sum x^{2}}{n}-\overline{x}^{2}\Bigg{]}\), \\ or & \(s^{2}=\frac{1}{n-1}\Bigg{[}\sum x^{2}-\frac{\left(\sum x\right)^{2}}{n}\Bigg{]}\) (in List MF 26) \\ or & \(s^{2}=\frac{n}{n-1}\frac{\sum(x-\overline{x})^{2}}{n}\) (in List MF 26) \\ \hline \end{tabular}
2. Often, the summary data may be given in the form \(\sum\left(x-a\right)\) and \(\sum\left(x-a\right)^{2}\) where \(a\) is the assumed mean. In this case, 

**Remark:** We can remember the formula for \(s^{2}\) by "replacing" \(x\) by \(x-a\).

**Example 4:**

Find the unbiased estimates of the population mean and variance for the following:

(a) \(n=8\), \(\sum x=152.98\), \(\sum x^{2}=2927.1\)

(b) \(n=50\), \(\sum x=4537\), \(\sum\left(x-\overline{x}\right)^{2}=4825.62\)

(c) \(n=50\), \(\sum\left(x-20\right)=30\), \(\sum x^{2}=21300\)

(d) \(n=12\), \(\sum\left(x-10\right)=23.5\), \(\sum\left(x-10\right)^{2}=48.72\)

(e) The observed values are \(17\)\(5\)\(3\)\(10\)\(4\)\(3\)\(10\)\(5\)\(2\)\(14\)

### Distribution of the Sample Mean \(\bar{X}\)

In the previous section, we discussed the use of just one sample to estimate the population mean and variance. In reality, if we repeat the sampling process several times on the same population, we are able to obtain many samples of the same size but with different sample means. Hence, it will be interesting to study the distribution of the sample mean which is denoted by \(\bar{X}\).

To find the distribution of the sample mean of a discrete random variable, we perform the following:

* Take a random sample of \(n\) independent observations (i.e. sample size \(n\)) from a population.
* Calculate the mean of these \(n\) sample values.
* Repeat the above 2 steps until we have taken all possible samples of size \(n\) and calculated the sample mean of each one.
* Form a distribution of all the sample means we have thus obtained.

The distribution thus formed is called the **(probability) distribution of the sample mean**.

To illustrate this process, let us consider a random variable \(X\) with the following distribution:

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|} \hline \(X\) & \(1\) & \(2\) & \(3\) \\ \hline \(\mathrm{P}(X=x)\) & \(\dfrac{1}{6}\) & \(\dfrac{1}{3}\) & \(\dfrac{1}{2}\) \\ \hline \end{tabular} We shall demonstrate how to obtain the distribution of \(\bar{X}=\dfrac{X_{1}+X_{2}+X_{3}}{3}\).

We have to consider all possible samples of 3 observations. The values of the 3 observations in each sample and the corresponding sample mean are tabulated as shown.

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|} \hline Sample Observation & \(\bar{X}\) & Sample Observation & \(\bar{X}\) \\ \hline \((1,1,1)\) & 1 & \(\dfrac{4}{3}\) & \(\dfrac{5}{3}\) \\ \hline \((1,1,2)\) & \(\dfrac{4}{3}\) & \((2,1,2)\) & \(\dfrac{5}{3}\) & \((3,1,2)\) & \(2\) \\ \hline \((1,1,3)\) & \(\dfrac{5}{3}\) & \((2,1,3)\) & \(2\) & \((3,1,3)\) & \(\dfrac{7}{3}\) \\ \hline \((1,2,1)\) & \(\dfrac{4}{3}\) & \((2,2,1)\) & \(\dfrac{5}{3}\) & \((3,2,1)\) & \(2\) \\ \hline \((1,2,2)\) & \(\dfrac{5}{3}\) & \((2,2,2)\) & \(2\) & \((3,2,2)\) & \(\dfrac{7}{3}\) \\ \hline \((1,2,3)\) & \(2\) & \((2,2,3)\) & \(\dfrac{7}{3}\) & \((3,2,3)\) & \(\dfrac{8}{3}\) \\ \hline \((1,3,1)\) & \(\dfrac{5}{3}\) & \((2,3,1)\) & \(2\) & \((3,3,1)\) & \(\dfrac{7}{3}\) \\ \hline \((1,3,2)\) & \(2\) & \((2,3,2)\) & \(\dfrac{7}{3}\) & \((3,3,2)\) & \(\dfrac{8}{3}\) \\ \hline \((1,3,3)\) & \(\dfrac{7}{3}\) & \((2,3,3)\) & \(\dfrac{8}{3}\) & \((3,3,3)\) & \(3\) \\ \hline \end{tabular} Next we need to calculate the probability corresponding to each value taken by \(\bar{X}\).

For example, the sample mean \(\bar{x}=\dfrac{5}{3}\) is obtained from samples \((1,1,3)\), \((1,2,2)\), \((1,3,1)\), \((2,1,2)\), \((2,2,1)\), \((3,1,1)\).

**Chapter 56 Sampling and Estimation Theory**

#### 6.4.1 Distribution of the Sample Mean taken from a Normal Distribution

If \(X\) is taken from a normal distribution, then \(\overline{X}\) is also normally distributed, i.e.

if \(X\sim\text{N}(\mu,\sigma^{2})\), then \(\overline{X}\sim\text{N}\Bigg{(}\mu,\frac{\sigma^{2}}{n}\Bigg{)}\), where \(\overline{X}=\frac{X_{1}+X_{2}+\cdots+X_{n}}{n}\).

**Remarks:**

1. \(X_{i}\sim\text{N}(\mu,\sigma^{2})\), where \(i=1\), \(2\), \(3\), \(\ldots\), \(n\), is the \(i\)-th observation of \(X\). We say that the \(X_{i}\)'s are **independent and identically distributed (l.l.d.)**.
2. \(\overline{X}\) is said to be the mean (average) of \(n\)**independent observations** of \(X\). This result says that if \(X_{1},X_{2},\)\(\ldots,X_{n}\) is a random sample of size \(n\) taken from a _Normal distribution_ with known mean \(\mu\) and variance \(\sigma^{2}\), then the sample mean \(\overline{X}\) will also follow a _Normal distribution_ given by \(\overline{X}\sim\text{N}\Bigg{(}\mu,\frac{\sigma^{2}}{n}\Bigg{)}\).

**Proof:**

Let \(X_{i}\sim\text{N}(\mu,\sigma^{2})\), where \(i=1,2,\)\(\ldots\)\(\ldots\), \(n\). Then,

\[\text{E}(\overline{X}) =\text{E}\Bigg{(}\frac{X_{1}+X_{2}+\cdots+X_{n}}{n}\Bigg{)}\] \[=\frac{1}{n}\text{E}(X_{1}+X_{2}+\cdots+X_{n})\] \[=\frac{1}{n}\Big{[}\text{E}\big{(}X_{1}\big{)}+\text{E}\big{(}X_ {2}\big{)}+\cdots+\text{E}\big{(}X_{n}\big{)}\Big{]}\] \[=\frac{1}{n}\big{(}\mu+\mu+\ldots+\mu\big{)}\qquad\quad\text{( since $X_{i}$'s are identically distributed)}\] \[=\frac{1}{n}(n\mu)=\mu\]

\[\text{Var}(\overline{X}) =\text{Var}\Bigg{(}\frac{X_{1}+X_{2}+\cdots+X_{n}}{n}\Bigg{)}\] \[=\frac{1}{n^{2}}\text{Var}\big{(}X_{1}+X_{2}+\cdots+X_{n}\big{)}\] \[=\frac{1}{n^{2}}\big{[}\text{Var}\big{(}X_{1}\big{)}+\text{Var} \big{(}X_{2}\big{)}+\cdots+\text{Var}\big{(}X_{n}\big{)}\Big{]}\] \[=\frac{1}{n^{2}}\big{[}\sigma^{2}+\sigma^{2}+\ldots+\sigma^{2} \big{]}\quad\text{(since $X_{i}$'s are identically distributed)}\] \[=\frac{1}{n^{2}}(n\sigma^{2})=\frac{\sigma^{2}}{n}\]

Recall that a linear combination of independent normal random variables will also follow a normal distribution. Hence result follows.

**Self-Review 2 :**

The mass of cockatoos in a bird sanctuary is found to have a mean of 6.7 kg and a standard deviation of 3.1 kg. A random sample of 300 cockatoos is taken.

The mean mass of the 300 cockatoos is denoted by \(\overline{X}\). State, with justification, the approximate distribution of \(\overline{X}\), giving its mean and variance. [N(6.7,3.1\({}^{2}\)/300)]

Find the probability that the mean found in (i) is between 6.5 kg and 6.8 kg. [0.580]

Find the probability that the total mass of the cockatoos exceeds 2040 kg. [0.288]

If there is a probability of more than 0.75 that the mean mass of a random sample of \(n\) cockatoos is greater than 6.5 kg, obtain the least value of \(n\). [110]

**Example 10: (Self-reading)**

A game is played in which an unbiased die is tossed 50 times and the number of 6's is counted.

Find the expected number of 6's in a game.

100 games are played. Find the probability that the average number of 6's obtained in a game is more than 10.

**Solution:**

Let \(X\) be the number of 6's obtained out of 50 tosses of the die (in a game)

Recall the Binomial Distribution.

Then \(X\sim\)B\(\left(50,\frac{1}{6}\right)\)

Expected number of 6's in a game, \(\operatorname{E}(X)=50\left(\frac{1}{6}\right)=\frac{25}{3}\)

Since \(n=100\) is large, by \(\operatorname{CLT}\),

\(\overline{X}\sim\)N\(\left(\frac{25}{3},\frac{125}{100}\right)\) approximately

Note the key word "average" in the question. To determine the value of \(n\), ask what we are averaging over - average number of 6's _per game_. Hence

\(\overline{X}=\frac{X_{1}+X_{2}+\cdots+X_{100}}{100}\)

\(\operatorname{P}\left(\overline{X}>10\right)\approx\)1.2754\(\times 10^{-10}\)

\(=\)1.28\(\times 10^{-10}\) (3 s.f.)

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:16]

**Chapter S6 Sampling and Estimation Theory**

**Remark:** If the population parameters are not given, we will need to use the sample mean and unbiased estimate for the population variance to estimate the parameters. For a normal distribution, we will use \(\overline{x}\) and \(s^{2}\) to estimate \(\mu\) and \(\sigma^{2}\) respectively. The following example illustrates this. The distribution of the sample mean in this case will still be approximately normal for a large sample size.

**Example 13:**

A mathematics test for JC2 students produces scores which are normally distributed on a scale from 0 to 100. A random sample of 160 JC2 students were assessed, and each of their individual test scores, \(x\), was recorded. The results are summarised by

\[\sum x=9120,\qquad\sum\left(x-\overline{x}\right)^{2}=35775.\] (i)

Calculate the unbiased estimates of the population mean and variance.

Assuming that the unbiased estimate of the population mean obtained above is equal to the population mean, find the value of \(c\) such that there is a probability of 0.95 that a sample of 160 scores has a sample mean that differs from its mean score by less than \(c\).

Comment on the validity of the calculations if the scores were not normally distributed.

**Solution:**

**(i)**: Unbiased estimate of the population mean \(\mu\),

\[\overline{x}=\frac{\sum x}{n}=\frac{9120}{160}=57\.\]

Unbiased estimate of the population variance \(\sigma^{2}\),

\[s^{2}=\frac{\sum\left(x-\overline{x}\right)^{2}}{n-1}=\frac{35775}{159}=225\] (ii)

Let \(\overline{X}\) denote the random variable representing the mean test scores of a sample of 160 randomly chosen JC2 students.

Then \(\overline{X}\sim\mathrm{N}(\mu,\frac{\sigma^{2}}{160})\).

Assuming \(\mu=57\) and estimating \(\sigma^{2}\) using \(s^{2}\) (\(=225\)) from (i),

we have \(\overline{X}\sim\mathrm{N}\left(57,\frac{225}{160}\right)\) approximately.

Note that the region is "center".

Find the probability that the total mass of the 60 packets exceeds 36.2kg.

[0.902, 0.984]Let \(X_{1}\), \(X_{2}\), \(X_{3}\), \(\ldots\), \(X_{n}\) be \(n\) independent observations drawn from a normal distribution with mean \(\mu\) and standard deviation \(\sigma\). State the distribution of the sample mean \(\bar{X}\). Is it necessary to apply the Central Limit Theorem in this case? Why? Given that \(\sigma=2\) and the probability that \(\bar{X}\) is within \(\pm\,0.1\) of the population mean \(\mu\) is at least 0.95, find the least value of the sample size required. [1537]
7 2017/NJC/II/7 There are three identically shaped balls, numbered from 1 to 3, in a bag. Balls are drawn one by one at random and with replacement.

9 N84/II/12 The random variables \(X\) and \(Y\) are related to two biased coins \(A\) and \(B\) in the following way. If when \(A\) is tossed and a head appears, which it does with probability \(p\), then \(X=1\), and if a tail appears, then \(X=0\). The random variable \(Y\) is defined in the same way for coin \(B\), for which the probability of a head appearing is \(2p\), where \(0<p<\frac{1}{2}\). For all values of \(\lambda\), it is given that the random variable \(T\), defined by \(T=\lambda X+\frac{1}{2}(1-\lambda)Y\) is an unbiased estimator of \(p\). (**i**) Show that \(\mathrm{Var}(T)=\lambda^{2}p(1-p)+\frac{1}{2}(1-\lambda)^{2}\,p(1-2p)\). (**ii**) Show that, when \(p=\frac{1}{3}\), the minimum value of \(\mathrm{Var}(T)\) is obtained by taking \(\lambda=\frac{1}{5}\). (**iii**) Hence obtain, for \(p=\frac{1}{3}\), the least possible value of \(\mathrm{P}\bigg{(}\bigg{|}\overline{T}-\frac{1}{3}\bigg{|}>0.05\bigg{)}\), where \(\overline{T}\) is the random variable denoting the mean value of \(T\) obtained from 100 tosses of the two coins.

1. At an early stage in analysing the marks scored by the large number of candidates in an examination, the Examination Board takes a random sample of 250 candidates and finds that the marks, \(x\), of these candidates give \(\sum x=11872\) and \(\sum x^{2}=646\),193. Find the unbiased estimates for the population mean and variance. Hence, find the probability that, on average, the candidates score between 45 to 55 marks.

On average, 40% of Christmas tree light bulbs manufactured by a company are red and the rest are blue. The lights are sold in boxes of 20. Assume that the number of red light bulbs in a box has a binomial distribution.

**(I)**: A random sample of 50 boxes is chosen. Using an approximate distribution, find the probability that the mean number of red light bulbs in 1 box will not exceed 7.5.
**(II)**: A customer selects boxes of light bulbs at random from a large consignment until she finds a box with fewer red lights than blue. Give a reason why a binomial distribution is not an appropriate model for the number of boxes selected.

Each morning, Tony drives from his home to his office and has to pass 4 traffic lights on his way. He has to reach his office by 8.50 am. The driving time to his office and the time held up at a traffic light junction, in minutes, may be assumed to follow normal distributions with means and standard deviations as summarized below:

\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|} \hline  & Mean & Standard deviation \\ \hline Driving time & 14 & 2.1 \\ \hline Time held up at a traffic light junction & \(\mu\) & 0.2 \\ \hline \end{tabular}

Tony leaves home at 8.30 am. If the probability that Tony is not late is 0.713, show that \(\mu=1.2\), correct to 1 decimal place. State an assumption needed in your calculations. [4]

Assume \(\mu\) is unknown.
