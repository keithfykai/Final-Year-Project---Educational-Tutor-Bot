## 1 Development of Chemical Kinetics

The concept of Chemical Kinetics started since 1700s and was developed by numerous experts of various nationalities in the field of Science and Mathematics to reach the understanding which we have today. The conceptual development started first with the focus on the finding of general laws for chemical reactions and relating kinetics to thermodynamics, followed by understanding of reactions through mechanism and transition states to describe multi-step chemical reaction. Below is a quick look at the progress in the development of Chemical Kinetics (or during those time, _Chemical Dynamics_).

* [12] French Chemists, Pierre Eugene Marcelin Berthelot (1827-1907) "_picture on left Leon Pean De Saint Gilles (1832-1863)_Found as a side result that rate is proportionate to the product of the reactant concentration.
* [13] Studied the kinetics of reversible reactions.
* [14] Norwegian Chemist, Peter Waage (1833-1900) Norwegian Mathematician, **Cato M. Guldberg (1836-1902)**Wage involved Guldberg as he was limited in mathematics, as were other scientists back then.
* [15] Built on Berthelot's work and developed the Law of Mass action, stating that rate of reaction is directly proportional to the product of the masses of the reactants
* [16] Tried deriving the rate equation, but incorrectly assumed that rate equation can be deduced from stoichiometric equations. Also, lack the instruments to justify and interpret the equation correctly.

[17] Dutch Chemist, Jacobus Henricus Van 't Hoff (1852-1911)
* [18] One of the founders of Physical Chemistry
* [19] Discovered the relationship between rate constant and equilibrium constant. Later, related the rate constant to temperature. All these, he justified using mathematical equations.
* [20] Classified chemical reactions at microscopic level as mono, bi or poly molecular (order of reaction).
* [21] These conclusions were later used by Arrhenius for his studies He laid down many equations which was picked up by other researchers, furthering the studies in this field.

[22] Swedish Chemist-Physicist,

**Svante August Arrhenius (1859-1927)**Re-studied the classical case of acid-catalysed hydrolysis of sugar (as done by Wilhelmy)
* [23] Introduced the concept of activation energy.
* [24] Using the equations proposed by Van 't Hoff, came up with the _Arnhenius Equation_, relating activation energy to rates of reaction, and related temperature to the rate constant.

[25] Russian-German Chemist, Friedrich Wilhelm Ostward (1853-1932)
* [26] Vars studying Catalysis when he found kinetics an intricate part which needs to look deeper into.
* [27] Developed the idea of method of isolation (pseudo first order), half-life, autocatalysis and classification of catalysis.
* [28] He brought to spotlight many of the other studies on kinetics which had not been noticed and even translated a few into German, the language of science back then.

What can we learn from these events leading up to the modern concept of Kinetics?

**Science is a pursuit to explain the natural phenomenon happening around us.**

Scientific knowledge and ideas are generated through observation of nature either through experiment or simply by daily encounters.

**Science is built upon evidences.**

Scientist built the general laws and concepts through gathering and evaluating of evidences. Scientist cannot just give a statement and call it a scientific knowledge. Evidences need to be sought through thorough studies in order to formulate a durable idea.

**Science is a complex social construct, is durable yet tentative.**

Science is not made by one man alone. As we can see from the development of the concept of Kinetics, scientist of different nationalities, different research interest and different abilities collectively contribute to the pool of knowledge over a long period of time, testing and building on each other's hypothesis/proposal in order to derive general laws which accurately describe the natural state. Hence, what we have today is credible and is as close as we can know with our technology (durable). However, as new discoveries and advances are made, new evidences may appear which require us to re-evaluate what we have and adjust our knowledge accordingly (tentative).

## 2 Introduction

Chemical reactions are processes where starting materials are converted into specific products. For a chemical reaction to occur, three important questions should be asked:

\begin{tabular}{c c}  & \begin{tabular}{c} Channel Reaction \\ \end{tabular} \\ Can a particular & How much of the starting \\ reaction occur under & material can be \\ defined conditions? & converted to products? \\ \end{tabular} & 
\begin{tabular}{c} If a reaction can occur, how fast \\ will it proceed? \\ \end{tabular} \\ \end{tabular}

\begin{tabular}{c c}  & \begin{tabular}{c} The investigations of rates of \\ reactions are the domain of \\ **KINETICS**. \\ **THERMODYNAMICS** concept through the \\ consideration of the _energy_ and _entropy_ changes \\ associated with a reaction. \\ \end{tabular} & 
\begin{tabular}{c} The effects of concentrations of \\ reactants, catalyst and the \\ temperature on the rate of \\ reaction provides insight into \\ the mechanism of a reaction \\ (how particles react with each \\ other). \\ \end{tabular} \\ \end{tabular}

In this chapter, we will focus on learning about the concept of kinetics and its use in understanding chemical reactions.

This will be done through studying kinetics qualitatively and quantitatively at two levels:

1. **MACROSCOPIC LEVEL**: addresses rates of reactions: what reaction rate means, how to determine a reaction rate and the rate equation experimentally, and how factors such as temperature, reactant concentration and the use of a catalyst influence rate.
2. **PARTICULATE LEVEL**: addresses the mechanism of the reaction, the detailed pathway taken by atoms and/or molecules as a reaction proceeds. We need to learn at a particulate level, how does the distribution of energy before, during and after reaction affect the (i) **energetic** feasibility and (ii) **kinetic** feasibility (rate) of a chemical reaction?

## 3 Basic Concept in Kinetics

### Collision Theory

(Understanding reaction at particulate level)

For a reaction between two particles to occur two conditions must be met:

1) The particles must collide in the **correct orientation**.

2) The particles must collide with **sufficient minimum energy (known as the activation energy)** to bring about the necessary re-organisation of the bonds in the colliding particles.

Assuming product to be A B.

The greater the number of particles involved in a single step, the more difficult it is to have all of them to collide at the correct orientation to affect a reaction. Hence usually, only a maximum of two particles will collide in a particular step of a reaction.

When particles **collide at the correct orientation and sufficient energy**, this collision is known as **effective collision** which will bring about a chemical reaction.

The greater the frequency of effective collisions, the greater the rate of reaction.

Hence, we can easily deduce that the experimental conditions required for increasing the number of effective collisions to increase reaction rate are:

**(i)**: Increase in temperature of the reacting particles

**(ii)**: Increase concentration of particles/ increasing surface area of solid particles

**(iii)**: Use of catalyst

### FACTORS Affecting Rate of Reaction

#### 3.2.1 Concentration of Aqueous or Gaseous Reactants

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:8]

#### 3.2.3 Temperature

[0.5cm] Success criteria:

[0.5cm] I can draw the Boltzmann distribution curve at two different temperatures and use it to explain how a change in temperature affects the rate of the reaction.

Increasing temperature of the reaction causes an increase in the rate of reaction. Rate approximately doubles for every 10 \({}^{\circ}\)C increase in temperature.

[0.5cm] _Worked example 1_

C\(\mathrm{e}\)H\({}_{5}\)CH\({}_{2}\)C\(l\) undergoes a substitution reaction to form C\(\mathrm{e}\)H\({}_{5}\)CH\({}_{2}\)CN as shown in the reaction below.

[0.5cm] C\(\mathrm{e}\)H\({}_{5}\)CH\({}_{2}\)C\(l\) + CN\({}^{-}\)C\(\mathrm{e}\)H\({}_{5}\)CH\({}_{2}\)CN + C\(l^{-}\)

With the aid of Boltzmann distribution curve, predict and explain the effect on the rate of this reaction when the reaction temperature is increased.

[0.5cm] _Note_:

The area under the curve is a measure of the total number of particles present. This area is the same for both curves.

[0.5cm] _Note_:

The area under the curve is a measure of the total number of particles present. This area is the same for both curves.

[0.5cm] _Note_:

When temperature of the reaction increases, average kinetic energy of the reacting molecules increases. The fraction of molecules with K.E. \(\geq\) E\({}_{\mathrm{a}}\) increases as shown in the Boltzmann distribution. The frequency of effective collisions increases hence rate of reaction increases.

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:10]

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:11]

**Case 2: Two Steps Reaction**

Consider A + B-C \(\longrightarrow\) AB + C (taking place in **2** steps)

In such cases, there will be **two transition states (humps)**, since **two elementary steps** are needed to reach the final product.

**Note:**

In this example, the first elementary step of this reaction has higher E\({}_{a}\), therefore overall rate of this reaction depends on the first elementary step which is also known as **slow step (rate determining step)**.

A **reaction intermediate** is a **short-lived species** formed in one of the steps in a multi-step reaction and is consumed in a subsequent step. It is neither a reactant nor an ultimate product of the overall reaction but is **stable** enough to be isolated for a short period of time.

#### 3.3.2 Homogeneous Catalyst

Catalyst and the reactants are in the same phase.

What are the different types of catalyst?

How does a homogeneous catalyst affect the reaction pathway of a reaction?

Watch [https://go.gov.ga/nic-kinetics-3](https://go.gov.ga/nic-kinetics-3) to find out.

A homogeneous catalyst functions by reacting with **ONE of the reactants** to form a reactive **intermediate** (Step 1). The reactive **intermediate** will then react with remaining reactant in later stage to complete the reaction (Step 2).

Step 1: A + catalyst \(\longrightarrow\) A-catalyst (**intermediate**)

Step 2: A-catalyst + B \(\longrightarrow\) AB + catalyst (Regenerated)

Overall reaction: A + B catalyst AB

Due to the involvement of the homogenous catalyst, the **alternative pathway** will **require one additional step to complete the reaction. This is because there can only be a maximum of two colliding particles in a particular step as probability of effective collision between 3 or more particles are unlikely.

The **energy profile** diagram with and without the catalyst is as shown:

### Worked example 3

Explain how Fe\({}^{2+}\)(aq) ions can be used as a catalyst for the reaction of \(\Gamma\) (aq) ions with S\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{8}\)\({}^{2-}\)(aq) ions as shown below.

\[2\Gamma^{-}\left(\text{aq}\right)+\text{S}_{2}\text{O}_{8}\text{${}^{2-}$}\left( \text{aq}\right)\longrightarrow\text{I}_{2}\left(\text{aq}\right)+2\text{SO}_{4} \text{${}^{2-}$}\left(\text{aq}\right)\]

The reaction has a high activation energy and it involves the collision of two anions. Fe\({}^{2+}\)(aq) catalysed the reaction by providing an alternative reaction pathway of lower activation energy as it enables the reaction between oppositely charged ions in both steps.

### Examples of Homogenous Catalysts

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|} \hline Homogeneous & \multicolumn{1}{c|}{Reaction catalysed} \\ \cline{2-3} Catalyst & \multicolumn{1}{c|}{} & \multicolumn{1}{c|}{**Ester formation**} \\ \cline{2-3} H\({}_{2}\)SO\({}_{4}\) (I) & HCOOH (I) + CH\({}_{3}\)OH (I) \(\longrightarrow\) HCOOCH\({}_{3}\) (I) + H\({}_{2}\)O (I) \\ \hline NO\({}_{2}\) (g) & \multicolumn{1}{c|}{**Oxidation of SO\({}_{2}\)(g) to SO\({}_{3}\)(g) in the atmosphere**} \\ (a pollutant gas & \multicolumn{1}{c|}{} & \multicolumn{1}{c|}{} \\ produced in car & \multicolumn{1}{c|}{SO\({}_{2}\) (g) + \(\gamma_{2}\)O\({}_{2}\) (g) \(\longrightarrow\) SO\({}_{3}\) (g)} \\ exhaust) & \multicolumn{1}{c|}{Burning of sulfur in fossil fuels produced large quantities of sulfur dioxide which can be readily oxidized to sulfur trioxide if NO\({}_{2}\) (g) is present in the atmosphere.} \\ \multicolumn{1}{c|}{NO\({}_{2}\) (g) can catalyse the oxidation of SO\({}_{2}\) (g) to SO\({}_{3}\)(g).} \\ Step 1: NO\({}_{2}\) (g) + SO\({}_{2}\) (g) \(\longrightarrow\) SO\({}_{3}\) (g) + NO (g) \\ Step 2: NO (g) + \(\gamma_{2}\) O\({}_{2}\) (g) \(\longrightarrow\) NO\({}_{2}\) (g) (regenerated) \\ \multicolumn{1}{c|}{The SO\({}_{3}\) produced can readily react with water in the atmosphere to form acid rain (H\({}_{2}\)SO\({}_{4}\)).} \\ \multicolumn{1}{c|}{SO\({}_{3}\) + H\({}_{2}\)O\(\longrightarrow\) H\({}_{2}\)SO\({}_{4}\)} \\ \hline \end{tabular}

#### 3.3.3 Autocatalyst

**Autocatalysis** is the **catalysis** of a reaction **by one of its products**. An autocatalysed reaction is slow at first and then becomes more rapid as the catalyst is produced in the reaction.

\begin{tabular}{|c c|} \hline \hline \begin{tabular}{c} WATCH \\ _Beam_ \\ \end{tabular} & 
\begin{tabular}{c} How does autocatalysis of the above redox reaction \\ affect its rate during the course of reaction? \\ Watch [https://qo.gov.sg/nic-kinetics-4](https://qo.gov.sg/nic-kinetics-4) to find out. \\ \end{tabular} \\ \hline \end{tabular}

**Example 1:** Redox reaction between manganate(VII) and ethanedioate ions \\ 
\begin{tabular}{c} MnO\({}_{4}\) + 5 C\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{4}\)\({}^{2}\)- + 16 H\({}^{+}\) \(\longrightarrow\) 2 Mn\({}^{2+}\) + 10 CO\({}_{2}\) + 8 H\({}_{2}\)O \\ \end{tabular}

**Example 2:** Hydrolysis of ester \\ The rate of the reaction below gradually increases at first, but then decreases. \\ \end{tabular}

\begin{tabular}{c} CH\({}_{3}\)COOCH\({}_{2}\)CH\({}_{3}\) + H\({}_{2}\)O \(\longrightarrow\) & CH\({}_{3}\)COOH + CH\({}_{3}\)CH\({}_{2}\)OH \\ \end{tabular}

The reaction yields CH\({}_{3}\)COOH as one of the products at first. It is a weak acid which partially ionizes in water to produce H\({}^{+}\) (aq).

The reaction rate gradually increases because it is auto-catalysed by H\({}^{+}\).

The reaction rate decreases after sometimes because the concentration of the reactant ethyl ethanoate decreases as rate is directly proportional to [CH\({}_{3}\)COOCH\({}_{2}\)CH\({}_{3}\)].

#### 3.3.4 Biological catalyst (Enzymes)

Enzymes are complex globular proteins that catalyse biochemical reactions. They contain an active site into which the reactant molecules of a particular shape and size will fit making them highly specific in their action. The attractive forces between the reactant (substrate) molecule and the enzyme weakens the bonds within the substrate molecule, thereby lowering the activation energy and increasing the rate of reaction.

Enzymes are more effective and efficient catalysts as illustrated by the following example. Consider the decomposition (disproportionation) of hydrogen peroxide.

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|} \hline
**Catalyst** & **Activation energy, E\({}_{\text{a}}\)** \\  & _/ kJ mol-1_ \\ \hline lodide ion & 56.5 \\ (inorganic catalyst) & \\ \hline Catalase & 8 \\ (enzyme) & \\ \hline \end{tabular}

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:20]

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:21]

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:22]

* **Initial rate** of reaction is the reaction rate at the start of the reaction, when an extremely small amount of reactants is used up. It corresponds to the slope of the tangent when t = 0. At initial rate, the rate of reaction is the highest due to the greatest amount of reactant consumed.

### The Rate Equation

**Success criteria:**

* I can define the rate equation, rate constant and order of reaction correctly.
* I can write the rate equation based on the order of reaction determined experimental
* I can interpret the meaning of zero, first and second order of reactions.

As a reaction may not adopt a fix rate throughout the reaction, a different approach from average rate is needed to understand the kinetics of a reaction. This can be achieved through the rate equation. The rate equation can give the kinetic profile of a reaction, providing information on the instantaneous rate and verify mechanism of a reaction.

The rate equation is stipulated as follows:

* By **monitoring how rate** of a particular reaction **varies with changing concentration** of each reactant, rate equation can be **deduced**.
* Rate equation **identifies the reactants** involved in the **rate determining step** of a multi-step reaction.

#### 4.2.1 Order of Reaction

**Order of reaction** with respect to a reactant is the **power** of the concentration of that reactant in the **experimentally determined** rate equation.

**Overall order of reaction** is the **sum** of the orders of reaction with respect to the reactants which are the **powers** of the concentrations of the reactants in the **experimentally determined** rate equation.

Rate Equation: **Rate = k[A]Y[B]Y**

(where x and y are the order of reaction with respect to A and B respectively.)

The **overall order** of the reaction = **x + y**.

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|} \hline WATCH & What is meant by 1st and 2nd order of reaction with \\ _(beam)_ & respect to certain reactants in each elementary step? \\ \hline Watch [https://go.gov.sg/nic-kinetics-10](https://go.gov.sg/nic-kinetics-10) to find out. \\ \hline \end{tabular}

In H2 Chemistry, we will need to know zero, first and second order of reaction.

Order of reaction is always with respect to a reactant. It will describe the effect of the concentration change of that reactant on the rate of reaction.

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|} \hline
**Order** & **Effect on Rate of Reaction** \\ \hline Zero Order & Rate of reaction is not affected by this reactant. \\  & (e.g. rate of reaction remains the same despite \\ concentration doubled) \\ \hline First Order & Rate of reaction is directly proportionate to the \\  & concentration of the reactant (linear relationship). \\  & (e.g. rate of reaction doubles when concentration \\  & is doubled) \\ \hline Second Order & Rate of reaction is directly proportionate to square \\  & of concentration of reactant. \\  & (e.g. rate of reaction quadruples when \\  & concentration is doubled) \\ \hline \end{tabular}

#### 4.2.2 Rate constant, \(k\)

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|} \hline
**Success criteria:** \\ \(\bullet\) & I can state the effect on the rate constant with the change in condition. \\ \(\bullet\) & I can state the units for rate constant based on the overall order of reaction. \\ \hline \end{tabular}

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|} \hline WATCH & What are the factors affecting rate constant k? \\ _(beam)_ & How do these factors affect the rate constant? \\  & Watch [https://go.gov.sg/nic-kinetics-9](https://go.gov.sg/nic-kinetics-9) to find out. \\ \hline \end{tabular}

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|} \hline
**Subject:** & **Changed** & **Effect on rate of reaction** \\ \hline The effect of the & **condition** & **Effect on value of** \\ changed conditions & Increase & **-** \\ on rate of reaction & concentration & (if the order is NOT zero \\ can be explained by & of a reactant & with respect to the reactant) \\ the collision theory & \({}^{*}\)Increase & **-** \\ with the aid of & temperature & Increases \\ Boltzmann & \({}^{*}\)Addition of a & **-** \\ distribution curve. & \({}^{*}\)Addition of a & **-** \\ (Refer to section 3.2) & catalyst & **-** \\ \hline \end{tabular}

* The units of rate constant, \(\mathbf{k}\), depend on the **overall order** of the reaction.

* rate = \(\frac{\text{d}\ \text{d}\ \text{d}}{\text{d}}\), hence, **units for rate is always mol dm-3 t-1**.
* Time (t) can be seconds, hour, day etc. depending on what is suitable for a particular reaction. For a reaction that is very slow, there is only a significant change in the concentration after a few hours, therefore it is only sensible to define its rate as change in concentration per unit hour or per day. **Refer to question for specific units of \(t\).

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|} \hline
**Overall** & **Units for rate constant, k** \\ \hline Zero order & units for k = units of rate = mol dm-3 t-1 \\ \hline First order & units for k = \(\frac{\text{units of rate}}{\text{units of }\text{[A]}}=\frac{\text{mol dm}^{-3}\text{ t}^{-1}}{\text{mol dm}^{-3}}=\text{ t}^{-1}\) \\ \hline Second order & units for k = \(\frac{\text{units of rate}}{\text{units of [A]}}=\frac{\text{mol dm}^{-3}\text{ t}^{-1}}{\text{mol dm}^{-3}}=\text{mol}^{-1}\text{dm}^{3}\text{ t}^{-1}\) \\ \hline Third order & units for k = \(\frac{\text{units of rate}}{\text{units of [A]}^{2}[\text{B]}}=\frac{\text{mol dm}^{-3}\text{ t}^{-1}}{\text{mol dm}^{-3}}=\text{mol}^{-2}\text{dm}^{6}\text{ t}^{-1}\) \\ \hline \end{tabular}

**Checkpoint 2**

### Reaction Mechanism and Rate Equation

**Success criteria:**

* I can derive the rate equation (i.e. rate = \(R\)A\(\mathcal{F}^{n}\)[B]\({}^{n}\), where \(m\) and \(n\) could be 0, 1 or 2) from the rate determining step (i.e. slow step) of the reaction mechanism and vice versa.
* I can verify the reaction mechanism by matching with the rate equation; and predict the order of reaction that would result from a given reaction mechanism.

#### 4.3.1 What is Mechanism?

For reaction involving 3 or more reacting particles, it is unlikely to combine all reactants in one step. Such reactions are likely to take place in multiple steps with maximum of 2 reacting particles per elementary step.

The breakdown and details of how and what reacts at each elementary step of a multi-step reaction is known as the **reaction mechanism.**

Each elementary step in a mechanism proceeds at its own rate. The elementary step which determines the rate of reaction is known as the slow step or the rate determining step. The slow step will provide the rate equation for the mechanism.

Mechanisms are usually suggested and require multiple investigation to confirm.

What is meant by

#### 4.3.2 Deducing and Verifying Reaction Mechanism

Mechanism can be deduced and verified in 2 ways:

The rate of the reaction is determined by the rate determining step as no elementary steps can be slower than the slow step. Hence, the rate equation will help us verify which suggested mechanism is true.

The rate equation for the suggested mechanism is derived from the stoichiometric coefficient of the reactants in the rate determining step.

#### 4.3.2.2 Route 2: Use Experimental Rate Equation to Construct Mechanism

1. Decide which molecules (species) are involved in the rate-determining step from the experimentally determined rate equation.
2. Suggest possible products from the reactants you have chosen. (These products may include species which do not appear as products in the stoichiometric equation)
3. Compare the rate-determining step with the stoichiometric equation to see how many molecules are still to be accounted for.
4. Add up the reaction steps and this must coincide with the overall stoichiometric equation.

_Worked Example 4_

Consider reaction between CH\({}_{3}\)CH\({}_{2}\)Br and NaOH propose a possible mechanism.

**Overall equation**: CH\({}_{3}\)CH\({}_{2}\)Br + NaOH \(\longrightarrow\) CH\({}_{3}\)CH\({}_{2}\)OH + NaBr

**Rate equation**: rate = k[CH\({}_{3}\)CH\({}_{2}\)Br][NaOH] _Determined experimentally_

Both reactants in the overall equation appear in the rate equation with the order of reaction stated according to its stoichiometric ratio. This indicates both reactants are in the rate determining step and reaction proceeds in a single step.

**Mechanism**: CH\({}_{3}\)CH\({}_{2}\)Br + NaOH \(\longrightarrow\) CH\({}_{3}\)CH\({}_{2}\)OH + NaBr

(same as balanced equation)

### Worked Example 5

The compound nitrosyl fluoride, ONF, can be produced from nitrogen monoxide and fluorine.

2NO (g) + F2(g) 2ONF (g)

The rate equation for this reaction is rate = k[NO][F2]. The mechanism has two steps. One of these steps produces ONF and the free radical F* in equimolar amounts.

Suggest equations for the two steps of the mechanism, stating which one is the slower step.

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|} \hline
**Step 1:** & NO, F2 \\ Decide which molecules (species) are & \\ involved in the rate-determining step. & \\ \hline
**Step 2:** & ONF, F* \\ Suggest possible products from the reactants you have chosen. (These products may include species which do not appear as products in the stoichiometric equation) & \\ \hline
**Step 3:** & rate equation (1 mol of NO and 1 mol of F2 in the _slow_ step) \\ with the stoichiometric equation to & Chemical equation and rate equation are \\ see how many molecules are yet to & not the same therefore reaction cannot \\  & occur in 1 step. \\  & (there is 2 mol of NO and 1 mol of F2 in the overall reaction) \\  & \\ \end{tabular}

Hence there are 2 steps in this mechanism with F* as the intermediate and also to introduce the 2nd mole of NO to react with F*

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|} \hline
**Step 4:** & 1st step: (slow) \\ Add up the reaction steps and this & NO (g) + F2 (g) & F* (g) + ONF (g) \\ must coincide with the overall stoichiometric equation. & 2nd step: F* (g) + NO (g) & ONF (g) \\ \hline \end{tabular}

#### Experiments to Determine Rate Equation

**Success criteria:**

* I can devise a suitable experimental technique for studying the rate of a reaction, using continuous or initial rate method from given information.

In this segment, we will look at various experimental techniques to obtain data for the rate analysis.

To monitor rate of reaction, several experimental approaches can be used:

(a) Making Physical Measurement (For Continuous or Initial Rate Method)

Following are some examples of physical measurements that can be taken to monitor reaction rate:

* Volume of Gases (Gas Collection)
* Mass Loss (Gravimetric method)
* pH changes
* Electrical conductivity
* Intensity of colour
* Pressure

(b) Titrimetric Method (For Continuous Method)
* Monitoring concentration of reactant left using a series of titration

(c) Clock reaction (For Initial Rate Method)
* Monitoring time taken for a sample to be reacted indicated by appearance or disappearance of colour

#### Examples of Physical Measurements

* Gas Collection Method
* measure the increase in volume at regular time interval under constant pressure.

(b) Gravimetric Method
* measure the decrease in mass over time
* measuring loss of mass and hence applicable for a reaction involving a gaseous product.

Example: CaCO\({}_{3}\) (s) + 2HCl(aq) Ca\(Cl_{2}\) (aq) + **CO\({}_{2}\)(g)** + H\({}_{2}\)O (l)

(b) Gravimetric Method
* measure the decrease in mass over time
* measuring loss of mass and hence applicable for a reaction involving a gaseous product.

* Monitor change in pH using Data Logger/ pH Meter
* measure the change in pH of a reaction over time
* measurement with the use of a pH probe

Example: CH3Br + NaOH \(\rightarrow\) CH3OH + NaBr _(the pH of the solution decreases with time as NaOH is being consumed)_

* Monitor change in electrical conductivity using Data Logger/

**Conductivity meter**

* measure change in electrical conductivity of a reaction over time due to a change in the number of ions in solution

Example:

BrO3 (aq) + 5Br^- (aq) + 6H^+ (aq) -> 3Br_2 (aq) 3H_2O (I) _(decrease in number of ions present and thus conductivity of the solution falls as reaction proceeds, and hence electrical conductivity decreases with time.)_

* **Colorimetry Method**
* measure the change in colour intensity over time
* intensity of colour is proportional to the concentration of the coloured substance

Example: CH3COCH3 (aq) + **I2 (aq)** CH2ICOCH3 (aq) + HI (aq) (_colour intensity decreases with time as brown I2(aq) is being consumed_)

(f) Changes in pressure
* measure change in pressure over time while volume of reaction vessel is kept constant.
* pressure change is due to number of moles of gaseous reactants being different from the number of moles of gaseous products.

Example: N2O4 (g) \(\rightarrow\) 2NO2 (g)

_(reaction is accompanied by an increase in number of moles of gas, and hence pressure increases with time at constant volume)_

#### 4.4.1.2 Titimetric method (Continuous Method)

Reactions may not always have colour or other means by which physical measurement can be taken directly to track reaction progress. In such, titration with the use of an indicator/coloured titrant is useful to determine the concentration of reactant left at regular time interval. A graph is then plotted which could be used to determine the order of reaction, rate or rate constant.

Reaction with coloured reactants can also use this method of monitoring if continuous method is the choice of analysis.

The withdrawn portions are then "_quenched_".

Quenching is the _slowing of the reaction abruptly at a measured time_ from the start of the reaction. This is to _allow analysis of the content in the reaction mixture at that point of time_ so that the concentration of products or reactants can be monitored with time.

Quenching usually can be achieved by:

1. rapid cooling in ice bath (lower temp of reaction mixture),
2. removing the catalyst,
3. by adding large volume of cold water which lowers the reaction temperature and dilutes the reactants.

Example of titrimetric method: Consider the reaction

\[\begin{array}{l}\text{CH}_{3}\text{COCH}_{3}\left(\text{aq}\right)+\text{I}_ {2}\left(\text{aq}\right)\xrightarrow{\text{H}^{+}}\text{CH}_{2}\text{COCH}_{2 }\left(\text{aq}\right)+\text{HI}\left(\text{aq}\right)\end{array}\]

#### 4.4.1.3 Clock reactions (Initial Rate Method)

For reactions that are accompanied by **prominent visual changes**, the rate of reaction may be studied by "clock reaction", which **measures the time measuring the time taken for a prescribed visual change to occur**

\[\text{Rate of reaction}=\frac{\text{change in concentration of reactants/products}}{\text{time taken for sudden observable change}}\]

To compare average rates of reaction with initial reactant concentrations, the **concentration of one of the reactants could be varied in a series of experiments**. Different mixtures would have different starting concentration of one reactant (say, reactant **A**) while all other factors (i.e. concentration of remaining reactants, temperature, etc) remain constant to determine the order of reaction with respect to reactant **A**.

Some examples of this experimental approaches are as follows:

**Example 1: Production of Solid**

\[\text{S}_{2}\text{O}_{3}\text{${}^{2-}$ (aq)}+2\text{H}^{+}\text{(aq)}\longrightarrow\text{S (s)}+\text{SO}_{2}\text{(g)}+\text{H}_{2}\text{O}\text{(l)}\]

The average rate of reaction for the reaction mixture can be measured by noting the **time taken for sufficient sulfur to be produced** such that the **"X" mark on the white paper is no longer visible**.

Since the same "X" on the white paper is obscured for all experiments, we are measuring the **time taken for a fixed amount of sulfur to be formed**. Hence, **rate of reaction**\(\propto\frac{1}{\text{time taken}}\).

\[\begin{array}{|c|}\text{WATCH}\\ \text{and}\\ \text{learn}\end{array}\]

Sulfur clock reaction

\[\begin{array}{|c|}\text{S}_{2}\text{O}_{3}\text{${}^{2-}$ (aq)}+2\text{H}^{+}\text{(aq)}\longrightarrow\text{S (s)}+\text{SO}_{2}\text{(g)}+\text{H}_{2}\text{O}\text{(l)}\\ \text{and start timing}\end{array}\]

### Example 2: Appearance of Colour

\[\text{H}_{2}\text{O}_{2}+2\text{I}^{-}+2\text{H}^{+}\text{---}\longrightarrow \text{I}_{2}+2\text{H}_{2}\text{O}\]

For reactions involving for appearance of colour, e.g. colourless to dark blue colouration with starch indicator.

The **amount of I\({}_{2}\) formed is fixed** by adding a known, small amount of Na\({}_{2}\)S\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{3}\). The iodine liberated will immediately react with the sodium thiosulfate.

\[\text{I}_{2}+2\text{S}_{2}\text{O}_{3}{}^{2-}\longrightarrow 2\text{I}^{-}+\text{S} _{4}\text{O}_{6}{}^{2-}\]

When all S\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{3}{}^{2}\)-are removed, an excess of I\({}_{2}\) forms and the solution give a deep blue colouration in the presence of starch indicators.

Since amount of S\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{3}{}^{2-}\) is fixed for all experiments, we are measuring the _time taken for a fixed amount of I\({}_{2}\) to be formed_.

\[\text{Hence},\ \text{rate of reaction}\propto\frac{1}{\text{time taken}}\]

WATCH and \(\text{learn}\)

WATCH and \(\text{learn}\)

### Example 3: Disappearance of Colour

\[\text{I}_{2}+\text{CH}_{3}\text{COCH}_{3}\longrightarrow\text{HI}+\text{CH}_{ 3}\text{COCH}_{2}\text{I}\]

For reactions involving for disappearance of colour, e.g. brown to colourless. The rate of reaction may be studied by measuring the time taken for the colour of iodine of varying concentration to disappear.

As the amount of I\({}_{2}\) can vary between experiments,

\[\text{rate of reaction}=\frac{\text{change in concentration of iodine}}{\text{time taken for iodine to disappear}}\]

How to identify when to simplify the rate of rxn for initial rate method?

Rate can in certain situation be simplified to: rate \(\propto\frac{1}{\text{time taken}}\).

* Appearance of colour (**Example 1 & 2**)

We measure the time taken for a fixed amount of coloured product to be produced for all experiments.

\[\text{rate}=\frac{\text{change in fixed amount of coloured products}}{\text{time taken for sudden observable change}}\]

It CAN be simplified as rate \(\propto\frac{1}{\text{time taken for sudden observable change}}\)

Disappearance of colour (**Example 3**)

As the amount of coloured reactant can vary between experiments,

\[\text{rate}=\frac{\text{change in concentration of coloured reactant}}{\text{time taken for coloured reactant to disappear}}\]

It CANNOT be simplified as rate \(\propto\frac{1}{\text{time taken}}\)

#### Data Processing Methods to Deduce Rate Equation

With the data obtained from the experiment, the data can be processed in one or more of these methods to deduce the rate equation.

1. **Inspection/Mathematical Method** - For Initial Rate Only
2. **Graphical Methods** - For both Continuous and Initial Rate

In each of these methods, we will allow only the concentration of one reactant to change, while keeping the other concentrations to stay constant. The concentrations which were kept constant may have impact on the rate of reaction but cannot be observed due to it being kept constant across the experiments.

Comparing the change in the rate of reaction with the changing concentration of reactant (or product), we can deduce the **order of reaction**. This can be used to construct the rate equation.

#### Inspection/Mathematical Method

When given a series of data obtained from multiple experiments, especially in table form,

1. **Inspection method**: compare concentration vs rate between suitable pair of experiments.
2. **Mathematical method**: use rate equation to compare suitable pair of experiments

To find out the orders of reaction with respect to ethene and bromine, ethene and bromine were first dissolved separately in tetrachloromethane. Various volumes of these solutions and tetrachloromethane were mixed and the time taken for the colour of bromine to disappear was recorded. The results are shown in the table below:

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|} \hline Experiment & \begin{tabular}{c} Volume of CH\({}_{2}\)=CH\({}_{2}\) \\ in CC\(l\)\(l\)\(/\) cm\({}^{3}\) \\ \end{tabular} & \begin{tabular}{c} Volume of Br\({}_{2}\)(\(l\)) \\ / cm\({}^{3}\) \\ \end{tabular} & \begin{tabular}{c} Volume of \\ CC\(l\)\(l\)\(/\) cm\({}^{3}\) \\ \end{tabular} &

* **LINEAR**: Zero Order

As reaction proceeds, **[A] decreases**. It is observed that the **rate of reaction (gradient of conc-time graph) remains unchanged**. * It is zero order reaction w.r.t. A.

**Half-life (t1/2)** is defined to be the time taken for the concentration of the reactant to fall to half of its initial concentration.

* **Half-Life of First Order Reaction If the reaction has a constant half-life, the reaction is first order with respect to the investigated reactant. This is due to rate of reaction decreasing linearly with the change in concentration. This half-life can be used to determine the value of rate constant, k, using the equation below.

#### Checkpoint 8

Azomethane, CH\({}_{3}\)-N=N-CH\({}_{3}\), is a common compound used in cancer research. It decomposes according to the following equation:

\[\text{CH}_{3}\text{-N=N-CH}_{3}\text{(g)}\xrightarrow{}\text{CH}_{3}\text{CH}_{3 }\text{(g)}+\text{N}_{2}\text{(g)}\]

**(i)**: Suggest a variable that can be monitored experimentally to study the rate of the reaction. Explain your answer.

**(ii)**: 0.0220 mol dm\({}^{3}\) of CH\({}_{3}\)-N=N-CH\({}_{3}\) was decomposed in a reaction. The concentration of ethane, [CH\({}_{3}\)CH\({}_{3}\)], was determined at different times in a particular experiment and is shown below:

* (iii) Calculate the rate constant for this reaction and state its units.

3. **Combination of Initial Rate and Continuous Methods** When the reaction involves two types of reactants, the **overall rate** of reaction could **depend on either one or both types of the reactants**. To construct the rate equation, we will need to find the order of reaction with respect to each reactant. This can be done through a combination of continuous and initial rate method. Using the following reaction as example, A + B (large excess) C

rate = k[A]^m[B]^n

Reactant B is used in large excess (>= 10 times the conc of reactant A).

**Step 1: Continuous Method (Find order of reaction w.r.t A)**

* Keep [B] constant by using large excess of B. Due to large excess, the very small amount of B will be consumed and hence the concentration is relatively constant. Any change in the rate of reaction would then not be due to B. The rate equation could be re-written below as pseudo rate equation: Rate = k' [A]^m, where k' = k[B]^n (a constant)
* Use the pseudo rate equation: Rate = k' [A]^m to find the order of reaction with respect to the changing reactant concentration, [A].

**Observe the shape and use half-life data to determine the order of reaction with respect to A. Step 2: Initial Rate Method (Find order of reaction w.r.t B)**

Repeat the same experiment in step 1

* Keep [A] constant
* Change [B], but still keeping B in large excess.

**Compare time taken for both reactions to reach the same [A] left. Use inspection method to deduce the order of reaction.**

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:52]

Suppose we look at experiment 2, where [ester] = 0.2 mol dm-3 and [H+]nitial = 0.2 mol dm-3 As reaction proceeds, [ester] decreases significantly while [H+] remains approximately constant. It is observed that the rate of reaction decreases with a constant half-life of 34 mins. \(\rightarrow\) It is first order reaction w.r.t. ester. Comparing expt 1 and 2, [ester] is kept constant while [H+] is doubled. Half-life for ester in _expt 1_ = 66 mins Half-life for ester in _expt 2_ = 34 mins For the _same amount_ or _conc of ester_ reacted, expt 2 takes half the time compared to expt 1. : **Average rate** of expt 2 must be twice of **average rate** of expt 1. Since the concentration of HC_I_ in expt 2 is twice of expt 1, the reaction is _first order_ w.r.t HC_I_. Rate equation: rate = k'[ester] [H+] where k' = k[H2O]z

**(d)**: Discuss why it is not possible to determine the order of reaction with respect to water. This is because water is present in large excess as it assumes the role of a solvent in aqueous solutions of HC_I_ and ester. The conc of water large and remains relatively constant, it is therefore impossible to determine the order with respect to water.

**Learning points:**

When aqueous catalyst is involved in the slow step, its concentration matters (as opposed to solid catalyst). The more aqueous catalyst used, the higher the rate of reaction.

In order to obtain the order of reaction for a single species in the rate equation, there is a need to ensure all other reactants (including catalysts) do not affect the rate. However, as long as a reactant is an aqueous species, it has the potential to impact the rate. Hence, **to ensure a particular reactant seemingly exert no effect on rate**, it has to be

present in relatively much larger concentration (large excess such that consumption is negligible from start to end of experiment) or,

kept the same between experiments.

Hence, when the reactant is a solvent, the order w.r.t this reactant cannot be determined as its concentration cannot be varied. Being a solvent, it will be present in large excess.

### Worked Example 11

The kinetics of reaction between bromomethane, CH\({}_{3}\)Br and NaOH is being investigated. The balanced chemical equation is as follows:

\[\text{CH}_{3}\text{Br}+\text{NaOH}\xrightarrow{}\text{CH}_{3}\text{OH}+\text{ NaBr}\]

In order to determine the order with respect to each type of reactant, two experiments can be carried out. [CH\({}_{3}\)Br] used is at least 10 times of the [NaOH].

_Chemistry Application...(for your interest)_

_Taken from "Green Chemistry Principle #9 Catalysis" by Roger A. Sheldon, PhD, Emeritus Professor of Biocatalysis and Organic Chemistry, Delft University of Technology and CEO of CLEA Technologies B.V. Web Source: [https://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/greenchemistry/what-is-green-chemistry/principles/green-chemistry-principle--9.html_](https://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/greenchemistry/what-is-green-chemistry/principles/green-chemistry-principle--9.html_)

A primary goal of green chemistry is the minimization or preferably the elimination of waste in the manufacture of chemicals and allied products: _"prevention is better than cure"_. This necessitates a paradigm shift in the concept of efficiency in organic synthesis, from one that is focused on chemical yield to one that assigns value to minimization of waste. What is the cause of waste? The key lies in the concept of atom economy: _"synthetic methods should be designed to maximize the incorporation of all materials used in the process into the final product"_. In the reaction scheme we compare, for example, the reduction of a ketone to the corresponding secondary alcohol using sodium borohydride or molecular hydrogen as the reductant. Reduction with the former has an atom economy of 81% while reduction with the latter are 100% atom economic, that is everything ends up in the product and, in principle, there is no waste.

Unfortunately, hydrogen does not react with ketones to any extent under normal conditions. For this we need a _cataly such as palladium-on-charcoal. A catalyst is defined as "a substance that changes the velocity of a reaction without itself being changed in the process". It lowers the activation energy of the reaction but in so doing it is not consumed_. This means that, in principle at least, it can be used in _small amounts and be recycled indefinitely_, that is it doesn't generate any waste. Moreover, molecular hydrogen is also the least expensive reductant and, for this reason, catalytic hydrogations are widely applied in the petrochemical industry, where the use of other reductants is generally not economically viable. It is only in the last two decades, however, following the emergence of green chemistry, that catalysis has been widely applied in the pharmaceutical and fine chemical industries, with the goal of minimizing the enormous amounts of waste generated by the use of stoichiometric inorganic reagents. This involves the use of the full breadth of catalysis: heterogeneous, homogeneous, organocatalysts and, more recently, Nature's own exquisite catalysts: enzymes. The latter are particularly effective at catalyzing highly selective processes with complex substrates under mild conditions and, hence, are finding broad applications in the pharmaceutical and allied industries. Moreover, they are expected to play an important role in the transition from a chemical industry based on non-renewable fossil resources to a more sustainable bio-based economy utilizing renewable biomass as the raw material, yet another noble goal of green chemistry.

Hydrogen peroxide of original concentration 3.0 mol dm\({}^{-3}\) was placed in a contaminated bottle some time ago. The student was then asked to determine how long the hydrogen peroxide had been stored in the bottle. In order for the student to find out how long the H\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{2}\) is stored in the bottle, the kinetics of decomposition of H\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{2}\) must be followed to determine its half-life. The rate of decomposition of hydrogen peroxide was investigated by monitoring remaining H\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{2}\) with time.

\[2\) H\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{2}\)(aq) \(\rightarrow\) 2H\({}_{2}\)O(l) + O\({}_{2}\)(g) The remaining H\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{2}\) can be determined by withdrawing 10 cm\({}^{3}\) portions of H\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{2}\) solution at regular time intervals and titrating it with acidified 0.1 mol dm\({}^{-3}\)KMnO\({}_{4}\)(aq). This is known as the **titrimetric method.**
