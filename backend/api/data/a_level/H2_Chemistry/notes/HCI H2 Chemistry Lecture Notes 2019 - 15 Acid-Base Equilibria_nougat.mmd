## 1 Introduction

Acids and bases are important in many chemical processes that occur around us, from industrial processes to biological ones and from reactions in the laboratory to those in our environment. In this topic, we will examine equilibria involving acids and bases and study the pH of solutions containing strong acids and bases, weak acids and bases, salts and buffers.

Recall from Topic 4,Reactions and Stoichiometry that, according to the Bronsted-Lowry Theory of acids and bases:

An acid is a proton-donor and a base is a proton-acceptor.

An acid-base reaction therefore involves a transfer of a proton from an acid to a base.

### Conjugate Acid-Base pair

_LO 4(b): show understanding of, and apply the Bronsted-Lowry theory of acids and bases, including the concept of conjugate acids and conjugate bases_

In the forward reaction:

CH\({}_{3}\)CO\({}_{2}\)H acts as a Bronsted acid, donating a proton to the Bronsted base, H\({}_{2}\)O.

In the reverse reaction:

CH\({}_{3}\)CO\({}_{2}\)- acts as a Bronsted base, accepting a proton from the Bronsted acid, H\({}_{3}\)O\({}^{\prime}\), to re-form the Bronsted acid, CH\({}_{3}\)CO\({}_{2}\)H.

\(\bullet\)CH\({}_{3}\)CO\({}_{2}\)H and CH\({}_{3}\)CO\({}_{2}\)- form a conjugate acid-base pair;

\(\bullet\)H\({}_{2}\)O and H\({}_{3}\)O\({}^{\prime}\)form another conjugate acid-base pair.

In general,

\(\bullet\)A conjugate acid-base pair constitutes two species which differ from each other by a proton.

\(\bullet\)An acid after donating a proton forms its conjugate base.

\(\bullet\)A base after accepting a proton forms its conjugate acid.

\(\bullet\)In any acid-base reaction, there are two conjugate acid-base pairs.

1. An aqueous solution contains 0.10 mol dm\({}^{-3}\) of calcium hydroxide (a strong base). Calculate the concentration of OH\({}^{-}\) in mol dm\({}^{-3}\), and hence the pH of this solution at 25 \({}^{\circ}\)C.
2. Solution X contains HCl, it has pH 2.2 Solution Y has the same volume as solution X. Solution Y contains HNO\({}_{3}\) and has pH 1.6. The two solutions are mixed. Calculate the pH of the resulting solution.

### Acid Dissociation Constant (\(K_{a}\)) and Base Dissociation constant (\(K_{b}\))

_LO 10.1(b):_ _report:_ _exploin the terms \(K_{a}\) pH\({}_{a}\)K\({}_{b}\) pH\({}_{b}\) and apply them in calculations, including the relationship K\({}_{a}\) = K\({}_{a}\)K\({}_{b}\)_

#### 2.5.1 Acid Dissociation Constant (\(K_{a}\))

A weak acid HA dissociates partially in water to give H\({}_{3}\)O\({}^{+}\),

In dilute aqueous solution, [H\({}_{2}\)O] is almost constant (at 55.6 mol dm\({}^{-3}\)). The equilibrium constant may be written as:

* For strong acids, e.g. HCl, \(K_{a}\) is very large and not used.
* The value of \(K_{a}\) indicates the **extent** to which the weak acid dissociates in water at the specified temperature.
* To compare the strength of two weak acids, compare their \(K_{a}\) values.
* At the same temperature, larger \(K_{a}\) (smaller pK\({}_{a}\)) = stronger acid.
* Like other equilibrium constants, the value of \(K_{a}\) depends only on temperature.

lons in salts derived from a strong acid and a strong base (e.g. NaCl, KNO) do not undergo salt hydrolysis, Hence the resulting solution is neutral \(\Rightarrow\) pH = 7 at 25.

However, ions in salts derived from weak acids/bases, as well as metal cations with high charge density, could undergo hydrolysis to result in acidic or alkaline solutions (pH greater/less than 7 at 25.).

#### Salt derived from a weak acid and a strong base

Consider CH3CO2Na which is derived from the salt of CH3CO2H and NaOH.

CH3CO2H is a weak acid so its conjugate base CH3CO2 is a stronger base than water. CH3CO2 undergoes hydrolysis forming OH ions.

Note:

CH3CO2 (aq) is a stronger base than water so is able to accept a proton from water.

However, it is still a weak base (\(K_{\mathrm{b}}\) of CH3CO2= 5.6 \(\times\) 10-10 mol dm\({}^{-3}\)). Hence a reversible arrow is used in the salt hydrolysis equation.

The cation Na+ does not undergo hydrolysis due to its low charge density.

#### Salt derived from a strong acid and a weak base

Consider NH4C_I which is derived from the salt of HCI and NH3.

NH3 is a weak base so its conjugate acid NH4 is a stronger acid than water. NH4 undergoes hydrolysis forming H3O' ions.

Note:

NH4 is a stronger acid than water so is able to donate a proton to water. (see Lecture Exercise 2.6)

However, it is still a weak acid (\(K_{\mathrm{a}}\) of NH4= 5.56 \(\times\) 10-10 mol dm\({}^{-3}\)). Hence a reversible arrow is used in the salt hydrolysis equation.

The anion CF derived from strong acid HCI is a weaker base than water and so does not hydrolyse.

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:16]

The pH of salt solutions can be calculated using the following general strategy:

1. Determine whether the ions in the salt undergoes hydrolysis in water by considering the strength of acid and base from which the salt is derived
2. Write an equation for any hydrolysis that takes place in water to produce H\({}_{3}\)O\({}^{+}\) or OH ions.
3. Calculate [H\({}_{3}\)O\({}^{+}\)] or [OH\({}^{+}\)] using the \(K_{\rm s}\) or \(K_{\rm b}\) of the ion that undergoes hydrolysis in water.

**Lecture Exercise 3.2**

Calculate the pH of a 0.10 mol dm\({}^{-3}\) CH\({}_{3}\)CO\({}_{2}\) Na\({}^{*}\)(aq) at 25\({}^{\circ}\)C.

#### 4.2.2 Mixing a weak base and its conjugate acid

Consider a buffer consisting of a weak base, aqueous NH\({}_{3}\) and its conjugate acid, NH\({}_{4}^{+}\) ions

Ammonia is a weak base and dissociates partially.

In a similar explanation to Section 4.2.1, the solution now contains a large reservoir of un-ionised ammonia and a large reservoir of ammonium ions from the ammonium chloride, and can act as a buffer solution.

Note: Buffer solutions with pH < 7 (at 25 \({}^{\circ}\)C) may be referred to as 'acidic buffers while buffer solutions with pH > 7 (at 25 \({}^{\circ}\)C) may be referred to as 'alkaline' buffers.

#### 4.2.3 Partial neutralisation of a weak acid (or weak base)

Another way to prepare a buffer is to form one of the species by _partial neutralisation_ of the other species. For example, the ethanoic acid/ethanoate buffer can be prepared by mixing suitable amounts of ethanoic acid and NaOH. The key is to add less NaOH than is required for complete neutralisation, such that the OH\({}^{+}\) ions will react with part of the total ethanoic acid present to produce the ethanoate ions needed, at the same time leaving some ethanoic acid behind, to give a mixture consisting of _both_ ethanoic acid and ethanoate ions.

This method is based on the same chemical process that occurs when a weak acid is titrated with a strong base (see Section 5.1.2) or when a weak base is titrated with a strong acid (see Section 5.1.3).

Using the concepts in this chapter, you may be asked to plan experiments involving acid-base equilibria. Some examples are as follows.

1. Determination of pKa of a weak acid or pK of a weak base. (See 2013, HCI JC2 BT2 Paper 2C1 in "Examples of Acid-Base Equilibria Planning Ons" in Moodle)
2. Preparation of a specific buffer for a particular purpose. (See 2011 -HClJC2 BT2 Paper 2C1 in "Examples of Acid-Base Equilibria Planning Ons" in Moodle)

Acidity of organic acids and phenols as well as basicity of amines will be covered under organic carboxylic acids, phenols and amines. The charges in an amino acid is also related to pH of solution. Salt hydrolysis due to high charge density of cations will be covered in the chapters on Transition Elements and Periodicity.
