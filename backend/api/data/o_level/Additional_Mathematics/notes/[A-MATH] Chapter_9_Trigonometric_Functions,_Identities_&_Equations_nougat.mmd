Take Note

1. Always check your equations and see if they can be solved quadratically
2. Before solving for the angle, always find the basic angle by taking the inverse of the trigonometric function
* if the value is negative, always take the positive of that value
3. Always draw out the ASTC diagram, to help you visualize which quadrants are needed in the calculations
4. Always check for the range of the question, and include all possible angles
* includes extra positive rotation

Includes negative rotations (if necessary)
