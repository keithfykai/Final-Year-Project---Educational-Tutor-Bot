### Introduction

_Kinematics_ (from Greek xviev, _kinein_, to move) is the branch of mechanics that describes the motion of objects without consideration of the causes leading to the motion. The study of why objects move falls under the branch of _Dynamics_. The first part of this chapter deals with one-dimensional motion of moving bodies in rectilinear motion.

### Terminology

#### 2.1.1 Distance vs. Displacement

**Distance.**_X_

**Distance** is the total length travelled by a moving object irrespective of the direction of motion.

**Displacement.**_s_

The **displacement** of an object from a reference point O is the **linear distance** and **direction** of the object from O. The **linear distance** refers to the shortest distance from the **initial** to the **final position** of an object moved from one place to another.

Note that distance is a **scalar** quantity whereas displacement is a **vector1** quantity.

Footnote 1: Generally, scalar quantities in textbooks are italicised and non-bold, e.g. x, while vector quantities in textbooks are either represented by an arrow above the quantity, a twiddle (-) below the quantity or italicised and bold, e.g. \(\widetilde{\textbf{A}}\), \(a\), or simply \(A\).

For illustration, in the diagram below, an object travels from point O to point P along the path represented by the solid line. The distance travelled is represented by the length of the solid line. The displacement is represented by the **length and direction** of the dashed line.

#### 2.1.2 Speed vs. Velocity

**Speed.**_y_

The speed of an object is defined as the **rate of change of distance** travelled by an object with respect to **time**.

**Velocity.**_y_

The velocity of an object is its **rate of change of displacement** with respect to **time**.

**Example 2**

John drove a car from his home towards the traffic junction. As the traffic light turned red, he stopped and waited for his turn. He then made a U-turn and drove to a supermarket to buy some groceries. John drove back to his home after making the stop at the supermarket. The journey is illustrated in the figure below, where points A, B, C, D and E are located along his journey.

**Example 3**

The reference line passes through John's home, and displacement **to the right** of it is defined as positive. Indicate the sign for John's displacement, velocity and acceleration at A, B, C, D and E.

**Example 4**

The reference line passes through John's home, and displacement **to the right** of it is defined as positive. Indicate the sign for John's displacement, velocity and acceleration at A, B, C, D and E.

### Describing Rectilinear Motion using Diagrams

#### 2.2.1 Ticker tape diagrams

A common way of analyzing the motion of objects in physics labs is to perform a ticker tape analysis. A long tape is attached to a moving object and threaded through a device that places a tick upon the tape at regular intervals of time - say every 0.1 second. As the object moves, it drags the tape through the "ticker," thus leaving a trail of dots. The trail of dots provides a history of the object's motion and is therefore a representation of the object's motion.

The **distance between dots** on a ticker tape represents the object's position change during that time interval.

The analysis of a ticker tape diagram will also reveal if the object is moving with a constant velocity or undergoing acceleration.

Usually, ticker tape diagram reflects the time axis in the usual sense we understand it, meaning, the dots on the right were made at a later time. For example, in diagram (iv), the separation between dots increases to the right, indicating acceleration.

#### 2.2.2 Vector diagrams

Vector diagrams use vector arrows to depict the direction and relative magnitude of a vector quantity. Vector diagrams can be used to describe the velocity of a moving object during its motion. For example, the velocity of a car moving down the road could be represented by a vector diagram. In a vector diagram, the **magnitude** of the vector is represented by the length of the **vector** arrow.

#### 2.2.3 Recording motion using stroboscope

#### 2.2.4 Multi-flash photo of a bouncing soccer ball

_Multi-flash photographs or stroboscopic photographs_ are photographs of a subject illuminated with a flashing light, taken by a camera with an open shutter. By keeping the subject in the dark and then illuminating the subject only at certain times, the resultant image will show a series of different positions of the subject.

Today, by using digital video camera and digital image compositing, a multi-flash photograph can be easily re-constructed from several video frames. The video camera enables us to record motion conveniently, even at high speed. A single video camera captures 2-dimensional motion on a plane parallel to the image plane of the camera. To record complex 3-dimensional motion, many video cameras are used. This technique is useful for sports biomechanical analysis and character analysis in animated film production.

### 2.3 Describing Rectilinear Motion using Graphs

#### Displacement vs. Time Graph (s-t graph)

On an **s-t** graph,

The **instantaneous velocity** is the **slope** (or **gradient**) of the **tangent line** at a given **instant** of time.

The **instantaneous velocity** is the **slope** of the **straight line connecting two points** corresponding to a given time.

- Average velocity is the **slope** of the **straight line connecting two points** corresponding to a given time **interval**.

- If an object moves with **constant** velocity, its **s-t** graph will be a **straight** line graph, and the instantaneous velocity at any instant is equal to the average velocity over the entire time interval.

#### Velocity vs. Time Graph (v-t graph)

On a **v-t** graph,

The **instantaneous acceleration** is the **slope** (or **gradient**) of the **tangent line** at a given instant of time.

- Average acceleration is the **slope** of the **straight line connecting two points** corresponding to a given time **interval**.

- If an object moves with **constant** acceleration, its **v-t** graph will be a **straight** line graph, and the instantaneous acceleration at any instant is equal to the average acceleration over the entire time interval.

The **area under a \(\nu\)-\(t\) graph** for a time interval of \(\Delta t\) gives the **change in displacement** of the object in that time interval.

#### Summary of relations among \(s\)-\(t\), \(\nu\)-\(t\) and \(a\)-\(t\) graphs

What is the expression of the change in displacement, \(\Delta s\), of the object from \(t\) to \(t\)? If you need to find distance travelled by the object in the same time interval, what would be your answer in terms of A, B and C?

**Example 4**

A student throws a ball vertically upwards at a speed of 20 m s-t from level A. Neglect air resistance.

**(a)**: Sketch the **s** - \(t\), **v** - \(t\) and **a** - \(t\) graphs from the moment the ball is thrown to the moment it returns to the student's hand.
**(b)**: Calculate the time it takes for the ball to return to the student's hand. [Ans: 4.1 s]

### Describing Rectilinear Motion using Equations (for uniform acceleration)

#### 2.4.1 Derivation of the Equations of Motion (for uniform acceleration)

In this section, we will analyse the motion for an object moving in a straight line with **uniform acceleration** and derive equations that could be used for similar motions with uniform acceleration.

Suppose at time = 0, the object is at point O with an initial velocity of \(u\). The object moves at uniform acceleration of \(a\) until time = \(t\), and has travelled through a displacement of \(s\) to arrive at point A with the final velocity of \(v\).

Let us look at its velocity-time graph:

Note: acceleration of object, \(a\) is given by the gradient of its \(v\) - \(t\) graph,

\[a=\frac{v-u}{t}\]

\[v=u+a\ t\]

Note: The displacement of object from point O, \(s\), is given by the area under its \(v\) - \(t\) graph from time = \(0\) to time = \(t\),

\[s=\frac{1}{2}\left(u+v\right)t\]

Substitute Eqn (1) into (2), we have

\[s=\frac{1}{2}\left[u+\left(u+a\ t\right)\right]t\]

\[s=u\ t+\frac{1}{2}\ a\ t^{2}\]

From Eqn (1), we have

\[t=\frac{v-u}{a}\ \ \text{ and substitute into Eqn (2), we have}\]

\[s=\frac{1}{2}\left(u+v\right)\left(\frac{v-u}{a}\right)\]

\[\Rightarrow\]

\[\nu^{2}=u^{2}+2\ a\ s\]

**Note:**

* The equation \(s=u\ t+\frac{1}{2}\ a\ t^{2}\) sets the reference point \(s=0\) at \(t=0\).
* The "boxed" equations can only be used if **the acceleration is constant**.
* The equations are **vector equations.** Therefore, variables have to be analysed along the same dimension. For example, if we choose to analyse the motion along the \(x\)-direction, then we can only use quantities like \(u_{x}\)\(v_{x}\) and \(a_{x}\). Acceleration along the \(y\)-direction \(a_{y}\) will not affect motion along the \(x\)-direction.

**Tips**

**Solving Rectilinear Motion Problems:**

In solving problems involving rectilinear (one-dimensional) motion, follow the following steps:

* 'from rest'/dropped' means initial speed, \(u=0\) -'stop' means final speed, \(\nu=0\) -'maximum height' means \(\nu\) at maximum height = 0
* Assign a positive direction and ensure the correct signs for vectors.
* Select and apply the relevant kinematics equations of motion.

**Example 5**

A motorist traveling at 13 m s-1 approaches traffic lights, which turn red when he is 25 m away from the stop line. His reaction time is 0.70 s. If he brakes fully such that the car slows down at a rate of 4.5 m s-2,

On which side of the stop line will he stop, and how far from the stop line would he stop?

[Ans: Beyond the stop line, 2.9m]

### Free-Falling Bodies

The simplest example of motion with constant acceleration is a free falling body.

**A free falling object is any object moving only under the influence of gravity, i.e. the effects of resistive forces (i.e. drag forces) and upthrust are negligible.** For free falling objects, whether they are initially thrown upward, downward or released from rest, they will accelerate downwards at a rate of **9.81 m s\({}^{2}\)**, regardless of the objects' weight, size and shape. Let us illustrate this below.

Consider a mass \(m\) under free falling. Since air resistance is negligible, the only force acting on the mass is its own weight. Applying Newton's 2\({}^{\text{nd}}\) Law,

\[F_{net} =ma\] \[mg =ma\] \[a =g\]

In essence, even though a larger mass experiences a larger gravitational force, its larger inertia also makes it harder to accelerate. These two effects cancel out cleanly. This curious coincidence causes a feather to fall at the same rate as a lead ball.

For a video explanation:

Acceleration of free fall by xmphysics

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT17C0zgn2c](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT17C0zgn2c)

**Example 6**

The following are 2 cases of objects in motion.

**Case 1:** A box of mass \(M\), sliding down a smooth incline.

Assume that air resistance is negligible.

**Case 2:** A feather of mass \(m\), falling in vacuum.

Assume that air resistance is negligible.

**(a)** Determine the acceleration of the box and the feather.

**(b)** Explain whether the cases are in free fall.

**(c)** Explain if the equations of motion can be applied to each case.

### Viscous Drag Force

In fluid dynamics, drag (or fluid resistance) refers to forces that oppose the relative motion of an object through a fluid (a liquid or gas). When a body moves through a fluid, it has to push the surrounding fluid molecules away in order to move. Hence it exerts a force on the fluid molecules and by Newton's Third Law, the molecules exert an equal and opposite force back on the body. Hence there is resistance to motion.

It follows that drag force depends on the **velocity** of the body, _i.e._ the faster the motion of the body through the fluid, the larger the resistance. It also means that if the body is at rest relative to the fluid, there is no resistance.

Other factors affecting the magnitude of drag force include the **shape** and **dimension** of the body (a more streamline shape allows a body to experience less drag as it pushes through the fluid) and the type of fluid (**viscosity** of the fluid).

When there is no turbulent flow (_e.g._ small and streamline objects traveling at low speeds) the drag force is proportional to the speed of the object. The magnitude of drag force can be stated empirically as follows:

\(F_{D}=k\nu\)

\(F_{D}\) : magnitude of drag force

\(k\) : a constant that depends on the dimensions of the body and the type of fluid

\(\nu\) : the velocity of the body relative to the fluidIf the fluid flow is turbulent (e.g. objects moving at high speeds through air, such as aircraft, skydiver and baseball), the drag force is approximately proportional to the square of the speed. The drag force is then given by:

\(F_{D}=k\nu^{2}\)

\(F_{D}\) : magnitude of drag force

\(k\) : a constant that depends on the dimensions of the body and the type of fluid

\(\nu\) : the velocity of the body relative to the fluid

### Non Free-Falling Bodies

In practice, free fall does not happen because of resistive forces. The effects on a diver or bungee jumper may not be significant, but this is clearly not the case for a parachutist where air resistance is (deliberately) used to limit the maximum downward velocity of the parachutist.

#### 2.7.1 Velocity-time graph of object falling through air

Let us now consider the motion of an object, dropped from rest, falling through air. If air resistance is not negligible, the forces acting on the object are:

\(W\) : Weight of object

\(F_{D}\) : Drag force

For ease of analysis, break the motion up into stages as seen below. Let us assume that drag force is proportional to speed.

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:19]

#### 2.7.2 Terminal Velocity

We can now explain why heavier objects fall at a faster rate than light ones in the presence of air resistance. For simplicity, let us assume air resistance is proportional to speed \(\nu\), _i.e._\(F_{D}=k\nu\).

Consider the free body diagram of an object falling at terminal velocity,

At terminal velocity, the acceleration is zero and so the net force is zero. Hence,

\[F_{D}=W\]

Assuming air resistance is proportional to speed, therefore \(F_{D}=k\nu_{t}\)

\[k\nu_{t} =mg\] \[\nu_{t} =\frac{mg}{k}\]

Based on this equation, we can now conclude:

1. Between two objects of the same dimensions but different densities, the denser one reaches a higher terminal velocity because it has a larger \(m\) but the same \(k\).
2. Between two objects of the same mass but different shapes, the more streamlined one reaches a higher terminal velocity because it has a smaller \(k\) but the same \(m\).

For a video explanation:

Terminal velocity by xmphysics

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuS98lyEzzq](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuS98lyEzzq)

**Example 7**

A steel ball bearing is released from a height above a deep pool of oil and it reaches a terminal velocity in the oil. Sketch the graph to show the variation of the velocity \(\mathbf{\nu}\) of the ball bearing against time \(t\) when the ball enters the oil the drag force acting on the ball is

**(a)**: smaller than the weight of ball (Case A)
**(b)**: larger than the weight of ball (Case B)

Indicate clearly on your diagram, \(t_{t}\), the time when the ball bearing hits the oil. Assume that upthrust is negligible.

### Two-Dimensional Kinematics

In this part of the chapter, we deal with the kinematics of a particle moving in a plane, or two-dimensional motion. Some common examples of motion in a plane are the motion of projectiles, motion of satellites and the motion of charged particles in an electric field. For the beginning we shall deal with the special case of motion of **an object with a uniform velocity in one direction and a uniform acceleration in a perpendicular direction.**

#### 2.8.1 Projectile Motion

Anyone who has observed a soccer ball in motion (or, for that matter, any object thrown into air) has observed _projectile motion_.

**Projectile motion** refers to the motion of an object in the presence of a gravitational field. In this section, we are interested in the motion of an object projected with an initial velocity at an angle to the horizontal. To analyze this type of motion, we will start with an idealized model. The assumptions made in our idealized model are:

1. the effect of air resistance is negligible.
2. the acceleration due to gravity \(\boldsymbol{g}\)_is constant4_, _acts downwards_ and has a _magnitude equal to_\(g=9.81\ m\ s^{2}\). Footnote 4: We shall restrict ourselves to objects whose distance travelled and maximum height above the Earth are small compared to the Earth’s radius (6400 km) so that \(\boldsymbol{g}\) can be considered constant.

With the above assumptions, we find that the path of a projectile, which we call its _trajectory_, is always a parabola5.

Footnote 5: The proof that trajectory of a projectile is parabolic will be shown in Example 11.

* The path of the projectile is symmetrical about the highest point.
* The speed of the projectile is symmetrical about the highest point.
* The time it takes for the object to go from \(y=0\) to the highest point **is equal to** the time it takes for the object to go from the highest point to \(y=0\).

It was Galileo, who first accurately described projectile motion. He showed that it could be understood by analysing the horizontal and vertical components of the motion separately. He found that:

**The horizontal and vertical motions of the projectile are independent of each other.**To examine this idea further, let us examine the motion of 2 balls:

1. Ball 1 is a ball released from rest and allowed to fall vertically through a hole on the table, and
2. Ball 2 is allowed to roll off the end of a table with an initial velocity \(\mathbf{u}_{\mathbf{x}}\) in the horizontal (\(\mathbf{x}\)) direction.

Both the balls leave the table at the same time. The stroboscopic photograph below depicts the motion of both balls. Let us examine the vertical and horizontal motion separately.

\(\circ\) **Vertical Motion:**

Consider the motion of both balls in the vertical direction.

Note,

The **vertical displacement of Ball 2 matches the vertical displacement of Ball 1**.

The **vertical displacement and vertical velocity** of Ball 2 are only affected by the vertical acceleration \(\mathbf{g}\) (as in Ball 1).

\(\circ\) **Horizontal Motion:**

Consider the motion of Ball 2. Note that

The **horizontal displacements** made by the ball at equal intervals of time are approximately the same.

The **horizontal velocity remains constant** with time.

The **horizontal acceleration is zero**.

Consistent with our assumption that only the weight acts on Ball 2 and no other forces act in the horizontal direction. Hence, horizontal acceleration is zero.

The **vertical acceleration hence has no effect on the horizontal velocity and horizontal displacements.**

Hence, we see that horizontal and vertical motions are **independent** of each other and projectile motion can be simplified by analysing the vertical and horizontal motions separately. Another result of this analysis, which Galileo himself predicted, is that _an object projected horizontally will reach the ground in the same time as an object dropped vertically_. This is because the vertical motions are the same in both cases.

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:24]

From the above equations, we can easily use them to obtain other information of the projectile, like:

* **Maximum Height:** Maximum vertical displacement with respect to the initial starting point (vertical velocity, \(\mathbf{v_{y}}\) = 0 m s\({}^{\text{-1}}\)).
* **Horizontal Range:** Maximum horizontal displacement with respect to the initial starting point.
* **Angle of Projection for Maximum Horizontal Range.**
* **Equation of the trajectory of the projectile (see Example 13(v)).**

## 111 **Solving Projectile Motion Problems:**

In solving problems involving projectile motion, follow the following procedures:

1. _Read_ the question carefully.
2. _Draw_ a careful diagram summarising the given information.
3. Choose an _x-y_ coordinate system.
4. Identify the accelerations in the \(x\) and \(y\) directions.
5. If you are given the initial velocity, you may want to resolve it into its \(x\) and \(y\) components.
6. Analyse the horizontal and vertical motion separately.
7. Apply the relevant equations. Remember to take sign conventions into consideration.

We shall now work through several examples of projectile motion to familiarize ourselves with the strategy and the application of the equations.

## 11 Example 8

A long-jumper leaves the ground at an angle of 20\({}^{\text{o}}\) to the horizontal and at a speed of 11 m s\({}^{\text{-1}}\).

**(a)**: How far does he jump? [Ans: 7.93 m]
**(b)**: What is his maximum height reached? [Ans: 0.72 m]

**Example 9**

A stone is thrown from the top of a building upward at an angle of 30\({}^{\circ}\) to the horizontal with an initial speed of 20 m s-1. If the height of the building is 45 m,

**(a)**: How long is the stone in flight? [Ans: 4.22 s]
**(b)**: What is the speed of the stone just before it strikes the ground? [Ans: 35.9 m s-1]

**Example 10**

An Alaskan rescue plane drops a package of emergency rations to a stranded party of explorers, as shown in the figure below. The plane is travelling horizontally at 40.0 m s-1 and is 100 m above a point O on the ground.
**(a)**: Determine how far from the point O does the package strike the ground. [Ans: 181 m]
**(b)**: Determine the position of the package relative to the airplane when it strikes the ground.

Consider a projectile projected with an initial velocity \(\mathbf{u}\) at an angle above the horizontal, diagram above. Assuming that air resistance is negligible and the acceleration of free fall \(\mathbf{g}\) remains constant, derive using the equations of motion expressions of:

**(a)**: maximum height \(H\) reached by the projectile,
**(b)**: duration of time of flight \(t_{light_{t}}\)
**(c)**: horizontal range \(R\),
**(d)**: optimal angle of projection \(\theta_{\max}\) (for maximum range),
**(e)**: equation of the trajectory of the projectile.

Adopt the sign conventions as given in the diagram above.

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:28]

**Example 12**

A boy aims his slingshot directly at an apple hanging in a tree. At the moment he **shoots** a pebble, the apple **drops**.

The initial speed of the pebble is 25 m s-1. The position of the apple is 5.0 m above the horizontal level, (\(h=5.0\) m). The pebble hits the apple 0.50 s later.

**(a)**: Determine the angle at which the boy must aim his slingshot towards the apple. [Ans: 24\({}^{*}\)]
**(b)**: Find the horizontal distance \(D\). [Ans: 11.4 m]

#### 2.8.3 2D Motion with Air Resistance

Consider an object projected above the horizontal with an initial speed of \(u\) and at angle of \(\theta\) with respect to the horizontal.

Suppose that the air resistance experienced by the projectile is not negligible. Then **throughout the motion, the projectile will experience a drag force in opposite direction to its motion** (velocity). Let us further analyse the horizontal motion and vertical motion independently,

\begin{tabular}{l l} \multicolumn{2}{l}{**Horizontally,**} \\ \hline draw force(s) acting on the projectile & The drag force acts in (the same/opposite) direction to the horizontal velocity. \\ \multicolumn{2}{l}{\(\Rightarrow\) The horizontal velocity (increases/decreases/remains the same) with time.} \\ \multicolumn{2}{l}{\(\Rightarrow\) The **horizontal range is reduced** (as compared with the case if no air resistance present).} \\ \end{tabular}

**Vertically,**

\begin{tabular}{|p{142.3pt}|p{142.3pt}|} \hline On its flight up, draw force(s) acting on the projectile & On its flight down, draw force(s) acting on the projectile \\ \hline The drag force acts in (the same/opposite) direction as the weight _mg._ & The magnitude of the net acceleration is (less/more) than _g._ \\ \(\Rightarrow\) **Maximum height reached** is lower than if there were no air resistance present. & The drag force acts in (the same/opposite) direction to the weight _mg._ \\ The magnitude of the net acceleration is (less/more) than _g._ & The magnitude of the net acceleration is (less/more) than _g._ \\ \(\Rightarrow\) **Maximum height reached** is lower than if there were no air resistance present. & The final (vertical) speed \(\nu_{y}\) will be (smaller/larger) than the initial (vertical) speed \(\nu_{y}\) (at the point of projection). \\ \(\Rightarrow\) **The average (vertical) speed upwards is (smaller/larger) than the average (vertical) speed downwards.** & The average (vertical) speed downwards. \\ Since, distance travelled up = distance to come down & Since, distance travelled up = distance to come down \\ and Average speed = Total distance / Time taken & \(\Rightarrow\) **The time taken to travel up is shorter than the time taken to travel down.** \\ \(\Rightarrow\) **The time taken to travel up is shorter than the time taken to travel down.** & Furthermore, comparing the vertical motion of the projectile on its flight up and on its flight down, we see that:

\(\circ\) The (vertical) acceleration experienced by the projectile when it is going up is different from the (vertical) acceleration experienced by the projectile when it is coming down. (\(\alpha_{\nu,\up}\neq\ \alpha_{y,down}\)) \\ \(\circ\) For a particular height, the speed of the projectile when it is going up is also different for the speed of the projectile when it is coming down. & Hence, we can see that the **path of the projectile will not be symmetrical about the highest point**, _i.e._ the path is asymmetrical about the highest point. \\ \end{tabular}

**In summary,**

\begin{tabular}{|p{142.3pt}|p{142.3pt}|} \hline The key characteristics of a projectile motion with air resistance (compared to if air resistance is negligible) are: \\ 1. Horizontal range is shorter. \\ 2. Maximum height is lower. \\ 3. The time taken to reach maximum height must be shorter than the time taken to return to the starting point. \\ 4. Path is asymmetrical about a vertical line through its highest point. \\ \end{tabular}

## Further Readings and References

### Appendix I : Understanding the Calculus Notations

Although rigorous treatment with calculus is not required in the A-level syllabus, it is however useful for us to understand the physical significance of some of the calculus notations as they are commonly used to define physical quantities.

### The Derivative : \(\dfrac{d\psi}{dx}\)

Consider a graph of \(y\) vs. \(x\) as indicated by the curve in Figure 1. \(\dfrac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}\) indicates the gradient of the line joining the 2 points A and B on the line.

Figure 2 shows that if we move point B closer towards point A, eventually the 2 points will meet. At this point gradient of the line AB will be exactly equal to the gradient of the tangent of the curve at A. (as represented by the bold straight line). Mathematically, we say:

\[\lim_{xx\to 0}\dfrac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}=\dfrac{d\psi}{dx}=\text{gradient of the tangent of the $y-x$ graph}\]

This physical interpretation is very important in physics as many physical quantities are expressed in this derivative form.

For example, in our study of kinematics, we have :

Velocity, \(\nu\) = Rate of change of displacement with respect to time

\[=\dfrac{ds}{dt}\] \[=\text{Gradient of tangent of the $s$ -$ $t$ graph}\]

and

Acceleration, \(a\) = Rate of change of velocity with respect to time

\[=\dfrac{d\nu}{dt}\] \[=\text{Gradient of the tangent of the $\nu$ -$ $t$ graph}\]

Figure 2: Tangent of the curve at A.

### The Integral: \(\int y\ dx\)

The reverse process to taking the derivative is referred to either as _integration_ or finding the _anti-derivative_. Graphically, it is equivalent to finding the area under the curve. Let us see why.

Consider a \(y\)-\(x\) graph as shown in Figure 3. Suppose we wish to find the area under the graph from some initial \(x\) value, \(x_{\text{initial}}\) to some final \(x\) value, \(x_{\text{final}}\). One way to do so is break the area up into \(n\) number of small rectangles each of some area, \(A_{i}\).

Hence, the area of each small rectangle can be written as: \(A_{i}=y_{i}\Delta x\) and the total area under the curve can be estimated by summing the area of all these little rectangles, i.e.

\[\text{Total area, }A=\sum_{i=1}^{n}y_{i}\Delta x\]

where the symbol \(\sum\) (upper case Greek sigma) signifies a sum over all terms, i.e. over all values of \(i\).

For the approximation of the area to be even better, we can try to divide the area into smaller and smaller rectangles, by decrease the interval \(\Delta x\), i.e. we say that we let \(\Delta x\to 0\). Therefore,

\[A=\lim_{\Delta x\to 0}\sum_{i=1}^{n}y_{i}\Delta x\]

This is also written as \(\int\limits_{x_{\text{final}}}^{x_{\text{final}}}y(x)\ dx\). So, \(\int\limits_{x_{\text{final}}}^{x_{\text{final}}}y(x)\ dx\) is the area under the \(y\)-\(x\) graph.

Figure 3: Finding the area under a curve. The area of the shaded rectangle is equal to the product of the width of the rectangle \(\Delta x\) and the \(y\) value of the curve at the particular \(x\), \(y_{i}\).

We now use the defining equations for acceleration and velocity to illustrate the use of the above concept.

The defining equation for acceleration of an object is \(\ a=\frac{\mathrm{d}\nu}{dt}\)

Therefore, the change in velocity of an object is

\[\nu_{\text{traul}}-\nu_{\text{traul}}=\int_{t_{\text{traul}}}^{t_{\text{traul}}} \alpha(t)\ dt\]

which is the area under a-t graph.

Similarly, velocity of an object is \(\nu=\frac{ds}{dt}\)

Rearranging the equation, we also have the change in displacement of an object given as

\[s_{\text{traul}}-s_{\text{traul}}=\int_{t_{\text{traul}}}^{t_{\text{traul}}}\nu(t )\ dt\]

which is the area under \(\nu\)-t graph.
