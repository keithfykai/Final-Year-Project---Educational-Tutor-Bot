## Electronic Cell

An electrolytic cell is the set-up used for electrolysis.

**Electrolyte** is the ionic compound, either in its molten or aqueous state, that would dissociate into ions when a current is passed through it.

**Electrodes** are made of a conductive material. For inert electrodes, it is usually made of lead or platinum.

**Anode** is the positively-charged electrode that is connected to the positive terminal of the electrical source.

(Anode is positively charged **&****attracts anions**, hence its called 'anode'.)

**Cathode** is the negatively-charged electrode that is connected to the negative terminal of the electrical source.

(Cathode is negatively charged **&****attracts cations**, hence its called 'anode'.)

**Battery/power source** causes electrons to always flow from the anode to the cathode.

(For those who take physics, under 'electricity', recall that electron flow is from the negative terminal to the positive terminal of the battery.)

## 3 variations

All 3 variations of electrolytic cell follows the same concept you have learnt in the previous 2 slides.

Let's run through how the concept applies and what's the difference between the 3 set-ups.

## 5 Case of Discharge

Before we move on to the electrolysis of dilute aqueous solution, we need to understand ease of discharge.

As there are usually the presence of 2 cations and 2 anions in a dilute aqueous solution, ease of discharge helps us **identity which cation & anion gets selectively discharged.**

**For cations, the less reactive is it on the reactivity series, the more easily it can get discharged.**

**For anions, OH:** **is the easiest to discharge, followed by halogens, then the common anions.**

_(Group VI, reactivity decreases down the group. The less reactive, the more easily it will get discharged.)_

However, when it is a concentrated solution/the solution becomes concentrated, **concentration effect** will result in the **halogens** to be preferentially discharged over OH- ions.

***Quick tip: For a normal aqueous ionic compound (excluding copper), H+ & OH is usually the ones who get discharged.**

Simple Electric cells

Electric cells uses **chemical energy to produce electricity**, unlike electrolysis, which uses electricity to cause chemical changes.

A simple, typical electric cell contains **two different electrodes** placed in an electrolyte/fe.

_More reactive metal (Zinc)_

The more reactive metal gives up electrons more readily and is the negative electrode. The metal is **oxidised** here, hence this is the **anode**.

**Zn (s) 2n\({}^{+}\) (aq) + 2e\({}^{+}\)**

**Less reactive metal (Copper)**

The less reactive metal would be the positive electrode. As **reduction** occurs here, this is the **cathode**.

**2H\({}^{+}\) (aq) + 2e\({}^{+}\) H\({}_{2}\) (g)**

**Overall**

The more reactive metal's electrons would flow to the less reactive metal. The voltmeter will detect a **potential difference** between the two metals. (_electricity produced_)

The **further apart** the two metals are in the reactivity series, the **greater the voltage** shown on the voltmeter or the brighter the light bulb.

* 19 The diagram shows a cell.

Which statement about the cell is correct? (N2020/P1/Q13)

A Electrons pass from the magnesium electrode to the silver electrode through the electrolyte.

B The cell shows that silver is more reactive than magnesium.

C The magnesium electrode loses electrons.

D The silver electrode is oxidised. ( )

Answer:

19. **C**

The more reactive metal loses electrons.
