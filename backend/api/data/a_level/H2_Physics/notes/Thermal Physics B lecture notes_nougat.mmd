## Introduction

Now that we have dealt with how we perceive heat and thermal energy at a macroscopic level, let us deal with how heat manifests at a microscopic level. In this set of lecture notes, we'll be dealing with the kinetic theory of matter, and thermodynamics.

### Kinetic Theory

#### The Kinetic Model of Matter

_Learning Outcome_

_(a) show an understanding that internal energy is determined by the state of the system and that it can be expressed as the sum of a random distribution of kinetic and potential energies associated with the molecules of a system._

The kinetic model of matter refers to the theory that attempts to explain the macroscopic behaviour of matter in terms of their microscopic properties. Key to this model is the simple assumption that **all matter is made of atoms/molecules**.

Any atom in a substance possesses two different kinds of energies, that being kinetic, and potential energy.

Random kinetic energy refers to the energy associated with how fast the particle is moving in the frame of the object. **The average random kinetic energy of all atoms in a substance is associated with an object's temperature.** If a substance has experienced an increase in temperature, we know that on average, the particles are moving faster.

Note:

The random kinetic energy of the particle must be contrasted with the bulk translational kinetic energy. The bulk translational kinetic energy refers to the energy that is associated to motion of the entire object in the lab reference frame.

Potential energy refers to the energy associated with the intermolecular forces of attraction. **The potential energy is associated with the phase of a substance, and how far apart the atoms are in the substance.** If a substance has increased its potential energy, we know that the intermolecular spacing between particles has increased, and/or a change of phase (from solid to liquid or from liquid to gas) has taken place.

Note:

The value of potential energy is a negative value. This is because energy has to be supplied to the atoms in order to free them from the influence of the other atoms. If for example, the potential energy of a particular atom is -5 J, this means that 5 J has to be supplied in order to free it from the force of attraction due to the other atoms. A potential energy of 0 J implies that the atom is completely free.

**The internal energy of a substance** is the sum of kinetic energy due to the random motion of all particles, and the potential energy due to the intermolecular forces of attraction.

\(\mathsf{U=KE_{total}+PE_{total}}\)

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:6]

iii. Cooling effect accompanies evaporation.

Solution

The molecules of a liquid have varying kinetic energies.

* The most energetic molecules at the surface obtain energy from the environment (through collision with air particles, or radiant sunlight)
* These molecules thus obtain enough energy to break free of the intermolecular bonds of attraction and leave the system.
* As the most energetic molecules are leaving the system, the average kinetic energy of the system decreases.
* This causes the temperature of the system to fall.
* Heat is drawn from the external environment and cooling effect accompanies.

#### Kinetic Theory of Gases

The kinetic theory of gases makes several assumptions.

(a) A gas consists of particles called atoms/molecules.

(b) The total number of molecules is very large.

(c) The molecules are in constant, random motion and obey Newton's laws of motion.

(d) The pressure on the container is the result of collisions with the walls as the molecules strike and rebound.

For gases, four macroscopic variables are of utmost importance. They are, namely,

1. Amount of gas (number of molecules/moles)
2. Volume
3. Pressure
4. Temperature

We shall collectively refer to these four as the "state variables" of the gas. From now on, whenever we talk about the "state" of a gas, we are really talking about these four quantities. With knowledge of the state variables, we are also able to determine the internal energy of the system. You would do well to remember the following statement.

The internal energy of a substance is a function of its state.

#### Gas Laws and The Equation of State Learning outcomes:

_(e) recall and use the ideal gas equation \(pV=nRT\), where \(n\) is the amount of gas in moles._

_(f) show an understanding of the significance of the Avogadro constant as the number of atoms in 0.012 kg of carbon-12._

_(g) use molar quantities where one mole of any substance is the amount containing a number of particles equal to the Avogadro constant._

When the pressure of gas in a container is sufficiently low and temperature sufficiently high, the state variables are found to obey three simple laws. They are, respectively,

Note: _Temperature must be in Kelvins_

Putting all three together, we get what we call the **equation of state of an ideal gas**.

Where \(n\) represents the amount of gas in moles and R is known as the molar gas constant.

If instead, we choose to work with the number of molecules instead, we ought to use the form

where \(N\) represents the amount of gas in terms of the number of atoms/molecules and \(k\) is known as the Boltzmann's constant.

Dunman High School (Senior High Physics Department)

From Junior High chemistry, let us recall the definition of a mole.

One mole is the amount of substance that contains the same number of particles equal to the Avogadro's constant.

Let's look at the mathematical relationship between \(n\) and \(N\).

N\({}_{A}\)n = N

N\({}_{A}\) is known as Avogadro's number, which is the number of atoms in 0.012kg of carbon-12. This is roughly 6.022x10\({}^{23}\) molecules. Basically think of 1 mole as just another way to say 6.022x10\({}^{23}\) molecules.

If we compare the two forms for the equation of state closely, we find that

nR = Nk

nR = N\({}_{A}\)nk

R = N\({}_{A}\)K

#### The Ideal Gas

An ideal gas is a hypothetical gas that obeys the equation of state of an ideal gas, PV=nRT, at all pressures, volumes and temperatures for the same amount of gas.

As such, the equation, PV=nRT, is also referred to as the **ideal gas law**. This hypothetical gas is assumed to have the following properties.

1. The volume of the molecules is a negligibly small fraction of the total volume occupied by the gas.
2. The intermolecular forces are negligible.
3. The collisions are elastic and are of negligible duration.
4. Between collisions, a molecule moves with uniform velocity.

1. Example 1: Find the volume occupied by one mole of an ideal gas at a temperature of 273 K and a pressure of 1.01 x 10\({}^{5}\) Pa.
2. Solution: \[\text{PV}=\text{nRT}\] \[\text{V}=\frac{\text{nRT}}{\text{P}}=\frac{1\times 8.31\times 273}{1.01 \times 10^{5}}=0.0225\text{ m}^{3}\] \[\text{V}=\frac{\text{nRT}}{\text{P}}=\frac{1\times 8.31\times 273}{1.01 \times 10^{5}}=0.0225\text{ m}^{3}\] \[\text{V}=\frac{\text{P}_{1}}{\text{P}_{2}}\text{V}_{1}=2.5\times 3 =7.5\text{ cm}^{3}\]
3. Example 2: A bubble at the bottom of the lake which has a depth of 15 m has a volume of 3 cm\({}^{3}\). What is the volume of the bubble at the top of the pond given that the hydrostatic pressure of water for every 10 m is 1 atm. Assume that the temperatures at the top and bottom of the pond are the same and that no air leaks out of the bubble.
4. Solution: \[\frac{\text{P}_{1}\text{V}_{1}}{\text{n}_{1}\text{T}_{1}}=\frac{\text{P}_{2} \text{V}_{2}}{\text{n}_{2}\text{T}_{2}}\] \[\text{P}_{1}\text{V}_{1}=\text{P}_{2}\text{V}_{2}\] \[\text{V}_{2}=\frac{\text{P}_{1}}{\text{P}_{2}}\text{V}_{1}=2.5\times 3 =7.5\text{ cm}^{3}\]
5. Example 3: A bubble at the bottom of the lake which has a depth of 15 m has a volume of 3 cm\({}^{3}\). What is the volume of the bubble at the top of the pond given that the hydrostatic pressure of water for every 10 m is 1 atm. Assume that the temperatures at the top and bottom of the pond are the same and that no air leaks out of the bubble.
6. Solution: \[\frac{\text{P}_{1}\text{V}_{1}}{\text{n}_{1}\text{T}_{1}}=\frac{\text{P}_{2} \text{V}_{2}}{\text{n}_{2}\text{T}_{2}}\] \[\text{P}_{1}\text{V}_{1}=\text{P}_{2}\text{V}_{2}\] \[\text{V}_{2}=\frac{\text{P}_{1}}{\text{P}_{2}}\text{V}_{1}=2.5\times 3 =7.5\text{ cm}^{3}\]

Example 5:

Two bulbs, X of volume 100 cm\({}^{3}\) and Y of volume 50 cm\({}^{3}\), are connected with a tube of negligible volume. A valve prevents gas to flow between the two bulbs. Initially bulb X is filled with an ideal gas at 10 \({}^{\circ}\)C to a pressure of 3x\(10^{5}\) Pa. Bulb Y is filled with the same ideal gas at 100 \({}^{\circ}\)C to a pressure of 1x\(10^{5}\) Pa. The valve is opened and the temperature of A and B are maintained at their initial temperatures. Determine the new equilibrium pressure of the system.

Solution:

Recognise that the final pressure, P\({}_{t}\), of both vessels must be the same. Furthermore, the total number of particles in vessel X and Y is conserved. Therefore,

\[\begin{array}{c}\vspace{0.2cm}n_{\rm X1}+n_{\rm Y1}=n_{\rm X2}+n_{\rm Y2}\\ \vspace{0.2cm}\frac{{\rm P_{X1}V_{X}}}{{\rm RT_{X}}}+\frac{{\rm P_{Y1}V_{Y}}}{{ \rm RT_{Y}}}=\frac{{\rm P_{H}V_{X}}}{{\rm RT_{X}}}+\frac{{\rm P_{H}V_{Y}}}{{\rm RT _{Y}}}\\ \vspace{0.2cm}{\rm P_{f}}=\frac{\left(\frac{{\rm P_{X1}V_{X}}}{{\rm T_{X}}}+ \frac{{\rm P_{Y1}V_{Y}}}{{\rm T_{Y}}}\right)}{\left(\frac{{\rm V_{X}}}{{\rm T_{ X}}}+\frac{{\rm V_{Y}}}{{\rm T_{Y}}}\right)}=2.45\times 10^{5}\,\rm{Pa}\\ \vspace{0.2cm}\end{array}\]

#### Internal Energy of an Ideal Gas

_Learning Outcome:_

_(b) relate a rise in temperature of a body to an increase in its internal energy._

_(i) recall and apply the relationship that the mean kinetic energy of a molecule of an ideal gas is proportional to the thermodynamic temperature to new situations or to solve related problems._

Assumption 2 implies that the molecules exert no forces of attraction or repulsion on each other until they collide. This implies that for an ideal gas,

\[\text{PE}=0\]

Therefore,

\[\text{U}_{\text{ideal gas}}=\text{KE}_{\text{total}}\]

Consider a box filled with an ideal gas containing N molecules. Remember that all particles are running around at different velocities.

9646 Physics

Topic 68: Thermal Physics (II) 68-14Let us focus on a single particle in the box which happens to be moving with a velocity \(\nu\) in some given direction. The velocity \(\nu\) may be resolved into 3 different components, \(\nu_{x}\), \(\nu_{y}\) and \(\nu_{z}\) For now, let us focus on just the x-component of the velocity. Thus, for the all intents and purposes, the particle is travelling along the x-axis.

Let us assume that the particle starts from one end of the box, collides with the surface and runs back to the other end. The time taken for the particle to do so is given by,

\[\Delta t=\frac{2L}{\nu_{x}}\]

The impulse delivered to the particle in that collision is thus,

\[\Delta p_{x}=p_{x,\text{ final}}-p_{x,\text{ initial}}=(\text{-mv}_{x}-mv_{x})= \text{-2mv}_{x}\]

However, by the conservation of momentum, the impulse delivered to the wall must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. Thus,

\[\Delta p_{wall}=2mv_{x}\]

The force experienced by the wall is thus

\[F=\frac{\Delta p_{wall}}{\Delta t}=2mv_{x}\div\frac{2L}{\nu_{x}}=\frac{mv_{x}^ {2}}{L}\]

The pressure exerted on the wall in that single collision is thus,

\[P=\frac{F}{A}=\frac{mv_{x}^{2}}{L\times L^{2}}=\frac{mv_{x}^{2}}{V}\]

Bringing the volume over, we obtain,

\[PV=mv_{x}^{2}\]Substituting the ideal gas equation where N = 1, and multiplying \(\gamma\) on both sides, we get,

\[\frac{1}{2}\mathrm{KT}=\frac{1}{2}\mathrm{mv}_{\mathrm{x}}^{2}=\mathrm{KE}_{ \mathrm{x}}\]

However, this is just the energy considering the molecule moves solely in the \(x\) direction. As the steps above may be repeated for the \(y\) and \(z\) directions, \(\mathrm{KE}_{\gamma}\)=\(\mathrm{KE}_{z}\)=\(\frac{3}{2}\mathrm{kT}\). The _KE_ for one molecule is thus,

\[\mathrm{KE}_{\mathrm{one~{}molecule}}=\frac{1}{2}\mathrm{mv}^{2}= \frac{1}{2}\mathrm{m}\big{(}\mathrm{v}_{\mathrm{x}}^{2}+\mathrm{v}_{\mathrm{y }}^{2}+\mathrm{v}_{\mathrm{z}}^{2}\big{)}=\frac{1}{2}\mathrm{mv}_{\mathrm{x}}^ {2}+\frac{1}{2}\mathrm{mv}_{\mathrm{y}}^{2}+\frac{1}{2}\mathrm{mv}_{\mathrm{z} }^{2}\] \[\mathrm{KE}_{\mathrm{x}}+\mathrm{KE}_{\mathrm{y}}+\mathrm{KE}_{ \mathrm{z}}=\frac{3}{2}\mathrm{kT}\]

As we make no distinction between the molecules. This is also the average _KE_. This relation shows that temperature is a measure of the average _KE_ of a gas.

The total _KE_ and thus the internal energy, \(U\), for a gas of \(N\) molecules is thus,

\[\boxed{\mathrm{KE}_{\mathrm{total}}=\mathrm{U}=\frac{3}{2}\mathrm{NKT}=\frac{3} {2}\mathrm{nRT}=\frac{3}{2}\mathrm{PV}}\]

It is important to realise from this equation that the internal energy of an ideal gas is related to its temperature. _For a constant amount of ideal gas, if there is no change in U, there will be no change in temperature. Conversely, no change in temperature implies no change in U._

#### Root Mean Square Velocities

From the previous section, we have determined for a gas of N particles,

\[\text{KE}_{\text{total}}=\frac{3}{2}\text{NkT}\]

Thus, the average kinetic energy per particle is given by,

\[\langle\text{KE}\rangle=\frac{\text{KE}_{\text{total}}}{\text{N}}=\frac{3}{2} \text{kT}\]

\[\frac{1}{2}\text{m}\frac{\left(\text{v}_{1}^{2}+\text{v}_{2}^{2}+\text{v}_{3}^ {2}+\ldots+\text{v}_{\text{N}}^{2}\right)}{\text{N}}=\frac{3}{2}\text{kT}\]

where \(m\) is the mass of a single particle. From the above, we obtain,

\[\frac{1}{2}\text{m}\langle\text{v}^{2}\rangle=\frac{3}{2}\text{kT}\]

Where

\[\langle\text{v}^{2}\rangle=\frac{\left(\text{v}_{1}^{2}+\text{v}_{2}^{2}+ \text{v}_{3}^{2}+\ldots+\text{v}_{\text{N}}^{2}\right)}{\text{N}}\]

This quantity which is the mean of the squared velocities is known as the **mean square speed**. This quantity is important because it gives us a feeling for the average KE of the system.

Square rooting both sides.

\[\boxed{\text{v}_{\text{RMS}}=\sqrt{\langle\text{v}^{2}\rangle}=\sqrt{\frac{ \left(\text{v}_{1}^{2}+\text{v}_{2}^{2}+\text{v}_{3}^{2}+\ldots+\text{v}_{ \text{N}}^{2}\right)}{\text{N}}}}\]

This quantity, \(\text{v}_{\text{RMS}}\) is known as the **root mean square velocity**.

Example 7

Helium gas occupies a volume of 0.0400 m\({}^{3}\) at a pressure of 200 kPa and temperature 300 K. Calculate the RMS speed of its molecules. (Molar mass of helium is 4)

Solution:

\[U=\frac{1}{2}mv_{\text{total}}^{2}=\frac{3}{2}PV\]

\[\frac{1}{2}m\langle v^{2}\rangle=\frac{3}{2}\frac{PV}{N}\]

\[\langle v^{2}\rangle=\frac{3PV}{Nm}=\frac{3nRT}{M_{\text{gas}}}=\frac{3nRT}{ nM_{\text{molar}}}=\frac{3RT}{M_{\text{molar}}}\]

\[\nu_{\text{RMS}}=\frac{3RT}{M_{\text{molar}}}=\sqrt{\frac{3\times 8.31\times 30 0}{0.004}}=1370\text{ m.s^{-1}}\]

Example 8

An ideal gas is contained in a vessel at 300K. If the temperature is increased to 900K, by what factor does each one of the following change?

(a) the average kinetic energy of the molecules,

Solution:

From above, we saw that

\[\langle\text{KE}\rangle=\frac{3}{2}kT\]

Hence, if \(T\) increases three fold, so will \(\langle\text{KE}\rangle\).

(b) the root mean square molecular speed,

Solution:

From the equation \(\frac{1}{2}mv_{\text{RMS}}^{2}=\frac{3}{2}kT\),

\[\nu_{\text{RMS}}\propto\sqrt{T}\]

Hence, if \(T\) increases three fold, \(v_{RMS}\) will increase by a factor of \(\sqrt{3}\).

### _Thermodynamics_

#### Work

Consider a piston filled with some gas (may or may not be ideal). The cross section is uniform with an area \(A\).

The gas exerts a pressure of \(P\) on the walls. Hence, if we wish to compress the piston, we have to exert a force of at least,

\[F=P.A\]

If we shift the piston from a position of \(x_{i}\) to \(x_{2}\), the amount of _work done on the gas_ is given by

\[W=\int_{x_{1}}^{x_{2}}F.dx=\int_{x_{1}}^{x_{2}}PA.dx\]

However, note that with every shift of the piston in the positive \(x\) direction, the gas is compressed and the volume of the piston decreases. Hence,

\[dV=-A.dx\]

Substituting this into the equation for work,This formula tells us that the amount of work done may be determined by the area under the P-V graph.

Physically, the negative sign indicates that if _volume decreases, work is done on_ the piston. Hence _energy goes into the gas. W is positive_.

Conversely, if the _volume increases, work is done by_ the piston. Hence, _energy goes out of the gas. W is negative_.

Note that if the question asks for work done _by_ the gas, simply reverse the sign of \(W\).

Topic 68: Thermal Physics (II) 68-21

#### The First Law of Thermodynamics

_Learning Outcome:_

_(d) recall and use the first law of thermodynamics expressed in terms of the change in internal energy, the heating of the system and the work done on the system._

**The First Law of Thermodynamics states that the _increase_ in internal energy \(\Delta U\) of a system is the sum of the heat supplied to the system _Q,_ and the work done on the system, \(W\).

Mathematically, this is expressed as

\(\Delta U=Q+W\)

\(Q\) (heat/thermal energy) refers to the amount of energy gained from the external environment. _Q is positive when thermal energy is supplied to the system._ Conversely, _Q is negative when thermal energy is removed from the system._

Note:

If Q is supplied or removed, it need not necessarily bring about an increase/decrease in temperature of the substance since internal energy depends on the work done. Also, if it is stated that the system is thermally insulated, _Q=0._

**Example 9:**

(a) Find the change in internal energy when 5 J of heat is supplied to the system and 3 J of work is done on the system.

Solution:

\(\Delta U=Q+W=5+3=8\) J

The positive sign on \(\Delta U\) means that the internal energy of the system has increased.

9646 Physics

Topic 6B: Thermal Physics (II) 6B-22Dunman High School (Senior High Physics Department)

(b) 10 J of heat is given off by the system while 8 J of work is done on the system. What is the change in internal energy of the system? Solution:

\[\Delta\)U = Q + W = -10 + 8 = -2 J The positive sign on \(\Delta\)U means that the internal energy of the system has decreased.

(c) The system absorbs 5 J of heat while doing 7 J of work. What is the loss in internal energy? Solution:

Note that work is done BY the system. Therefore work done ON system (W) is given by W = -7 J

\[\Delta\)U = Q + W = 5 - 7 = -2 J (d) The internal energy of a system increases by 10 J when 14 J of work is done on it. How much heat is lost by the system? Solution:

\[\Delta\)U = Q + W 10 = Q + 14 Q = -4 J As question asks for heat lost by the system, answer is 4 J.

(e) A system loses 5 J of heat and the internal energy decreases by 8 J. How much work is done by the system? Solution:

\[\Delta\)U = Q + W -8 = -5 + W W = -3 J As the question asks for work done by the system, answer is 3 J.

Dunman High School (Senior High Physics Department)

Example 10

Some gas, assumed to behave ideally, is contained within a cylinder that is surrounded by insulation to prevent loss of heat, as shown in the diagram.

Initially, the volume of gas is 2.9x10-4 m3, its pressure is 1.04x105 Pa and its temperature is 314 K.

(a) Use the equation of state for an ideal gas to find the amount, in moles, of gas in the cylinder.

Solution:

\[\text{PV}=\text{nRT}\]

\[\text{n}=\frac{\text{PV}}{\text{RT}}=\frac{\big{(}1.04\times 10^{5}\big{)}(2.9 \times 10^{-4}\big{)}}{8.31\times 314}=0.0116\text{ mol}\]

(b) The gas is then compressed to a volume of 2.9x10-5 m3 and its temperature rises to 790 K. Calculate the pressure of the gas after this compression.

Solution:

\[\text{PV}=\text{nRT}\]

\[\text{P}=\frac{\text{nRT}}{\text{V}}=\frac{(0.0116)(8.31)(790)}{2.9\times 10 ^{-5}}=2.63\times 10^{5}\text{ Pa}\]

(c) The work done on the gas during the compression is 91 J. Use the first law of thermodynamics to find the change in internal energy of the gas.

Solution:

\[\text{\Delta U}=\text{Q}+\text{W}=0+91=91\text{ J}\]

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:27]

When more than one thermal process takes place such that the gas is in its original state, this is known as a _cyclic process_. As the gas has returned to its original state, its internal energy must be the same and hence AU must be 0 J. The area enclosed by the graph is the total (net) work done._

**Example 12**

0.2 mol of an ideal gas is trapped in a closed cylinder sealed by a piston at an initial temperature of 300 K and initial pressure \(p\). The gas undergoes a cycle of changes \(A\)\(\rightarrow\)\(B\)\(\rightarrow\)\(C\)\(\rightarrow\)\(A\) as shown in the figure below.

From \(A\) to \(B\), the gas is compressed isothermally at a temperature of 300 K during which 800 J of work is done on the gas. From \(B\) to \(C\), the gas is cooled at a constant volume of 1.0x10\({}^{-3}\) m\({}^{3}\) till its pressure returns to \(p\). From \(C\) to \(A\), the gas expands at constant pressure \(p\).

Solution:

\[p=\frac{nRT}{V}=\frac{0.2\times 8.31\times 300}{5\times 10^{-3}}=99.7\ \text{kPa}\]Dunman High School (Senior High Physics Department)

(b) Calculate the work done on the gas during the change from C to A.

Solution:

Area under graph = \(|\)W\(|\) = \((5-1)\times 10^{-3}\times 99.72\times 10^{3}=399\) J

As arrow points right, W is negative. Therefore

W = -399 J

(c) Calculate the net heat supplied in one complete cycle.

Solution:

Wtotal = WAB + WBC + WCA

Process B\(\rightarrow\)C is isochoric. Hence, \(W_{BC}=0\) J.

Wtotal = 800 + 0 - 399 = 401 J

Since process is cyclic,

\(\Delta\)U = 0 J

\(\Delta\)U = Qtotal + Wtotal

Qtotal = 0 - 401 = -401 J

**Example 13**

A fixed mass of an ideal gas is subjected to various changes of pressure, volume and temperature through cycle ABCDA. The states A, B, C, and D of the gas are shown in the table below.

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|} \hline State & Pressure / \(10^{5}\) Pa & Volume / \(10^{-2}\) m\({}^{3}\) \\ \hline \(A\) & 2.0 & 1.5 \\ \hline \(B\) & 0.5 & 6.0 \\ \hline \(C\) & 0.5 & 2.0 \\ \hline \(D\) & 1.0 & 1.5 \\ \hline \end{tabular}

The changes are shown in the P-V diagram below.

If the cycle is repeated 10 times per second, calculate the power output of this engine. Solution:

\[\text{P}=\frac{\text{W}}{\text{t}}=\frac{\text{|-4.16}+2+0.36|\times 10^{3} \times 10}{1}=18000\text{ W}\]

(c) Calculate the efficiency \(\varepsilon\) of this engine where \(\varepsilon\) is defined as

\[\varepsilon=\frac{\text{work output}}{\text{heat input}}\]

Solution:

\[\varepsilon=\frac{\text{work output}}{\text{heat input}}=\frac{\text{|-4.16 }+2+0.36|\times 10^{3}}{(4.16+3.27)\times 10^{3}}=24.2\text{ \%}\]

### Kinetic Model of Matter

#### Self-Attempt Questions

1. Explain what is meant by internal energy of a system? Using the concept of internal energy, explain the following 1. Compare the internal energy per unit mass of water and water vapour at the same temperature 2. Why the temperature of a pure substance does not change when it experiences a change of state
2. (a) Explain, using a simple kinetic model for matter, why melting and boiling takes place without a change in temperature. 2. The _specific latent heat of vaporisation_ of water is 2.26 x 10\({}^{6}\) J.kg-1 whereas the corresponding value of the _specific latent heat of fusion_ is 3.34 x 10\({}^{5}\) J.kg-1. Define the terms in **italics** and explain, using a _simple kinetic model for matter_ why the first term is bigger than the second.
3. The assumptions of the simple kinetic theory of gases include: 1. gases are made up of many molecules moving randomly, 2. the collisions of the molecules with the walls of the container are elastic (i.e. there is no loss in kinetic energy of the molecules in the collisions). What experimental evidence is there that justifies these assumptions? Describe the experiment in detail.
