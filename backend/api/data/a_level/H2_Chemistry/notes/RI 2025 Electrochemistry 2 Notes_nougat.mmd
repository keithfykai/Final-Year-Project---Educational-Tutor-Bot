### Relative Concentrations of the Species (especially when \(E^{\circ}\) values are close)

The \(E^{\circ}\) value used to predict the species to be discharged is valid under _standard conditions_. However, if the concentrations of the species are **non-standard**, i.e. not 1.0 mol dm\({}^{-3}\), then we need to consider its effect on the position of equilibrium and hence the value of \(E\), the electrode potential under non-standard conditions.

For example, the presence of high concentrations of an ion may cause it to be discharged even though its \(E^{\circ}\) value predicts it to be less favourable (at standard conditions).

Consider the electrolysis of brine (_concentrated_ sodium chloride, where concentrations of Na\({}^{+}\) and C\(I\)- are very high).

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|} \hline  & **Species** & \\  & **present in** & Na\({}^{+}\)(aq), C\(I\)(aq) and H\({}_{2}\)O(l) \\  & **electrolyte** & \\ \hline
**Electrodes** & & Inert electrodes e.g. graphite \\ \hline  & Na\({}^{+}\)(aq) + e\({}^{-}\)\(\rightleftharpoons\) Na(s) & \(E^{\circ}\) = -2.71 V \\
**Cathode (-)** & & 2H\({}_{2}\)O(l) + 2e\({}^{-}\)\(\rightleftharpoons\) H\({}_{2}\)(g) + 2OH\({}^{+}\)(aq) & \(E^{\circ}\) = -0.83 V \\  & & The higher [Na\({}^{+}\)] **does not** override the position of the ions in the redox series as its reduction potential is **too** negative. \\ \hline
**(conc.** & & 2C\(I\)(aq) \(\rightarrow\) Cl\({}_{2}\)(g) + 2e\({}^{-}\) \\
**aqueous NaC\(I\))** & & **Reasons**: \\  & & O\({}_{2}\)(g) + 4H\({}^{+}\)(aq) + 4e\({}^{-}\)\(\rightleftharpoons\) 2H\({}_{2}\)O(l) & \(E^{\circ}\) = +1.23 V \\  & **C\(l\)\(z\)(g) + 2e\({}^{-}\)\(\rightleftharpoons\) 2C\(I\)(aq)** & \(E^{\circ}\) = +1.36 V \\  & & The increased [C\(I\)-] causes the position of equilibrium of Cl\({}_{2}\)(g) + 2e\({}^{-}\)\(\rightleftharpoons\) 2C\(I\)(aq) to shift left, such that \(E\)**becomes much less than +1.36 V** (i.e. and also less positive than \(E^{\circ}\)(O\({}_{2}\)/H\({}_{2}\)O). \\  & **C\(I\)(aq) is preferentially oxidised to form C\(I_{2}\)(g).** \\ \hline \end{tabular}

### Nature of the Electrodes (Inert vs Reactive)

An inert electrode, such as the graphite or platinum electrode, does not participate in the electrolysis reactions.

A reactive electrode is one that participates in the electrolysis reactions. Since it participates in the electrolysis reactions, the reactive electrode (the anode, in particular) must be considered in addition to species present in the electrolyte.

Consider the electrolysis of CuSO\({}_{4}\)(aq) using reactive copper electrodes.

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|} \hline
**Species** & \\
**present in** & Cu\({}^{2+}\)(aq), SO\({}_{4}\)\({}^{2-}\)(aq) and H\({}_{2}\)O(l) \\
**electrolyte** & \\ \hline \hline
**Electrodes** & Cu electrodes (reactive electrodes) \\ \hline \hline
**Cu\({}^{2+}\)** and H\({}_{2}\)O compete to undergo reduction. \\ \begin{tabular}{l} \(\mathrm{Cu}^{2+}\)(aq) + 2e\({}^{-}\)\(\rightleftharpoons\) Cu(s) \\ 2H\({}_{2}\)O(l) + 2e\({}^{-}\)\(\rightleftharpoons\) H\({}_{2}\)(g) + 2OH\({}^{-}\)(aq) \\ \end{tabular} & 
\begin{tabular}{l} \(E^{\Theta}\) = +0.34 V \\ \(E^{\Theta}\) = -0.83 V \\ \end{tabular} \\
**Cathode** & Since **\(E^{\Theta}\)(Cu\({}^{2+}\)/Cu) is positive**, Cu\({}^{2+}\) has a greater tendency to be reduced than H\({}_{2}\)O and is thus **preferentially reduced**. \\ \end{tabular} \\
**Reaction at cathode**: Cu\({}^{2+}\)(aq) + 2e\({}^{-}\)\(\rightarrow\) Cu(s) \\ 
\begin{tabular}{l} [Note: The sulfate ions will be repelled by the negative cathode. Hence, they will not be reduced.] \\ \end{tabular}

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|} \hline
**CuSO\({}_{4}\)(aq)** & Cu\({}^{2+}\)(aq) + 2e\({}^{-}\)\(\rightleftharpoons\) Cu(s) \\ \begin{tabular}{l} \(\mathrm{O}_{2}\)(g) + 4H\({}^{+}\)(aq) + 4e\({}^{-}\)\(\rightleftharpoons\) 2H\({}_{2}\)O(l) \\ \end{tabular} & 
\begin{tabular}{l} \(E^{\Theta}\) = +1.23 V \\ \(E^{\Theta}\) = +2.01 V \\ \end{tabular} \\
**Anode (+)** & Since **\(E^{\Theta}\)(Cu\({}^{2+}\)/Cu) is the least positive**, Cu has the greatest tendency to be oxidised and is thus **preferentially oxidised**. \\ \end{tabular}

Thus the anode reaction is:

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|} \hline
**Reaction at anode**: Cu(s) \(\rightarrow\) Cu\({}^{2+}\)(aq) + 2e\({}^{-}\) \\ \hline \end{tabular}

What if INERT electrodes such as graphite were used instead?

\begin{tabular}{|p{113.8pt}|p{113.8pt}|} \hline
**Cathode** & Cu\({}^{2+}\) and H\({}_{2}\)O compete to undergo reduction. Since the considerations are the same, Cu\({}^{2+}\) is still **preferentially reduced**. \\
**(-)** & **Reaction at cathode:** Cu\({}^{2+}\)(aq) + 2e\({}^{-}\)\(\rightarrow\) Cu(s) \\ \hline
**Anode** & \(\Omega_{2}\)(g) + 4H\({}^{+}\)(aq) + 4e\({}^{-}\)\(\rightleftharpoons\) 2H\({}_{2}\)O(\(l\)) \(E^{\circ}\) = +1.23 V \(S_{2}\)O\({}^{2-}\)(aq) + 2e\({}^{-}\)\(\rightleftharpoons\) 2SO\({}_{4}\)\(E^{\circ}\) = +2.01 V \\ (+) & We do not need to consider the Cu\({}^{2+}\)/Cu equation. \\ Here, **since \(E^{\circ}\)(O\({}_{2}\)/H\({}_{2}\)O) is less positive**, H\({}_{2}\)O has a greater tendency to be oxidised and is thus **preferentially oxidised**. \\
**Reaction at anode:** 2H\({}_{2}\)O(\(l\)) \(\rightarrow\) O\({}_{2}\) \\ \hline \end{tabular}

Advantages of anodising:

* Anodising of aluminium is of substantial commercial value as aluminium is widely used especially where lightness and corrosion resistance are important e.g. cookware, electric cables, aircrafts and automobile.
* The anodic film is hard, resistant to wear and a good electrical insulator.
* The freshly formed film can be dyed to give colour-anodised aluminium.

### Electrolytic Purification of Copper

Copper is about 99% pure when it is first obtained from its ores. The main impurities are silver, platinum, iron, gold and zinc.

The impurities reduce the electrical conductivity of copper and so impure copper must be purified before being used e.g. for electrical wires. The purification of metals is known as _refining_.

At the cathode:

At the anode:

The cell potential is adjusted such that Cu at the anode dissolves. Over a period of time the **anode dissolves** and **reddish-brown copper is deposited on the cathode**.

Impurities with \(E^{\Theta}\) values more positive than Cu e.g. Ag

Ag\({}^{+}\) + e\({}^{-}\) \(\rightleftharpoons\) Ag \(E^{\Theta}\) = +0.80 V

Cu\({}^{2+}\) + 2e\({}^{-}\) \(\rightleftharpoons\) Cu \(E^{\Theta}\) = +0.34 V

Since the \(E^{\Theta}\)(Cu\({}^{2+}\)/Cu) is less positive, Cu is preferentially oxidised at the anode. Thus Ag impurities will not be oxidised and they fall to the bottom as'sludge'.

Impurities with \(E^{\Theta}\) values less positive than Cu e.g. Zn

Zn\({}^{2+}\) + 2e\({}^{-}\) \(\rightleftharpoons\) Zn \(E^{\Theta}\) = -0.76 V

Cu\({}^{2+}\) + 2e\({}^{-}\) \(\rightleftharpoons\) Cu \(E^{\Theta}\) = +0.34 V

Since the \(E^{\Theta}\)(Zn\({}^{2+}\)/Zn) is less positive, Zn is preferentially oxidised at the anode and goes into the solution (as Zn\({}^{2+}\) ions) first, followed by Cu.

At the cathode, however, since the \(E^{\rm e}({\rm Cu^{2+}}\)/Cu) is more positive, Cu\({}^{2+}\) is preferentially reduced and deposited on the pure Cu rod. Zn\({}^{2+}\) ions remain in the electrolyte and are not plated onto the cathode.

### Electroplating

Cathode: object to be plated

Anode: plating metal

Electrolyte: a solution containing the ions of the plating metal

Only metals less reactive than zinc (e.g. \(E^{\rm e}\) more positive than that of Zn) can be used as plating metal. Hence, objects may be electroplated with chromium, copper, silver and gold but cannot be electroplated with aluminium for example.

Successful electroplating requires that the electric current, concentration of electrolyte and temperature to be exactly right. The cathode must also be clean.

## 4 Faraday's Law of Electrolysis

Candidates should be able to state the relationship, \(F=L\epsilon\), between the Faraday constant, the Avogadro constant and the charge on the electron.

Faraday's laws of electrolysis provide the quantitative relationship between electricity and chemical change.

### Faraday's First Law

The mass of substance and/or volume of gas liberated during electrolysis is **directly proportional** to the **amount of charge** that passed through the cell.

\begin{tabular}{|l l l|} \hline \multicolumn{1}{|c}{Q} & \multicolumn{1}{c}{= amount of charge in coulombs, **C**} \\ \multicolumn{1}{|c}{I} & \multicolumn{1}{c}{= current in amperes, **A**} \\ \multicolumn{1}{|c}{m} & \multicolumn{1}{c}{\(\propto\)**Q**} & \multicolumn{1}{c}{where **Q**} & \multicolumn{1}{c}{\(=\) **It**} \\ \multicolumn{1}{|c}{I} & \multicolumn{1}{c}{= time in seconds, **s**} \\ \multicolumn{1}{|c}{m} & \multicolumn{1}{c}{= mass deposited in grams, **g**} \\ \multicolumn{1}{|c}{} & \multicolumn{1}{c}{When a current of 1 A has been passed for 1 s,} \\ \multicolumn{1}{|c}{this means that 1 C of charge has been passed.} \\ \hline \end{tabular} Important: The amount of substance formed is **not** dependent on the temperature or concentration.

Example: \({\rm Cu^{2+}}\)(aq) + 2e\({}^{-}\)\(\rightarrow\) Cu(s)

The greater quantity of electricity, **Q**, passed through the cell

\(\Rightarrow\) a greater amount of e\({}^{-}\) passed through

\(\Rightarrow\) a greater mass of Cu(s) deposited.

This can be achieved by using a **higher current** or passing the current through for a **longer** duration. Increasing the concentration of Cu\({}^{2+}\) will **not** result in a greater mass of Cu(s) deposited within the same duration.

### Faraday's Second Law

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|} \hline \multicolumn{2}{|l|}{To discharge} & Implications \\ \hline
1 mol of Na+ requires 1 F & Na+ + e- Na \\ (or 96500 C) of electrons & 96500 C is needed to produce 23.0 g of Na \\ \hline
1 mol Mg2+ requires 2 F & Mg2+ 2e- Mg \\ (or 2 x 96500 C) of electrons & It requires 193 000 C to produce 24.3 g of Mg \\ \hline
1 mol Al3+ requires 3 F & Al3+ 3e- Al \\ (or 3 x 96500 C) of electrons & It requires 289 500 C to produce 27.0 g of Al \\ \hline \multicolumn{2}{|l|}{Weaked Sample 1} \\ \hline What is the mass of Cu deposited on the cathode of an electrolytic cell if an electric current of 2.00 A is run through CuSO4(aq) for 20.0 minutes? \\ \hline
**Answer:** & **Answer:** \\ Quantity of charge passed & Since Q = It = n\({}_{e}\)F \\ = I x t = 2.00 x 20.0 x 60 = 2400 C & \(n_{e}=\frac{\text{lt}}{\text{F}}=\frac{(2.00)(20\times 60)}{96500}=0.02487\) mol \\ \(\text{Cu}^{2+}\)(aq) + 2e- \(\rightarrow\) Cu(s) & \\ 2 x 96500 C is required to deposit 1 mol of Cu & \(\text{Cu}^{2+}\)(aq) + 2e- \(\rightarrow\) Cu(s) \\ Amt of Cu(s) deposited & Amt of Cu deposited = \(\gamma_{2}\)(0.02487) \\ = 0.01244 mol & \(\text{--}\) 0.01244 mol \\ Mass of Cu(s) deposited & Mass of Cu(s) deposited \\ = 0.01244 x 63.5 = **0.790 q** & \(\text{--}\) 0.01244 x 63.5 = **0.790 q** \\ \hline \end{tabular}
