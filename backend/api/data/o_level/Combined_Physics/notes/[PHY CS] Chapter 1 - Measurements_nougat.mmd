1) Why do we have to take reading for 20 oscillations and do it multiple times? During the starting and the stopping of the stopwatch, there is **human reaction time**. By increasing the number of oscillations and taking the average of the readings, we **reduce** the significance of that **random error** and obtain a more accurate value as a result. The pendulum blob also starts to sway after 20 oscillations, hence 20 oscillations is an ideal number.

2) Does increasing the mass of the pendulum **bob/ angle of swing affect the oscillation time?**

No, the mass of the pendulum blob does not affect the time taken for the oscillation. Only the **length** of the string affects the time taken for the oscillation. Similarly, the angle of swing of the pendulum has no effect on the time as well. (_dielly, on angle of 5 degree is optimal for stability._)
