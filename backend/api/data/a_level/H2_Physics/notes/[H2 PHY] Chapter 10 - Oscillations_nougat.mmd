## Chapter 1 Simple Harmonic Motion

S.H.M. is a type of oscillatory motion whose acceleration is always

1. directly proportional to its displacement from the equilibrium position and
2. directed towards the equilibrium point (or is always directed opposite to of its displacement)

where \(a=\) acceleration of oscillator at certain position

\(x=\) displacement from equilibrium position

\(v=\) velocity of the oscillator

\(\omega=\) angular frequency of oscillator (constant)

\(f=\) frequency, \(T=\) period of oscillation

## Appendix A Simple Harmonic Motion

### A.1. Angular frequency and frequency are NOT the same.

The symbol and equations for angular frequency and angular velocity are the same but they are different quantities.

Appendix A spring-mass system is vertically suspended from a ceiling. The acceleration of the block of mass \(m\) is given by

\[a=-\frac{k}{m}x\]

where \(x\) is the displacement of the block. Discuss why the block's motion is simple harmonic.

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:11]

Energy in Simple Harmonic Motion

When a body is in S.H.M., there is a continuous interchange of its kinetic energy and potential energies. If the body oscillates with a constant amplitude, its total energy remains constant over time and displacement.

Let us consider the interchange of energy for the oscillations of a simple pendulum that has negligible resistance to its motion.

1. At the top of its swing (a), the pendulum possesses zero kinetic energy and maximum (gravitational) potential energy.
2. As the pendulum is releases from the top of its swing (a) and moves towards its equilibrium position (b), its (gravitational) potential energy is converted to kinetic energy.
3. At its equilibrium position (b), the pendulum possesses maximum kinetic energy and minimum (gravitational) potential energy Energy in Simple Harmonic Motion

4. As the pendulum moves past its equilibrium position (b) and moves towards the other extreme position (c), its kinetic energy is converted to (gravitational) potential energy.
5. At the other extreme position (c), the pendulum possesses zero kinetic energy and maximum (gravitational) potential energy.
6. The energy conversion cycle repeats.

**Note**:

A similar energy conversion cycle can also be described for the oscillations of a vertical mass-spring system. However, it must be noted that potential energy will refer to the sum of both its gravitational and elastic potential energies

## Chapter Variation of Energy with Displacement and Time

Energy is the capacity to do work. It exists around us in many different forms. Some of the common forms are shown below.

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}  & Function of displacement (x) & Function of time \\ \hline \begin{tabular}{c} **Kinetic** \\ **Energy E\({}_{\text{K}}\)** \\ \end{tabular} & \(\dfrac{1}{2}m\omega^{2}(x_{0}^{2}-x^{2})\) & \(\dfrac{1}{2}m\omega^{2}x_{0}^{2}\cos^{2}(\omega t)\) \\ \hline \begin{tabular}{c} **Potential** \\ **Energy E\({}_{\text{P}}\)** \\ \end{tabular} & \(\dfrac{1}{2}m\omega^{2}x^{2}\) & \(\dfrac{1}{2}m\omega^{2}x_{0}^{2}\sin^{2}(\omega t)\) \\ \hline 
\begin{tabular}{c} **Total** \\ **Energy E\({}_{\text{T}}\)** \\ \end{tabular} & \(\dfrac{1}{2}m\omega^{2}x_{0}^{2}\) \\ \hline \end{tabular}

*derivations are found in the appendix

**Note:** When sketching these graphs involving displacement, take good care to ensure that the graphs do not extend beyond the extreme displacements (i.e. \(x_{0}\) and \(-x_{0}\)).

## Chapter 2 Qained Oscillation

A damped oscillation is an oscillation that loses energy until it comes to a stop due to resistive forces

**2 types of forces acting on the system:**

a. Restoring force

b. Dissipative force

The rate if removal of energy from an oscillating system is called the degree of damping. There are 3 different degrees of damping:

1. Light Damping (Under-damped system)

2. Critical damping (Critically damped system)

3. Heavy Damping (Over-damped systemForced oscillation

A forced oscillation is one which **an oscillator** is made to oscillate at the frequency of an external **driver.**

**3 types of forces acting on the system:**

a. Restoring force

b. Dissipative force

c. Driving force

Since the driver is causing the oscillator to oscillate, the driver is also transferring energy to the oscillator.

## Appendix A Applications of Resonance

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|} \hline
**Useful Resonance** & **Destructive Resonance** \\ \hline
**Musical Instruments** & **Shattering of Glass** \\ \hline Resonance is responsible for the production of sound in many musical instruments especially the wind instruments. & It has been known for high-pitched sound waves to shatter fragile objects. For example, an opera singer hitting a top note may shatter a wine glass at resonance. \\ \hline
**Radio Receptions** & **Earthquakes** \\ \hline A radio receiver works on the principle of resonance. Our air is filled with radio waves of many different frequencies which the aerial picks up. The tuner can be adjusted so that the frequency of the electrical oscillations in the circuits is the same as that of the radio waves transmitted from the particular station we desired. The effect of resonance amplifies the signals contained in this wave while the radio waves of other frequencies are diminished \\ \hline \end{tabular}

During earthquakes, buildings are forced to oscillate in resonance with the seismic waves, resulting in serious damages. In regions of the world where earthquake happen regularly, buildings may be built on foundations that absorb the energy of the shock waves. In this way, the vibrations are damped and the amplitude of the oscillations cannot reach dangerous levels.

## Applications of Resonance

\begin{tabular}{|p{113.8pt}|p{113.8pt}|} \hline
**Useful Resonance** & **Destructive Resonance** \\
**Microwave Cooking** & **Human Internal Organs** \\ \hline \end{tabular} In a microwave oven, microwaves with a frequency similar to the natural frequency of vibration of water molecules are used. When food containing water molecules is placed in the oven, the water molecules resonate, absorbing energy from the microwaves and consequently get heated up. This absorbed energy then spreads through the food and cooks it. The plastic or glass containers do not heat up since they do not contain water molecules.**

**Magnetic Resonance**

Imaging Strong, varying radio frequency electromagnetic fields are used to cause oscillations in atomic nuclei. When resonance occurs, energy is absorbed by the molecules. By analyzing the pattern of energy absorption, a computer-generated image can be produced

**Factice Example**

A spring-mass system is vertically suspended from a ceiling. The acceleration of the block of mass \(m\) is given by

\[a=-\frac{k}{m}x\]

where \(x\) is the displacement of the block. Discuss why the block's motion is simple harmonic.

**Answer:**

The negative sign in front of \(x\) shows that the acceleration is opposite in direction to the displacement. Since \(\frac{k}{m}\) is a constant, the acceleration of the motion is proportional to its displacement. Thus, the motion of the block is simple harmonic.

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:31]

**Fractice Example4**

A particle oscillates with simple harmonic motion along a line with a maximum speed \(v_{0}\). What is the speed of the particle when its displacement a third of its amplitude?

**Solution:**

\[v=\omega\sqrt{x_{0}^{2}-x^{2}}\]

\[v_{0}=\omega x_{0}\]

\[v=\omega\sqrt{x_{0}^{2}-\left(\frac{1}{3}x_{0}\right)^{2}}=\frac{2\sqrt{2}}{3} \ \omega x_{0}\]

\[v=\frac{2\sqrt{2}}{3}v_{0}=0.94v_{0}\]

\begin{tabular}{|c|} \hline
**Predate Example 5** \\ \hline \(x=2.50\) \(\cos 3.6t\) \\ where \(x\) is in meters and \(t\) is in seconds. \\ \hline \end{tabular}

\begin{tabular}{|c|} \hline
**Solution (a):** \\ \(x_{0}=2.50\)\(m\) \\ \(\omega=3.6\)\(Hz\) \\ \(E_{T}=\frac{1}{2}m\omega^{2}x_{0}^{2}=\frac{1}{2}(0.75)(3.6)^{2}(2.5)^{2}\) \\ \(E_{T}=30.4\)\(J\) \\ \hline \end{tabular}

**Solution (b):** \\ \(x=2.50\)\(\cos(3.6\times 0.2)\) \\ \(x=1.88\)\(m\) \\ \(E_{K}=\frac{1}{2}m\omega^{2}(x_{0}^{2}-x^{2})=\frac{1}{2}(0.75)(3.6)^{2}[2.5^ {2}-1.88^{2}]\) \\ \(E_{K}=13.2\)\(J\) \\ \hline \end{tabular}

**Solution (c):** \\ \(E_{P}=\frac{1}{2}m\omega^{2}x^{2}=\frac{1}{2}(0.75)(3.6)^{2}(1.88)^{2}\) \\ \(E_{P}=17.2\)\(J\) \\ \hline \end{tabular}
