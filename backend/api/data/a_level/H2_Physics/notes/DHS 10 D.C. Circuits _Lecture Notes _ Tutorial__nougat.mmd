## Introduction

D.C. stands for direct current. It means current flowing only in one direction in a closed circuit. The magnitude of the current, however, may vary from time to time. The following are some examples of graphs representing the variation of direct current with time.

In (a) and (b), the magnitudes of the current change with time. The currents in (a) and (b) flow in the opposite direction. In (c), the current flows with constant magnitude. We say, the current is a steady D.C. This chapter focuses mainly on the type of current shown in (c) - steady D.C.

A simple D.C. circuit will usually comprise:

* source (s), e.g. batteries, cells
* switches
* resistors (or other components such as capacitors)
* measuring instruments such as voltmeter, ammeter, etc.

* recall and use appropriate circuit symbols as set out in the ASE publication Signs, symbols and systematics: the ASE companion to 16-19 science (2000)
* draw and interpret circuit diagrams containing sources, switches, resistors, ammeters, voltmeters, and/or any other type of component referred to in the syllabus

Standard circuit symbols are used to simplify circuit diagrams. Each circuit symbol represents an electrical device. The table below shows some common circuit symbols.

### Application of Charge and Energy Conservation Principles in Circuit Analysis

Charges cannot be created nor destroyed. This is the law of Conservation of Charge. Hence, the total charge that enters a junction per unit time (i.e. current entering) must be equal to the total charge that leaves the same junction per unit time (i.e. current leaving).

**Current Law:** The sum of currents entering any junction in an electric circuit is always equal to the sum of currents leaving that junction (otherwise charge would build up at the junction).

In the circuit below, the three currents by related by \(I=I_{1}+I_{2}\).

**Example 5**:

A battery with an e.m.f. of 20 V and an internal resistance of 2.0 \(\Omega\) is connected to resistors \(R_{1}\) and \(R_{2}\) as shown in the diagram. A total current of 4.0 A is supplied by the battery and \(R_{2}\) has a resistance of 12 \(\Omega\). Calculate the resistance of \(R_{1}\) and the power supplied to each circuit component.

**(c)**: solve problems using the formula for the combined resistance of two or more resistors in series

In the circuit, the resistors \(R_{1}\) and \(R_{2}\) are said to be in series because the same current flows through both \(R_{1}\) and \(R_{2}\).

From conservation of energy,

\(E=V_{1}+V_{2}\)

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:7]

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:8]

To supply a continuously variable potential difference from zero to the full voltage of the supply \(E\), a resistor with a sliding contact may be used.

### Potential and Potential Difference

Each point in a circuit has a potential. Two points have the same potential if they are connected directly by a wire of zero resistance, and there is no potential difference between them.

If the two points are separated by a _gap_, _a resistor_, _a battery or some other device with resistance_, the potential on either point can be _different_. The difference in potential between the two points is called the potential difference.

These two points have the potential unless the current is zero in which case the p.d. across the resistor will be zero.

Hence, for potential difference (p.d.) to exist, the component must either be an e.m.f source (e.g., batteries, solar cells or thermocouples) or have resistance, and _current must be flowing_ through the component.

Consider the following diagram showing part of a circuit:

As point A is connected to the earth, the potential at A is zero.

From point A to B:

The p.d. across the 5 \(\Omega\) resistor, \(V\)= \(IR\)= 1x 5 = 5 V

As current flows from higher to lower potential, B is at a lower potential

Hence, potential at B is 0 - 5 V = -5 V

From point B to C:

For a potentiometer found in our Physics laboratory, a length of resistance wire AB is used in place of the two resistors, \(R_{1}\) and \(R_{2}\). An additional resistor \(R_{\mathrm{S}}\) connected in series with the wire serves to limit the current that flows through the circuit. The resistance of \(R\)s will affect the p.d across the resistance wire AB.

A sliding contact is connected to a galvanometer G as shown, and is moved along the wire until a point, C is found on the wire such that there is _no current_ in the galvanometer (null reading). This point is known as the null point or balance point and the length AC is known as the **balance length**. At the null point, the p.d. across the length AC is equal to the p.d. across the circuit to be measured. Hence, no current will flow through the galvanometer.

**Assumptions**

(i): wire has uniform cross-sectional area

(ii): potential difference across wire remains constant with time

(iii): length of wire remains constant with time

For a uniform wire of length \(L\),

\[R=\frac{\rho L}{A}\]

\[R\propto L\]

Since the same current flows through the entire wire,

\[V_{\mathrm{AC}}=\frac{R_{\mathrm{AC}}}{R_{\mathrm{AB}}}\times V_{\mathrm{AB}}\]

\[V_{\mathrm{AC}}=\frac{L_{\mathrm{AC}}}{L_{\mathrm{AB}}}\times V_{\mathrm{AB}} =\left(\frac{V_{\mathrm{AB}}}{L_{\mathrm{AB}}}\right)L_{\mathrm{AC}}=kL_{ \mathrm{AC}}\]

where \(k\) is the potential per unit length of the wire AB.

Comparing e.m.f.s

In practical circuitry, \(V_{\mathrm{XY}}\neq\) e.m.f. of _driver cell_ as practical sources have _internal resistance_.

Hence in order to find the unknown e.m.f. (\(E_{1}\)) of a cell, we can compare it with a standard e.m.f. cell (\(E_{2}\)) using the circuit below.

The setting of the variable resistor must be the _same_ for the two cells so that the _potential difference across XY is the same_. The variable resistor is used to _control_ the potential difference across XY such that the balance length XJ is large enough to be accurately measured.

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:15]

**Example 15**: The diagram below shows a simple potentiometer circuit for measuring a small e.m.f. source.

The wire XY has a length of 1.000 m and a resistance of 5.0 \(\Omega\). The driver cell has an e.m.f. of 2.00 V. If a balance point, P is obtained 0.600 m along XY when measuring an e.m.f. of 6.00 mV, what is the value of the resistance \(R\)?

Using the potentiometer principle,

Using the potential divider rule,

With switch S opened, no current passes through the loop containing the resistor of resistance \(R_{2}\). The balance point is at point C and the balance length is \(L_{1}\).

With switch S closed, current passes through the loop containing the resistor of resistance \(R_{2}\). The new balance point is now at point D and the balance length is \(L_{2}\).

* Using the balance length \(L_{1}\), we can find the e.m.f. \(E\).
* Using the balance length \(L_{2}\), we can find the terminal p.d. \(V\)across \(E\) when there is a current flowing though \(E_{1}\).
* The terminal p.d. \(V\)across \(E\) will also be equal to the p.d. across resistor \(R_{2}\). Using \(V=IR\), we can find the current \(I\) flowing through \(R_{2}\).
* Using the equation \(V=E-Ir\), we can find the internal resistance \(r\).

**Example 16**: A potentiometer circuit for measuring the internal resistance of a cell is shown below. The uniform wire AB has a length of 100.0 cm and a resistance of 1.6 \(\Omega\). The driver cell is of e.m.f. 3.0 V and internal resistance 0.80 \(\Omega\). A cell of unknown e.m.f. E.and internal resistance \(r\) and a resistor of 20 \(\Omega\) is connected to the circuit.

The movable contact C can be connected to any point along the wire AB. When switch S is opened, a balance length of 61.0 cm is obtained. When switch S is closed, a balance length of 49.5 cm is obtained. Find the internal resistance, \(r\).
