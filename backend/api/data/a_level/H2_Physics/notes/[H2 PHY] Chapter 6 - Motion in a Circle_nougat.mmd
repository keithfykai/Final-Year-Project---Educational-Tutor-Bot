The Kinematics of Circular Motion

* Circular motion is a common occurrence in our daily lives: spinning discs, Ferris wheels, and rotation of a tyre about its axis. In this topic, we explore the physics behind rotating objects.

Symbol: \(\theta\)

Algouler Displacement

Sl unit: radians [rad]

Vector quantity

* The period of an object in circular motion is the time taken for it to make one complete revolution.

* The frequency of an object in circular motion is the number of complete revolutions made per unit time.

Relationship between perfect, angular velocity frequency

For an object moving in uniform circular motion, i.e. with constant \(\omega\)

\[\omega=\frac{2\pi}{T}\]

Since \(T=1/f\)

Relationship between perfect and linear speed

If the object is moving in uniform circular motion, its linear speed \(v\) can also be found by:

\[v=\frac{circumference\ of\ the\ circle}{T}\]

Thus

\[T=\frac{2\pi r}{v}\]

## In summary

For uniform circular motion, it may help to adopt a primary school approach* [1]

Compact disc players use laser to scan the content of a disc. Suppose the laser is pointed 3.5 cm from the center of the disc, what length of the disc is scanned when the disc rotated by an angle of 30\({}^{\circ}\).

Dynamics of Uniform Circular Motion

* Consider an object moving in uniform circular motion with a speed of \(\nu\) and an angular velocity of \(\omega\).

* By Newton's 1st Law, if there is no net force on an object, it will continue in its state of constant velocity. Inertia will cause the object to continue moving along a straight line.
* For an object undergoing uniform circular motion, the speed remains constant, \(|\mathbf{v_{i}}|=|\mathbf{v_{f}}|\), but the velocity changes due to direction changing, \(\mathbf{v_{f}}\neq\mathbf{v_{i}}\). Thus, there must be an acceleration.

* The change in velocity of the object is given by \(\mathbf{\Delta v}=\mathbf{v}_{f}-\mathbf{v}_{i}\). This implies a change in momentum \(\mathbf{\Delta p}=\mathbf{\Delta(mv)}\). By Newton's \(2^{\text{nd}}\) Law, there is a corresponding resultant force, \(\mathbf{F}\propto\frac{\mathbf{dp}}{\mathbf{dt}}\), acting along the same direction as the change in momentum
* The net force and correspondingly the acceleration are directed towards the center of the circular path. _Centripetal_ means center-seeking

## Chapter 1 Contepetal Acceleration

* Is the acceleration which acts perpendicular to the velocity and always acts towards the center of the circular motion.

where \(a_{c}=\) centripetal acceleration

\(r=\) radius of circular motion

\(v=\) linear or tangential velocity

\(\omega=\) angular velocity

## Chapter 1 Centralpetal Force

The force that causes an object to go round the circle

\[F_{c}=mr\omega^{2}=mv\omega=\frac{mv^{2}}{r}\]

where \(F_{c}=\) centripetal force

\(r=\) radius of circular motion

\(v=\) linear or tangential velocity

\(\omega=\) angular velocity

\(m=\) mass of the object

The centripetal force \(F_{c}\) is a resultant force. Do not include it in the free body diagram.

The centripetal force \(F_{c}\) does no work. The displacement is perpendicular to the force.

General Approach in Solving Problems relating to Circular Motion

1) Draw a free body diagram showing all the forces acting on the body.

2) Determine the center of the circular path.

3) Resolve the forces in the direction towards the center of the circle.

4) Identify the force(s) that provide the centripetal force and write down the statement. e.g. **Friction provides the centripetal force**

5) Apply Newton's Second Law:

\[F_{net}=mr\omega^{2}=mv\omega=\frac{mv^{2}}{r}\]

Appendix A A pendulum bob is suspended by a string and made to undergo uniform circular motion in a fixed horizontal plane.

Given that the weight of the bob is 3.50 N, the radius of the circular motion 7.00 cm, and the angle made by the string from the vertical is 11.0\({}^{\circ}\), find the period of circular motion.

## Appendix I Non-Uniform Circular Motion

* A body moving along a circular path with a speed that is varying is said to be in **non-uniform circular motion.**

Non-uniform circular Motion in a Vertical circle

* When the circle is vertical, the effects of gravity can cause the object to go slower at the top of the circle than at the bottom. Such situations can be examined by analyzing the energy transformations that take place and/or applying Newton's laws of motion.
* The acceleration of this body comprises two components: _centripetal acceleration_ (or radial acceleration) \(a_{r}\) and acceleration in the _tangential direction_ \(a_{t}\).
* The **centripetal acceleration** of the body keeps it in its circular path, and **can be calculated using the same formula.**
* The tangential acceleration of the body causes its speed to change.

## Appendix A Meruniform circular Motion in a Vertical Circle

* An object is fixed to one end of a string which rotates in a vertical circle at constant speed.

Consider the free body diagram of the object when the rod makes an angle \(\theta\) with the vertical.

* The component of the resultant force towards the center of the circle provides the centripetal force. This is also known as the radial force: \[T-mg\cos\theta=\frac{mv^{2}}{r}\] \[\Rightarrow T=\frac{mv^{2}}{r}+mg\cos\theta\]

At the bottom (\(\theta=0\) and \(2\pi\) rad), the tension is the greatest:

\[T=\frac{mv^{2}}{r}+mg\]

At the bottom (\(\theta=\pi\) rad), the tension is the smallest:

\[T=\frac{mv^{2}}{r}-mg\]
## 3 Meruniform circular Motion in a Vertical Circle

At the side,

\[T=\frac{mv^{2}}{r}\]

A graph that represents the variation with angle \(\theta\) of the tension \(T\) in the rod:

The tangential resultant force \(mg\sin\theta\) causes the speed to increase as the object moves towards the bottom. As it moves away from the bottom, this force slows down the object.

**Fradite Example 2**

As part of Kenneth's weekly workout, he jogs in a circular track of radius 250 m near his apartment building. He completes one full round in 10 minutes. Assuming that he jogs at constant angular speed,

What is the distance covered in one full round?

What is Kenneth's angular speed?

Calculate its linear speed?

Find the frequency of its motion.

**Solution:**

(a) Distance, s

\[s=r\theta=r(2\pi)=250(2\pi)=1570\;m\]

(b) Angular speed \(\theta\)

\[\omega=\frac{\theta}{t}=\frac{2\pi}{10\;min}\bigg{(}\frac{1\;min}{60\;s} \bigg{)}=10.5\times 10^{-3}\;rad/s\]

(c) Linear speed \(v\)

\[v=r\omega=(250)(10.5\times 10^{-3})=2.6\;m/s\]

(d) Frequency \(f\)

\[f=\frac{1}{T}=\frac{1}{10min}\bigg{(}\frac{1min}{60\;s}\bigg{)}=1.67\times 10^{-3 }\;Hz\]

**Solution:**

We resolve all real forces parallel and perpendicular to the plane of the circle

As the object is in equilibrium in the y direction,

\[W=F_{T}\cos\theta\]

As the x component of the tension provides the centripetal force,

\[F_{c}=F_{T}\sin\theta=mr\omega^{2}\]

\[\frac{mr\omega^{2}}{W}=\tan\theta=\frac{mr\omega^{2}}{mg}\]

\[\left(\frac{2\pi}{T}\right)=\sqrt{\frac{g}{r}\tan\theta}\]

\[T=\frac{2\pi}{\sqrt{\frac{g}{r}\tan\theta}}=\frac{2\pi}{\sqrt{\frac{981}{0.0 7}\tan 11}}=\mathbb{I}.\mathbf{20}\;\mathbf{s}\]
\begin{tabular}{p{142.3pt} p{142.3pt}}  & \\ \end{tabular}

**Solution:**

Horizontal component of Normal contact force provides centripetal force

\(N\)\(F_{net}=ma_{c}\)

\(Nsin\)\(\theta=\dfrac{mv^{2}}{r}\)

For verticle equilibrium:

\(Ncos\)\(\theta=mg\)

\(\tan\theta=\dfrac{v^{2}}{rg}\)

\(W\)\(v=\sqrt{(50)(9,81)(\tan 25)}\)

\(v=15.1\)\(m\)/s

Note that when there is friction, horizontal component of friction also contributes to centripetal force: the equation in the second line becomes \(N\sin\theta+(friction)\cos\theta=\dfrac{mv^{2}}{r}\)A bucket of water is spun in a circular motion along a vertical plane. Find the minimum linear speed to ensure that the water stays in the bucket.

**Solution:**

From the free body diagram, we realise that the normal reaction force by the bucket on the water, and the weight of the water provides the centripetal acceleration. However, if the bucket is to just reach the maximum point, the water must be travelling fast enough such that its weight alone can support the circular motion.

\(F_{c}=W\)

If it travels faster, the centripetal force must be larger which may be provided by the reaction force by bucket on the water.

\(F_{c}=N+W\)

Therefore,

\(F_{c}\geq W\)

\(\dfrac{mv^{2}}{r}\geq mg\)

If the bucket travels too slowly, \(F_{c}\leq W\) the centripetal force is too small. Since \(N\) is negative, there is no contact force and the water spills.
