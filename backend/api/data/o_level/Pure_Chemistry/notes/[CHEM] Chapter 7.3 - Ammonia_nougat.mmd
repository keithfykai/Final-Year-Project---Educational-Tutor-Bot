## 6 AMMONAIA

### 6.1 AMMONAIA

Ammonia (NH) is a **weak alkali** when it is in its aqueous state, as it partially dissociates in water to produce low concentration of OH- ions.

NH\({}_{3}\) (g) + H\({}_{2}\)O (l) = NH\({}_{4}\)* (gq) + OH (qq)

### 6.2 reversible reactions

### 6.3 Displacement of ammonia from its salts

An alkali has the ability to displace the ammonia from an ammonium salt.

For example, potassium hydroxide **displaces ammonia** from ammonium carbonate when the solution is gently heated:

ZXOH (aq) + (NH\({}_{4}\))\({}_{2}\)CO\({}_{3}\)(aq) - K\({}_{2}\)CO\({}_{3}\)(aq) + NH\({}_{3}\)(g) + 2H\({}_{2}\)O (l)

**Rate of reaction is more important than yield**

**Temperatures lower than 450% will result in very slow rates of reaction. It is more cost efficient to use a higher temperature that increases the rate of reaction.**

**Only 15% of the reactants are converted into ammonia. But that is okay because 99% of the reactants are eventually reacted to form ammonia.**

**Recall how 'pressure' increases rate of reaction**

**to**

**Rat a higher pressure, the reactants are brought closer together. There are more reactants per unit volume.**

**Racall how 'temperature' increases rate of reaction**

A higher temperature of a system means that:

1) Reactions have higher kinetic energy and move faster

2) The fraction of reactant particles in the system that have energy more than or equal to the activation energy is higher

These two factors increase the **frequency of effective collisions** and essentially result in an increase in the rate of reaction.

* 4. Which statement about ammonia is correct? (N2017/P1/Q20)
* A It decomposes on heating to a high temperature to form nitrogen and hydrogen.
* B It dissolves in water to form an acidic solution.
* C It is formed when ammonium salts are heated with sulfuric acid.
* D It reacts with alkalis to form salts. ( )

## Answer:

* A The reaction for the manufacture of ammonia [N,(g) + 3H,(g) = 2NH,(g)] is a reversible reaction. It means the backward reaction will take place under certain conditions. Ammonia is an alkali is dissolves in water to form an alkaline solution. It is formed by heating ammonium salts with an alkali. It reacts with acids to form salts.
