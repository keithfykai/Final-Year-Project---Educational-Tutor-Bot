## Narratives

An understanding of _Genetics and Inheritance_ that would help make sense of the transition from molecular to organismal level. _Genetics and Inheritance_ provides the molecular basis to the understanding of how variations in populations arise and this is important in the study of biological evolution. At the cellular level, expression of genes involves cellular structures such as the nucleus, endoplasmic reticulum and ribosome. Many essential products of gene expression are enzymes involved in biochemical pathways which control physiological functions. As such, mutation of genes may give rise to dysfunctional proteins which in turn could result in diseases. Sickle cell anemia and cancer are raised as examples of a monogenic and a multi-genic disease respectively.

The following questions should help students frame their learning:

* How does the genetic make-up of an organism influence its appearance, behavior and survival?
* How does the inheritance of genetic information ensure the continuity of humans as a species?

### The cell cycle is tightly regulated

The cell cycle comprises interphase, nuclear division and cytokinesis. There are two types of nuclear division: mitosis and meiosis. A cell cycle that involves mitosis will give rise to genetically identical cells and this is important for growth, repair and asexual reproduction of organisms. This cycle is coupled intricately and inexplicably with another important process of the living cell i.e. DNA replication, which occur during synthesis phase of interphase. The mitotic cell cycle is tightly regulated at various checkpoints that control the rate of cell division; uncontrolled cell division could result in cancer.

A cell cycle that involves meiosis occurs in reproductive organs of organisms and is important for sexual reproduction. Meiosis results in sex cells having half the amount of genetic material present in somatic cells. The crossing-over of non-sister chromatids and independent assortment of bivalents in meiosis, together with random fertilisation of male and female gametes, give rise to genetic variation in populations. Genetic variation is necessary for natural selection to occur. Homogeneity of a population can result in the entire population being wiped out by diseases or climatic changes.

## Learning Outcomes

### Core Idea 2E: The Cell Cycle

_There are two different types of cell cycles: mitotic and meiotic. Cell cycles are tightly regulated at various checkpoints. The mitotic cell cycle is necessary for growth and repair while the meiotic cell cycle is necessary to generate gametes. Meiosis gives rise to genetic variation between gametes through crossing over of homologous chromosomes and independent assortment of bivalents._

Candidates should be able to:

* Describe the events that occur during the mitotic cell cycle and the main stages of mitosis (including the behavior of chromosomes, nuclear envelope, cell surface membrane and centrioles).
* Explain the significance of the mitotic cell cycle (including growth, repair and asexual reproduction) and the need to regulate it tightly (knowledge that dysregulation of checkpoints of cell division can result in uncontrolled cell division and cancer is required, but detail of the mechanism are not required.)
* Describe the events that occur during the meiotic cell cycle and the main stages of meiosis (including the behavior of chromosomes, nuclear envelope, cell surface membrane and centrioles). (Names of the main stages are expected, but not that sub-divisions of prophase).
* Explain the significance of the meiotic cell cycle (including how meiosis and random fertilization can lead to variation).

## 1 Introduction

### _Somatic cells, Germ cells and gametes_

* In this topic, we will be mainly talking about cell division in eukaryotic cells and multicellular organisms.
* A **somatic cell** (diploid) is any cell in a multicellular organism **other** than those involved in gamete formation (Fig. 1.1). Examples: muscle cell, liver cell, neurons, blood cells, bone marrow cells, etc.
* A **germ cell** (diploid) is a cell that develops into an egg or a sperm (usually haploid).
* A **gamete** is a sperm or an egg cell (usually haploid). They typically carry **half the amount** of DNA and half the number of chromosomes that a somatic cell in the same organism carries.

### _Gene_

* A gene (Fig. 1.2) is an **inheritable and specific sequence of nucleotides** on a **DNA molecule**, which **codes for a RNA** (e.g. tRNA, rRNA, telomerase RNA) or **polypeptide** (e.g. amylase).
* A single chromosome can carry many genes.

Fig. 1.2: Genes are found on chromosomes. One chromosome contains many genes.

Fig. 1.1: The relationship between somatic cells, germ cells and gametes.

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:5]

### 1.4 Locus / Loci

* Within each species, each gene occupies a fixed position on a particular chromosome. This **fixed position of a gene on a chromosome** is called a **locus** (Fig. 1.4 and Fig. 1.5).
* Alleles of a gene occupy the **same relative position** on **a pair of homologous chromosomes** (Fig. 1.5). They occur in **pairs** in a diploid cell and only one of a homologous pair is present in a gamete (haploid).

### 1.5 Chromosomes

#### Chromatin

* Chromatin is a complex of DNA and proteins that forms chromosomes within the nucleus of eukaryotic cells.
* **The negatively-charged DNA molecule** is first coiled **around positively-charged histone proteins** to give **nucleosomes**.
* Each histone is made of **eight** protein subunits i.e. **a** protein **octamer**.

* The nucleosomes are connected by **linker DNA** to give the "beads-on-a-string" form of chromatin (Fig.1.6a).

Figure 1.5: A diagrammatic explanation of a homologous pair of chromosomes, gene loci and their alleles.

* This structure is then coiled to form the **30nm solenoid** (about six nucleosomes per turn) (Fig. 6a).
* This forms **chromatin** as seen in **non-dividing cells** (Fig. 6b).
* **Chromatin** (Fig. 6c) is **not visible** under the **light microscope** but regions of **euchromatin** and **heterochromatin** are visible in **electron micrographs**.
* **Individual chromosomes** are **visible only** when the chromatin is **further condensed** during nuclear division (mitosis or meiosis) (Fig. 6d).
* **One chromosome** consists of **one DNA molecule**. Most eukaryotic organisms have a certain specific number of chromosomes. (E.g. most humans have 46 chromosomes.)

### Duplicated Chromosomes

* Prior to nuclear division, **DNA replication** (Fig. 7a) occurs at the **S phase of Interphase**.

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:9]

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:10]

* **Diploid**
* A **diploid** cell or diploid organism has **two sets of chromosomes**. In sexually reproducing organisms, one set is from the **male** parent and the other set is from the **female** parent.
* The diploid condition is designated as **2n**, where \(n\) denotes number of chromosomes in one set of chromosome.
* E.g. In fruit-files, 2n = 8; n = 4
* A number is given to every different type of chromosomes in a cell of a specific organism (exception is the sex chromosome, either X or Y).
* In fruit flies, there are 4 different types of chromosomes. The chromosomes are numbered as chromosome 1, chromosome 2, chromosome 3 and chromosome X or Y as in the diagram (Fig. 1.10).
* Chromosome X and Y are known as **sex chromosomes*
* in most species. Chromosomes 1, 2 and 3 are known as **autosomes**.
* are chromosomes carrying genes that code for phenotypic characteristics except sex and sexual characteristics.
* Sex chromosomes carry the genes that determine the sex of the organism.
* Advantages of possessing two sets of chromosomes or being diploid:
* **Greater genetic variation*
* as each individual will have a mixture of characteristics from **both*
* If a gene on one chromosome of a pair is faulty, the second chromosome may provide a **normal back up copy*
* (with the exception of the sex-determining chromosome in males).
* **Haploid**
* A cell or an organism is haploid if it contains **half the diploid number (n) of chromosomes**.
* The haploid condition is usually found in the **gametes** (sperm or ovum). Haploid organisms like male worker bees exist.
* A haploid cell or organism has only **one set of chromosomes** (half the diploid number of chromosomes). E.g. a somatic human skin cell has 46 chromosomes (2n) while a haploid human egg cell has 23 chromosomes (n).

### **Polypioly**

* A cell or an organism is **polyloid** if it contains more than 2 sets of chromosomes.
* **Polyloidy** occurs very rarely in animals. E.g. the Plains Viscacha Rat is tetraploid (4n). Polyloidy can be induced artificially; e.g. genetically modified salmon are triploid (3n).
* Polyloidy is more common in plants. E.g. Domestic oat (6n), peanut (4n) and sugar cane (8n).

#### a) Non-Sister Chromatids

* This refers to **chromatids of a pair of homologous chromosomes** (Fig. 12). They are **not** genetically identical as they come from different sources (two parents).

#### b) Synapsis

* It is the **process of pairing up** of homologous chromosome to form bivalents (Fig. 13).
* This process happens in **prob

## 2 Cell Theory and the Cell Cycle

* **All cells arise from pre-existing cells by cell division**. The ability of organisms to reproduce is the one characteristic that best distinguishes living things from non-living matter.
* The continuity of life is based on the reproduction of cells, or **cell division**.
* The cell division process is an integral part of the **cell cycle**, which can be defined as the time period from the **formation of a cell** from a dividing parent cell until the point when the **cell itself divides again**.
* **Mitosis** is an integral part of the **cell cycle**, which is the life of a cell from its origin in the division of a parent cell until its own division into two daughter cells. At the end of each cell cycle, **genetically identical daughter cells** are produced.
* **Meiosis** is a specialised type of nuclear division that occurs in all **sexually reproducing** eukaryotes.
* The **division of the nucleus**, either by mitosis or meiosis, is usually followed by the division of the cytoplasm, called **cytokins**.
* **Nuclear division** (mitosis or meiosis) is just one small part of the eukaryotic cell cycle. (Fig.2.1)
* After learning about nuclear division, you will learn about the molecular control system that regulates the cell cycle and what happens when the control system malfunctions.

* The **length of a cell cycle** varies from cell to cell, and also **depends** on **nutrient availability**, **oxygen supply** and **temperature**. Actively dividing cells usually undergo a regular cycle lasting 15 to 20 hours.

Figure 2.1: (Left) Diagrammatic representation of the cell cycle. (Right) Approximate time frame of each phase in a 16-hour cell cycle.

* The eukaryotic **cell cycle** can be divided into three parts: 1. **Interphase:** which consists of three subphases, \(\text{G}_{1}\), S and \(\text{G}_{2}\), during which the cell produces many materials required for its own growth and for carrying out its functions. DNA replication occurs in S phase of interphase before mitosis or meiosis can occur. 2. **Mitosis/meiosis: nuclear division** including the division of genetic material. 3. **Cytokines:** division of the cytoplasm.
* The **stem cells*
* of an organism (Fig. 2.2) are usually capable of continuous renewal (i.e. cell division).
* Most cell types **never divide again*
* after they have grown and **become specialized*
* e.g. guard cells in plants and most cells in the nervous system (e.g. neurons or nerve cells, Fig 2.2).
* **DNA**, the genetic material in the nucleus, is the source of information responsible for the development and growth of the cell, as well as the whole organism.
* Hence the DNA of the parental cells **needs to be passed to the daughter cells** when cell and nuclear division occurs.

Fig. 2.2: Stem cells and the specialised cells they can differentiate into.

- A process by which a **nucleus** divides **once** to produce **two daughter nuclei**, each **genetically identical** to the original/parental nucleus (Fig. 3). 2. **Meiosis**
- A process by which a **nucleus** divides **twice** to produce **four daughter nuclei**, each containing **half the number of chromosomes** of the original/parental nucleus. It is also known as **reduction division** since the process halves the number of chromosomes in the parental nucleus.

* or **cytoplasmic division*
* is the process by which the rest of the cell (other than the nucleus) divides to give two daughter cells. Cellular organelles are also redistributed in the process.
* **Organisation of DNA, the genetic material in the cell*
* All the **DNA*
* found in a cell of a particular organism is called its **genome**.
* While the genome of a **prokaryotic*
* cell is often a **single*
* DNA molecule (a single circular chromosome), the **eukaryotic*
* genome consists of a **number*
* of DNA molecules (a number of linear chromosomes). The overall length of eukaryotic DNA is many times that of prokaryotic DNA. For example, a typical human cell has about 2 metres of DNA, which is 250,000 times longer than the diameter of the nucleus.
* For this enormous length of DNA to be packed into the nucleus, be replicated and then distributed equally between the two daughter cells, the **DNA molecules are packaged into chromatin**_(Part 1 of Cell and Nuclear Division, page 1)_.

Figure 3: Mitosis. From stages 1 - 5, the cell undergoes nuclear division. Note that two nuclei are formed during stage 5. From stages 5 - 6, the cell undergoes cytoplasmic division, which eventually gives rise to two cells by stage 6.

### Organisation of the Eukaryotic Chromosome

* After each DNA molecule **replicates** in the S phase (Fig. 3.2), there will be **two identical DNA** molecules joined together by a **centromere**.
* As the cell **enters mitosis** (i.e. the dividing cell), the duplicated chromatin **condenses** to become a **duplicated chromosome** (Fig. 3.3). Each duplicated chromosome consists of two **genetically identical sister chromatids** held together at the **centromere**.

_An animation on how the eukaryotic chromosome condenses to form the structures seen during nuclear division: [https://dnalc.cshl.edu/resources/3d/07-how-dna-is-packaged-basic.html_](https://dnalc.cshl.edu/resources/3d/07-how-dna-is-packaged-basic.html_)

* Each **chromatid** carries several hundred to a few thousand **genes**, the units that specify the organism's characteristics or traits.
* Later in the mitotic process, the two sister chromatids of each duplicated chromosome separate and end up in each of the two nuclei. Thus, the resulting nuclei / cells are **genetically identical**.

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:26]

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:27]

* **Nuclear envelope disintegrates.** The nuclear membrane dissociates into small vesicles and the nuclear pore complexes also dissociate.
* **The spindle fibres are attached to the kinetochores bound to the centromeres of each chromosome in late prophase.** **Spindle fibres will move the kinetochores bound to the centromeres of the chromosomes towards the centre of the cell in the next phase.*** The **mitotic spindle** is now fully formed and spindle fibres are attached to the kinetochore on centromere of each duplicated chromosomes.
* **The chromosomes** are **aligned at the equator of the cell** (i.e. the **metaphase plate**), **equidistant** from the two poles of the mitotic spindle.
* This facilitates the **equal division of chromosomes** in the next phase and the production of **genetically identical daughter cells.

### Significance of Mitosis

* To maintain the genetic stability of the organism.
* The two daughter cells produced from mitosis contain chromosomes that are **genetically identical*
* to the parent cell's chromosomes.
* This is due to:
* the **separation of sister chromatids*
* during **anaphase*
* of mitosis.
* **no chiasma*
* formed and **no crossing over*
* occur during mitosis, maintaining genetic fidelity (i.e. same alleles and the **same nucleotide sequence*
* on each chromosome).
* To **maintain the diploid state*
* of the next generation of cells. This is possible due to:
* **Replication of the parental DNA*
* during **interphase*
* before mitosis begins.
* The amount of DNA is **doubled*
* during **interphase**,
* so that DNA **returns to the original amount*
* after **separation of sister chromatids*
* at **anaphase*
* (Fig. 4.2).
* The **arrangement of the chromosomes at the equator*
* during **metaphase**.
* This ensures that the **sister chromatids*
* are divided equally between the two daughter nuclei during anaphase.

Figure 4.2: Summary of mitosis.

### Functions of Mitosis

Mitotic cell division has several important functions in the life of an eukaryotic organism:

**a)**: **The growth of a multicellular organism**

* Mitosis enables a multicellular organism to develop from a single fertilized egg cell (called the zygote) after fertilisation. Mitosis increases the number of cells, hence the size/mass of the organism.
* Examples: The growth of a seedling into an adult plant. Growth from a single-cell zygote to adult human.
**b)**: **Cell replacement and Tissue repair**

* In a multicellular organism, cells are constantly dying from wear and tear or accidents. **Replacement of cells** involves mitosis. E.g. Repair of wounds, dividing cells in the bone marrow continuously make new red blood cells as RBCs have a life span of approximately three months.
**c)**: **Regeneration of body parts**

* Some organisms are able to regenerate body parts. E.g. starfish replaces their arms via mitosis.
**d)**: **Asexual Reproduction**

* Producing genetically identical offspring from parents is the key to successful colonisation of a new habitat by a species.
* Asexual reproduction enables the rapid spread of adaptable individuals in a particular type of environment.
* Many organisms like onion and ginger are propagated in this manner.

## 5 Cytokinesis

* is a process whereby the **cytoplasm of the cell divides*
* to give two daughter cells with the **same organelles as the parent cell**, each containing one of the newly formed nuclei.
* **Note that cytokinesis and mitosis are separate processes*
* which depend on different molecular machinery.
* In many cells, telophase and cytokinesis occur **concurrently**. The speed at which each process occurs varies between cells.
* In animal cells, a **cleavage furrow*
* (Fig. 5.1) appears in the cell membrane as a result of a ring of microfilaments forming midway between the poles of the cell. The cleavage furrow deepens until the cell is pinched into two, producing two completely separated cells.
* In plant cells, a series of **Golgi vesicles line up*
* in the **middle*
* of the **parent cell*
* (Fig. 5.2). The Golgi vesicles **fuse to form the cell plate**, which extends outwards across the equator of the parent cell. The contents of the Golgi vesicles **form the cell wall*
* of the daughter cells while their membranes contribute to the cell surface membranes of the daughter cells.
* The **contents*
* of the Golgi vesicles involved in plate formation include:

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:35]

**b)**: \(\mathbf{G_{2}}\) checkpoint
* The cell checks for **DNA damage / mutation** after DNA replication.
* Cell continues on to mitosis or meiosis only if there is no DNA mutation or the DNA damage is repaired.
* This prevents **mutations** from being passed onto the daughter cells.
**c)**: **Metaphase checkpoint** (Fig. 6.2b)
* The cell checks for the **attachment of spindle fibres to the centromeres of the chromosomes** before **anaphase** is allowed to take place.
* This is also known as the **spindle assembly checkpoint**.
* Cell division will be arrested and switched to the \(\mathbf{G_{0}}\) phase if spindle fibres are not properly attached to the **kinetochores** at the centromeres.
* This prevents mistakes from occurring during cell division. (E.g. nondisjunction.)

Figure 6.2: How the checkpoints function to regulate the cell cycle.

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:37]

## 7 Meiosis

* Meiosis is the process by which a **nucleus divides twice** to produce four daughter nuclei, each containing **half the number of chromosomes of the original nucleus**.
* Meiosis is known also as **reduction division** since it **halves the number of chromosomes** in the parental nucleus of a diploid organism.
* In the life of a sexually reproducing organism, meiosis occurs during the **formation of gametes** (ovum and sperm) from the germ cells, producing **haploid nuclei** in the gametes. The ovum and sperm fuse together during fertilisation to **restore the diploid condition** in the zygote (Fig. 7.1).
* Offspring inherit genes by **inheriting chromosomes from both parents**.
* In the life cycle of sexually reproducing organisms, fertilisation (fusion of male and female gametes) and meiosis (production of gametes) occurs.
* Meiosis reduces the **number of chromosome sets from diploid to haploid** so that upon fertilisation of gametes, the diploid condition is restored in the offspring (Fig. 7.1).
* Meiosis produces **genetic variation** that contributes to evolution.
* Similar to mitosis, **interphase** occurs **before meiosis**.
* There are two consecutive nuclear divisions (Fig. 7.2) in meiosis
* **Meiosis I*
* (1st meiotic division) - separation of homologous chromosomes
* **Meiosis II*
* (2nd meiotic division) - separation of sister chromatids
* After meiosis,
* The number of chromosomes is **halved*
* (Fig. 7.2)
* The ploidy of the cell is reduced. E.g. from **diploid (2n) to haploid (n)**.

Figure 7.1: Meiosis in sexually reproducing organisms produced haploid gametes and fusion of gametes restores the diploid conditionFigure 7.2: An overview of meiosis, also known as reduction division as the number of chromosomes is halved after two consecutive nuclear divisions—i.e. a diploid cell becomes haploid after meiosis and cell division.

### Stages of Meiosis

* Chromatin **condenses*
* to form **visible chromosomes**.
* **confenced duplicated chromosomes*
* in order to divide intact.
* **Homologous chromosomes** pair up by a process called **synopsis**. Each pair of homologous chromosomes constitutes a **bivalent** (also known as a **tetrad**).
* Each chromosome continues to shorten and thicken and is seen to consist of **two sister chromatids** joined at the **centromere**.
* **Centrioles migrate to opposite ends*
* of the cell to stretch spindle fibres across the two poles.
* The **nucleolus*
* disappears, RNA transcription no longer occurs and ribosome assembly is halted.
* This allows the formation of the **pole-to- centromere and pole-to-pole spindle fibres**.
* Many of the key events of **meiosis*
* depend on spindle fibres of the **meiotic*
* **Chiasmata** (singular: chiasma) may form **between non-sister chromatids of homologous chromosomes**, resulting in **crossing over**.
* **Crossing over occurs, the process in which corresponding sections of the chromatids are exchanged.
* **After crossing over**, the sister chromatids of a duplicated chromosome are **no longer genetically identical**.

* **The chromatids** are now at their **shortest and thickest**. At this stage, there is still attachment between the sister chromatids throughout their full length.

Fig. 6.1: Crossing over during prophase I of meiosis results in recombinant chromosomes in daughter cells.

* **Spindle fibres are attached to kinetochores at the centromere of each duplicated chromosome.**
* **The bivalents** or pairs of homologous chromosomes move to align at the equator of the spindle in two rows.**
* **The arrangement of the chromosomes of each bivalent is independent of the orientation of the other bivalents.**
* **This is known as independent assortment of homologous chromosomes (Mendel's Law of Independent Assortment of homologous chromosomes).**

**Some potential combinations as a result of independent assortment**

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:43]

* The **chromatids** reach their respective **poles** and become the **chromosomes** of the **daughter cells.**
* **Chromosomes uncoil*
* and return to their original thread-like form.*
* **The chromatids need to uncoil before cellular processes can take place.**
* **Spindle fibres disintegrate.*
* **Spindle fibres are no longer required.**
* **Nuclear envelope reforms around the chromosomes at each pole*
* **Recall the function of the nuclear envelope.**
* **Nucleoli reappear.*
* **Recall the function of the nucleolus.**
* In cells where telophase I and interphase (without DNA replication) have occurred, the **nucleoli*
* are no longer visible and **nuclear envelopes of each cell disintegrate**. This facilitates the formation of the **meiotic spindle**.
* This allows for the formation of spindle fibres **between-poles*
* and **pole-to-centromere*
* spindle formation.
* DNA replication does not occur as this would lead to polyploidy after fertilisation.
* If **centrioles*
* are present, they **move to opposite poles**.
* The function of centrioles is to form the **meiotic spindle**, a framework of **microtubules*
* spanning the cell that is responsible for the division of genetic material.
* **Spindle fibres develop*
* but the direction of the axis is **at right angles to the spindle axis of meiosis I**.
* Many of the key events of meiosis depend on spindle fibres of the **meiotic*
* The **meiotic spindle** is now fully formed and spindle fibres are attached to the kinetochores on centromeres of the duplicated chromosomes.
* The duplicated **chromosomes** are **aligned at the equator of the cell in one row** (i.e. the **metaphase plate**), **equidistant** from the two spindle poles.
* The arrangement of duplicated chromosomes at the equator is **random and independent (Mendel's Law of Independent Assortment of non-identical sister chromatids).**
* This means that the arrangement of each chromosome is not dependent on the arrangement of other chromosomes.
* This results in **genetic variation in the daughter cells formed.*** The **centromere-to-pole*
* Tension is created in the spindle fibres and enough force is produced to **divide the****centromeres*
* of the duplicated chromosomes.
* At the same time, the **pole-to-pole** **microtubules lengthen**, pushing the poles apart.
* **Centromeres of each duplicated chromosome divide**.
* The genetically different **non-identical sister chromatids separate** and are **pulled by the spindle fibres to opposite poles**, at the centromeres.
* The daughter nuclei produced after this nuclear division are **genetically different** as the **non-identical sister chromatids** are divided equally between the potential daughter cells.
* If crossing over occurs at problem I, the duplicated chromosomes separate and **non-identical sister chromatids** are **pulled to the opposite poles** at anaphase II* The **chromatids reach the respective poles** and become the **chromosomes** of daughter cells.
* Upon **reaching the opposite poles of the spindle**, the **chromatids uncoil** and return to their original thread-like form (chromatin).
* The **spindle fibres disintegrate**.
* Both the **nuclear envelope** and the **nucleoli** reform.
* Recall the function of the nuclear envelope.
* Recall the function of the nucleolus.
* At the end of meiosis II, the parental nucleus has divided to give rise to **four genetically different daughter nuclei**. Each daughter nucleus has a **haploid** number of chromosomes.
* Meiosis results in **genetic variation** in sexually reproducing organisms as the gametes contain combinations of alleles different from that in the parental cells.
* Meiosis reduces the ploidy so that the **diploid condition will be restored after fertilisation**.
* Meiosis II halves the original mass of DNA of the parental cell so that the mass of DNA will be restored after fertilisation.

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:49]

### Significance of Meiosis

* Meiosis results in the production of haploid gametes (sperm and ovum) as a result of the separation of homologous chromosomes during anaphase I.
* During **fertilisation**, the **fusion*
* of male and female nuclei, causes the cell / zygote to **return to its diploid state*
* (Fig. 7.1 and 7.4).
* If meiosis did not occur, there would be a doubling in the number of sets of chromosomes in each successive generation (a condition known as **polylploidy**).
* Meiosis results in **genetic variation*
* which is essential for **natural selection*
* and **evolution.*
* Genetic variation produces **variation in the expressed traits*
* (phenotype) to ensure that the **species as a whole can constantly adapt when environmental conditions change**.
* Genetic variation allows **natural selection*
* to operate, where only **individuals best suited to the existing environmental conditions survive*
* to reproductive age and produce offspring.
* Refer to lecture notes on "Biological Evolution" in JC2 for detailed explanation on genetic variation and natural selection.

### How Meiosis gives rise to Genetic Variation

**a)**: **Crossing over in Prophase I** (during Meiosis)
**e)**: In prophase I, **non-ister chromatids of homologous chromosomes** align themselves alongside one another, and form chiasma.
**e)**: During **crossing over**, **new combinations of alleles** on the chromosomes of the gametes are formed (Fig. 7.5). **b)**: (Mendel's Law of) **Independent Assortment and Segregation** (during Meiosis)
**e)**: During **metaphase I** and **anaphase I** respectively, the **arrangement** and subsequent **separation** of the **homologous chromosomes** of each bivalent is **independent** of the orientation of the other bivalents (Fig. 7.6). **e)**: During metaphase II and **anaphase II** respectively, the **arrangement** and subsequent **separation** of the **non-identical sister chromatids** of each chromosome is **independent** of the orientation of the other chromosomes (Fig. 7.7). **e)**: Independent assortment and segregation produces **new combinations** of **chromosomes** in **gametes**. **c)**: **Random fusion of gametes** (during Fertilization)
**e)**: This source of variation is **not directly caused** by the process of meiosis. **e)**: The **random fusion** of **gametes** produced by meiosis results in even more possible **combinations** of chromosomes formed in zygotes after fertilisation. **e)**: A human with 23 homologous pairs can potentially produce of \(2^{23}\) = 8,388,608 combinations of chromosomes (Formula = 2\({}^{n}\)) in their gametes, where \(n\) represents the number of chromosomes in one haploid set (i.e. one human egg cell contains 23 chromosomes).

### Differences between Cell Division in Animal and Plant cells

**Centioles are involved in the formation of spindle fibres.**

Cytoplasmic division involves furrowing of plasma membrane and cleavage of cytoplasm.

Cytoplasmic division involves the formation of a cell plate derived from Golgi vesicles.

Occurs mainly in the **meristems** (regions where active cell division occurs).

Checklist for Cell Cycle:

Are you able to confidently answer all?

1. List the phases of the cell cycle and describe the sequence of events that occurs during each phase.
2. Describe the major events of cell division that enable the genome of one cell to be passed on to two daughter cells.
3. Compare cytokinesis in animals and in plants.
4. Describe the behaviour of centrioles and spindle fibres (microtubules) during each phase of mitosis.
5. Describe the roles of checkpoints in the cell cycle control system.
6. Explain how haploid and diploid cells differ from each other. State which cells in the human body are diploid and which are haploid.
