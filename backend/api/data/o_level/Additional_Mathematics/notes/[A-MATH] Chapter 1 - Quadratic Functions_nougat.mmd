**Slogs** \\ In terms of the general case: \\ \(f(0)=\alpha^{2}+h\kappa+c\) \\ \(=a\left(x^{2}+\frac{b}{a}\right)+c\) \\ \(=a\left(\left[x+\frac{b}{2a}\right]-\left[\frac{b}{2a}\right]\right)+c\) \\ \(=a\left(\left[x+\frac{b}{2a}\right]\right)^{2}+\left[c-\left(\frac{b}{2a}\right] \right)^{2}\) \\ \(=a\left(x-h\right)^{3}+k\) \\ \end{tabular}

Real example:

\[f(0)=x^{2}+9x+12\] \[=\left(x+\frac{9}{2}\right)^{2}-\left(\frac{9}{2}\right)^{2}+12\] \[=\left(x+\frac{4}{2}\right)^{2}-\frac{8}{4}\]

Students must know how to deal with these \(2\) cases with factorising

- Coefficient of \(x^{2}\) is negative

- Coefficient of \(x^{2}\) is not \(1\)

\[\alpha^{2}+h\kappa+c=a\left(x^{2}+\frac{b}{2a}\right)+c\]

**1) Complete the square**

When we complete the square and achieve the form of \(y=a(x-h)^{2}+\text{k}\), we are able to derive our turning point.

Coordinates of turning point = (h, k)

* Tip: Let the bracket \((x-h)\) to be equals to \(0\).

**2) Using the line of symmetry**

Once we derive our \(x\)-intercepts, we can compute the line of symmetry by finding the midpoint: \(\frac{x_{1}+x_{2}}{2}\), where \(x_{1}\)and \(x_{2}\) are the x-intercepts.

Sub in the value of \(x\) found from the previous step into the equation and find the value of \(y\).

To find the \(x\)-intercept, sub \(y=0\).

To find the \(y\)-intercept, sub \(x=0\).

To find the turning point, use either Complete the square or finding the line of symmetry (Refer to previous page)

To determine the shape of the graph, we look at the coefficient of \(x^{2}\).

- If the coefficient of \(x^{2}\) is more than 0, it is a happy face.

- If the coefficient of \(x^{2}\) is less than 0, it is a sad face.

Conditions to be always positive or always negative

Method 1: Complete the square

When we complete the square and achieve the form of \(y=a(x-h)^{2}+k\), we can identify the maximum or minimum point. If the maximum point of the graph is below the \(x\)-axis, there will not be any intersections between the curve and the \(x\)-axis, therefore the graph will always be negative as it will always below the \(x\)-axis. If the minimum point of the graph is above the \(x\)-axis, there will not be any intersections between the curve and the \(x\)-axis, therefore the graph will always be positive as it will always be above the \(x\)-axis.

Method 2: Discriminant (This is covered in Chapter 2 so stay tune for our next chapter!)

Conditions for always positive:

- The coefficient of \(x^{2}\) is more than 0 AND the discriminant (always known as \(b^{2}-4ac\)) is lesser than 0.

Conditions for always negative:

- The coefficient of \(x^{2}\) is less than 0 AND the discriminant (always known as \(b^{2}-4ac\)) is lesser than 0.
