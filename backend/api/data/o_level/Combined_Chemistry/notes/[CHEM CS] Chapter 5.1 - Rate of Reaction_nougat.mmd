2CONDITIONS FOR EFFECTIVE COLLISION

1) SUFFICIENT ENERGY

2) Right ORIENTATION

Reactions occur when there are **effective collisions** between reacting particles.

In an effective collision, reactants would need to collide with sufficient energy and in the right orientation to form products.

**Both conditions have to be fulfilled** before an effective collision takes place and products can be formed.

## Size of reactant particles

The smaller the size of the particles, the faster the rate of reaction.

The reason is that having a smaller particle size means that the total surface area for interaction between reacting particles is greater.

The frequency of effective collisions in Reaction 1 is higher than 2 because of the greater total surface area that is exposed for interaction between reactants.

## 6 Conclusion of Reactants

A **higher concentration** means that within the same volume of reactants, there is a **higher number of reacting particles.**

For the reaction with 2 moldm\({}^{3}\), the initial gradient of the graph is steeper compared to the rest, indicating a higher reaction rate.

However, the volume of CO\({}_{2}\) produced for three reactions are the same. If the number of moles of the limiting reagent used in the reactions is the same, volume of CO\({}_{2}\) produced from the reactions will be the same.

## 6 Pressure Applied

The **higher the pressure, the higher the rate of reaction.**

At a higher pressure, the reactants are brought closer together due to the decrease in volume.

This means there are **more reactants per unit volume.** This would result in the rate of reaction to increase.

For the set-up at higher pressure, as there are more reactant particles per unit volume compared to the set-up at lower pressure, the reacting particles are closer together as well.

As a result, there would be more collisions between reactants and thus leading to a higher frequency of effective collisions.

**Temporary of system**

When the temperature of a system is increased, the average kinetic energy of the particles in the system increases too.

A higher temperature of a system means that:

1) Reactant particles have **higher kinetic energy and move faster**

2) The **fraction of reactant particles** in the system that have energy **more than or equal to the activation energy** is higher

These two factors would increase the **frequency of effective collisions** and resulting in an increase in the rate of reaction.

USE OF CATAXYSIS

A catalyst provides an alternative reaction pathway that allows a **lower activation energy barrier**.

As less activation energy is required, a higher number of **reacting particles** will have sufficient kinetic energy to overcome the activation energy barrier for reaction. Hence, it is more likely to be an **effective collision**.

CHARACTERISTICS OF CATAXYSIS

1) A catalyst changes the rate of reaction without being chemically altered.

2) **The yield from the reaction is not altered** by catalyst.

3) The purpose of catalysts are to **speed up the rates of reactions** and only a **small amount of the catalyst is required**.

4) Many catalysts are **transition metals** due to variable oxidation states.
