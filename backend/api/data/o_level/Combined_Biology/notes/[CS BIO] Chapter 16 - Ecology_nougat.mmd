## Chapter Chapter Analysis

**ecosystem**

**Ecology** is the study of interactions between organisms and the interactions between these organisms and their environment

**Ecosystem** consists of a community and the abiotic environment / physical environment.

**- Community** is all the organisms that live in a particular habitat, thus these populations of organisms interact with one another.

**- Abiotic environment** is the physical factors in the environment that the community interacts with such as

pH of water and soil

affect enzyme activity

Temperature

affect enzyme activity and metabolism of organisms

Light Intensity

affect rate of photosynthesis

Water availability

water is important for the survival of all living things

Oxygen content

necessary for aerobic respiration

Salinity of water and soil

affect water potential of environment thus

water uptake or removal for plants

**food chain**

* **A food chain is a sequence of energy transferred in the form of food, between organisms in an ecosystem.**
* **Each level of the food chain is known as trophic level**
* **Interconnected food chains form a food web**

* **Producer:**
* **organisms that contain chlorophyll thus are able to convert light energy from the sun to chemical energy thus making their own food via photosynthesis**
* **provides food for other organisms in the community thus occupies first trophic level in food chain**
* **Consumer:**
* **Organisms that are not able to make their own food and obtain energy by feeding on other organisms**
* **Primary consumers feed on primary producers directly. They are herbivores.**
* **Secondary consumers feed on primary consumers. They are carnivores.**
* **Ternary consumers feed on secondary consumers. They are carnivores.**

* **Food Web:**
* **Food web consists of two or more food chains linked together.**Non-cyclic energy flow

1. In any ecosystem, the **ultimate source of energy is the Sun. Light energy** from the sun is absorbed by chlorophyll in producers and converted into **chemical energy** during photosynthesis
2. Plants make its **own food** via photosynthesis and **contain carbon** in the form glucose, sucrose, starch.
3. Energy is passed from **one trophic level to another** when primary consumer feed on the producers and so on.
4. Organisms at each trophic level **pass on about 10% energy** to the next trophic level compared to what they receive.
5. This is because **energy is lost** at every trophic level as **heat in respiration, uneaten organism parts and through excreted andested waste material**. These energy lost cannot be recycled.
6. Faces, excretory products and dead organisms **contain trapped chemical energy.** This energy is released through the activity of **decomposers**. Decomposers use some of this trapped chemical energy for their needs, releasing CO2. The rest of the energy is lost as heat.

* A pyramid of numbers shows the relative population of each trophic level in a food chain at a particular time
* Pattern: Usually, the number of producer at the base is highest number, as it is needed to **feed the next level**. The number of consumers gradually decreases towards the top
* Disadvantage: It is **not an accurate estimate** of the amount of energy at each trophic level because the **population number** does not always correspond to the **amount of energy** it can transfer to the next trophic level, e.g. a single tree can support a large population of caterpillars

**Pyramid of food chain**

**pyramid of biomass**

- A **pyramid of biomass** shows the dry mass of organisms at each trophic level in a food chain.

- Pattern: The **biomass of the producer is the largest** as it **supplies all the energy** for the resumers. Biomass is lost along the food chain due to loss of energy thus **biomass decreases along the food chain.**

- Disadvantages:

- Dry mass **cannot be easily obtained** from every animal e.g. human being, large animals like tiger

It is also **destructive** as it involves drying the organism at 100 \({}^{\circ}\)C, which will affect the food chain/ food webcarbon cycle

**Removal of carbon dioxide**

1. Plants convert atmospheric carbon dioxide into glucose during

** photosynthesis.** Glucose can be converted to other carbohydrates, proteins and fats within the plants

**Return of carbon dioxide**

2. Carbon dioxide is returned to the atmosphere when **cellular respiration** takes

place in living organisms.

3. When the plants and animals die, **decomposers** such as bacteria and fungi

**break down the organic matter** into carbon dioxide, which is released back to

the atmosphere

4. Fossil fuels are formed from the **fossilised remains of dead plants and animals**.

Carbon compounds from these dead organisms are stored as **fossil fuels**.

5. When **fossil fuels and wood are burnt**, carbon dioxide is produced.

**Importance of carbon cycle**

- Ensures that there is a continuous supply of carbon dioxide for plants to carry out photosynthesis.

- Allows photosynthesis to convert light energy from the Sun into chemical

energy in food, which non-photosynthetic organisms can feed on to stay alive.

- Enables energy to flow through the ecosystem. Carbon compounds carry the stored energy from organism to organism in the food chains of an ecosystem.

- Maintains the correct concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.

**carbon sinks**

An area that that absorbs more carbon than it releases as carbon dioxide

**Access**

* Atmospheric carbon dioxide is absorbed by the ocean as carbon dioxide dissolves in the ocean's water
* Dissolved CO2 is used by phytoplankton and algae in photosynthesis.
* Iron compounds increases the photosynthetic activity of phytoplankton.
* The organisms in the oceans store carbon compound. When they die, they may sink and be buried deep in the seabed and may form fossil fuels.

**Forests**

* The plants in forests absorb atmospheric carbon dioxide for photosynthesis
* A large amount of carbon compound is stored in trees. When trees die, they are buried deep in the ground and form coal, a kind of fossil fuels.

**Key Concept**

**water pollution**

**sewage treatment**

# water pollution

###### Abstract

Pollution is the contamination of the environment due to addition of substances called pollutants, causing harm and damage to the ecosystem.

* Water pollution can be caused by **sewage*
* and **inorganic waste*
* consists mainly of organic wastes such as detergents, oils and fats, insecticides and herbicides, and debris
* Inorganic waste consists of leached nutrients and fertilisers (nitrates and phosphates) from farmland, ammonia, sulfur dioxide from power plants, and heavy metals.
* They are **discharged directly into water*
* without undergoing treatment
* Some of these pollutants can be **directly toxic*
* to the living organisms in the water, causing them to die.
* Contaminated water usually **encourages growth of microorganisms** such as bacteria, parasites and viruses. These could lead to **diseases** such as gastroenteritis, cholera, typhoid and parasitic infection.
* **Eutrophication**, which is the **excessive growth of algae and water plants** due to excessive nutrients of **phosphates and nitrates**

**water pollution**

When pollutants such as mercury, arsenic and DDT (dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane) are released into the environment, they are non-biodegradable, which means it cannot be broken down by the environment so it persists in the environment. they also enter the bodies of organism.

**Bioaccumulation refers to certain substances that cannot be broken down (detoxified) and excreted by organisms, thus they accumulate in the fatty tissues of organism. It occurs within an organism. However, the concentration may not be high enough to cause the organism to die**

**Bioamplification is the increase in concentration of a substances up a food chain. The organism at the higher trophic level contain higher concentration of substances. It occurs in a food chain across trophic levels. Thus, the tertiary consumers are most susceptible to problems arising from such pollutants as the concentration of toxic substances may reach a fatal level**

**Sewage treatment**

environmental biotechnology

1.In sewage treatment plants, sewage is added to the **setting tanks** for screening, where **large solids are removed**.

2.The sewage liquid is then sent to the **primary settlement tank**, where **smaller solid suspensions** to settle to the bottom of the tank as **primary sludge** and removed.

3.The liquid then flows into an **aeration tank**, where pure **oxygen** is bubbled in and **aerobic bacteria** are added. The bacteria **decompose the organic waste into harmless substances**

4.The treated water is channeled into the **final settlement tank**. A portion of the sludge is returned to the aeration tank for reuse.

5.The sewage water leaving final settlement tank is **disinfected** to **reduce the number of microorganisms in the water** before it is discharged back into the environment.

6.The excess **sludge is sent to an anaerobic digester** where there is no oxygen. Anaerobic bacteria **decompose the organic matter in sludge**, producing **biogas**, mainly **methane**. Methane is used as a **fuel to generate electricity**. The remaining solid material is removed from the tank. It may be used as fertiliser or burnt in an incinerator.
