### General rules for the solubility of common salts in water

Do ionic compounds dissolve in water?

Yes. _Water molecules are attracted to ions. This weakens the electrostatic forces between the ions. The ions are pulled from the lattice structure. and the compound.......... dissolves to form aqueous solution._

However, solubility in water is dependent on temperature and nature of solute as well.

The table below summarises the general rules for solubility of the common salts in water at room temperature.

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|} \hline
**Soluble salts** & **Insoluble salts** \\ \hline All sodium, potassium, ammonium & & \\ salts & & \\ (**SPA**) & & \\ \hline All nitrates & & \\ \hline All Chlorides & except & Lead chloride, PbCl\({}_{2}\) \\ (**Clown Laugh \& Smile)** & & Silver chloride, AgCl/ \\ \hline All Sulfates & except & Barium sulfate, BaSO\({}_{4}\) \\ (**Super Big Chicken Leg)** & & Calcium sulfate, CaSO\({}_{4}\) \\ \hline Sodium carbonate, Na\({}_{2}\)CO\({}_{3}\) & & \\ Potassium carbonate, K\({}_{2}\)CO\({}_{3}\) & & \\ Ammonium carbonate, (NH\({}_{4}\))\({}_{2}\)CO\({}_{3}\) & & All carbonates \\ \hline Sodium hydroxide, NaOH & except & All hydroxides \\ Not & Potassium hydroxide, KOH & & Calcium hydroxide, Ca(OH)\({}_{2}\) \\ salts, & Ammonium hydroxide, NH\({}_{4}\)OH & & is slightly soluble \\ these & & \\ are & Sodium oxide, Na\({}_{2}\)O & & \\ bases. & Potassium oxide, K\({}_{2}\)O & & Calcium oxide, CaO is \\  & & \\ \hline \end{tabular}

**The solubility of a salt must be determined before we can choose a suitable method for preparing the salt.**

### 12.3 Water of Crystallisation

* Salts crystals are often formed by crystallisation from aqueous solutions, and thus often have water molecules bonded to them. This water is known as water of crystallisation.
* Salts that contain water of crystallisation are known as hydrated salts.
* Heating a hydrated salt drives away the water, leaving the anhydrous salt.

**(2) Reacting an acid with alkali via titration method**

* We can prepare a soluble salt by reacting with an acid with an alkali. However, because both reactants are usually colourless, and the products are also colourless and soluble in water, we have no way of determining when all the acid has completely reached with all the alkali. Hence. We use titration.

Preparation of pure and dry sodium chloride, a soluble salt.

**Step 1**

Identify solubility of salt sodium chloride, NaCl, is soluble in water

**Step 2**

Identify method of preparation NaCl contains the chloride anion use hydrochloric acid

What are possible reactants to react with hydrochloric acid? Sodium carbonate, sodium oxide, sodium hydroxide

Why is titration the most appropriate method to prepare sodium sulfate? Sodium carbonate, sodium oxide, sodium hydroxide are soluble in water. There is no way of determining if excess solid is added or only salt remains at the end of reaction. Thus titration with an indicator will be able to determine when the reaction is complete.

### Step 3

Summary of steps involved in preparation of soluble salts

Prepare the salt by following the steps.

Step 1: Fill up a burette with hydrochloric acid. Note the initial burette reading (V1 cm3).

Step 2: Pipette 25.0cm3 of sodium hydroxide into a conical flask

Step 3: Add 2 drops of methyl orange to the conical flask with the sodium hydroxide solution. The solution will turn yellow.

Step 4: While swirling, add hydrochloric acid from the burette slowly until solution turns orange permanently. This is the end-point. Record the final burette reading (V2 cm3).

Step 5: Find the volume of hydrochloric acid required for complete neutralisation (V2-V1 cm3)

Step 6: Pipette 25.0 cm3 of sodium hydroxide into another conical flask. Add (V2-V1 cm3) of hydrochloric acid from the burette. (Do not add indicator as it will make the salt impure)

**Step 7:** Heat the solution until it is saturated.

Step 8: Allow the saturated solution to cool so that sodium chloride salt can crystallise.

Step 9: Filter to collect the crystals. Wash the crystal with a little cold deionised water to remove impurities.

Step 10: Dry the crystals between a few sheets of filter paper.

Additional note:

Bromothymol blue ( yellow(<6) -- green -- blue (>8) ) ;

methyl orange ( red(<3) -- orange -- yellow (>5) )

#### 12.4.2 Preparation of Insoluble Salt

\(\text{Ag}^{+}(\text{aq})+\text{NO}_{3}(\text{aq})+\text{NaCl}(\text{aq})+\text{Cl}( \text{aq})\)\(\text{AgCl}(\text{s})+\text{NaCl}(\text{aq})+\text{NO}_{5}(\text{aq})\)

Final ionic equation: Ag^(aq)+Cl(aq)AgCl(s)Teacher note: Understanding the rationale for the method of salt preparation is useful for practical examination.

**Questions**

1. In the preparation of insoluble salt, two aqueous solutions (acid/alkali or soluble salts) are used to react with each other. Why must two solutions be used as the starting reactants? The salt produced is insoluble in water. Using two solutions as the starting reactants allow the resulting insoluble salt to be separated from the soluble reactants and by-product by filtration. The insoluble salt won be able to dissolves to give the ions for precipitation to occur.
2. Why can't an insoluble salt be used as one of the reactants? The insoluble salt cannot dissolves in water to produce the necessary ions in water.. for precipitation to take place...
3. Why is the precipitate rinsed with cold distilled water instead of warm distilled water? In general, precipitate formed is rinsed with cold distilled water instead of warm distilled water to prevent any possible dissolving of salt.
4. Note: for insoluble salt in precipitation, the dissolving of salt by rinsing is minimal due to its insoluble nature.
5. Why can metal/metal carbonate/metal oxide react with acid to form the insoluble salt? E.g. Preparation of calcium sulfate Why can we use Calcium with sulfuric acid to produce calcium sulfate? The amt of calcium sulfate formed will be very little. This is because an insoluble layer of calcium sulfate will coat the calcium metal, preventing any further reaction.

**Level 3**

4. Calcium carbonate is insoluble in water. Calcium sulfate and calcium hydroxide are both sparingly soluble in water. Three students were asked to suggest a method for making calcium sulfate from calcium carbonate: Method 1: Add dilute nitric acid to calcium carbonate, then add dilute sulfuric acid to the calcium nitrate solution formed. Method 2: Add dilute sulfuric acid to calcium carbonate. Method 3: Heat calcium carbonate strongly to give calcium oxide, then react the calcium oxide with dilute sulfuric acid. (a) Which method is the most suitable for preparing calcium sulfate? Write the equation(s) for any reaction(s) involved. Include state symbols. (b) Explain why the other two methods are less suitable. (c) Answer: 1 Method 1. The reactions are: CaCO\({}_{3}\) (s) + 2 HNO\({}_{3}\)(aq) - Ca(NO\({}_{3}\))\({}_{2}\) (aq) + H\({}_{2}\)O (l) + CO\({}_{2}\) (g) Ca(NO\({}_{3}\))\({}_{2}\) (aq) + H\({}_{2}\)SO\({}_{4}\) (aq) CaSO\({}_{4}\) (s) + 2 HNO\({}_{3}\) (aq) In methods 2 and 3, dilute sulfuric acid and calcium carbonate or calcium oxide react to from an insoluble layer of calcium sulfate, which prevents further reaction. In method 3, calcium carbonate has to be heated to a very high temperature before it decomposes. This makes the process difficult and time consuming.
