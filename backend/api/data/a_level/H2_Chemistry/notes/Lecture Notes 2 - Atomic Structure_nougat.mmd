### Behaviour of the subatomic particles in an electric field

* Consider the following beams of subatomic particles all travelling at the same speed:
* a beam of protons
* a beam of neutrons
* a beam of electrons
* When each of these beams is passed through an electric field, each beam is found to behave differently in the following aspects:
* the direction of deflection and
* the angle of deflection.
* Behaviour of the subatomic particles in an electric field
* The direction of deflection is dependent on the subatomic particle.
* The angle of deflection is proportional to the magnitude of the charge
* ratio of the particle.
* The larger the charge
* of the particle, the stronger is the attraction towards the oppositely charged plate:
* the greater the angle of deflection
* The larger the mass
* of the particle, the more difficult it is to cause it to deviate towards the oppositely charged plate.
* the smaller the angle of deflection Note: In this case, protons and electrons have the same charge in terms of magnitude. However, protons are heavier and hence the angle of deflection for the proton beam is smaller, i.e. \(x^{\circ}<y^{\circ}\)

### The electron

What do we know about electrons?

Electrons in an atom do not occupy fixed positions around the nucleus. They do not move in orbits (or fixed circular/elliptical paths) around the nucleus.

Electrons in an atom move in certain regions of space around the nucleus known as **atomic orbitals**.

Each electron has energy that is quantised (i.e. each electron has energy restricted to certain values). Each electron occupies a discrete energy level.

### Arrangement of electrons in atoms

The arrangement of electrons in an atom (or ion) is referred to its electronic structure.

The electronic structure provides us with the following information:

the number of electrons in the atom or ion

the distribution of electrons in the atom or ion

the energies of the electrons

It is important because it determines how the atom will react with other atoms to form ions or molecules.

### Electronic shells

Electrons in atoms are arranged in a series of shells or energy levels surrounding the nucleus. Each shell is described by a number known as the principal quantum number, n.

The principal quantum number n is a positive integer i.e. n = 1, 2, 3,... (numbered outward from the nucleus).

\begin{tabular}{c c} The greater the value of n, & \\ \(\circ\) the further the shell (or electron) is from the nucleus & \\ \(\circ\) the higher the energy level of the shell (or electron) & \\ \(\circ\) the weaker the electrostatic attraction between the nucleus and the electron & \\ \(\circ\) the larger the size of the orbital (or the orbital becomes more diffuse) & \\ \end{tabular}

Diagrams showing shells or energy levels corresponding to & \\ the different principal quantum numbers & \\ \end{tabular}

### Subshells (sub-levels) and orbitals

Each shell comprises of one or more **subshells**, Each subshell, in turn, comprises of one or more **orbitals**.

An **orbital** represents a region in space in which there is a high probability (\(>95\%\)) of finding an electron.

Each orbital can accommodate **2 electrons**.

Each orbital has a distinctive geometrical shape (see Section 3.6).

The 'energy of an orbital' is the **energy of the electron** occupying the orbital.

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:10]

* As the nuclear charge increases, the energies of all the orbitals decrease, i.e. the energies of the electrons occupying those orbitals(decrease).
* Due to their proximity to the nucleus, the spherically symmetrical s orbitals are affected to a greater degree than are the more angular p and d orbitals, and so their energies decrease more rapidly than the other types of orbitals.
* By(n = 4; there is, in fact **an overlap between the 3\({}^{\rm rd}\) and 4\({}^{\rm th}\) shells**. As seen from the graph above, **the energy of the 4s orbital has already become less than that of the 3d orbital** at \(Z=18\) (argon).

### Writing electronic configurations

Note: Electrons occupy the 4s orbital first before the 3d orbitals because the 4s orbital is at a lower energy level than the 3d orbitals (see page 11).

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:15]

### Ground state and excited state

* An atom is in the ground state when the electrons are in the orbitals of lowest available energy level. Most atoms are in their ground state at room temperature.
* The electronic configurations written so far on the earlier pages are all ground state electronic configurations (i.e. the most stable electronic configurations).
* An atom is in the excited state when one or more electrons absorb energy and are promoted to a higher energy level. Excited atoms are unstable and can emit energy to return to the ground state.

### Electronic configurations of ions

* Ions are formed when atoms gain or lose electrons.

(a) **Anions (negative ions)**

### Electronic configurations and isoelectronic species

Isoelectronic species are species with the same total number of electrons.

Examples of isoelectronic species:

Atoms or ion & Electronic configuration & Total number of electrons

N^->, O^-, F^-, Ne, Na^+ & 1s^2s^2p^6 & 10

Cr & 1s^2s^2p^2p^6 & 3s^2p^6 & 3d^5 & 1

Mn^+ & 1s^2s^2p^2p^6 & 3s^2p^6 & 3d^5 & 4s^+ & 24

Fe^2* & 1s^2s^2p^6 & 3s^2p^6 & 3d^5 & 24

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:18]

### Electronic configurations and the Periodic Table

* Based on the electronic configurations of the elements, the elements in the Periodic Table are grouped into four blocks, the**\(\mathbf{s}_{i}\)**,**\(\mathbf{p}_{i}\)**,**\(\mathbf{d}\) **and** \(\mathbf{f}\) **blocks**, as shown below.
* The name of each block is determined by whether an s, p, d or f subshell is being filled in successive elements of that block.
* **Horizontal rows** in the Periodic Table are called**periods**: Elements in the same period have the same number of electronic shells. The period number of an element is the number of electronic shells occupied with electrons in an atom of that element.
* **Vertical columns** in the Periodic Table are called**groups**. Elements in the same group have the same number of valence electrons and hence similar outer electron configurations.

## 5 Electrostatic Effects

Electrostatic effects - attraction of opposite charges and repulsion of like charges - play a major role in determining the energy states of atoms and hence influence their atomic properties, such as atomic size and ionisation energies.

The main factors that affect the strength of the electrostatic attraction between the nucleus and the electrons are:

### Number of electronic shells

If the number of shells increases,

the principal quantum number, n, of the outermost (valence) shell increases

distance between the nucleus and the valence electron increases

electrostatic attraction between the nucleus and the valence electron decreases

### Nuclear charge, Z

If the number of protons increases,

nuclear charge increases

electrostatic attraction between the nucleus and the valence electron increases

### 3 Shielding effect (or screening effect) by inner electrons

If the number of inner shell electrons increases

shielding effect experienced by the valence electron increases

electrostatic attraction between the nucleus and the valence electron decreases

Note: When discussing the trend of the atomic properties **across a period**, it is common to consider factors 2 and 3 together and state their combined net effect using the term, **effective nuclear charge**.

Note: We will be making use of these factors in explaining the trends and variations in:

atomic radius and ionic radius

first ionisation energies across a period

first ionisation energies down a group

successive ionisation energies of an element

electronegativityWhat is meant by shielding?

Since all electrons are negatively charged, they repel each other. The **electrons in inner shells repel the electrons in outer shells** and prevent them from experiencing the full effect of the actual nuclear charge. This is called **shielding**.

The greater the shielding of outer electrons **by the inner shell electrons**, the weaker the attractive forces between the nucleus and the outer electrons.

Note:

Electrons in the **same shelf** provide very poor shielding effect for one another.

For a given shell **n**, **shielding ability of electrons decreases** in the following order: **s > p > d > f**

d and f electrons usually **provide poor shielding effect** for outermost electrons from the nuclear charge because the **d** and **f** orbitals are rather diffuse.

## 6 ATOMIC RADIUS

### Definitions

* **Atomic radius** is defined as half the shortest inter-nuclear distance found in the structure of the element. This observed 'radius' of the atom depends upon _how the atom bonds or interacts with its neighbours_.

The metallic radius of an atom is half the inter-nuclear distance between two neighbouring atoms in the metal.
* Metallic radius is obviously restricted to those elements that form metallic lattices. Example: \(\mathrm{Mg}\) = 0.160 nm

The covalent radius of an atom is half the inter-nuclear distance between two covalently bonded atoms.

* Covalent radius may be measured for most elements Example: \(\mathrm{c_{f}}\) = 0.099 nm

The van der Waals' radius of an atom is half the inter-nuclear distance between atoms which are not chemically bonded.

Van der Waal's radius is most easily determined for non-metals, and is particularly useful for the lighter noble gases which do not form chemical bonds. Example: \(\mathrm{c_{f}}\) = 0.192 nm van der Waals' radius = 2 d,dw

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|} \hline Explanation: & Down a group, \\  & the number of electronic shells increases \\  & distance between the nucleus and the valence electrons increases \\  & Despite the increasing nuclear charge, \\  & electrostatic attraction between the nucleus and the valence electrons \\  & decreases, resulting in an increase in the size of the electron cloud. \\  & Hence atomic radii increase down a group. \\ \hline \end{tabular}

## 7 IONIC RADIUS

The ionic radius of an ion can be defined as the radius of the spherical ion in an ionic compound.

### Anionic radius (\(r_{\text{atom}}<r_{\text{anion}}\))

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|} \hline Observation: & The radius of an anion is always greater than that of the parent atom. \\ \hline Example: & S: 1s2 2s2 2p6 3s2 3p4 & S\({}^{2*}\): 1s2s2 2p6 3s2 3p8 \\  & rs: 0.104 nm & fug2*: 0.184 nm \\ \hline Explanation: & \(\bullet\) Both the anion and its parent atom have the same number of protons \\  & and hence have the same nuclear charge. \\  & However, the anion has more electrons than its parent atom. \\  & With more electrons, electron-electron repulsion increases \\  & & Electrostatic attraction between thenucleus and the valence electrons \\  & decreases, resulting in an increase in the size of the electron cloud. \\ \hline \end{tabular}

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:29]

Information which can be obtained from the above graph of successive ionisation energies

1. There are a total of 19 electrons present in an atom of the element. The electronic configuration of the element **X** is \(\frac{18^{2}28^{2}2^{2}2^{6}38^{2}3^{6}48^{7}}{48^{7}}\).
2. There are 4 electronic shells. A large jump in ionisation energies is observed when an electron is removed from a different shell, one that is inner and nearer to the nucleus, and hence experiences a stronger electrostatic attraction to the nucleus. The graph shows 3 such large increases in ionisation energies corresponding to the removal of the 2nd, 10th and 18th electron \(\Rightarrow\) there are 4 different electronic shells.
3. There is 1 valence electron and hence the element belongs to Group 1 of the Periodic Table. A large jump between the 1st and 2nd ionisation energies is observed. \(\Rightarrow\) significantly more energy is required to remove the 2nd electron as it is located in a different shell, one that is inner and nearer to the nucleus, and hence experiences a stronger electrostatic attraction to the nucleus. there is 1 valence electron the element belongs to Group 1 of the Periodic Table

Points to take note:

Data of successive ionisation energies of an element provides evidence for the existence of electronic shells of different principal quantum numbers (energy levels) and subsileils (sub-levels) in an atom. Large jump observed in two successive ionisation energies removal of electrons from different shells Moderate difference (i.e. small jump) between two successive ionisation energies removal of electrons from different subshells. The small jump between 7th and 8th ionisation energies is due to the removal of electrons from different subshells. The energy gap between subshells is not as big as that between shells and is sometimes not discernible. For example, a small jump is expected between the 15th and 16th ionisation energies (due to the removal of electrons from different subshells) but this is not observed in the graph.
