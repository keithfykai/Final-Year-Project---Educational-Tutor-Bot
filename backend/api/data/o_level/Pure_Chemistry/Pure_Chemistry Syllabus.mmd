## Introduction

The Ordinary Level Chemistry Syllabus is designed to place less emphasis on factual materials while having a greater emphasis on the understanding and application of scientific concepts and principles. This approach has been adopted in recognition of the need for students to develop skills that will be of long-term value in an increasingly complex and globalised world, rather than focusing on large quantities of factual material, which may have only short-term relevance.

It is envisaged that teaching and learning programmes based on this syllabus will feature a wide variety of learning experiences designed to promote acquisition of scientific expertise and understanding, and to develop values and attitudes relevant to science. Teachers are encouraged to use a combination of appropriate strategies including developing practical work for their students to facilitate a greater understanding of the subject. It is expected that students will apply investigative and problem-solving skills and effectively communicate the theoretical concepts covered in this course.

## Aims

The aims of a course based on this syllabus should be to:

1. provide a worthwhile educational experience for all students, whether or not they go on to study science beyond this level.
2. develop in students the understanding and skills relevant to the practices of science, and enable them to 2.1 appreciate practical applications of Chemistry in the real world 2.2 deepen their interest in Chemistry for future learning and work 2.3 become scientifically literate citizens who can innovate and seize opportunities in the 21 century 2.4 develop a way of thinking to approach, analyse and solve problems by explaining macroscopic characteristics and changes in chemical systems through the use of sub-microscopic and symbolic representations.
3. develop in students the values, ethics and attitudes relevant to science such as 3.1 curiosity - desiring to explore the environment and question what is found 3.2 creativity - seeking innovative and relevant ways to solve problems 3.3 integrity - handling and communicating data and information with complete honesty 3.4 objectivity - seeking data and information to validate observations and explanations without bias 3.5 open-mindedness - accepting all knowledge as tentative and suspending judgement, tolerance for ambiguity, willingness to change views if the evidence is convincing 3.6 resilience - not giving up on the pursuit of answers/solutions, willingness to take risks and embrace failure as part of the learning process 3.7 responsibility - showing care and concern for living things and awareness of our responsibility for the quality of the environment 3.8 healthy scepticism - questioning the observations, methods, processes and data, as well as trying to review one's own ideas.

## Practice of Science

The _Practices of Science_ represent the set of established procedures and practices associated with scientific inquiry, what scientific knowledge is and how it is generated and established, and how Science is applied in society respectively. It consists of three components:

### Demonstrating Ways of Thinking and Doing in Science (WoTD)

#### 1.1.1 Posing questions and defining problems

#### 1.2.1 Designing investigations

#### 1.3.1 Conducting experiments and testing solutions

#### 1.4.1 Analysing and interpreting data

#### 1.5.1 Communicating, evaluating and defending ideas with evidence

#### 1.6.2 Making informed decisions and taking responsible actions

#### 1.7.1 Using and developing models

#### 1.8.1 Constructing explanations and designing solutions

#### 2.1.2 Understanding the Nature of Scientific Knowledge (NOS)

1.3 Science is an evidence-based, model-building enterprise concerned with understanding the natural world

2.4 Science assumes there are natural causes for physical phenomena and an order and consistency in natural systems

3.1 Scientific knowledge is generated using a set of established procedures and practices, and through a process of critical debate within the scientific community

#### 2.4.2 Scientific knowledge is reliable and durable, yet open to change in the light of new evidence

#### 3.2.1 Relating Science, Technology, Society and Environment (STSE)

1.3 There are risks and benefits associated with the applications of science in society. Science and its applications have the potential to bring about both benefits and harm to society

#### 3.2.2 Applications of science often have ethical, social, economic and environmental implications

3.3 Applications of new scientific discoveries often inspire technological advancements while advances in technology motivate scientists to ask new questions and/or empower scientists in their inquiry (e.g. collecting more precise data or carrying out more complex data analysis)

The _Practices of Science_ serve to highlight that the discipline of Science is more than the acquisition of a _body of knowledge_ (e.g. scientific facts, concepts, laws, and theories); it is also a way of _thinking and doing_. In particular, it is important to appreciate that the cognitive, epistemic and social aspects of the _Practices of Science_ are intricately related. For example, observation of events can lead to the generation of scientific knowledge which is, simultaneously, shaped by the beliefs of scientific knowledge. In addition, scientists develop models to construct theories, based on the assumption that there is order and consistency in natural systems. The practice of theory-making, in turn, reinforces the explanatory power of scientific knowledge. The scientific endeavour is embedded in the wider ethical, social, economic and environmental contexts.

## Disciplinary ideas of Chemistry

The disciplinary ideas of Chemistry described below represent the overarching ideas which can be applied to explain, analyse and solve a variety of problems that seek to address the broader questions of what matter is and how particles interact with one another. Equipping students with a coherent view and conceptual framework facilitates the application and transfer of learning. These disciplinary ideas can be revisited and deepened at higher levels of learning and beyond the schooling years.

1. Matter is made up of a variety of chemical elements, each with characteristic properties, and the smallest particle that characterises a chemical element is an atom.
2. The structure of matter and its chemical and physical properties are determined by the arrangement of particles and electrostatic interactions between them.
3. Energy changes across and within systems usually occur during physical and chemical changes, when there is rearrangement of particles.
4. Energy plays a key role in influencing the rate and extent of physical and chemical changes.
5. Matter and energy are conserved in all physical and chemical changes.

## Assessment objectives

## Subject Content

### Section I: Matter - Structures and Properties

#### Overview

Matter is understood in terms of particles, the way particles are arranged and the forces that hold them together. Evidence of the particulate nature of matter come from daily observable phenomena such as diffusion and crystal growth. The simplest particle is known as an atom, which consists of sub-atomic particles like protons, neutrons and electrons. A myriad of molecules with different properties are formed from the atoms of hundreds of elements discovered to date. The physical properties of a substance are determined by how its particles are arranged (i.e. structure) and the strength of the electrostatic forces between them.

Chemistry is typically an experimental science and relies primarily on practical work. This section also examines the appropriate use of simple apparatus and chemicals, and experimental techniques.

This section provides an understanding of the changes at the sub-microscopic level during chemical reactions. Different types of chemical reactions (acid-base, precipitation and redox reactions) are delved into and lay the foundation for understanding what happens to energy and rate of reactions during a chemical change. The study of reactions also reveals patterns in the chemical properties of substances, leading to the organisation of elements in the Periodic Table.

In all chemical reactions, matter is conserved and this is illustrated by balanced chemical equations. Chemists use symbols and formulae to construct these chemical equations, from which the molar ratios are used to quantify the amount of reactants and products in a reaction.

## Section III: Chemistry in a Sustainable World

### Overview

Ubiquitous in modern life, organic compounds range from the fuels we burn, the materials we use such as plastics to the food we eat. Urbanisation, industriaisation, increasing population and economic development especially in developing countries also create a huge demand for consumption of material goods and energy, accelerating the rate of waste output and emissions of pollutants. The excessive use of crude oil and its products results in detrimental effects on the environment and sustainability. Chemists have made significant contributions towards reducing these effects and improving sustainability through innovative use of chemical knowledge.

## Practical Assessment

Scientific subjects are, by their nature, experimental. It is therefore important that an assessment of a candidate's knowledge and understanding of science should include a component relating to practical work and experimental skills.

This assessment is provided in Paper 3 as a formal practical test and is outlined in the _Scheme of Assessment_.

### Paper 3 Practical

This paper is designed to assess a candidate's competence in those practical skills which can realistically be assessed within the context of a formal practical assessment.

Candidates will be assessed in the following skill areas:

1. Planning (P) Candidates should be able to: * identify key variables for a given question/problem * outline an experimental procedure to investigate the question/problem * describe how the data should be used in order to reach a conclusion * identify the risks of the experiment and state precautions that should be taken to keep risks to a minimum 2. Manipulation, measurement and observation (MMO) Candidates should be able to: * set up apparatus correctly by following written instructions or diagrams * use common laboratory apparatus and techniques to collect data and make observations * describe and explain how apparatus and techniques are used correctly * make and record accurate observations with good details and measurements to an appropriate degree of precision * make appropriate decisions about measurements or observations 3. Presentation of data and observations (PDO) Candidates should be able to: * present all information in an appropriate form * manipulate measurements effectively for analysis * present all quantitative data to an appropriate number of decimal places/significant figures 4. Analysis, conclusions and evaluation (ACE) Candidates should be able to: * analyse and interpret data or observations appropriately in relation to the task * draw conclusion(s) from the interpretation of experimental data or observations and underlying principles * make predictions based on their data and conclusions * identify significant sources of errors and explain how they affect the results * state and explain how significant errors may be overcome or reduced, as appropriate, including how experimental procedures may be improvedOne, or more, of the questions may incorporate some assessment of skill area P, set in the context of the syllabus content, requiring candidates to apply and integrate knowledge and understanding from different sections of the syllabus. It may also require the treatment of given experimental data in drawing relevant conclusion and analysis of proposed plan.

The assessment of skills MMO, PDO and ACE will be set mainly in the context of the syllabus content. The assessment of PDO and ACE may also include questions on data-analysis which do not require practical equipment and apparatus.

Within the _Scheme of Assessment_, the practical paper constitutes 20% of the O-Level Chemistry examination. It is therefore recommended that the schemes of work include learning opportunities that apportion a commensurate amount of time for the development and acquisition of practical skills.

Candidates should be able to use appropriate apparatus/equipment to record a range of measurements such as mass, length, time, volume and temperature. In addition, candidates are expected to have been exposed to a range of experimental techniques in the following areas:

1. Titration, e.g. acid-base titration (with suitable indicators such as methyl orange, screened methyl orange, and thymolphthalein). Other types of titrations may also be required, and where appropriate, sufficient working details will be given.
2. Speeds of reaction that may involve measuring of quantities, e.g. temperature, volume, length, mass or time measurements
3. Experiments involving separation techniques such as paper chromatography, filtration and distillation
4. Salt preparation
5. Gas collection Candidates would not be required to carry out drying of gases during practical examination.
6. Qualitative inorganic analysis involving an element, a compound or a mixture, including displacement reactions and tests for oxidising and reducing agents. Candidates should be familiar with the reactions of cations, reactions of anions and tests for gases as detailed in the _Notes for Qualitative Analysis_. Candidates would not be required to carry out tests involving sulfur dioxide gas. Reactions involving ions not included in the _Notes for Qualitative Analysis_ may be tested: in such cases, candidates will **not** be expected to identify the ions but only to draw conclusions of a general nature. Candidates should **not** attempt tests, other than those specified, on substances, except when it is appropriate to test for a gas.
7. Qualitative organic analysis requiring a knowledge of simple organic reactions as outlined in Topic 11 Organic Chemistry, e.g. test-tube reactions indicating the presence of unsaturation (C=C) may be set, but this would be for the testing of observation skills and drawing general conclusions only.

This is not intended to be an exhaustive list. Candidates are expected to be familiar with the use of data-loggers. Assessment of Skill P may include the appropriate use of data-loggers.

Responsibility for safety matters rests with Centres.

Candidates are **not** allowed to refer to notebooks, textbooks or any other information in the practical examination. _Notes for Qualitative Analysis_ will be included in the question paper for the use of candidates in the examination. Candidates may be required to carry out simple calculations.

### Practical Techniques

The following notes are intended to give schools and candidates an indication of the accuracy that is expected in titration and general instructions for qualitative analysis.

1. Candidates should normally record burette readings to the nearest 0.05 cm\({}^{3}\) and they should ensure that they have carried out a sufficient number of titrations, e.g. in an experiment with a good end-point, two titres within 0.20 cm\({}^{3}\).
2. In qualitative analysis, candidates should use approximately 1 cm depth of a solution (1-2 cm\({}^{3}\)) for each test and add reagents slowly, ensuring good mixing, until no further change is seen. Candidates should indicate at what stage a change occurs. Answers should include details of colour changes and precipitates formed, and the name and test for any gases evolved.

### Apparatus List

## Glossary of Terms Used in Chemistry Papers

It is hoped that the glossary (which is relevant only to science papers) will prove helpful to candidates as a guide, i.e. it is neither exhaustive nor definitive. The glossary has been deliberately kept brief not only with respect to the number of terms included but also to the descriptions of their meanings. Candidates should appreciate that the meaning of a term must depend in part on its context.

1. _Calculate_ is used when a numerical answer is required. In general, working should be shown, especially where two or more steps are involved.
2. _Classify_ requires candidates to group things based on common characteristics.
3. _Comment_ is intended as an open-ended instruction, inviting candidates to recall or infer points of interest relevant to the context of the question, taking account of the number of marks available.
4. _Compare_ requires candidates to provide both similarities and differences between things or concepts.
5. _Construct_ is often used in relation to chemical equations where a candidate is expected to write a balanced equation, not by factual recall but by analogy or by using information in the question.
6. _Define (the term(s)...)_ is intended literally. Only a formal statement or equivalent paraphrase being required.
7. _Describe_ requires candidates to state in words (using diagrams where appropriate) the main points of the topic. It is often used with reference either to particular phenomena or to particular experiments. In the former instance, the term usually implies that the answer should include reference to (visual) observations associated with the phenomena. In the latter instance, the answer may often follow a standard pattern, e.g. Apparatus, Method, Measurement, Results and Precautions. In other contexts, _describe and give an account_ of should be interpreted more generally, i.e. the candidate has greater discretion about the nature and the organisation of the material to be included in the answer. _Describe and explain_ may be coupled in a similar way to _state and explain_.
8. _Determine_ often implies that the quantity concerned cannot be measured directly but is obtained by calculation, substituting measured or known values of other quantities into a standard formula.
9. _Discuss_ requires candidates to give a critical account of the points involved in the topic.
10. _Estimate_ implies a reasoned order of magnitude statement or calculation of the quantity concerned, making such simplifying assumptions as may be necessary about the points of principle and about values of quantities not otherwise included in the question.
11. _Explain_ may imply reasoning or some reference to theory, depending on the context.
12. _Find_ is a general term that may be variously interpreted as calculate, measure, determine, etc.
13. _List_ requires a number of points, generally each of one word, with no elaboration. Where a given number of points is specified, this should not be exceeded.
14. _Measure_ implies that the quantity concerned can be directly obtained from a suitable measuring instrument, e.g. length, using a rule, or angle, using a protractor.
15. _Outline_ implies brevity, i.e. restricting the answer to giving essentials.
16. _Predict_ or _deduce_ implies that the candidate is not expected to produce the required answer by recall but by making a logical connection between other pieces of information. Such information may be wholly given in the question or may depend on answers extracted from an earlier part of the question. _Predict_ also implies a concise answer with no supporting statement required.

* 17. _Sketch_, when applied to graph work, implies that the shape and/or position of the curve need only be qualitatively correct, but candidates should be aware that, depending on the context, some quantitative aspects may be looked for, e.g. passing through the origin, having the intercept, asymptote or discontinuity at a particular value. In diagrams, _sketch_ implies that a simple, freehand drawing is acceptable; nevertheless, care should be taken over proportions and the clear exposition of important details.
* 18. _State_ implies a concise answer with little or no supporting argument, e.g. a numerical answer that can be obtained 'by inspection'.
* 19. _Suggest_ is used in two main contexts, i.e. either to imply that there is no unique answer, or to imply that candidates are expected to apply their general knowledge to a 'novel' situation, one that may be formally 'not in the syllabus'.
* 20. _What do you understand by/What is meant by (the term(s)...)_ normally implies that a definition should be given, together with some relevant comment on the significance or context of the term(s) concerned, especially where two or more terms are included in the question. The amount of supplementary comment intended should be interpreted in light of the indicated mark value.

## Special Note

### Nomenclature

Candidates will be expected to be familiar with the nomenclature used in the syllabus. The proposals in '_Signs_, _Symbols and Systematics_' (The Association for Science Education Companion to 16-19 Science, 2000) will generally be adopted although the traditional names sulfate, sulfite, nitrate, nitrite, sulfurrous and nitrous acids will be used in question papers. Sulfur (and all compounds of sulfur) will be spelt with f (not with ph) in question papers, however candidates can use either spelling in their answers. It is intended that, in order to avoid difficulties arising out of the use of f as the symbol for litre, use of dm\({}^{3}\) in place of 1 or litre will be made. In chemistry, full _structural formulae_ (_displayed formulae_) in answers should show in detail both the relative placing of atoms and the number of bonds between the atoms. Hence, -CONHz and -COzH are not satisfactory as full structural formulae, although either of the usual symbols for the benzene ring is acceptable.

### Units and significant figures

Candidates should be aware that misuse of units and/or significant figures, i.e. failure to quote units where necessary, the inclusion of units in quantities defined as ratios or quoting answers to an inappropriate number of significant figures, is liable to be penalised.

### Calculators

An approved calculator may be used in all papers.
