**Introduction**

The concept of forces is fundamental in Physics and spans across many different topics. This chapter briefly overviews two broad categories of forces, namely contact and non-contact forces. Following that, a more in-depth study of some contact forces including resistive forces, elastic force, fluid pressure and upthrust is presented. You will also learn the turning effects of a force as well as the conditions for a system to be in equilibrium.

A1 The Meaning of Force

A force is a push or pull.

Exists as a result of **interaction** between 2 bodies.

Whenever there is an _interaction_ between two bodies, there is a force upon each of the bodies.

Force is a **vector** quantity that has both magnitude and direction.

A2 Read categories of Forces

All forces (interactions) between bodies can be placed into two broad categories:

* **Contact forces** are those types of forces that result when the two interacting bodies are physically in contact with each other.
* **Non-contact forces** are forces resulting from action-at-a-distance. These forces between two interacting bodies, which are able to exert a push or pull on each other despite their physical separation.

_Examples_

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|} \hline  & **Contact forces** & **Non-contact forces** \\ \hline Friction & Air Resistance & Gravitational Force \\ Tension & Applied Force & Electrical Force \\ Normal Contact Force & Spring Force & Magnetic Force \\ \hline \end{tabular}

The usual abbreviations for the forces are shown in the next table:

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|} \hline
**Type of Force** & **Examples** & **Denoted** \\ \hline Normal Contact & Force between objects when they are in contact. This \\  & force acts normal (perpendicular) to the surfaces in & N \\  & contact. \\ \hline Friction & Force exerted by a surface as an object moves or try to \\  & move across it. Direction of force is such that it \\  & opposes the relative motion of the object. \\ \hline Tension & Force transmitted through a cable when forces acting \\  & from opposite ends pull it tight. \\  & The force is directed along the length of the wire and \\  & pulls equally on the objects on the opposite ends. \\ \hline Air Resistance & Force which acts upon objects as they travel through \\  & the air. The force of air resistance opposes the motion \\  & of an object. \\ \hline Spring & Force exerted by a compressed or stretched spring. A \\  & force acts in the direction, which restores the spring to \\  & its equilibrium position. \\ \hline \end{tabular}

 Two bodies may exert a force on each other even without being in contact. Each of these bodies set up a field of force (or force field) around it. The fields of the two bodies interact, producing a force on each body. Only fields of the same nature can interact e.g. one gravitational field can interact with another gravitational field but does not interact with an electric field or a magnetic field.

**Gravitational Forces**

Gravitational forces exist between any two bodies with mass. These forces only attract.

_(To be discussed later in detail under the topic of Gravitation)_

**Electric Forces**

Electric force occurs between electrically charged bodies. Like charges repel and unlike charges attract.

_(To be discussed later in detail under the topic of Electric Field)_

**Magnetic Forces**

Magnetic forces exist between any two moving electric charges. Moving electric charges and electrical currents create magnetic fields. Consequently, if you have two moving electric charges or current-carrying conductors, these will create magnetic fields. The magnetic force can be attractive or repulsive.

_(To be discussed later in detail under the topic of Electromagnetism)_* [1] Hooke's Law states that force by an elastic body is **directly** proportional to its extension, provided the limit of proportionality has not been exceeded.

Hooke's Law is given by the equation:

* [1] In the form of magnitude only, [1] F = kx
* [1] In the form of vector, [1] F = kx
* [1] Where : F is the restoring force by elastic body (N) k is the force (or spring) constant (N m\({}^{-1}\)) [i.e. a measure of stiffness] x is the extension of the body (m)
* [1] The negative sign (-) indicates that the restoring force always points in a direction opposite to the extension of the elastic body.

* [1] Force, F / N
* [1] limit of proportionality
* [1] F = kx
* [1] Extension, x / m For more information on the graph of Force vs Extension, please refer to Appendix A.

**Quiz**

The natural length of a spring is L\({}_{0}\). Sketch the graph of elastic force (F) against TOTAL length of the spring (L).

Is F proportional to L?

Solution:

Extension is same for both springs.

So x\({}_{1}\)= x\({}_{2}\) = x

However, the restoring forces are not equal if the spring constants differ.

Applied Force is balanced by the Total Restoring Forces, i.e.

Applied Force = F\({}_{1}\)+ F\({}_{2}\) [Assume springs have negligible mass.]

\(k_{\text{eff}}\) x = k\({}_{1}\) x\({}_{1}\)+ k\({}_{2}\) x\({}_{2}\)

Since x\({}_{1}\) = x\({}_{2}\) = x,

\(k_{\text{eff}}\) = k\({}_{1}\)+ k\({}_{2}\)

where k\({}_{\text{eff}}\) is the effective spring constant.

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:6]

\begin{tabular}{l} For spring P, \(F=k_{p}x_{p}\) \\ \(0.6=6x_{p}\)\(\therefore x_{p}=0.1m\) \\ For spring \(Q_{r}F=k_{q}x_{q}\) \\ \(0.6=3x_{q}\)\(\therefore x_{q}=0.2m\) \\ \end{tabular}
2. What is the effective force constant, \(k_{eff}\), of the spring combination? Solution: \[F=k_{eff}x_{\tau}\] \[0.6=k_{eff}(0.1+0.2)\] \[k_{eff}=2Nm^{-1}\] Alternatively, for springs in series, \[\frac{1}{k_{eff}}=\frac{1}{6}+\frac{1}{3}.\] \[\therefore k_{eff}=2Nm^{-1}\]

**Example 2**: When an object of mass m is suspended from a spring, its extension is \(e\). Two such springs, of negligible mass, are then connected in parallel to form a combination. If another object of mass 2m is then suspended on the spring combination, what would its extension be? Solution: \[\text{Let the spring constant of each spring be k.}\] Each spring has negligible mass, hence when an object of mass m is suspended from it, the total downward force equals mg (i.e. neglecting the weight of the spring) and the elastic force is uniform throughout and equals mg. \[\text{mg}=k\text{e},\therefore k=\frac{mg}{e}\] For the parallel spring combination, \[k_{eff}=k+k=2k.\] Hence \[2\text{ mg}=2\text{ k},\ 2\text{ mg}=2\left(\frac{mg}{e}\right)x\text{, hence x}=e.\]

#### 4.4.4 Plastic deformation

Once the limit of elasticity is exceeded in an elastic body, it is said to under plastic deformation.

The graph for the loading and unloading of an elastic body, which has undergone plastic deformation, is as shown below.

During unloading, not all the energy is fully recoverable when the elastic body's limit of elasticity, E has been exceeded. The energy is not fully recovered because the spring no longer returns to its original length when the load is removed; the work done on the spring in stretching it from its initial position is not the same as the work done by the spring in returning to the initial position.

The energy lost is given by the dotted area, which is the difference in the area under F-x graph during loading and that of unloading and is usually dissipated as thermal energy and other forms of energy.

MINISTISTI

A force of 16 N is required to stretch a spring a distance of 40 cm from its rest position. A second identical spring is fixed parallel and adjacent to this spring. How much force is required to stretch this pair of springs by 20 cm?* [2] Fiction is a contact force that opposes the _relative_ motion between two bodies in contact, or, _tends to_ oppose one body from moving _relative_ to the other.

Magnitude of the frictional force depends on:

* the nature of the surface, and
* the magnitude of the normal contact force.

The magnitude is independent of the contact area and speed of motion. Friction occurs for both a static body and a moving body.

Consider a force F1 applied to a block, which is at rest.

* [2] F, static frictional force

* [2] F1, applied force

As F1 is applied and increased slowly, the frictional force F acts in the opposite direction and increases slowly. Initially, F always equals to F1, causing the block to remain at rest. Frictional force F is known as static friction.

However, once F increases to a maximum value, known as the limiting frictional force, if the applied force F1 exceeds the limiting frictional force, the block will start to move. Kinetic friction comes into action.

* [2] F1, F2, F3, F4, F5, F6, F7, F8, F9, F10, F11, F12, F13, F14, F15, F16, F17, F18, F19, F20, F21, F22, F23, F24, F25, F26, F27, F28, F29, F30, F31, F32, F33, F34, F35, F36, F37, F38, F39, F40, F41, F42, F43, F44, F45, F46, F51, F47, F52, F53, F54, F55, F66, F7, F8, F8, F9, F10, F11, F12, F13, F14, F15, F16, F17, F18, F19, F20, F21, F23, F24, F25, F26, F27, F28, F29, F31, F32, F33, F34, F35, F36, F37, F38, F39, F41, F42, F43, F44, F50, F45, F51, F52, F54, F56, F57, F58, F59, F60, F61, F62, F63, F64, F65, F66, F67, F68, F69, F70, F60, F61, F63, F65, F6The drag forces act over the whole surface of the body but can be represented by a single force as shown above.

At low speeds, the drag forces are proportional to the speed of the object relative to the fluid, i.e. \(F\propto v\). At high speeds, the flow of the fluid becomes turbulent and drag force is proportional to the square or cube of the speed, i.e. \(F\propto v^{2}\) or \(F\propto v^{3}\)

4.7.1 Monte Effect of Forces

#### 4.7.1 Moment of a force (Torque)

Definition:

**Moment of a force about any point** is the turning effect of a force which is equal to the product of the force and the perpendicular distance from that point to the _line of action_ of the force.

\(M=F\times d\)

where d is the perpendicular distance from the point to the line of action of the force, F.

The moment of a force is a vector.

Sl unit: newton metre, N m

Consider the following body pivoted at O and a force F is applied on the body:

The perpendicular distance may not be immediately apparent. In such cases, draw the line of action first, and then draw the perpendicular distance \(d\).

The force causes the body to rotate about O and it produces a moment which causes the body to have a turning effect.

If the body is initially at rest, the moment will cause it to rotate.

If the body is initially in rotational motion, it will cause it to rotate with increasing/decreasing rotational speed. The body will have a rotational acceleration.

QuizA drawbridge of length L being is raised by a chain attached as shown.

What is the perpendicular distance from O? What is the moment or torque about O?

Perpendicular distance between O & the line of action of the force =

Moment or torque about O, t =

#### 4.7.2 Couple

Definition:

A **couple** consists of two forces of equal magnitude but acting in opposite directions whose lines of action are parallel but separate.

Moment (or torque) of a couple is given by

where: \(\tau\) is the moment (or torque) of couple

F is a force of the couple

d is the perpendicular distance between the two forces

The net force is zero, as the 2 forces are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction.

no linear acceleration

a couple tends to produce rotation only

The body will start to rotate about O (the midpoint between the two forces) if it is initially at rest or rotate with an increasing/decreasing rotational speed if it is initially in rotational motion.

#### 4.7.3 Principle of Moments

The Principle of Moments states that for a body to be in equilibrium, the sum of clockwise moments about any pivot must be equal to the sum of anticlockwise moments about that same pivot.

**Example 3**

A uniform beam of length 2.0 m and mass 1.0 kg, carrying at its end, a toy of mass 0.50 kg, is supported on one end by a pivot, P on the wall and the other by a wire 2.5 m long, as shown in the diagram. Calculate the tension in the wire.

Solution: Draw the free-body diagram of the beam:

\(\theta=\cos^{-1}\left(\frac{2.0}{2.5}\right)=36.9^{\circ}\)

\(\mathrm{d}=2.0\sin\theta\)

\(=1.2\,\mathrm{m}\)

Taking moments about P,

Sum of clockwise moments = Sum of anti-clockwise moments

\(\mathrm{m_{2}}\times 0.5\,\mathrm{L}+\mathrm{m_{2}}\mathrm{g}\,\mathrm{x}\,\mathrm{L} =\mathrm{T}\,\mathrm{x}\,\mathrm{d}\)

(1.0) (9.81) (1.0) + (0.50) (9.81) (2.0) = \(\mathrm{T}\,\mathrm{x}\,\mathrm{(1.2)}\)

T = 16 N

**Example 4**

A ruler of length 0.30 m is pivoted at its centre. Equal and opposite forces of magnitude 2.0 N are applied to the ends of the ruler as shown. What is the magnitude of the torque of the couple on the ruler when it is in the position shown?

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:13]

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:14]

**Example 6**: A picture weighing 40 N is hung by a wire which passes over a small hook. The two parts of the wire are inclined at 60\({}^{\text{o}}\) to each other. Find the tensile force in the wire.

**Example 7 (N01/1/5)**: A light rod is acted upon by three forces P, Q and R. Which diagram could show the position and direction of each of the forces when the rod is in equilibrium?

**If 3 coplanar and non-parallel forces act on a body which is in equilibrium, the lines of action of all 3 forces must pass through a common point.**

**Example 8**: A body of mass 40 kg is suspended by a rope and is pulled sideways with a horizontal force. Determine the tension and the horizontal force.

Solution:

**Method 1: Constructing a vector diagram**

If a body is in equilibrium under the action of three coplanar forces, these forces will form a closed triangle when joined head-to-tail.

Step 1: Draw the closed vector triangle using ruler, protractor and a chosen scale. Determine and label all known quantities.

\begin{tabular}{l} \hline \hline \end{tabular}

Step 2: Measure the length of the unknown vectors to be determined. Use the scale to calculate their magnitude.

\begin{tabular}{l} \hline \hline \end{tabular}

**Method 2: Method of resolution of forces**

\begin{tabular}{l} \hline \hline \end{tabular}

Resolving forces along the x direction (taking \(\gamma\) as positive),

\begin{tabular}{l} \hline \hline \end{tabular}

Resolving forces along the y direction (taking \(\gamma\) as positive),

[MISSING_PAGE_POST]

**Example 9**

A uniform ladder of length 10 m and weight 200 N leans against a smooth wall so that it is inclined 60\({}^{\circ}\) to the horizontal ground. A boy of weight 500 N stands on the ladder % of the way from its lower end. Calculate the normal reaction at the smooth wall and the magnitude and direction of the force acting on the lower end of the ladder.

Solution:

**Example 10**

What force applied horizontally at the axle of the wheel is required to raise the wheel of diameter 490 cm and weight 100 N over a 15 cm obstacle?

Since 3 non-parallel coplanar forces act on the wheel, and the wheel is in equilibrium, the **lines of action of these 3 forces must pass through one point**. In this case, they all pass through the centre of the wheel.

Taking moments about the pivot P,

Sum of clockwise moments = Sum of anticlockwise moments

F x d = mg x s (R produce zero moment about pivot P)

F x 230 = 100 x 84.4

F = 36.7 NA uniform bridge, resting horizontally on supports at each end, weighs 4.5 x 10\({}^{4}\) N and is 8.0 m long. Find the force acting downward on each support when the bridge carries a load of 1.0 x 10\({}^{4}\) N placed 2.0 m from one end.

#### 4.9.1 Pressure in a fluid

In general, pressure is defined as the perpendicular force acting on per unit area of a surface.

P= \(\frac{F}{A}\)

Where: P is pressure (Pa)

F is force (N)

A is area (m\({}^{2}\))

In a fluid, it can be derived from the above equation that the pressure varies with depth as follows:

P = hpg

Where: P is pressure at depth h in a fluid (Pa)

h is the depth (m)

p is the density of the fluid (kg m\({}^{-3}\))

g is the acceleration due to gravity (m s\({}^{2}\))

Note that all points at the same depth in the same fluid are at the same pressure.

_Derivation (required in H2 Syllabus)_

Consider a column of fluid as shown below.

h: height of the fluid column.

A: base area of the fluid column.

F\({}_{1}\), F\({}_{2}\) : perpendicular forces on the upper and lower surfaces of the column respectively.

P\({}_{1}\), P\({}_{2}\) : pressure on the upper\({}^{\text{i}}\)and lower surfaces of the column respectively.

p : density of fluidV : volume of fluid column

Mass of fluid column = Density of fluid x Volume of fluid column

= pV

= pAh

Weight of fluid column = mg = (pV)g = (pAh)g

Fluid is static > Upward force = Downward force

F\({}_{2}\) = Weight of fluid column + F\({}_{1}\)

P\({}_{2}\)A = pAhg + P\({}_{1}\)A

P\({}_{2}\) = phg + P\({}_{1}\)

Pressure difference (increase) down the fluid column, \(\Delta\)P = P\({}_{2}\) - P\({}_{1}\) = phg

#### Origin of Uphrust

Uphrust is the net upward force exerted by a fluid on a body because of the body being immersed (either partially or totally) in the fluid.

Uphrust arises because fluid pressure increases directly proportionally with depth in the fluid. Thus, the pressure at the lower part of a body is higher than the pressure at the upper part of the body. This pressure differences results in the sum of the upward force components due to the fluid pressure to be greater in magnitude than the sum of the downward force components due to the fluid pressure. Hence a net upward force is exerted by the fluid on the body, which is known as upthrust.

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:22]

#### 4.9.3 Archimedes' Principle

Archimedes' Principle informs us on how to determine upthrust:

Archimedes' Principle states that when an object is totally or partially immersed in a fluid, it experiences a net upward force (upthrust) equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to the **weight of fluid displaced**.

i.e. Uphrrust = Weight of fluid displaced

U = m\({}_{\text{fl.\ displ}}\)g = p\({}_{\text{f}}\)V\({}_{\text{fl.\ displ.}}\)g

Where: U is upthrust acting on the object (N)

p\({}_{\text{f}}\) is density of fluid displaced (kg m\({}^{3}\))

g is gravitational acceleration (m s\({}^{-2}\))

V\({}_{\text{fl.\ displ.}}\) is volume of fluid displaced (m\({}^{3}\))

Upthrust exists for both an object that is floating and object that is sinking

- When it is **sinking**, means that:

Weight > Uphrrust

- When it is **floating**, means that:

Weight = Uphrrust

**Quiz**

Which object experiences the greatest value of upthrust?

**Example 11**: An object made of glass weighs 0.26 N when suspended in air by a thread attached to a spring balance. When the object is fully immersed in water, the spring balance reading changes to 0.16 N. Given the density of water to be 1000 kg m-3, calculate a) the volume of the object; and b) its density.

Solution: a) When the object is immersed in water, we expect the spring balance reading to decrease because the pressure differences in the water will generate a net upward force exerted by the water on the object (called upthrust). Uphrust balances the weight of the object partially, hence reducing the force in the spring. The amount of force in the spring gives the spring balance reading.

Since object is in equilibrium,

Upward forces = Downward force

\(\text{T}+\text{U}_{w}=\text{W}\)

\(\text{U}_{w}=\text{W}-\text{T}\)

\(=0.26-0.16\)

\(=0.10\) N

\(\text{U}_{w}=\text{Weight of fluid displaced}=\text{V}_{w}\text{p}_{w}\text{g}\)

\(\text{V}_{w}\text{p}_{w}\text{g}=0.10\)

\(\Rightarrow\text{V}_{w}=\frac{0.10}{1000(9.81)}=1.02\times 10^{-5}\text{ m}^{3}\)

b) \(\rho=\frac{\text{M}}{\text{V}}=\frac{\text{g}}{\text{V}}=\frac{ 0.26}{1.02\times 10^{-5}}=2600\,\text{kg}\,\text{m}^{-3}\)

#### 4.9.4 Principle of Flotation

**Principle of Flotation** states that an object _floats_ in a fluid when it displaces a _weight_ of fluid equal to its own weight.

In other words, a body floating in a fluid must be displacing an amount of fluid whose weight equals its own weight.

_Principle of Flotation is derived from (1) balance of vertical forces, and, (2) Archimedes' Principle:_

In order for a body to float, the upward force exerted on the body must be equal to the downward force on the body (i.e. it is vertically in equilibrium). In this case, the upward force exerted on the body is the upthrust, whereas the downward force on the body is the gravitational force on the body (i.e. weight of the body).

Weight of floating body, W\({}_{o}\) = Uphtrust acting on the body, U

According to Archimedes' Principle, the upthrust on the body is equal to the weight of the fluid displaced by the body.

Thus,

Weight of floating body, W\({}_{o}\) = Weight of fluid displaced, W\({}_{th.displ.}\)

The above is the Principle of Flotation.

\({\rm m_{o}\,g=m_{th.displ}g}\)

V\({}_{o}\,\rho\)g = V\({}_{th.displ}\)(\({\rm p_{f}\,g}\)

V\({}_{o}\)> V\({}_{th.displ}\) (otherwise it won't be floating!)

Hence, \({\rm\rho_{o}\,<\,\rho_{f}}\) in order for an object to float

**Example 12**

A block of ice of weight 1500 N is floating in a fresh-water lake.

a) What is the upthrust on the ice?

b) What is the weight of water displaced?

Solution:

a) 1500 N (since vertical forces are balanced)

b) 1500 N (Archimedes' Principle)

**Example 13**:

A wooden object of density 710 kg m\({}^{3}\) floats in water of density 1000 kg m\({}^{3}\). What fraction of the object will be below the surface of the water?

Solution:

The object is floating in equilibrium.

Uphrrust = Weight of object

Weight of fluid displaced = Weight of object

\(\text{m}_{\text{f}}\text{g}\text{=}\text{m}_{\text{o}}\text{g}\Rightarrow\text{ p}_{\text{f}}V_{\text{f}}=\text{p}_{\text{o}}V_{\text{o}}\)

Weight of object

\(\frac{V_{\text{f}}}{V_{\text{o}}}=\frac{\text{p}_{\text{o}}}{\text{p}_{\text{f} }}\Rightarrow\frac{\text{h}\text{A}}{\text{H}}=\frac{710}{1000}\)

\(\frac{\text{h}}{\text{H}}=0.71\)
