**Note:**

* In the absence of air resistance and friction, a displacement-time graph is sinusoidal. This is a characteristic of an important type of oscillation called **simple harmonic motion.**
* The mass does _not_ actually move along the sinusoidal curve. It always moves back and forth over the same path (periodic).
* Graph is sinusoidal, but need not always be a sine curve (i.e. oscillator which is at equilibrium position at \(t=0\)). It can also be a cosine curve (i.e. oscillator at maximum displacement at \(t=0\)) or any other sinusoidal curve, depending on the initial conditions.
* show an understanding of and use the terms amplitude, period, frequency, angular frequency and phase difference and express the period in terms of both frequency and angular frequency

Since an oscillatory motion can be graphically represented by a sinusoidal representation, we can mathematically describe its _displacement_ (\(x\)) with respect to time (\(t\)) as the general equation \(x=x_{0}\sin(\omega t+\phi)\), and usually we are concerned with the particular solutions in which \(\phi=0^{\circ}\) or \(\phi=90^{\circ}\), depending on where the object starts oscillation at \(t=0\):

For \(x=x_{0}\sin\) (\(\omega t\)), at \(t=0\) (starting time), the value of \(x=0\). i.e. the object passes the equilibrium position at \(t=0\).

For \(x=x_{0}\cos\) (\(\omega t\)), at \(t=0\) (starting time), the value of \(x=x_{0}\). i.e. the object is at the extreme position at \(t=0\).

In the table that follows, we will define the terms that is important in the topic of "Oscillations":

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|} \hline Physical & Definition & SI Unit (symbol) & Type \\ \hline amplitude, \(x_{0}\) & The maximum displacement of the oscillating object & metre (m) & scalar \\  & from the equilibrium position. & (m) & vector \\ \hline displacement, \(x\) & The distance of the oscillating object from its equilibrium position in a stated direction. & (m) & scalar \\ \hline period, \(T\) & The time taken for one complete oscillation. & second (s) & scalar \\ \hline frequency, \(f\) & The number of complete to-and-fro cycles per unit time made by the oscillating object. & hertz (Hz) & scalar \\ \hline \end{tabular}

**Example 1**

A particle undergoes S.H.M. in which its displacement is given by

\[x=(0.050\ m)\cos(4\pi t)\]

(a) What is the amplitude of the motion?

(b) What is the period of the motion?

(c) What is the displacement of the particle when \(t=0.3\) s?

(d) What is the time when the displacement of the particle is 0.025 m?

**Solution:**

(a) Amplitude, \(x_{0}=0.050\ m\)

(b) Angular frequency, \(\omega=4\pi\ \ \Rightarrow\ 2\pi/T=4\pi\ \ \Rightarrow\ T=0.50\ s\)

(c) \(x=(0.050\ m)\cos(4\pi t)=(0.050\ m)\cos[4\pi(0.30\ s)]=(0.050\ m)\cos(216^{ \circ})=-0.040\ m\)

(d) \(x=(0.050\ m)\cos(4\pi t)\Rightarrow 0.025=(0.050\ m)\cos(4\pi t)\Rightarrow\cos(4\pi t)=0.50 \Rightarrow t=0.083\ s\)

**Example 2**

The rise and fall of water in a harbour is simple harmonic. The depth varies between 1.0 m at low tide and 3.0 m at high tide. The time between successive high tides is 12 hours.

A boat, which requires a minimum depth of water of 2.5 m, approaches the harbour when the water depth is 2.0 m. How long will the boat have to wait before entering?

**A** 0.50 hours **B** 1.0 hours **C** 1.5 hours **D** 2.0 hours

The depth of the water can be represented by

\[x=2.0+(1.0)\sin(\frac{2\pi}{12})t\]

At \(x=2.5\ m\),

\[2.5=2.0+(1.0)\sin(\frac{2\pi}{12})t\]

\[\sin(\frac{2\pi}{12})t=0.50\Rightarrow\left(\frac{2\pi}{12}\right)t=\frac{\pi }{6},\ \frac{5\pi}{6}\]

\[t=1.0\ hr,\ 5.0\ hr\]

(f) recognise and use the equations \(\nu=V_{0}\cos{\omega t}\) and \(\nu=\pm\omega\sqrt{\left(X_{0}^{2}-X^{2}\right)}\)

We have seen that one solution to \(\underline{\alpha}=-\omega^{2}X\), for the case \(t=0\) when \(x=0\), is given by

\(x=X_{0}\sin{\omega t}\)

To get velocity-time, we have

\[\nu=\frac{\alpha x}{dt}=\frac{d}{dt}(X_{0}\sin{\omega t})=X_{0}\omega\cos{\omega t}\]

\(\nu=V_{0}\cos{\omega t}\)

where \(\nu_{0}=X_{0}\omega\)

To get acceleration-time, we have

\[\underline{\alpha}=\frac{d\nu}{dt}=\frac{d}{dt}(X_{0}\omega\cos{\omega t})=- \omega^{2}X_{0}\sin{\omega t}=-\omega^{2}X\]

\(\underline{\alpha}=-\underline{\alpha}_{0}\sin{\omega t}\)

where \(\underline{\alpha}_{0}=X_{0}\omega\)\({}^{2}\)

We can also get the equations for velocity and acceleration against displacement as

\(\nu=\pm\omega\sqrt{\left(X_{0}^{2}-X^{2}\right)}\)

(see annex for derivation)

and acceleration

\(\underline{\alpha}=-\omega^{2}X\)

which is the defining equation for simple harmonic motion.

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:9]

**Example 5** (N85/17)

The diagram shows a displacement-time graph of a body performing simple harmonic motion.

At which one of the points, **A**, **B**, **C**, **D** or **E**, is the body travelling and accelerating in the same direction?

**Answer: [E]**

Direction of "Travelling" means the direction of "velocity".

**Paraphrase - "At which point is the velocity & acceleration in the same direction?"**

At **A**: equilibrium position, \(a\) = 0 but velocity is maximum

At **B**: extreme end, \(v\) = 0, but a is maximum

At **C**: same as A, but direction of velocity is opposite

At **D**: travelling towards positive extreme end, but acceleration is pointing in the opposite direction

At **E**: travelling towards equilibrium position, while acceleration is also pointing towards equilibrium position

**Example 6**

A horizontal plate is vibrating vertically with simple harmonic motion at a frequency of 20 Hz as shown in the diagram.

What is the maximum amplitude of vibration so that fine sand on the plate always remains in contact with it?

The restoring force on the sand is the resultant force acting on it. It acts towards the equilibrium position. Therefore

\[N-mg =ma\] \[N-mg =m(-\omega^{2}x)\] \[N =mg-mo^{2}x\]

For the sand to remain in contact with the plate, the normal contact force \(N\) should be more than 0:

\[N > 0\] \[mg-mo^{2}x > 0\] \[x < \frac{g}{\omega^{2}}\] \[x < \frac{g}{\left(2\pi f\right)^{2}}=\frac{9.81}{\left(2\pi\left(20 \right)\right)^{2}}=0.00062\text{ m}\]

Hence the maximum value of \(x\) is 0.62 mm.

The amplitude of vibration must be at most 0.62 mm for the sand to always remain in contact with the plate.

When the kinetic energy of an oscillating object is maximum, its potential energy must be minimum, since the total energy is constant.

If we define \(E_{\text{potential, min}}=0\), then

\[E_{\text{SHM, total}}=E_{\text{kinetic, max}}=E_{\text{potential, max}}\]

thus in terms of \(t\),

\[\frac{1}{2}m\omega^{2}{x_{0}}^{2}=\frac{1}{2}m\omega^{2}{x_{0}}^{2}\cos^{2} \left(\alpha t\right)+E_{\text{potential}}\]

\[\frac{1}{2}m\omega^{2}{x_{0}}^{2}=\frac{1}{2}m\omega^{2}\left({x_{0}}^{2}-x^{ 2}\right)+E_{\text{potential}}\]

\[E_{\text{potential}}=\frac{1}{2}m\omega^{2}{x^{2}}\]

* describe practical examples of damped oscillations with particular reference to the effects of the degree of damping and to the importance of critical damping in applications such as a car suspension system

#### Damped Oscillations

In the previous sections, we discussed systems oscillating in the absence of _dissipative forces_ e.g. drag forces_.

Damping is a process where energy is taken from an oscillating system as a result of dissipative forces.

_Damped_ oscillation occurs when there is a continuous dissipation of energy to the surroundings such that the total energy in the system decreases with time, hence the amplitude of the motion progressively decreases with time.

#### The 3 degrees of damping

[0.5cm] _Light damping_

The object undergoes a number of complete oscillations with the amplitude of vibration decreasing exponentially with time.

An example is a vertical simple spring-mass system in air or in a liquid of low viscosity.

[0.5cm] _Critical damping_

No oscillations occur. The displacement is brought to zero in the shortest possible time.

An example is a passenger car suspension system which reduces discomfort on bumpy roads.

[0.5cm] _Heavy damping_

No oscillations occur about the equilibrium position when the damping force increases beyond the point of critical damping. The system takes a long time to return to the equilibrium position compared to the critically damped system.

An example is a door closer with hydraulic (liquid-filled) damper that closes the door automatically but very slowly.

[0.5cm] _For Internal Use Only_

## Applications of damping

### Car Suspension System

The degree of damping a mechanical system is important. The suspension system of a car should ensure a comfortable ride for passengers when the car moves on a bumpy road.

If the suspension is only lightly damped, passengers would be thrown up and down since the suspension system would take some time to stop oscillating. This is what happened when the suspension system is faulty. The setting up of vibration could make control difficult or cause damage to the car.

A good suspension system is one which is critically damped. Shock absorbers on a car critically damp the suspension of the vehicle.

The diagram below shows that by the time the car has reached P, the shock absorbing system is ready for the drop in road surface. After Q, it is ready for another bump.

A heavily damped shock absorbing system would still have a compressed spring by the time P is reached and so would not be able to respond to the sudden drop in road surface. So long as there are bumps on a road then these must have an effect on a passenger in a car. The shock-absorbing system can only reduce the forces applied. It cannot eliminate them because, clearly, in the above diagram, the passenger must rise and drop eventually by the height of the bump.

### Analogue voltmeters and ammeters

Instruments such as analogue voltmeters and ammeters are also designed to be critically damped so that the pointer comes quickly to the correct position without oscillating in the shortest possible time.

(i) describe practical examples of forced oscillations and resonance

### Forced Oscillations

Forced oscillations are caused by the continual input of energy by external applied force to an oscillating system to compensate the loss due to damping in order to maintain the amplitude of the oscillation.

The system then oscillates at the frequency of the external periodic force.

### Resonance

* When the driving frequency (\(f\)) equals the natural frequency of a system (\(f_{0}\)), the amplitude of oscillation will be a maximum. This is called resonance.

Resonance occurs when the resulting amplitude of the system becomes a maximum when the driving frequency of external driving force equals to natural frequency of the system.

At resonance, there is a maximum transfer of energy from the driving system to the driven system.

### Practical example of forced oscillations and resonance

### Barton's Pendulums

A, B and C are three pendulums, each with a light paper cone for a bob. X is another pendulum with a heavy metal bob. Pendulum X is displaced perpendicularly to the plane containing the bobs at rest and then released.

Pendulum X provides the driving force. The kinetic energy of X is transmitted along the wooden rod to the other pendulums, which subject them to a periodic force from X.

Damping in this case is light because air resistance does not provide a large viscous force.

The motion settles down after a short time and all the pendulums oscillate with very nearly the same frequency as the driver but with different amplitudes. This is forced oscillation.

The frequency of X is close to the natural frequency of pendulum B because they have the same length. As a result, resonance will take place for B and it oscillates with the greatest amplitude. Pendulums A and C will oscillate with smaller amplitude because their natural frequencies are different from the driving frequency of X.

* describe graphically how the amplitude of a forced oscillation changes with driving frequency near to the natural frequency of the system, and understand qualitatively the factors which determine the frequency response and sharpness of the resonance

### Frequency Response Graph

The graph below shows how the amplitude \(x_{0}\) of a forced oscillation depends on the driving frequency \(f\) when the damping of the system is light and heavy.

For a forced oscillation, when conditions are _steady_, one observes the following:

* The amplitude of a forced oscillation depends upon: 1. the damping of the system, 2. the relative values of the driving frequency \(f\) and the natural frequency \(f_{0}\) of free oscillation (i.e. how far \(f\) is from \(f_{0}\)).
* The vibrations with largest amplitude (i.e. resonance) occur when \(f\) is equal to \(f_{0}\).

As damping increases,

* the response is less sharp (lower and flatter peak and smaller amplitudes at all frequencies) and
* the maximum amplitude is reached when the driving frequency is slightly less than the natural frequency

Consider a block of mass \(m\) attached to the end of a spring of negligible mass and spring constant \(k\), with the block free to move on a horizontal frictionless surface. When the spring is neither stretched nor compressed it is at its equilibrium position as shown.

It is the resultant force acting on the mass, hence by Newton's \(2^{\text{nd}}\) law of motion:

\(F_{\text{restoring}}=ma\)

Compare this with the standard equation for S.H.M. \(a=-\omega^{2}x\), we get

\[\omega^{2}=\dfrac{k}{m}\]

Thus, the natural frequency of a horizontal spring-mass system is given by

\[f=\dfrac{1}{2\pi}\sqrt{\dfrac{k}{m}}\]

similar to that of the vertical spring-mass system!(C) Show that the natural frequency of a simple pendulum \(f\) with mass \(m\) and length \(L\) is \(f=\dfrac{1}{2\pi}\sqrt{\dfrac{g}{L}}\). Solution:

The forces acting on the bob are the tension \(T\) in the string and the weight \(mg\) of the bob of mass \(m\). When the bob is displaced by a small angle \(\theta\) (<10\({}^{\circ}\)), it is displaced by a distance \(s=L\theta\) to the right. The restoring force is the resolved component of \(mg\) tangential to the path:

\[F_{\text{restoring}}=-mg\sin\theta\]

Since \(\theta\) is very small, \(sin\theta\approx\theta\) and

\[F_{\text{restoring}}\approx-mg\theta=-mg\dfrac{S}{L}\]

Thus, the natural frequency of a simple pendulum is given by (D) Equation for velocity

Note that the \(\pm\) sign indicate that there are two velocities with the same magnitude, which correspond to the two cases when the body is at the same position but moving in **opposite** directions.

\begin{tabular}{l} \hline \hline \end{tabular} If a point P moves in a circle of radius \(x_{0}\) at a steady angular velocity \(\omega\). N is the foot of the perpendicular from P to the diameter AOB of the circle. As P moves steadily round the circle, N moves to and fro along AOB. The acceleration of P is \(x_{o}\omega^{2}\), directed towards O. Assuming that \(t=0\) when \(\theta=0\) (i.e. \(t=0\) when the point N is at B). After a time \(t\), \(\theta=\omega t\) \(x=x_{0}\cos\theta=x_{0}\cos\omega t\) The acceleration of N is the component of the acceleration of P parallel to AB: \(a=-x_{0}\omega^{2}\cos\theta\) The negative sign indicates that the acceleration is directed towards O. We can write \(a=-x_{0}\omega^{2}\cos\theta\) \(=-x_{0}\omega^{2}\cos\omega t\) \(=-\omega^{2}\left(x_{0}\cos\omega t\right)\) \(=-\omega^{2}x\) Thus the motion of N is S.H.M. Its acceleration is zero at O and a maximum at A or B. The period of N (time taken for N to go from A to B and back again) is given by \(T=\frac{2\pi}{\omega}\) The model shows that when a point moves in a circle with a steady speed, the projection of that point on to a diameter of the circle moves with S.H.M. Uniform circular motion projected perpendicularly on to any straight line produces S.H.M. \\ \hline \end{tabular}

### Data-based Question

We know that slow oscillations of a rolling ship can produce sea-sickness, although the origin of car-sickness is less clear. Machine operators are subject to more rapid vibrations; the pneumatic road drill is an extreme example.

Some effects of oscillations of various frequencies are shown in Fig. 1.

Most serious effects are due to resonance - when the natural frequency of oscillation of some part of the body is equal to the frequency of a vibrating platform with the person on it. Fig. 2 shows the motion of the abdomen wall at various frequencies.

Figure 1:

Figure 6.2: The tolerance of human beings to vibration varies with frequency. You can see this in Fig. 6.3, which is a graph showing the results of a study of human vibration tolerance. Such studies are of special importance in designing aircraft and space probes. Human vibration engineering is also important in designing hand-operated machine tools. The use of such a tool for intricate work would be very difficult if it is vibrated at a resonant frequency of the hand-arm system.
