## Introduction to Organic Chemistry

### 1 What is Organic Chemistry?

* It is the study of the chemistry of carbon compounds other than its oxides, metallic carbonates and related compounds.
* More than 6 million organic compounds have been identified. This ability of carbon to form so many stable compounds is because (i) strong bonds can be formed between two carbon atoms, e.g. C-C bond is much stronger compared to single bonds formed between atoms of other elements. This allows carbon to form long chains (catenation) and rings, resulting in a wide variety of possible molecules. (ii) carbon is tetravalent, which allows branching of carbon chains into side chains and formation of double or triple bonds, further increasing the number of carbon compounds which can be formed. (iii) carbon forms strong covalent bonds with other elements, e.g. H, N, O, S and the halogens.

### 2 Formulae of Organic Compounds

* **Empirical formula** shows the **simplest ratio** of the atoms of the different elements present in the compound. E.g. C\({}_{2}\)H\({}_{4}\)O
* **Molecular formula** shows the **actual number** of atoms of each element present in one molecule of the compound. E.g. C\({}_{4}\)H\({}_{8}\)O\({}_{2}\)
* **Constitutional formula (structural formula)** shows how the constituent atoms of a molecule are **joined together**. E.g. CH\({}_{3}\)CH\({}_{2}\)CH\({}_{2}\)CO\({}_{2}\)H and (CH\({}_{3}\))\({}_{2}\)CHCO\({}_{2}\)H have different structural formulae but the same molecular formula of C\({}_{4}\)H\({}_{8}\)O\({}_{2}\).
* **Displayed formula or full structural formula** is the detailed structure of a molecule showing the arrangement of the atoms and **all the bonds** between them.
* **Skeletal formula** shows the carbon skeleton of the molecule without showing the carbon atoms and the C-H bonds and atoms in the molecule. Only the carbon-carbon bonds, bonds to functional groups and functional groups are shown.

E.g.

**Stereochemical formula** shows the **spatial** arrangement of the bonds, atoms and groups in a molecule as a perspective **3-dimensional** formula.

**Making Thinking Visible**

Question: What are the possible types of carbon-carbon bonds?

Answer: C-C, C=C, C\(\equiv\)C, C\(\equiv\)C (benzene)

Question: What does a normal straight line, a solid wedge and a dashed wedge represent in the stereochemical formula?

Answer: Normal straight line: bond lies on the plane of the paper

Solid wedge: bond pointing out of the plane of the paper

Dashed wedge: bond pointing into the plane of the paper

## 3 Common Terminology

**Hydrocarbons** are compounds containing carbon and hydrogen **only**. The simplest hydrocarbons, containing **only single bonds** are the **alkanes** with general formula **C\({}_{n}\)H\({}_{2n+2}\)**.

E.g.

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|} \hline molecular formula & structural formula & name \\ \hline CH\({}_{4}\) & CH\({}_{4}\) & methane \\ \hline C\({}_{2}\)H\({}_{6}\) & CH\({}_{3}\)CH\({}_{3}\) & ethane \\ \hline C\({}_{3}\)H\({}_{8}\) & CH\({}_{3}\)CH\({}_{2}\)CH\({}_{3}\) & propane \\ \hline C\({}_{4}\)H\({}_{1.0}\) & CH\({}_{3}\)(CH\({}_{2}\))\({}_{2}\)CH\({}_{3}\) & butane \\ \hline C\({}_{5}\)H\({}_{12}\) & CH\({}_{3}\)(CH\({}_{2}\))\({}_{3}\)CH\({}_{3}\) & pentane \\ \hline \end{tabular}

* **Alkyl group** is a group of carbon and hydrogen having the general formula **C\({}_{n}\)H\({}_{2n+1}\)**. It is usually denoted by the letter R. The name follows that of corresponding alkane but with the suffix -**yl** instead of -ane.

E.g.

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|} \hline alkyl group & name \\ \hline CH\({}_{3}\)- & methyl \\ \hline CH\({}_{3}\)CH\({}_{2}\)- & ethyl \\ \hline CH\({}_{3}\)CH\({}_{2}\)CH\({}_{2}\)- & propyl \\ \hline \end{tabular}

## 4 Hybridisation

* Electronic configuration of C: 1s\({}^{2}\)2s\({}^{2}\)2p\({}^{2}\)

Carbon atom in the ground state:

1s2s2p

promotion of 2s electron to 2p orbital

1s2s2p

Carbon atom in the excited or bonding state is capable of forming four bonds.

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:7]

* The **more s character** a hybrid orbital has, the **closer the electrons are to the nucleus**.
* 25% s character, 75% p character sp\({}^{2}\): 33% s character, 67% p character sp: 50% s character, 50% p character

**The more s character the bond has, the stronger the bond will be.** For example, there is greater s-character in the sp\({}^{2}\) hybrid orbital than in the sp\({}^{3}\) hybrid orbital and the electrons in the sp\({}^{2}\) hybrid orbital are **closer to the nucleus**. Hence, C-C bond with sp\({}^{2}\)-sp\({}^{2}\) overlap is **shorter** than that with sp\({}^{3}\)-sp\({}^{2}\) overlap.

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|} \hline type of bond & representative bond length / pm \\ \hline sp\({}^{3}\)-sp\({}^{3}\) & 154 \\ \hline sp\({}^{3}\)-sp\({}^{2}\) & 150 \\ \hline sp\({}^{3}\)-sp\({}^{3}\) & 146 \\ \hline sp\({}^{2}\)-sp\({}^{2}\) & 147 \\ \hline sp\({}^{2}\)-sp\({}^{2}\) & 143 \\ \hline sp-sp & 137 \\ \hline \end{tabular}

* Type of hybridisation: sp\({}^{3}\)
* Shape: tetrahedral around each carbon atom, bond angle = 109.5\({}^{\circ}\)
* Sigma bond formation: each C-H bond is formed by the head-on overlap of **sp\({}^{3}\) hybrid orbital of C with 1s orbital of H** and the C-C bond is formed by the head-on overlap of **sp\({}^{3}\) hybrid orbital of each C**

* Pi bond formation: carbon-carbon pi bond is formed by the side-on overlap of **2p\({}_{2}\) orbital** of each C **laterally**. The resulting pi electron cloud is distributed **above and below the plane of atoms**.

* Benzene, C\({}_{6}\)H\({}_{6}\)

* Number of hybrid orbitals: 3
* Number of p orbitals: 1
* Type of hybridisation: sp\({}^{2}\)
* Shape: trigonal planar around each carbon atom, bond angle = 120\({}^{\circ}\)
* Hence, benzene has a **planar** structure in which the six carbon atoms are bonded in a **regular hexagonal ring**.

* Pi bond formation: carbon-carbon pi bond is formed by the side-on overlap of **2p\({}_{2}\) orbital** of each C with the adjacent **2p\({}_{2}\) orbitals on either side of it**
* This results in two continuous doughnut-shaped electron clouds, **one above and the other below the plane of the atoms**.

**Note:**

* The pi electrons move over a larger region of space in the actual structure of benzene, as compared to the Kekule structure. The **pi electrons** are said to be **delocalised around the whole ring** and this phenomenon is known as **resonance**.
* Each C-C bond in benzene is a **partial double bond** and is **identical** to one another.
* Structure of benzene is more accurately presented as \(\raisebox{-3.01pt}{\mbox{\rule{6.5pt}{0.4pt}\rule[6.5pt]{6.5pt}{0.4pt}} \rule[6.5pt]{0.4pt}{0.4pt}\rule{0.4pt}{6.5pt}}\) where the circle represents the delocalisation of six pi electrons.

* Strength of inductive effect increases with increasing number of groups present and decreases with increasing distance between the group and the charge.
* **Electron-donating** inductive effect of alkyl group **disperses positive charge** of carbocation, thus **stabilising** it.

As **more alkyl groups** are attached to C with positive charge, strength of inductive effect increases and charge is dispersed to a greater extent. Hence, **carbonation becomes more stable**.

* **Electron-withdrawing** inductive effect of -**C**_I_ **disperses negative charge** of carboxylate ion, thus **stabilising** it.

As **C**_I_ **atom gets nearer to the negative charge, strength of inductive effect increases and charge is dispersed to a greater extent. Hence, **carboxylate ion becomes more stable**.

* **Making Thinking Visible**

* **Steric effect (steric hindrance)** This refers to the **steric hindrance** which occurs when **large groups** on a molecule 'get in the way' and thus hinder the reaction.
* **2,6-dimethylbenzoic acid is resistant to normal methods of esterification because of the steric hindrance of the adjacent methyl groups which hinders the reaction of -CO\({}_{2}\)H group.

Question: Is steric effect a form of inter-electronic repulsion?

Answer: Yes.

Question: Can you summarise the four important ways in which a charge (positive or negative) can be dispersed or intensified?

Answer: Electron-donating inductive effect: disperse positive charge **but** intensity negative charge

Electron-withdrawing inductive effect: intensify positive charge **but** disperse negative charge

**Exercise**

For each of the following sets, consider inductive effects exerted by relevant groups and hence arrange the ions in order of increasing stability.

**Types of reagents (attacking species)**

Electrophile (Lewis acid): An **electron-deficient** species that **accepts an electron pair**, e.g. C/\({}^{*}\), NO\({}_{2}\)\({}^{*}\)

Nucleophile (Lewis base): An **electron-rich** species with a **lone pair of electrons**, e.g. OH\({}^{+}\), C/\({}^{*}\), NH\({}_{3}\)

Free radical: A species that has an **unpaired electron**, e.g. C/\({}^{*}\), \({}_{\bullet}\)NO\({}_{2}\)

#### 3.3.3 Approach for recognising mechanisms

Examine first step to determine nature of species attacking organic reactant.

**Note** Electron-rich C=C or benzene C is usually attacked by electrophiles and C with \(\delta\)+ charge is usually attacked by nucleophiles.

Compare **starting organic** reactant and **final organic** product to determine whether reaction is substitution or addition. (Ignore intermediate steps.)

Substitution: An atom or group of atoms **replaces** another atom or group of atoms.

Addition: Two or more molecules combine to form a **single product**, involves **breaking of pi bonds**.

#### 3.3.4 Other types of organic reactions

* **Elimination** reaction: **Removal** of atoms or groups of atoms from two adjacent atoms to form a pi bond**.

H H H

E.g. H-C-H

H H
* **Condensation** reaction: Two or more molecules **combine** to form a larger molecule with **elimination of a small molecule** such as water or HC/\({}_{\blacksquare}\). In a condensation reaction, two functional groups from different molecules react with each other to form a larger molecule, and a small molecule is released as a byproduct.

E.g. CH\({}_{3}\)CH\({}_{2}\)CO OH + H HOCH\({}_{2}\)CH\({}_{3}\rightarrow\) CH\({}_{3}\)CH\({}_{2}\)COOCH\({}_{2}\)CH\({}_{3}\) + H\({}_{2}\)O
