## 2 Normal Distribution and Normal Curve

### Normal Distribution

Consider the following situation:

A large number of 1kg bags of sugar are weighed to check how accurately they have been filled, and the results are shown in the histogram below.

This histogram is similar to the histograms you might obtain for a variety of different types of data, such as the heights of 5 year-old girls, or the time taken to run 2.4km by 18 year-old boys, or the lifespans of batteries, etc,

Observe that

the histogram is (almost) symmetrical about the mean, and

the percentages of bags with weight close to the mean is higher than the percentage of bags with weight further away from the mean.

If a smooth curve is drawn through the top of the columns, this will give a distribution which is roughly 'bell"-shaped.

Such a distribution can be modelled by the **normal distribution**, whose probability density function is given by

\[\mathbf{f}(x)=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}\sigma}\,\mathrm{e}^{-\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac {x-x}{\sigma}\right)^{2}},\ \ x\in\mathbb{R}\,.\]

Note : There is no need to memorize the complicated function above.

If a continuous random variable \(X\) follows a normal distribution, we write \(\mathbf{X}\simeq\mathbf{N}(\sigma\sigma^{2})\) where

\(\bullet\)\(\mathbf{E}(X)=\mu\),

\(\bullet\)\(\mathbf{Var}(X)=\sigma^{2}\).

Remarks :

Recall that in section 1.4 of Chapter S2B, we looked at the graphs of the probability distribution of the random variable \(X\), where \(X-\mathrm{B}\big{(}n,p\big{)}\). It can be observed that for large \(n\) and value of \(p\) which is not too close to 0 or 1, the shape of the graph of the probability distribution of \(X\) becomes symmetrical and bell-shaped. In fact, for large \(n\) and value of \(p\) which is not too close to 0 or 1, the Binomial distribution can be approximated using a normal distribution (Refer to Appendix 2 for more details)

## Conclusion

The normal distribution was introduced by the French mathematician Abraham De Moivre in 1733. He used this distribution to approximate probabilities connected with coin tossing, and called it the exponential bell-shaped curve. Its usefulness, however, became truly apparently only in 1809, when the famous German mathematician K. F. Gauss used it as an integral part of his approach to predict the location of astronomical entities. As a result, it became common after this time to call it the Gaussian distribution.

During the mid to late nineteenth century, however, most statisticians started to believe that the majority of data sets would have histograms conforming to the Gaussian bell-shaped form. Indeed, it came to be accepted that it was "normal" for any well-behaved data set to follow this curve. As a result, following the lead of the British statistician Karl Pearson, people began referring to the Gaussian curve by calling it simply the normal curve.

The normal distribution is used to model a wide range of real-world situations. Its applications are highly prevalent in pure sciences as well as in social sciences. You should be very familiar with its properties and be highly comfortable in solving related questions, as it is going to play a huge part in subsequent topics in Statistics.

## Appendix 1 Probability Density Function of Continuous Random Variables

A continuous random variable \(X\) is defined by its probability density function which can be represented by a curve \(y=f(x)\). The probabilities are given by the area under the curve.

Properties of the probability density function:

**(1)**: \(f(x)\geq 0\) for all values of \(x\)
**(2)**: \(\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}f(x)\,dx=1\) (**total probability equals one**)
**(3)**: \(P(a<X<b)=P(a\leq X\leq b)=P(a<X\leq b)=P(a\leq X<b)=\int_{a}^{b}f(x)\,dx\)

**Remarks:**

* \(f(a)\) is not a probability; it is not the probability at \(x=a\).
* A continuous random variable has a probability of zero of assuming exactly any of its values. That is (a) \(P(X=x)=0\) for all values of \(x\), and (b) the probability of randomly selecting \(X\) to be exactly \(x\) (and not one of the infinitely many real numbers so close to \(x\) that you cannot humanly measure the difference) is extremely remote. Hence **(3)** follows.
**Expectation and Variance of Continuous Random Variables**

Let \(X\) be a continuous random variable.

Then

* the expectation of \(X\) is given by \[E(X)=\mu=\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}x\,f(x)\,dx\]
* the variance of \(X\) is given by \[Var(X) =E\Big{[}(X-\mu)^{2}\Big{]}\] \[=\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}(x-\mu)^{2}f(x)\,dx\] However, for most computational purposes, we prefer to use the equivalent form \[Var(X)=E(X^{2})-\big{[}E(X)\big{]}^{2}\,,\,\text{where}\,\,\,\,E(X^{2})=\int_{- \infty}^{\infty}x^{2}\,\,f(x)\,dx\,.\]

## Appendix 2 Approximating a Binomial Distribution using a Normal Distribution

We may approximate a binomial distribution using a normal distribution when the number of trials \(n\) is large and the probability of success \(p\) is not too close to 0 or 1.

The closer \(p\) is to 0.5, the less skewed the binomial distribution, and the better the approximation using a normal distribution (which is symmetrical).

How large must \(n\) be?

Generally we require

\[n\]

 to be sufficiently large such that \[np\!>\!5\]

 and \[n(1\!-\!p)\!>\!5\]

Note however that a binomial random variable is discrete while a normal random variable is continuous. Hence a **continuity correction** must be applied.

We need to state "by continuity correction" when it is being applied, and it is always helpful to draw a diagram.

Let \(X\!-\!\mathrm{B}(n,p)\).

If \(n\) is large such that \(np\!>\!5\) and \(n(1\!-\!p)\!>\!5\), then

\(X\!-\!\mathrm{N}(\,np,\,np(1\!-\!p)\,)\) approximately.

\(\mathrm{P}(X\!=\!x)\!=\!\mathrm{P}(x\!-\!0.5\!<\!X\!<\!x\!+\!0.5)\) (by continuity correction)

## Appendix 5 Standard Normal Distribution Table

A table (List MF26 page 7) of values is provided for calculation of probability involving the standard normal random variable.

The following notation is used in the table:

\[\Phi(z)=\mathrm{P}(Z\leq z)\,.\]

The standard normal distribution table used by Cambridge gives the values of \(\Phi(z)\) for values of \(z\) between 0.000 and 2.999 in step size of 0.001.

Some Useful Properties:

(as table in MF26 gives values for positive values of \(z\) only)
