NEWTON'S SECOND LAW OF MOTION

**Newton's Second Law of Motion** states that the resultant force acting upon an object is equal to the product of the mass and acceleration of the object, the direction of the force is the same as that of the object's acceleration.

**Resultant force** is defined as the overall force acting on the body after accounting for all forces acting on the body.
