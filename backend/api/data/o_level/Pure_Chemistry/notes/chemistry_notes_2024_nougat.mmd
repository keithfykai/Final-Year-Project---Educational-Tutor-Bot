## Collection of Gas

The method used to collect a gas depends on the physical properties of the gas:

* Solubility in water
* Density: Less dense or denser than air?
* Take the molar mass of air to be approximately 30 g/mol

### Water Displacement

* Suitable for gases that are **insoluble** in water

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:3]

* Suitable for gases that are **acidic/neutral** in nature For **Method 1** explain why the inlet tube is inserted into the concentrated sulfuric acid while the outlet tube needs to be above the concentrated sulfuric acid The inlet tube needs to be in the concentrated sulfuric acid so that **gas needs to be bubbled into the acid to remove the water vapour.** The outlet tube needs to be above the concentrated sulfuric acid so that the dry gas can escape.

### Using Calcium Oxide

* Suitable for gases that are **basic/neutral** in nature
* Suitable for gases that are **acidic/alkaline/neutral** (except for ammonia) For **Method 3**, explain what it meant by "fused" and why ammonia gas cannot be collected using this method.
* "Fused" means anhydrous (does not contain water)
* This method cannot be used to collect ammonia gas because ammonia would react with calcium chloride

## Brownian Motion

The **kinetic model of matter** states that all matter is made up of a large number of small particles (e.g. atoms, molecules, ions) which are in **continuous and random motion.**

Definition of DiffusionDiffusion is the **movement of particles from a region of higher concentration to a region of lower concentration.**

## 10 Factors affecting the rate of diffusion

### Temperature

* As temperature increases, the particles **move faster and spread through water more quickly.**
* The **higher the temperature**, the **faster the rate of diffusion**.

### Relative Molecular Mass

Since **ammonia particles have a smaller relative molecular mass,** they **move faster than hydrogen chloride particles**. The ammonia particles **move further along the tube than the hydrogen chloride particles** before the particles collide and react to form ammonium chloride
* The **greater the relative molecular mass of the molecule**, the **slower the rate of diffusion**

### Concentration

* The greater number of CO molecules means that there is a **higher statistical probability that the CO molecules will spread through the solution, increasing the diffusion rate.**

## 11 Essential Questions

How does energy affect the arrangement and behaviour of the particles in matter?

* When **particles absorb energy in the form of heat, they move more quickly due to an increase in kinetic energy.**
* At temperatures when the substance is changing state, the **energy gained is used to overcome forces of attraction, and the **particles spread further**, apart and move more freely, resulting in a more random arrangement.

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:13]

different in each state?

* The forces of attraction between the molecules are **weak**
* These forces are known as **intermolecular forces of attraction**

### During State Change

* **Intermolecular forces of attraction are weakened** as the state changes. Hence, oxygen molecules are not held closely together anymore.
* Covalent bonds are intact, hence oxygen atoms are still bonded together

### Giant Covalent Molecules

1. Diamond
2. Graphite
3. Silicon Dioxide

### Allotropes

* **Allotropes** are physical forms of the **same chemical element** in which the **atoms are bonded together in different arrangements**

## Description of Structure of Diamond

* Each carbon atom uses all its **4 valence electrons** to form 4 covalent bonds with **4 other carbon atoms** to form a **tetrahydral structure.** Diamond exists as a **giant molecular structure.**

## Description of Structure of Graphite

* Each carbon atom uses **3 valence electrons** to form 3 covalent bonds with **3 other carbon atoms** to form **hexagonal layers** of carbon atoms with **weak intermolecular forces of attraction between layers.**
* **Fourth valence electron is delocalised** between layers of carbon atoms.

## Sals

What are Sals?

A salt is an ionic compound that consists of a cation (positive ion) and an anion (negative ion).

### Reactions that produce salts

* acid + reactive metal \(\rightarrow\) salt + hydrogen
* acid + carbonate \(\rightarrow\) salt + water + carbon dioxide
* acid + base \(\rightarrow\) salt + water
* base + ammonium salt \(\rightarrow\) salt + water + ammonia gas

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:17]

* NaC\({}_{5}\)H\({}_{8}\)NO\({}_{4}\)
* A sodium salt of glutamic acid which is used as a flavour enhancer in the food industry, and is especially used to enhance the taste of savoury foods.
* Sodium Fluoride
* NaF
* A salt used to provide the fluoride ions in toothpaste. The fluoride ions prevent cavities and tooth decay.

Criteria for Preparation of Salts

* Solubility of the salt product
* Solubility of the reactants
* Method to achieve minimal contamination
* Ease of obtaining pure products
* Safety of procedure

Method 1: Reaction of acid with an excess insoluble substance, metal / carbonate / base

* To prepare a soluble salt from an acid
* Cation of the salt is provided by the insoluble substance, metal / carbonate / base
* Anion of the salt is provided by the acid.

## Considerations

* Very reactive metals such as Group 1 metals are not reacted with acids due to safety as these metals react explosively with acids.
* Unreactive metals such as copper, silver, and gold do not react with acids.

## Steps

1. Using a measuring cylinder, transfer 50\(cm^{3}\) of a suitable acid into a beaker.
2. Add **excess suitable insoluble metal / carbonate / base** to the acid. Stir the mixture continuously until no more **insoluble metal / carbonate / base** can dissolve. * Excess of the insoluble substance can be seen at the bottom of the beaker. * **Rationale** * Insoluble substance is added in excess to ensure that all the acid has reacted. If not, the mixture at the end will contain excess acid and contaminate the salt produced.
3. Filter to remove **excess insoluble substance** (unreacted) as residue. Collect the filtrate, which is the **desired salt solution** * To remove excess insoluble substance
4. Heat the filtrate in an evaporating dish until saturated. * To obtain a saturated solution for crystallisation.
5. Cool the saturated solution to allow salt crystals to form. * Solubility decreases as solution cools.
6. Filter to collect the crystals. Wash the crystals with a little cold distilled water. Dry the crystals between sheets of filter paper. * Use cold distilled water to minimise dissolving of the soluble salt crystals.

## Method 2: Titration

* To prepare a soluble salt containing group 1 or ammonium cation
* Cation of the salt is provided by a soluble alkali or group 1 metal carbonate
* Anion of the salt is provided by the acid.

## Considerations

* Titration is used to prepare group 1 salts as the metals of these salts are very reactive metals and group 1 carbonates and bases are soluble. Hence, method 1 was unsuitable.

## Steps

1. Fill a burette with suitable dilute acid. Note the initial burette reading, \(V_{1}cm^{3}\)
2. Pipette 25.0\(cm^{3}\) of suitable aqueous alkali or aqueous carbonate into a conical flask.
3. Add a few drops of a suitable indicator to the solution in the conical flask.
4. Add the dilute acid from the burette slowly, swirling the conical flask, until the indicator changes colour permanently. Record the final burette reading, \(V_{2}cm^{3}\)
5. Find the volume of dilute acid added for complete reaction, \(V_{2}\) - \(V_{1}cm^{3}\) * The colour change at the end point indicates that the reactant has been fully neutralised. The end point indicates the volume of alkali required to react completely with the acid.
6. Repeat the titration without adding the indicator. Add \(V_{2}\) - \(V_{1}cm^{3}\) of the dilute acid to the aqueous alkali or aqueous carbonate into aconical flask, to obtain the **desired salt solution**.

* Titration repeated without indicator so that the final salt produced is not contaminated by the indicator.

7. Heat the **salt solution** in an evaporating dish until saturated.

* To obtain a saturated solution for crystallisation.

8. Cool the saturated solution to allow **salt crystals** to form.

* Solubility decreases as solution cools

9. Filter to collect the crystals. Wash crystals with a little cold distilled water. Dry the crystals between sheets of filter paper.

* Use cold distilled water to minimise dissolving of the soluble salt crystal.

## Method 3: Ionic Precipitation

* To prepare an insoluble salt using 2 soluble solutions.
* Cation of the salt is provided by an aqueous salt solution, usually a nitrate of the desired cation as well as all nitrate salts are soluble.
* Anion of the salt is provided by another aqueous salt solution or acid, usually a sodium salt of the desired anion as all sodium salts are soluble.
* A precipitate is formed when two clear solutions react together to form an opaque solid product
* All solutions are clear but may be coloured, e.g. "blue solution of copper(II) sulfate".
* All precipitates are opaque and may be coloured, e.g. "yellow precipitate of lead(II) iodide".
* Note: There is no such thing as a clear precipitate!

## Steps

1. Using a measuring cylinder, transfer \(50cm^{3}\) of a **suitable salt solution**, **AB** into a beaker
2. Add the other **suitable salt solution CD** into the beaker and stir. Continue to add excess **solution CD** until no more precipitate **AD** forms.
3. Add excess CD so that all AB will be reacted.
4. Filter the mixture to obtain the insoluble salt, **AD** as the residue * The filtrate obtained is salt CB and excess CD
5. Wash the residue **AD** with distilled water. Dry the residue between sheets of filter paper.
6. The residue is washed to remove any excess soluble CD and soluble CB.

2. Continue adding aqueous ammonia to the mixture and shake gently. Note down your observations upon addition of excess sodium hydroxide to the mixture.

## 9 Why do we need 2 reagents?

**What are the observations for addition of aqueous sodium hydroxide and aqueous ammonia to calcium nitrate?**

* **Observations for addition of sodium hydroxide:** White precipitate forms upon addition of aqueous sodium hydroxide. When excess aqueous sodium hydroxide is added, the white precipitate does not dissolve.
* **Observations for addition of aqueous ammonia:** No precipitate forms upon addition of aqueous ammonia.

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:25]

### Purpose of Adding Nitric Acid

* There may be impurities present: i.e. hydroxide and carbonate ions that can precipitate with the same test reagents and give misleading positive results.
* Most carbonates and hydroxides are **insoluble.**
* Thus, nitric acid is added to acidify the test sample, so as to **react away any possible carbonates and hydroxides** in the test sample.
* These carbonates and hydroxides (if present) can also precipitate with the same test reagent and give false positive results.

### Testing for Water

An ionic half equation shows which reactant particles gain or lose electrons to form products. To construct ionic half equations, follow these steps:

1. **Isolate reactant and product of the same element** into a single ionic half equation.
2. **Add coefficients** to balance the number of elements on the reactant and product sides of the ionic half equation
3. **Add electrons** to the ionic half equations to balance the charges on the reactant and product sides. Note that electrons are negatively charged.
4. **Write state symbols** for all reactant and product particles.

Oxidation ionic half equation involving zinc:

\[\text{Zn(s)}\rightarrow\text{Zn}^{2+}\left(\text{aq}\right)+2\text{e}^{-}\]

**Using ideas about electron transfer, explain why the reaction between zinc metal and aqueous copper(II) chloride is a redox reaction.*** Zinc atom loses electrons to form Zn\({}^{2+}\) ions and copper(II) ions gained electrons to form copper atoms. Hence, zinc atom is oxidised and copper(II) ions are reduced simultaneously.

Based on the definitions of oxidation and reduction written in (iii), deduce if oxidation and reduction can take place independently of one another.

Explain your answer.

* Oxidation and reduction cannot take place independently of one another as electrons that are lost by a particle is gained by another particle.

### From your answer in (v), briefly define a redox reaction.

* A redox reaction is a chemical reaction in which reduction and oxidation occur at the same time.

## Examples

_By constructing ionic and ionic half equations for the following reactions, use ideas about electron transfer to explain why they are redox reactions._

\[2\ \mathrm{HCl(aq)}+\mathrm{Mg(s)}\rightarrow\mathrm{MgCl_{2}(aq)}+\mathrm{H_{2 }(g)}\]

Ionic equation: \(2\ \mathrm{H^{+}(aq)}+\mathrm{Mg(s)}\rightarrow\mathrm{Mg^{2+}(aq)}+\mathrm{H_{2 }(g)}\)

Ionic half equations:

Oxidation: \(\mathrm{Mg(s)}\rightarrow\mathrm{Mg^{2+}(aq)}+2\mathrm{e^{-}}\)

Reduction: \(2\ \mathrm{H^{+}(aq)}+2\mathrm{e^{-}}\rightarrow\mathrm{H_{2}(g)}\)_Using ideas about electron transfer, explain why the reaction is a redox reaction._

Magnesium atom loses **electrons** and is **oxidised** to form \(\mathrm{Mg^{2+}}\)**ions**, while hydrogen **ions** gains electrons and is reduced to \(\mathrm{H_{2}}\)**molecules** simultaneously.

Oxidation State Rules

1. Elements that are uncombined with other elements are assigned an oxidation number of o.
2. In simple ions, the oxidation number is simply the charge on the ion.
3. In complex ions, the sum of the oxidation numbers is equivalent to the net charge for polyatomic ions.
4. The oxidation number of hydrogen in all of its compounds is +1, except in metal hydrides where its oxidation number is -1.
5. The oxidation number of oxygen in all its compounds is -2, except in peroxides where it is -1.
6. The oxidation number of Group 1 elements (e.g. sodium) in their compounds is +1, for Group 2 elements (e.g. magnesium) in their compounds is +2, and for aluminium in its compounds is +3.
7. There are many oxidation numbers for Group 17 elements in their compounds but the usual one is -1.
8. The sum of the oxidation numbers of all the elements in a compound is zero.

Explaining Redox Using O.S

The oxidation state of **chlorine** decreased from o in \(\mathrm{Cl_{2}}\) to -1 in KCl, hence chlorine was reduced. The oxidation state of **bromine**increased from -1 in KBr to o in Br2, hence bromine was oxidised simultaneously.

## Oxidising and Reducing Agents

In a redox reaction, both oxidation and reduction take place.

* and is itself reduced.
* and is itself oxidised.

## Example

Identify the oxidising agent and reducing agent in the following reaction:

\[\text{CuO (s)}+\text{H}_{2}\,\text{(g)}\rightarrow\text{Cu (s)}+\text{H}_{2}\,\text{O ($l$l$)}\]

The oxidation state of **hydrogen** increased from \(\mathbf{0}\)**in H2 to +1 in H2O**. Hence, hydrogen is oxidised. The oxidation state of **copper** decreased from +2 in CuO to o in Cu. Therefore, hydrogen is the reducing agent and CuO is the oxidising agent.

## Testing of Oxidising Agents and Reducing Agents

### Acidified potassium manganate(VII) solution

Half equation: \(\text{MnO}_{4}^{-}\,\text{(aq)}+8\,\text{H}^{+}\,\text{(aq)}+5\text{e}^{-} \rightarrow\text{Mn}^{2+}\,\text{(aq)}+\text{H}_{2}\,\text{O ($l$l$)}\)

Acidified KMnO\({}_{4}\) solution is a **strong oxidising agent** and it turns from purple to colourless when coming into contact with a reducing agent.

## Potassium iodide solution

Half equation: 2 I\({}^{-}\) (aq) \(\rightarrow\) I\({}_{2}\) (s) + 2e\({}^{-}\)

KI solution is a **reducing agent** and it turns from colourless to brown when coming into contact with an oxidising agent.

## 1 Introduction to Electrochemistry

Electrolyte

* Ionic compound in molten or aqueous state
* Conducts electricity due to free mobile ions
* Examples: mobile dilute H\({}_{2}\)SO\({}_{4}\), molten NaCl and CuSO\({}_{4}\) solution

## 2 Electrodes

* A rod or plate which conducts electricity through the electrolyte
* OXIDATION** takes place at this electrode
* REDUCTION** takes place at this electrode
* Types of Electrodes:
* **Inert Electrode*
* - An electrode that does not take part in chemical reactions during electrolysis, e.g. graphite/carbon and platinum.
* It does not react with the product of electrolysis or the electrolytes, and not oxidised in the process.
* **Reactive Electrode*
* - An electrode that takes part in chemical reactions during electrolysis, e.g. metal plates such as copper.

## 3 Electrolytes

Electrolytes conduct electricity differently from electrodes such as metals and graphite.

## 5 Electrolytic Cells vs Simple Cells

## 6 Similarities

* Both have positive and negative electrodes
* Both have electrolyte
* Both form a closed circuit with the electrons flowing.
* Electrons flow from anode to cathode.

## 7 Differences
* Electrodes connected by battery (source of energy)
* Anode is positive, cathode is negative

### Simple Cell

* Electrodes connected by voltmeter
* Electrodes are different metals (difference in reactivity as the source of chemical energy)
* Anode is negative, cathode is positive.

### Why are there these similarities and differences?

* Opposite polarity for anode and cathode due to difference in energy conversion
* Oxidation always occurs at anode, reduction always occurs at cathode.

## Factors Affecting Products of Electrolysis

The polarity of a terminal in an electrolytic cell is **determined by the polarity of the battery it is connected to.**

## Definition of Electrolysis

Electrolysis is the decomposition of a compound by electricity.

When the ionic compound is **molten** or when it is **dissolved in water**, the positive and negative **ions** become **mobile** and are free to move towards the electrode of opposite charge, thus **conducting electricity.**

## Electrolysis of Molten Sodium Chloride

### Setup

**Anode (+) (Oxidation)**

* Cl\({}^{-}\) attracted to anode
* Cl\({}^{-}\) lose electrons to form Cl\({}_{2}\)(g), Cl\({}^{-}\) is oxidised
* Cl\({}^{-}\) discharged (_meaning ions leave the electrode_)
* Half equation: 2 Cl\({}^{-}\)(l) \(\rightarrow\) Cl\({}_{2}\)(g) + 2e\({}^{-}\)

### Cathode (-) (Reduction)

* Na\({}^{+}\) attracted to cathode
* Na\({}^{+}\) gain electrons form Na(l), Na\({}^{+}\) is reduced
* Na\({}^{+}\) is discharged
* Half equation: Na\({}^{+}\)(l)\({}^{+}\) e\({}^{-}\)\(\rightarrow\) Na(l) (reduction)

**Overall Equation**

\[\text{2 NaCl (l) $\rightarrow$ 2 Na(l)+Cl_{2}(g)}\]

**Observations**

1. Effervescence of greenish-yellow gas appears around at the anode.
2. Greyish (or silvery) liquid is formed at the cathode.

**Selective Discharge of Cations and Anions (Aqueous Electrolytes)**

* molten sodium chloride contains only Na\({}^{+}\) and Cl\({}^{-}\) ions, while aqueous sodium chloride contains Na\({}^{+}\), Cl\({}^{-}\), H\({}^{+}\), OH\({}^{-}\) ions.
* In an aqueous solution, water undergoes partial ionisation to form H\({}^{+}\) and OH\({}^{-}\) ions: \[\text{H}_{2}\text{O(l)}\rightleftharpoons\text{H}^{+}\text{ (aq)}+\text{OH}^{-}\text{(aq)}\]
* In an aqueous electrolyte, there will always be more than one type of cation and anion present.
* However, only one type of cation and anion will be selectively (preferentially) discharged during electrolysis.

### Comparing Dilute Sodium Chloride vs Dilute Copper(II) Nitrate

### Anode (+) (Oxidation)

#### Dilute Sodium Chloride

* Cl- and OH- attracted to anode
* OH- is lower than Cl- in electrochemical series, hence OH- is selectively discharged.
* Half equation: \[4\;\mathrm{OH}^{-}\left(\mathrm{aq}\right)\to 2\;\mathrm{H}_{2}\;\mathrm{O}\left( \mathrm{I}\right)+\mathrm{O}_{2}\left(\mathrm{g}\right)+4\mathrm{e}^{-}\]

#### Dilute Copper(II) Nitrate

* NO3- and OH- attracted to anode.
* OH- is lower than NO3- in electrochemical series, hence OH- is selectively discharged.
* Half equation: \[4\;\mathrm{OH}^{-}\left(\mathrm{aq}\right)\to 2\;\mathrm{H}_{2}\;\mathrm{O} \left(\mathrm{I}\right)+\mathrm{O}_{2}\left(\mathrm{g}\right)+4\mathrm{e}^{-}\]

## Cathode (-) (Reduction)

### Dilute Sodium Chloride

* Na\({}^{+}\) and H\({}^{+}\) attracted to cathode
* Hydrogen is less reactive than sodium, hence H\({}^{+}\) is selectively discharged
* Half equation: \[2\;\mathrm{H}^{+}\;\mathrm{(aq)}+2\mathrm{e}^{-}\rightarrow\mathrm{H}_{2}\mathrm{(g)}\]

### Dilute Copper(II) Nitrate

* Cu\({}^{2+}\) and H\({}^{+}\) attracted to cathode
* Copper is less reactive than hydrogen, hence copper is selectively discharged.
* Half equation: \[\mathrm{Cu}^{2+}+2\mathrm{e}^{-}\rightarrow\mathrm{Cu}\;\mathrm{(s)}\]

### Overall Equation

### Dilute Sodium Chloride

\[2\;\mathrm{H}_{2}\mathrm{O}\mathrm{(I)}\rightarrow\;2\;\mathrm{H}_{2}\mathrm{( g)}+\mathrm{O}_{2}\mathrm{(g)}\]

### Dilute Copper(II) Nitrate

\[2\;\mathrm{Cu}^{2+}+4\;\mathrm{OH}^{-}\;\mathrm{(aq)}\to 2\;\mathrm{Cu}\mathrm{(s)}+2\; \mathrm{H}_{2}\mathrm{O}\mathrm{(I)}+\mathrm{O}_{2}\mathrm{(g)}\]

### Observations

#### Dilute Sodium Chloride

1. Solution remains neutral as both H\({}^{+}\) and OH\({}^{-}\) ions are discharged.
2. Water levels drops
3. Effervescence of colourless gas at both electrodes. Volume of hydrogen gas collected at the cathode is twice the volume of oxygen gas collected at the anode. For every 4 moles of electrons transferred, 2 moles of hydrogen gas and 1 mole of oxygen is produced.

#### Dilute Copper(II) Chloride

1. Solution becomes more acidic as OH\({}^{-}\) ions are selective discharged while H\({}^{+}\) ions remain in solution.
2. Reddish-brown solid formed on cathode.
3. Effervescence of colourless gas at anode.

4. Blue solution fades/turns colourless

Concentration of Halide Ions (For aqueous electrolyte)

* In a concentrated solution, the ease of discharge of Cl\({}^{-}\), Br\({}^{-}\), orI\({}^{-}\) anions increases.

### Anode (+) (Oxidation - Concentrated)

* Cl\({}^{-}\) and OH\({}^{-}\) are attracted to anode.
* Concentration effect applies since concentration of Cl\({}^{-}\) is greater than OH\({}^{-}\), hence Cl\({}^{-}\) is selectively discharged.
* Half equation: \[2\) Cl\({}^{-}\) (aq) \(\rightarrow\) Cl\({}_{2}\) (g) + 2e\({}^{-}\)

### Cathode (-) (Reduction - Concentrated)

* H\({}^{+}\) attracted to cathode
* Since H\({}^{+}\) is the only cation, H\({}^{+}\) selectively discharged
* Half equation: \[2\) H\({}^{+}\) (aq) + 2e\({}^{-}\)\(\rightarrow\) H\({}_{2}\)(g)

### Overall Equation - Concentrated

\[2\) H\({}^{+}\) (aq) + 2 Cl\({}^{-}\)(aq) \(\rightarrow\) H\({}_{2}\)(g) + Cl\({}_{2}\)(g)

### Observations - Concentrated

1. Solution becomes less acidic as there is a net discharge of H\({}^{+}\) while OH\({}^{-}\) ions remain in solution.
2. Effervescence of colourless gas at cathode and greenish-yellow gas at anode. Volume of hydrogen gas collected at the cathode is same as the volume of chlorine gas collected at the anode. For every 2 mole of electrons transferred, 1 mole of hydrogen gas and 1 mole of chlorine is produced.

### Types of Electrodes

* If the electrode used is not graphite or platinum but another metal, the electrode is reactive and is oxidised as the anode during electrolysis.

### Anode (+) (Oxidation)

* SO\({}_{4}\)\({}^{2-}\) and OH\({}^{-}\) attracted to anode
* However, copper electrode is a reactive electrode, copper electrode is oxidised instead of anions.
* Half equation: \[\text{Cu(s)}\rightarrow\text{Cu}^{2+}+2\text{e}^{-}\]

### Cathode (-) (Reduction)

* Cu\({}^{2+}\) and H\({}^{+}\) attracted to cathode
* Copper is less reactive than hydrogen, hence Cu\({}^{2+}\) is selectively discharged.
* Half equation: \[\text{Cu}^{2+}+2\text{e}^{-}\rightarrow\text{Cu(s)}\]

### Observations

1. Solutions remains neutral as no H\({}^{+}\) and OH\({}^{-}\) ions are discharged.
2. Intensity of blue solution remains as concentration of Cu\({}^{2+}\) remains unchanged.
3. Size of anode decreases, size of cathode increases.

### Applications of Electrolysis

#### Metal Purification

* Impure copper can be purified using electrolysis
* The piece of impure copper is made the anode (+) and the piece of pure copper is made the cathode(-).

* Electrolyte is an aqueous solution of copper(II) ions.

## 10.1 Electroplating

* Electroplating is coating a thin layer of metal onto an object.
* This is done to protect the object from corrosion and give the object a more attractive appearance.
* The plating metal is made the anode (+), and the object to be plated is made the cathode (-) )
* **Electrolyte is an aqueous solution of a salt of the plating metal.**

## 10.2 Hydrogen Fuel Cells

Suggest why scientists want to make hydrogen from sea water.

To reduce the usage of methane (a fossil fuel) to produce hydrogen from steam reforming. To use non-potable sea water which is present in large quantities, to produce hydrogen instead of more precious fresh water.

Explain why electrolysis of water has high energy costs.

Electrical energy is constantly supplied to split water to form hydrogen and oxygen gas.

Write a half equation to show how chlorine is produced from chloride ions.

2. Group 1 metals react with water to form metal hydroxides and hydrogen gas.
3. The reactivity of Group 1 metals increase down the group.

* Down the group, the number of electron shells increase, resulting in an **increase in the size of atoms.** The valenceelectron will be **located further from the positively charged nucleus.** Less energy is absorbed to overcome the **weaker electrostatic forces of attraction.**

## Group 17 Elements

Elements in Group 17 of the Periodic Table are also known as **halogens**

1. Group 17 elements exist as **diatomic** molecules.
2. The colour of Group 17 elements gets **more intense** down the group.
3. Boiling points of Group 17 elements **increase** down the group.

* Down the group, there is an **increase in the atomic radius of the elements** due to the increase in number of electron shells.
* With a larger atomic radius, the **intermolecular forces of attraction between molecules increases.**

## Exceptions in the Reactivity Series

Lead metal reacts with dilute nitric acid. However, when lead metal is added to dilute HCl or dilute H\({}_{2}\)SO\({}_{4}\), there is an initial reaction and a little effervescence before the reaction stops. From the reactivity series, lead is above Hydrogen and hence should react with acids to form salt and hydrogen gas. Explain why the observations with dilute HCl or dilute H\({}_{2}\)SO\({}_{4}\) do not corroborate with the trends predicted by the reactivity series.

* Pb(s) + 2 HCl (aq) \(\rightarrow\) PbCl\({}_{2}\)(s) + H\({}_{2}\) (g)
* Pb(s) + H\({}_{2}\)SO\({}_{4}\)(aq) \(\rightarrow\) PbSO\({}_{4}\) (s) + H\({}_{2}\) (g)

Lead(II) chloride and lead(II) sulfate are both insoluble in water. Upon forming, the soluble salts will coat the lead metal and prevent the metal from further reaction with the acid.

## Displacement Reactions

Generally, a displacement reaction involves the reaction between **a more reactive element** and **the compound of a less reactive element**.

\[\mathrm{Fe(s)+CuCl_{2}(aq)\rightarrowCu(s)^{+}FeCl_{2}(aq)}\]

The **iron** has displaced **copper** from **copper(II) chloride** solution to form **copper** and **iron(II) chloride** solution.
Add a strip of zinc metal into aqueous copper(II) sulfate

Equation: Zn(s) + CuSO4(aq) \(\rightarrow\) ZnSO4(aq) + Cu(s)

**Observations:**

* Reddish-brown solid deposits formed.
* Size of metal strip becomes smaller.
* Blue solution fades (or turns colourless)

**Explanations:** Zinc is more reactive than copper and would displace copper from copper(II) sulfate. Hence, copper metal is deposited and zinc metal ionises to form a colourless solution of zinc sulfate.

## Thermal Stability of Metal Compounds - Decomposition

### Relationship between the reactivity of metal and the thermal stability of its compound

A compound is **thermally stable** if it **does not decompose** under the influence of temperature.

Some metal carbonates can be decomposed by heat, producing carbon dioxide gas in the process.

\begin{tabular}{c|c}
**Metal** & **Observations** \\
**Carbonates** & \\ potassium & Unaffected by heat \\ carbonate & \\ \end{tabular}

The more reactive the metal is, the more difficult it is to decompose its carbonate by heat.

Hence, the more reactive metals form carbonates that are more thermally stable.

Discovering Metals

Extraction of MetalsThe process of getting metals from the ones is called the extraction of metals.

The extraction process is as described:

There are two main methods used to chemically extract the given metal from its metal compounds.

1. **Electrolysis:** the melting of metal compounds and the use of electricity to decompose the molten compound to obtain the metal.
2. **Reduction by carbon/coke:** Heating the metal compound with carbon to obtain the pure metal. This is considered as both a redox and a displacement reaction.

The reason why there are two different methods to extract metals is:

1. Metals have different reactivity.
2. Extraction methods have costs.

Only two metals, gold and platinum, are found principally in their native states.

Many other metals naturally exist as metal compounds (such as sulfides, oxides, and hydroxides) in ores.

As most metals are reactive, once they are exposed, they would react with oxygen, water, etc. present in the surrounding to form metal compounds.

## Appendix AExplain why the very reactive metals (metals above carbon) can only be extracted by electrolysis and not by the reduction of its oxide by carbon.

These metals are more reactive (or more easily oxidised) than carbon and cannot be extracted from their oxides by reduction of carbon.

These metals are very stable as ions in metal compounds. It is very difficult to extract the metal from its compounds.

Electricity is needed to decompose the molten ionic compound to obtain the metal (electrolysis)

Explain why the less reactive metals (metals below carbon) can be extracted by reduction of their oxides by carbon (displacement reaction).

These metals are less reactive (or less easily oxidised) than carbon and can be displaced from their compounds by reduction with carbon to obtain the metal.

_(These metals can be extracted using electrolysis too! But electrolysis is a very expensive process.)_

Reduction of Metal Oxides With Hydrogen

Some metals can be extracted from their metal oxide ones by the reduction with hydrogen gas.

Copper, silver and gold can be extracted from their metal oxides by reduction with hydrogen gas.

Copper < Silver < Gold (easiest)

**Chemical Equation**:

\[\mathrm{CuO(s)+H_{2}(g)\to Cu(s)+H_{2}O(l)}\]

## 6 Rusting of Iron

For rusting to occur, the conditions required are:

* Presence of oxygen
* Presence of water

**General Chemical Equation**

\[4\;\mathrm{Fe(s)}+3\;\mathrm{O_{2}(g)}+2\;\mathrm{XH_{2}O(l)}\to 2\;\mathrm{Fe_{2}\;O_{3}\,X\,H_{2}\,O(s)}\]

## 7 Using Freshly Boiled Water and Oil

* Freshly boiled water has negligible dissolved oxygen as most would have escaped from the solution during the boiling process. This minimises the exposure of the nail to oxygen.
* The oil layer prevents oxygen from the surrounding air from dissolving in the water.

## 8 Increasing rate of rusting

* The rusting process involves the transfer of electrons
* Presence of ions in the solution increases the conductivity of the solution, allowing faster transfer of electrons.
* Rate of rust formation is accelerated.

## 9 Protection of Iron (against rusting)

Surface ProtectionCoating with a layer of:

* paint
* oil/grease
* plastic or **less reactive** metal (tin, silver) by electroplating.

**How does this prevent rusting?**

* The protective layer prevents the metal from contacting with water and oxygen, thus reducing the rate of rusting
* If the protective layer is scraped off/removed, the iron is exposed to water and oxygen and rusting occurs.

**Uses**

* machine, motor cars, bridges, ships

**Coated with Tin:**

* Cans for can food

**Coated with Chromium""**

* Taps, kettles, bicycles, handlebars

**Sacrificial Protection (using sacrificial metal)**

**Coat with a layer of Zn (galvanising)**

Kitchen sinks, 'zinc' roofs

**Attaching blocks of Zn or Mg metals to iron or steel**

* Note: These blocks of Zn and Mg metal have to be replaced regularly once they have all been reacted.

**How does this prevent rusting?**

* Both Zn and Mg are more reactive than iron and would react more readily with oxygen and corrode preferentially, preventing the iron from rusting.
* A coating layer of Zn or Mg on the entire iron metal surface is not necessary. As long as Mg or Zn is present, iron will not rust.

**Uses**

* Underground pipes, ships, columns of steel piers

## 1 Uses of Ammonia

Ammonia is a very important chemical, used in the manufacture of:

1. Fertilisers
2. Nitric acid
3. Household cleaning products

**Nitrogen is an essential element required for the survival of plants. Even with an abundance of 78% nitrogen in the air, there is a lack of nitrogen for crop growth. Why is this so?**

* Though N\({}_{2}\) is present in a large percentage of air, plants are unable to absorb N\({}_{2}\) from the air directly. N\({}_{2}\) as to be dissolved in water before plants can absorb them through the roots.
* (Nitrogen is dissolved naturally when lightning occurs and by certain types of bacteria in soil but these processes do not occur fast enough to support current crop growth.)

## 2 Common Artificial Fertilisers

1. Ammonium Nitrate, NH\({}_{4}\) NO\({}_{3}\)
2. Ammonium Sulfate, (NH\({}_{4}\))\({}_{2}\) SO\({}_{4}\)

## 3 Reversible Reactions

Reversible reactions are chemical reactions that can proceed in both theforward and backward directions.

## Examples:

**Thermal decomposition of ammonium chloride**

\[\mathrm{NH_{4}Cl\left(s\right)}\rightleftharpoons\mathrm{NH_{3}\left(g\right)+HCl (g)}\]

**Formation and decomposition of hydrogen iodide**

\[\mathrm{2\ HII(g)}\rightleftharpoons\mathrm{H_{2}\left(g\right)+I_{2}\left(g\right)}\]

In reversible reactions, the reactants can change into products and the products can change back into reactants.

Note

Note the type of arrows to denote reversible chemical reactions.

## Production of Ammonia

General Word Equation for Reaction Between Ammonium Salt and Base

Alkali + ammonium salt \(\rightarrow\) salt + water + ammonia

## Raw materials for Haber Process

* The raw materials in the manufacture of ammonia are **nitrogen** and **hydrogen**.
* The nitrogen is obtained by the **fractional distillation of liquefied air.
* The hydrogen is obtained from a variety of sources:
* Reacting together methane and steam
* methane + steam \(\rightarrow\) carbon monoxide + hydrogen gas
* CH4 (g) + H2O (g) \(\rightarrow\) CO(g) + 3 H2 (g)

### Fractional Distillation of Liquefied Air

* Cracking hydrocarbons found in crude oil:
* butane \(\rightarrow\) ethene + hydrogen
* C4H10 (g) \(\rightarrow\) 2 C2H4 (g) + H2 (g)

## Conditions Suitable for Reversible Reactions

Conditions such as temperature and pressure need to be adjusted for reversible reactions.

### Function of the Iron Catalyst

* The iron catalyst is used to increase the rate of reaction
* It increases the speed of reaction by providing an **alternative reaction pathway** with a **lower activation energy*** The finely divided iron catalyst provides a **larger surface area to volume ratio** for the reaction to take place, further increasing the rate of reaction.

### Why is ammonia gas condensed into a liquid and not transported in gaseous state?

* Compressing the gas to liquid state allows more ammonia to be stored per volume
* It also allows for easier storage and transportation of ammonia gas.

## 10 Introduction

The **rate (or speed)** of a chemical reaction tells us **how quickly or slowly** a reaction takes place.

It is defined as the **change in amount of product formed or reactant used per unit time.**

**Methods to Determine Rate of Reaction**

**Method 1: Measuring Volume of Gas Produced Per Unit Time**

When 0.5o g of CaCO\({}_{3}\) solid is added to excess hydrochloric acid, carbon dioxide is formed. The carbon dioxide gas can be collected in the gas syringe using the following apparatus. To determine the rate of the reaction, the volume of gas collected in the gas syringe can be measured over a period of time. A graph of volume of gas collected against time is plotted.

Method 2: Measuring loss in mass of reaction per unit time

To determine the rate of reaction between 0.50 g of CaCO\({}_{3}\) solid and excess hydrochloric acid.

## Apparatus

* Conical flask
* Electronic mass balance
* Stopwatch

## Procedure

1. Set up the apparatus as shown above.
2. Use a cotton wool plug to cover the mouth of the conical flask to prevent acid from splashing out during the reaction (resulting in a loss in reactants).
3. Record the mass of the conical flask and its contents.
4. Release the thread and ensure that the calcium carbonate are added into the acid. Start the stopwatch immediately.
5. Record the mass of the conical flask and its contents at regular time intervals (e.g. every 1 minute) until mass remains constant.
6. Use the data collected to plot a graph of mass of conical flask and contents against time.
7. The rate of reaction can be determined from the gradient of the graph of mass against time.
To determine the rate of the reaction between 50 cm\({}^{\wedge}\)3 of 0.200 mol/dm\({}^{\wedge}\)3 sodium thiosulfate solution and hydrochloric acid.

Na2S2O3 (aq) + 2 HCl (aq) \(\to\) 2 NaCl(aq) + H2O(I) + SO2 (g) + S(s)

## Apparatus

* Conical flask/beaker
* Stopwatch
* White tile with cross or colourimeter

## Experimental Setup

## Procedure

1. Set up the apparatus as shown above.
2. Using a measuring cylinder, measure 50 cm\({}^{\wedge}\)3 of 0.2 mol/dm\({}^{\wedge}\)3 of sodium thiosulfate solution into the conical flask
3. Using a measuring cylinder, add 100 cm\({}^{\wedge}\)3 of 0.2 mol/dm\({}^{\wedge}\)3 dilute hydrochloric acid into the conical flask and start the stopwatch immediately.
4. Look at the cross through the mouth of the flask. Stop the stopwatch when the cross is no longer visible. (yellow solid sulfur produced is opaque and blocks the cross from view as more of it is formed.)
5. Repeat the experiment with a changed variable (e.g. temperature, concentration of solution).
6. The change in rate of reaction can be determined by comparing the change in time taken fro the cross to be covered.

### Alternative Method

1. Use the colourimeter to measure the colour intensity of the reaction mixture in the conical flask at regular time intervals (e.g. every 1 minute).
2. Use the data collected to plot a graph of colour intensity against time.
3. The rate of reaction can hence be determined through the gradient of the graph of colour intensity against time.

## Collision Theory

* For a reaction to occur and products to form, **the reactant particles must collide with each other.**
* However, only **effective collisions will result in a reaction.*
* An effective collision must fulfil the following conditions:
* The reactant particles must **collide with sufficient energy, equal to or greater than the reaction's activation energy.*
* The reactant particles must also collide with the **correct orientation**, i.e., "the right way round".

## Factors Affecting Rate of Reaction

There are five factors affecting the rate of reaction. They are:

1. **Concentration:** applicable for reactants in **aqueous** state
2. **Pressure:** applicable for reactants in **gaseous** state
3. **Particle Size:** applicable for reactants in **solid** state.
4. **Temperature**
5. **Presence of Catalyst**

## Factor 1: Concentration

\begin{tabular}{|p{142.3pt}|p{142.3pt}|} \hline
**Lower Concentration** & **Higher Concentration** \\ \hline
**Fewer** reactant particles per unit volume & **More** reactant particles per unit volume \\ \hline Reactant particles are **further** from each other. & Reactant particles are **closer** to each other \\ \hline
**Fewer** collisions per unit time between particles & **More** collisions per unit time between particles \\ \hline Frequency of effective collisions is **lower** & Frequency of effective collisions is **higher** \\ \hline
**Slower** rate of reaction & **Faster** rate of reaction \\ \hline \end{tabular}

## Factor 2: Pressure

\begin{tabular}{|p{142.3pt}|p{142.3pt}|} \hline
**Lower Pressure** & **Higher Pressure** \\ \hline
**Fewer** reactant particles **per unit volume** & **More** reactant particles **per unit volume** \\ \hline \end{tabular}

## Factor 3: Particle Size

\begin{tabular}{p{113.8pt}|p{113.8pt}} \hline
**Large Particle Size** & **Small Particle Size** \\
**(Granulated Solid)** & **(Powdered Solid)** \\ \hline

**Frequency of effective collisions** per unit time between particles & Frequency of **effective collisions is higher** \\ \hline
**Slower** rate of reaction & **Faster** rate of reaction \\ \hline \end{tabular}

## Factor 4: Temperature

\begin{tabular}{p{113.8pt}|p{113.8pt}} \hline
**Lower Temperature** & **Higher Temperature** \\ \hline \end{tabular}

## 4 Catalysts

A catalyst increases the rate of chemical reactions without being chemically changed at the end of the reaction.

### Characteristics of Catalysts

* Increased rate of reaction but not the yield
* Not used up in the reaction as it can be regenerated at the end of the reaction
* Selective in action (i.e. each catalyst only catalyses certain reactions)
* Can be poisoned by impurities
* Physical appearance may change but remain chemically the same
* Provide an alternative pathway with a lower activation energy, _E\({}_{a}\)_, for the reaction

## Industrial Catalyst

* Industrial catalysts are usually transition metals and their compounds due ot the ability to have variable oxidation states
* By using catalysts, less extreme physical conditions (heat and pressure) are required, saving energy.

\begin{tabular}{p{113.8pt} p{113.8pt}} \hline
**Catalyst** & **Use** \\ \hline Iron & Manufacture of ammonia in the Haber process \\ \hline Aluminium or Silicon Dioxide & Cracking of hydrocarbons \\ \hline Nickel & Manufacture of margarine from vegetable oils \\ \hline \end{tabular}

## Biological Catalysts (Enzymes)

* Enzymes are biological catalysts, which catalyse biological processes such a s digestion, energy production, detoxification etc.
* Enzymes are made of proteins
* most enzymes operate best at body temperature (between 35 degrees Celsius and 40 degrees Celsius). Enzymes are dormant/inactive at low temperatures and **denatured** at high temperatures. Denaturation is when the specific active site changes and enzyme cannot catalyse the specific reaction anymore.
* operates best at optimal pH range. Different enzymes have different optimal pH range.

## Specific Catalytic Action

* The active site of each enzyme is specific, and can only fit certain reactant molecules in a specific orientation.
* Manufacture of food such as cheese, yoghurt and bread, in laundry detergent.

## Graphical Analysis

* Graphs are often used to describe information about a chemical reaction.
* Gradient of graph indicates the speed of the reaction. The steeper thegradient, the faster the speed of reaction. The gradient can change as reaction proceeds as reactants are used up.
* The final volume of gas / mass of the reaction indicates the yield of the reaction. The yield of the products depends on the amount of limiting reagents.

## 1 Introduction to Fuels

* Fossil fuels are formed from decayed plants and animals from millions of years ago.
* They are mainly organic compounds that contain only carbon and hydrogen, known as **hydrocarbons**
* Fossil fuels are important as they are the largest sources of energy for powering transport and electrical appliances, which are essential for us to function in our daily lives.
* When fossil fuels undergo combustion, heat is released as the reaction is an exothermic one. The thermal energy can then be converted to other forms of energy.
* **Crude oil** and **natural gas** are forms of fossil fuel.
* The different compounds in crude oil have different boiling points.
* Generally, hydrocarbons with larger relative molecular mass have higher boiling and melting points.
* As one moves up the fractionating tower, the temperature decreases.
* Hydrocarbons boil and rise up the column until they reach the trays that are cool enough for them to condense (into liquids).
* The liquids are siphoned off at different levels. Hence, hydrocarbon compounds with the highest boiling points will condense in trays **near the bottom of the fractionating column.*
* Note that the liquid siphoned off at each level is called a
fraction**. * Every fraction comprises a **mixture** of compounds, instead of pure substance.
* The lightest hydrocarbon (petroleum gas, which has the smallest relative molecular mass), does not condense and is collected at the top of the fractionating tower. It can also be used as a fuel. Mixture of crude oil is heated so that **it enters the fractionating column as a _gaseous mixture_**\(\rightarrow\) ALL the fractions exist as vapour at the same time and then **separate out by selectively condensing Note:** During fractional distillation the liquids **DO NOT 'boil' or 'evaporate' one at a time

## Difference between bioresources and biofuels

Bioresources are raw materials from human or animal activity that are renewable and biodegradable, however, biofuels are fuels that may be derived from bioresources, to be used as alternatives to conventional fossil fuels.

## Government's Plan to Support Domestic Power Generation

It's plan is to blend the use of biomethane in larger quantities with natural gas in the piped networks to support domestic power generation.

Three Factors for Consideration before Extensive Implementation of Use of Biofuels in Singapore.

* Cost effectiveness in emissions reduction
* Existing infrastructure for fuels and feedstocks
* Suitability of applications for deployment by 205o.

Suggest one negative impact of the use of biofuel and bioresources on the biodiversity, land use and carbon cycle.

* Biodiversity : With the need for biofuel, there might be a tendency to increase the production of certain types of crops. This will lead to the loss of biodiversity and possible disruption in the natural eco-systems.
* Land use: With the demand for biofuel, there might be demand for land use to grow such crops to meet the demand. There will be competing uses for the land such as for agricultural needs to support food compared to the fuel industry.
* Carbon cycle: Deforestation and land conversion programmes to clear and prepare the lands required to produce biofuel, may release significant amount of CO2. This can offset the environmental sustainability factor of biofuels of being carbon-neutral.

Possible Contribution of Singapore

in Future of Biofuel

Singapore could possibly be a leader in the importing of biofuels and

refining them for export.

## 11 Biofuels

* Biofuels are alternative renewable energy sources to crude oil and natural gas.
* Biofuels are a renewable energy source that is derived from plant, algal or animal biomass.

## 12 Carbon-Intensive Sectors

* Electricity generation
* Transport industry
* Heavy industry
* Types of businesses that carry a high capital cost, high barriers to entry and low transportability, e.g. petrochemical industry, oil refining, aerospace and aviation.

**Bioruel is a renewable energy source that is derived from plant, algal, or animal biomass.**

**Solid Biofuel:**

* Wood chips

**Liquid biofuel:**

* Biodiesel (from vegetable oil)
* Bioethanol (from sugarcane and corn) **Gaseous biofuel**
* Biogas (from animal waste)

**Bioresources** are raw materials from human or animal activity that are renewable and biodegradable.

Examples of bioresources are wood chips, vegetable oil, animal fats.

## Introduction to Organic Chemistry

Cryanic Compounds

Elements that most organic compounds contain:

* All organic compounds contain **carbon**.
* Most also contain hydrogen
* Others may contain elements such as oxygen, nitrogen or a halogen.

Homologous Series

* A homologous series is a family of compounds with the **same general formula and similar chemical properties.**
* Each homologous series has a general formula.
* Subsequent members of organic compounds in the same homologous series differ by a chemical formula of -CH\({}_{2}\)

Functional Group

* A functional group is a group of atoms that are bonded together in a way that is unique to that particular homologous series. The functional group is responsible for a compound's characteristicchemical properties.
* As they possess the same functional group, members of the same homologous series will **react in a similar way to one another.**

## Properties

* E.g: Boiling point, Melting point, Electrical conductivity (physical properties).
* For Organic Chemistry: **Viscosity (physical)** and **Flammability (Chemical)**

## Viscosity

* Measure of "thickness" and stickiness of a liquid
* Ability of fluid to flow

## Flammability

* **Chemical property:** The ability of a chemical to burn or ignite, causing fire or combustion.
* **higher flashpoint, lower flammability.**

## Trends: MP and BP (physical)

### Trend and Explanation

The melting points and boiling points of the alkanes generally increases as _relative molecular mass_ increases.

* Larger molecules have stronger intermolecular forces of attraction.
* More energy is required to overcome the stronger intermolecular forces of attraction.
* higher MP and BP.

## Trends: Flammability (chemical)

### Trend and Explanation

The flashpoints of the alkanes and alkenes generally increases as _relative molecular mass increases \(\rightarrow\) flammability_ decreases.

* larger molecules have stronger intermolecular forces of attraction, thus less volatile (likelihood of existing as a gas)
* larger molecules also have higher percentage of carbon \(\rightarrow\) requires more oxygen to burn \(\rightarrow\) less flammable.

### Trends: Viscosity (Physical)

### Trend and Explanation

As relative molecular mass increases, the liquid alkanes and alkenes have _higher viscosity_.

* larger molecules have stronger intermolecular forces of attraction.
* harder for liquid containing larger molecules to flow.

### Summary

The gradual change in properties can be observed in **all** homologous series as a result of the _increase in molecular mass of molecules down the homologous series_.

Isomerism

## Definition

Isomerism is the phenomenon where **compounds (isomers) have the same molecular formula but different structural formulae.**

* Do not have to be of the same homologous series.
* Different homologous series can have the **same molecular formula.**

## Appendix Abreak down into smaller molecules
* \(\mathrm{CH_{3}COOCH_{3}+H_{2}O\to CH_{3}COOH+CH_{3}OH}\) with dilute acid/alkali catalyst.

## 10.1 Alkanes

* C and C
- H covalent bonds \(\to\) Hard to break
* Undergo **combustion, substitution** and **cracking**.

## 10.2 Combustion

The complete combustion of an alkane produces carbon dioxide and water. The reaction is very important because it is highly exothermic.

\[\mathrm{CH_{4}(g)+2O_{2}(g)\to CO_{2}(g)+2H_{2}O(g)}\]

## Appendix A

## Method A: Fermentation of Glucose

* Fermentation: chemical process in which **microorganisms** such as yeast act on glucose to produce ethanol and carbon dioxide.
* Yeast contains **enzymes** that catalyse the breakdown of glucose to form ethanol and carbon dioxide.

### Balanced Chemical Equation

* Absence of oxygen
* Enzymes in yeast

### Method B: Hydration of Alkanes

### Essential Conditions

* High temperature and pressure (300 degrees Celsius, 60 atm),
* H3PO4 catalyst

### Physical Properties of Alcohols

* Soluble in water
* Most are liquids at room temperature
* Alcohols with more carbon atoms (12 and above) are solids at roomtemperature

The ability to form hydrogen bonds (a type of intermolecular force) allows alcohols to interact with water molecules allowing it dissolves in water.

More energy is also required to overcome the hydrogen bonds resulting in higher melting and boiling points of alcohol

### Solubility of Alcohols

* All alkanes are insoluble in water.
* Alcohols: solubility decreases as number of carbons in chain increases
* The alkyl group (carbon chain) is non-polar and cannot form hydrogen bonds with water.
* The longer the carbon chain, the more insoluble the alcohol.

## How do Alcohols React?

Alcohols are generally more reactive than alkanes.

* O and O
- H bonds in alcohols are more reactive than the C
- C and C
- H bonds in alkanes

### Combustion of Alcohol

* Like all organic compounds, alcohols undergo combustion in the presence of oxygen and heat to produce **carbon dioxide and steam.** \[\text{C}_{2}\text{H}_{5}\text{OH}\left(\text{I}\right)+3\text{O}_{2}\left( \text{g}\right)\to 2\text{ CO}_{2}\left(\text{g}\right)+3\text{ H}_{2}\text{O}(\text{g})\]

## Oxidation

\[\mathrm{C_{3}H_{7}OH}\rightarrow\mathrm{C_{2}H_{5}COOH}\]

with acidified \(\mathrm{KMnO_{4}}\)

What is the proof that the alcohol has been oxidised?

* Oxygen atom has been added to propanol to form propanoic acid.

What happens if wine is left exposed to air?

* Ethanol in wine is oxidised by aerobic bacteria, forming ethanoic acid.
* This process only happens to ethanol

## Dehydration

with concentrated \(\mathrm{H_{3}PO_{4}}\) catalyst

### As a solvent

* Used in paints, varnishes and perfumes.
* Why is alcohol a good solvent?

The structure of alcohol enables interaction with the organic substances which would not have dissolved in water.

The presence of the hydroxyl group allows to form hydrogen bonds readily with other non-organic substances.

### As a fuel

* Main constituent in methylated spirit (used in spirit lamps and burners)
* In some countries, it is added to petrol and sold as a "blend".

Note

### Why does the use of dilute acid favour the reverse reaction?

## Maintaining Air Quality

* **Nitrogen:** 78%
* **Oxygen:** 21%
* **Argon:** 0.96%
* **Carbon Dioxide:** 0.04%

## Humidity

Humidity is the measurement of water vapour content in air and the water vapour content in air varies.

### Suggest a possible reason why the water vapour content in air varies

Humidity is affected by **temperature** and **pressure**.

**Location** can also affect the humidity. In the desert, it is likely that there will be less water vapour present as compared to the coastal areas.
How can air be separated to obtain the various constituent gases?

\begin{tabular}{|p{113.8pt}|p{113.8pt}|p{113.8pt}|} \hline
**Type of Gas** & \multicolumn{2}{c|}{**Composition by Volume**} & \multicolumn{1}{c|}{**Boiling Point /**} \\ \hline Nitrogen & 78\% & -196.0 \\ \hline Oxygen & 21\% & -183.0 \\ \hline Argon & 0.93\% & -185.0 \\ \hline Carbon dioxide & 0.04\% & -78.5 \\ \hline \end{tabular}

Based on the table, each gas has its own boiling point and **through fractional distillation of liquefied air,** it is possible to obtain each individual gas.

* In the Haber Process, the nitrogen used in the manufacture of ammonia is obtained through distillation of liquefied air.
* However, this is not encouraged for gases aside from nitrogen.
* That is due to the fact that attempting to obtain any gas aside from nitrogen from liquefied air gives a low yield as the composition of gases in air shows that majority of air is made up of nitrogen.
