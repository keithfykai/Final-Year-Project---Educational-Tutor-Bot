### _Circular Motion: An Introduction_

(a) express angular displacement in radians.

So far, we have discussed the motion of an object in a **straight** line (linear motion) and a **parabolic** path (projectile motion). However, in real life, there are many cases of objects moving in an arc of a circle or a circular path.

For example, we can tie a ball to a string and swing it in a horizontal circle.

Suppose the radius of this circle is \(r\) and the ball travels a distance (arc length) of \(s\), its angular displacement will be \(\theta\).

Angle \(\theta\) in radians is the ratio of the distance \(s\) along a circular arc subtended by \(\theta\) divided by the radius \(r\).

If \(s\) = \(r\), then \(\theta\) =1 radian.

One **radian** is

Since \(\pi=\dfrac{\text{circumference of circle}}{\text{diameter of circle}}\), the circumference of a circle = \(2\pi r\).

So \(\theta=\dfrac{\text{s}}{r}=\dfrac{2\pi r}{r}=2\pi\)\(\Rightarrow\)\(\theta\) for one revolution = \(2\pi\).

\(2\pi\) radian = \(360^{\circ}\)

Thus, 1 radian = \(\dfrac{360^{\circ}}{2\pi}=57.3^{\circ}\)

Conversion to degree can be done using: \(\pi\) (rad) = 180\({}^{\circ}\)

Translate degrees to radians: \(\dfrac{\pi}{180}\times\theta\) (degrees)

Translate radians to degrees: \(\dfrac{180}{\pi}\times\theta\) (radians)

#### 6.1.1 Angular velocity \(\omega\)

(b) show an understanding of and use the concept of angular velocity to solve problems.

Angular velocity, \(\omega\), is the rate of change of angular displacement.

Its unit is rad s\({}^{-1}\).

When the angular velocity is constant,

\[\omega=\frac{\text{angle moved through in time}\,t}{\text{time taken}}=\frac{ \theta}{t}\]

the body is then said to be undergoing **uniform circular motion**, i.e. the motion of an object moving in circular path at constant speed.

For our syllabus, we are **mainly** interested in objects moving in **uniform circular motion**.

If a body undergoing uniform circular motion takes \(T\) seconds to complete 1 full revolution, i.e., its period is \(T\) seconds,

where \(f\) represents the frequency of the circular motion.

1.2 Relationship between angular velocity \(\omega\) and linear speed \(\nu\) for uniform circular motion

(c) recall and use \(\nu=\pi\omega\) to solve problems.

From \(s=r\theta\), the linear speed of an object (e.g. P, as shown in the diagram) can be determined via calculus.

If \(r\) is a constant,

\[\frac{ds}{dt}=r\,\frac{d\theta}{dt}\]

Therefore,

This relationship is only valid when \(\omega\) is measured in rad s\({}^{-1}\).

Note that the direction of the (linear) velocity is tangential to the circular path.

For an object rotating about an axis, every point on the object has the same angular velocity. The tangential speed of any point is proportional to its distance from the axis of rotation.

**Question 6.1**

Find the angular velocity of the second, minute and hour hands of a clock. If the second hand, minute hand and the hour hand is 5.0 cm, 5.0 cm and 4.0 cm long respectively, find the linear speed of the tip of each hand.

Using \(\omega=\frac{2\pi}{T}\), for second hand, \(\omega=\frac{2\pi}{T}=0.105\) rad s\({}^{-1}\)

for minute hand, \(\omega=\frac{2\pi}{T}=1.75\times 10^{-3}\) rad s\({}^{-1}\)

for hour hand, \(\omega=\frac{2\pi}{T}=1.45\times 10^{-4}\) rad s\({}^{-1}\)

Using \(\nu=r\omega\), for second hand, \(\nu=\big{(}\) \(\big{)}\big{(}0.105\big{)}=5.25\times 10^{-3}\) m s\({}^{-1}\)

for minute hand, \(\nu=\big{(}\) \(\big{)}\big{(}1.75\times 10^{-3}\big{)}=8.75\times 10^{-6}\) m s\({}^{-1}\)

for hour hand, \(\nu=\big{(}\) \(\big{)}\big{(}1.45\times 10^{-4}\big{)}=5.80\times 10^{-6}\) m s\({}^{-1}\)

**Question 6.2**

A Blu-ray disc (BD) rotating inside a player must maintain a constant linear speed of 4.92 m s\({}^{-1}\) in order for the information on it to be read correctly. The laser in the Blu-ray player starts at the inside of the disc and moves outwards.

(a) State and explain what must happen to the angular velocity of the disc as the BD is played.

(b) Calculate the radius at which the BD will have an angular velocity of 23.1 revolutions per second when the linear speed is 4.92 m s\({}^{-1}\).

Answers:

(a) The angular velocity of the disc must................... when the laser is moving outwards to read the info. Since \(\nu=r\omega\), when \(r\) increases, \(\omega\) must................... to keep \(\nu\) constant.

### Analysis of uniform circular motion

#### 6.2.1 Centripetal acceleration in uniform circular motion

(e)   recall and use centripetal acceleration \(\alpha=\kappa v^{2}\), and \(\alpha=\sqrt[2]{r}\) to solve problems.

A body is moving round a circle radius \(r\) with constant angular velocity \(\omega\). It moves from point A to point B in a brief time of \(\delta t\). Its velocity changes from \(v_{\rm A}\) to \(v_{\rm B}\) in this time (change in direction but not magnitude).

In time \(\delta t\), the body moves round the circle a distance arc AB of length \(r\,\delta\theta\).

Its speed \(\nu=r\,\frac{\delta\theta}{\delta t}=ro\).

The vector diagram shows that the change in velocity in time \(\delta t\), \(\delta\nu=\nu\,\delta\theta\) (if \(\delta\theta\) is small)

The average acceleration of the body between A and B (rate of change of velocity) \(=\frac{\delta\nu}{\delta t}=\frac{\nu\delta\theta}{\delta t}\)

In the limit when \(\delta t\) approaches zero, \(\lim_{\delta t\to\infty}\frac{\delta\theta}{\delta t}=\frac{d \theta}{dt}=\omega\),

The acceleration of the body at any point is

As \(\delta\theta\) becomes infinitesimally small, \(\delta\nu\) is perpendicular to \(v_{\rm A}\). Since \(\delta\nu\) is in the same direction as the acceleration, the direction of acceleration of the body undergoing uniform circular motion is towards the centre of the circular path. This acceleration is called the **centripetal acceleration**.

Centripetal acceleration is one which is always perpendicular to the velocity and always acts towards the centre of the circular motion.

This centripetal acceleration can also be expressed as

#### 6.2.2 Centripetal force in uniform circular motion

(d) describe qualitatively motion in a curved path due to a perpendicular force, and understand the centripetal acceleration in the case of uniform motion in a circle.

Recall: An object at rest will remain at rest and an object in motion will remain in motion at constant velocity in the absence of an external resultant force.

Consider an object moving in uniform circular motion at _constant angular velocity_, \(\omega\), from A to B.

If no external resultant force acts on the object, by Newton's 1\({}^{\text{st}}\) Law (N1L), the object will travel from A to C with a _constant velocity_, \(\nu\).

However, since the object **travels along the curved path** from A to B, this implies that **an external resultant force \(F\) must have acted on the object to change its velocity**.

Instead of arriving at C, the object arrives at B. This means that the object must have been "pulled" towards the centre of the circle "by this external resultant force" \(F\).

Since the object is **moving at constant speed** in a circle, there is no component of acceleration in the direction of motion, implying there is **no component of the external resultant force acting along the tangential path** of the object.

[_Conversely, if the speed is changing (not constant), there will be a component of the external resultant force acting tangentially to the circle. This_ component _causes a change in speed_.]

If there is no component of the external resultant force acting along the direction of motion, the **external resultant force must always be at right angles to the motion** and **directed along a radius towards the centre**. Since the object is turning steadily at constant rate (**constant \(\omega\)**), the external resultant force must be **constant in magnitude** (**but always changing in direction**) towards the centre to produce this uniform circular motion.

By Newton's 2\({}^{\text{nd}}\) Law (N2L), for an object with constant mass that is accelerating, the direction of its acceleration and the external resultant force acting on it are the same. Hence, the **direction of the acceleration** of an object undergoing _uniform_ circular motion must be **acting towards the centre of the circular path** as well (in the same direction as its external resultant force).

The _resultant_ acceleration and the external _resultant_ force found in _uniform_ circular motion is also known as _centripetal_ acceleration \(a\) and _centripetal_ force \(F\) respectively.

Similar to an external resultant force, the centripetal force is NOT an additional force acting on the object. It should not be drawn on any free-body diagrams. It can be a combination of forces like tension, friction, gravitational force, electric force etc.

### Application of N2L

(f) recall and use centripetal force \(F=m\nu^{2}\), and \(F=m\nu^{2}/t\) to solve problems.

Applying N2L to a body that has mass \(m\), the centripetal force that must act to produce the uniform circular motion is

For uniform circular motion, the centripetal acceleration is constant in magnitude (but always changing in direction) and the associated centripetal force, which is required to produce this motion, is also constant in magnitude (but always changing in direction).

Notes:

As the centripetal force acts at right angles to the motion, it only changes the direction of the velocity, but not the speed of the object.

Centripetal acceleration is not constant as its direction is constantly changing.

Centripetal force is a resultant force towards the centre of the circle and therefore the object executing circular motion is not in equilibrium.

The fact that the centripetal force is normal to the velocity means that work is not being done by this force as the displacement of the object is always perpendicular to the force.

If the centripetal force producing the centripetal acceleration vanishes, the object does not continue to move in its circular path; instead, it will move along a tangential path.

#### 6.3.1 Steps to solve problems involving circular motion

(a) Draw a free body diagram for the problem

(b) Identify the centre of the circular motion

(c) Choose a suitable coordinate system

(d) Resolve the forces, if necessary

(e) Apply N2L to solve the problem

\({}^{\star}\) Ensure that \(r\) is the radius of the circular path!

**Question 6.3**

When a bung of mass \(m\) is whirled with constant angular velocity \(\omega\) in a horizontal circle at the end of a string of length \(l\), the string itself will not be horizontal. The point at which the string is held will be above the plane of the circle.

(a) Draw a diagram showing the forces acting on the bung.

(b) What force, in addition to the centripetal force, does the string provide?

(c) What happens to the angle which the string makes with the vertical if the angular velocity of the bung increases?* [2] It also provides a vertical component to balance the weight of the bung.
* [3] Vertically, (1) Horizontally, (2) As \(\omega\) increases, \(T\) [1] [if \(l\) is kept constant, from (2)] From (1), as \(T\) increases, \(\cos\ \theta\) [1], thus \(\theta\) [1] Both \(\theta\) and \(T\) [1] so that the above equations are still true at the increased \(\omega\).

Note that \(\cos\ \theta=\) [1].

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:9]

Because the tyres of the car can only provide a certain................... friction, a car travelling too fast may not get round the bend even though the wheels are pointing in the right direction. It may skid.

One way of reducing the possibility of slipping at a corner is to (slope or) bank the road so that the normal contact force of the road acting on the car provide a component directed to the centre of the circular path.

For a particular speed, this force will produce exactly the centripetal force required.

At other speeds some lateral frictional force needs to come into play.

**Question 6.5**

Show that, for a vehicle taking a bend at speed \(\nu\), the banking of the curve to eliminate side slip (any tendency to skid) is given by

\[\tan\theta=\frac{\nu^{2}}{gr}\]

where \(\theta\) is the angle between the road surface and the horizontal.

Here, the horizontal component of the normal contact force \(N\) between the car and the road provides the centripetal force required to keep the car moving round the bend.

#### Trains

**Question 6.6**

(a) A new high-speed train is designed to travel at 200 km h\({}^{-1}\). Calculate the banking angle needed on a track of radius 0.25 km if that speed is to be sustained without the train trying to push the rails out of place. (Hint: this means that the force on the train produced by the rails will be perpendicular to the ground.)

(b) What will passengers feel if the train takes this banked curve at speeds below 200 km h\({}^{-1}\)?

(c) What will passengers feel if the train takes the curve at speeds above 200 km h\({}^{-1}\)?

(a) (In practice, the train will not travel round a bend at maximum speed and the track banking (normal push by the ground) is unlikely to provide all the necessary centripetal force. Hence the angle will probably be less than 52\({}^{\circ}\).)

(b) Passengers feel a tendency to slide laterally................... the centre of the bend.

(c) Passengers feel a tendency to slide laterally................... from the centre of the bend.

**Question 6.10**:

A pair of water can be whirled in a vertical circular path of radius \(r\) such that no water is spilled. If the acceleration of free fall near the surface of the Earth is \(g\),

* why does the water remain in the pair, even when the pall is upside down?
* determine the minimum linear speed of the pall at the highest point such that the water remains in the pall.
* estimate the minimum angular velocity at which a pall of water must pass over your head at arm's length in a vertical circle if you are to remain dry.

* The water tends to follow a straight-line path. However, the pall is being pulled inwards, so the water in it gets pushed in, against its bottom. The pall exerts force on the water towards the centre. This force \(N\) and the weight of water \(W\) provide the centripetal force needed to keep the water in circular motion.

If the pall is swung very fast, a larger centripetal force is needed. If \(W\) is insufficient to provide this centripetal force, \(N\) needs to be present and act in the same direction as \(W\) (downwards), to help to provide the centripetal force.

Non-zero \(N\) means the water needs to be in contact with the pair, and not spilling out.

Consider the water only as the system. By N2L,

* \(N+W=\dfrac{mv^{2}}{r}\)

If the water were to stay in the pall, the contact force with the pall must be present, i.e. \(N\) > 0.
* For the water to stay in contact with the pall, \(N\) > 0.

* For the water to stay in contact with the pall, the speed at the top of the circle:

\(v>\sqrt{rg}\)

If \(r=1.0\) m, \(g=9.81\) m s\({}^{-2}\),

\(v>\sqrt{(1.0)(9.81)}=3.13\) m s\({}^{-1}\).

\(\Rightarrow\omega=\dfrac{v}{r}>\dfrac{3.13\) m s\({}^{-1}}{1.0\) m

\(\Rightarrow f>\dfrac{\big{(}}{\big{(}}\dfrac{\big{)}}{\big{(}}\big{)}}=\)

#### Roller Coaster

**Question 6.11**

The figure shows a roller coaster moving around an almost circular loop of radius \(R\).

Assume that frictional forces may be neglected. Derive expression in terms of \(g\) and \(R\) for the

* minimum speed the car must have at the top for it to be just in contact with the loop,
* speed at which the car must enter at the bottom of the track so that the car just makes it over the top of the loop.

(a) At top of loop, by N2L:

If car is _just in contact, \(N\)_ = 0:

\(mg=\frac{m{\nu_{\text{top}}}^{2}}{R}\)\(\nu_{\text{top}}=\sqrt{gR}\)
* For the car to _just_ make it over the top of the loop,

\(\nu_{\text{top}}=\sqrt{gR}\)

By principle of conservation of energy, decrease in \(E_{\text{t}}\) = increase in \(E_{\text{p}}\)

(\({\nu_{\text{bot}}}^{2}-{\nu_{\text{top}}}^{2}\)) = 2g(2R)

\({\nu_{\text{bot}}}^{2}-gR=2g(2R)\)

\({\nu_{\text{bot}}}^{2}=5gR\Rightarrow\nu_{\text{bot}}=\sqrt{5gR}\)

### Application III: Spin driers

In a spin drier, the clothes move around in a circle because the walls of the spinning cylinder provide the centripetal force. The holes in the cylinder are small enough to prevent clothes going through, but large and frequent enough not to impede the water. Very large forces are required to keep a mass spinning in a circle at high speed.

**Question 6.12**:

1. In which direction will the water travel when it is 'thrown out' of a spin drier?
2. Calculate the maximum force a water molecule will need to keep it in the spinner, if the cylinder is turning 6000 times every minute and has a diameter of 0.5 m. Take the mass of a water molecule as \(3\times 10^{-26}\) kg.
3. An automatic washing-machine manufacturer advertises on TV that they have increased the rotational frequency of the cylinder from 5000 to 8000 revs per minute. What percentage increase in the'squeezing force' does this represent?

1. \(\omega=2\pi f=2\pi\times\left(\frac{6000}{60}\right)\) rad s\({}^{-1}\) Using \(F=mo^{2}r\),

\(F=\)
2. The squeezing force is proportional to \(\omega^{2}\), therefore, the squeezing force increases by a factor of \((8/5)^{2}=64/25\).

Percentage increase is \(\left[\frac{64}{25}-1\right]\times 100\%=\)* [30]
