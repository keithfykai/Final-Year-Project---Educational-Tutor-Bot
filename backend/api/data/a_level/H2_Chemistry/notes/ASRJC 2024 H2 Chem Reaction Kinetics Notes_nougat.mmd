We have been taking a rather simple approach to chemical change, i.e.: reactants mix, and products are formed. A balanced equation is an essential quantitative tool for calculating product yields from reactant amounts, but it tells us nothing about how fast the reaction is.

In energetics, we learnt about energy changes that accompany chemical reactions. While the value of the energy changes may indicate the direction of the chemical change, it does not tell us how fast a reaction proceeds. The rate of reaction can only be determined by experiment.

Reactions occur at a wide range of rates. Some, like a neutralisation, a precipitation, or an explosive redox process, seems to be over as soon as the reactants make contact - in a fraction of a second. Others, such as the reactions involved in rusting or decaying, take a moderate length of time, from minutes to months or even thousands of years.

Kinetics studies are important as it provide information on the rate and economic feasibility of a process in the industry. From there, an optimal set of conditions can be chosen to maximise the output in the shortest time frame. Knowing the mechanism will also allow the modification of processes or reactants, thereby increasing its effectiveness. For example, knowing how quickly a medicine acts or blood clots can make the difference between life and death; how long it takes for cement to harden or polyethylene to form can make the difference between profit and loss.

In general, the rates of these diverse process / reactions depend very much on the same variables, most of which chemist can manipulate to maximise yields within a given time or to slow down an unwanted reaction. In this lecture, you will look at both the quantitative and qualitative aspects of reaction kinetics.

* _Reaction Kinetics_ is a study of the _rates_ of chemical reactions, the factors which affect them and the mechanism by which chemical reactions occur.
* The rate of chemical reaction varies greatly with different reactions and under different conditions. Factors that can affect the rate of a reaction include:
* temperature condition of the reaction,
* concentration of reactants (or pressure, for gaseous reactions),
* particle size of reactant,
* presence of catalyst.

We will apply the _Collision Theory_ to explain how these various factors affect the rates of chemical reactions (refer to _Section 7_).

* We can measure the rate of a reaction by monitoring the _rate of change_ of an _observable property_ in the reaction, such as concentration of reactants or concentration of products, or mass, volume of gas etc. (refer to _Section 10_).
* Kinetic experiments can also be performed to examine quantitatively how the various factors (e.g. change in concentration of a reactant) affect the rate of a reaction. (You will perform some kinetics experiments in the lab).
* Quantitative data from these experiments is used to derive an important equation called the _rate equation_ that is unique for a reaction under a set of conditions (refer to _Section 5_).
* The rate equation allows us to determine the factors or conditions to increase (or decrease) the rate of a reaction, and most importantly, provides information on how the chemical reaction takes place at the molecular level, that is, information on the _reaction mechanism_ (refer to _Section 6_).

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:4]

A curve obtained for a concentration versus time graph means the rate of the reaction changes as the concentration of the reactant changes during the reaction.
* Thus, a time interval that covers the entire duration of a reaction is not very useful especially if the rate of the reaction is affected significantly by the concentration of the reactant as it does not tell us how fast the concentration is changing at a given instant.
* However, the average rate can still be useful if we measure it over a very short time interval as we will see in **(c)**.
* **Instantaneous rate**
* Instantaneous rate refers to the rate of a reaction at a specific point of time. It is defined as the rate of change in concentration of a reactant or product at a specific point of time (e.g. at time t\({}_{1}\))
* The instantaneous rate can be obtained from a concentration-time graph of the reaction by drawing a tangent to the graph at a specific time and determining the gradient (as shown below).

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:6]

### Initial Rate

* Initial rate refers to the instantaneous rate at time zero (t = 0)
* It is the instantaneous rate at the start of the reaction, when an infinitely small amount of the reactant has been used up.

* In practice as shown in Fig. 2, the _initial rate_ can be approximated by the _average rate_ if we measure it over a _very short time interval / period_.

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:8]

## 3 Rate Equation (or Rate Law), Rate Constant & Order of Reaction

* Changing the concentration of a reactant commonly (**but not always**) will change the rate of reaction.
* The stoichiometric equation (balanced equation) cannot be used to predict the effect of concentration of a reactant on rate for reactions occurring at a fixed temperature.
* The relationship between rate of reaction and the concentration of reactants can only be determined **experimentally**.

### Rate Equation (or Rate Law)

* zC If experimental data shows that rate \(\propto\) [A]\({}^{n}\) and rate \(\propto\) [B]\({}^{n}\), then the rate equation is **Rate = \(k\) [A]\({}^{n}\) [B]\({}^{n}\) where \(k\) is the rate constant; \(m\) is the order of reaction with respect to \(A\) _n_ is the order of reaction with respect to \(B\) (_m_ + _n_) is the overall order of reaction **Definition:** The rate equation relates the rate of reaction to the concentration of reactants raised to the appropriate power.
* The units for rate of reaction is **mol dm\({}^{-3}\) time\({}^{-1}\) (SI units for time is's')**

### Order of reaction

* The order of reaction with respect to a given reactant is the power to which the concentration of the reactant is raised in the **experimentally determined** rate equation.
* Order of a reaction is a number that tells us how a change in concentration of a reactant affects the rate of a reaction.
* The order of a reaction is an experimentally determined value. It is not necessarily equivalent to the stoichiometric coefficient of the reactant in the balanced equation (i.e. **m** and **n** need _not_ necessarily be equal to x and y respectively).
* Orders of reaction are usually integers but for some complex reactions, they can be **negative** or **fractional**. **(Note:** For A-level, common values of m or n are 0, 1 and 2.)* **Overall order of reaction** is the sum of the individual orders with respect to each of the reactants. In the above example, Order of reaction with respect to reactant **A**: \(\underline{\textbf{m}}\) Order of reaction with respect to reactant **B**: \(\underline{\textbf{n}}\) Overall order of the reaction = **m** + **n**

### **Rate constant, \(k\)**

* It is a **constant of proportionality in a rate equation**.
* Its value depends on **temperature** and the **activation energy** of the reaction, and is **not** dependent on the concentration of reactants.
* The units of \(k\) depend on the overall order of reaction and the time unit. You need to derive the units for \(k\) mathematically.

#### 3.3.1 **Effect of Temperature and Catalyst on Rate Constant, \(k\)**

* **Increasing temperature** will **increase** the value of \(k\)**
* **Presence of catalyst** (which provides an alternative reaction pathway of lower activation energy) will **increase** the value of \(k\) These effects can be seen from the Arrhenius Equation. The _Arrhenius Equation_ is useful in predicting how changes in temperature or addition of catalyst affects the rate constant, \(k\), of a reaction. where \(k\) is the rate constant \(A\) is the Arrhenius constant (related to collision frequency and molecular orientation) \(E_{a}\) is the activation energy of the reaction \(R\) is the universal gas constant \(T\) is the absolute temperature in Kelvin, K From the equation, it can be seen that rate constant, \(k\), is affected by changes in \(E_{a}\) and \(T\) (and other factors, broadly the frequency factor and the energy factor).

### First-Order Reaction

_Definition:_

A reaction that is first-order with respect to a reactant **A** is one whereby the rate of reaction is

**directly proportional to [A]**, i.e. rate **a [A]**.

* Consider the reaction: **A**\(\,\rightarrow\,\) product

If the _experimentally determined_ rate equation is:

**rate = _k [A]_** **where \(k\) is the rate constant**

**when [A] doubles, increases by a factor of 2)**

**when [A] triples, increases by a factor of 3)**

* **Characteristics of a first-order reaction:**

- The rate constant \(k\) has units of: \(\frac{\text{mol}\,\text{dm}^{-3}\,\text{s}^{-1}}{\text{mol}\,\text{dm}^{-3}}\)\(\,=\,\)\(\,\underline{\textbf{s}^{-1}}\) (or \(\,\text{min}^{-1}\,/\,\text{h}^{-1}\,\text{etc.}\))

- The graph of rate against [A] is a straight line which passes through the origin and has a positive gradient. (refer to Graph 3 below)

- The reaction has a **half-life, t\({}_{\textbf{t}n}\)**. (This will be discussed in the next section.)

* The graphs associated with a first-order reaction are shown below.

#### 4.2.1 Half-life, \(\mathbf{t_{i}}\)

The notion of half-life is one useful concept for describing reaction rate.

_Definition:_

The half-life of a reactant is the **time taken** for the concentration of a reactant to **decrease to half its original concentration**.

For a **first-order reaction**.

* the **half-life** of the reactant is **constant**, and
* the **half-life** is **independent of the initial concentration** of the reactant
* the relationship between half-life, \(t_{t/2}\) and rate constant, \(k\) at constant temperature is given by: \[t_{t/2}\ =\ \frac{\ln 2}{k}\]
* We can confirm whether the order of reaction with respect to a reactant is one or not by analysing a **concentration against time graph of the reactant or the product**.
* If **at least two constant half-lives** can be obtained from the **concentration against time graph**, the **order** with respect to the reactant is **one**.

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:17]

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:18]

### Second-Order Reaction

_Definition:_

A reaction that is second-order with respect to reactant **A** is one whereby the rate of reaction is

**directly proportional to IA2**.

* Consider the reaction: **A**\(\,\rightarrow\,\) product

If the _experimentally determined_ rate equation is:

\[\textbf{rate}=\textbf{{k}}\,\textbf{{[A]}}^{2}\] where \(k\) is the rate constant

when **[A] doubles**, rate increases 2\({}^{2}\) = 4 times (quadruples)** (or, when [A] increases by a factor of 2, rate increases by a factor of 4).

when **[A] triples**, rate increases 3\({}^{2}\) = 9 times** (or, when [A] increases by a factor of 3, rate increases by a factor of 9).

* Units of rate constant \(k\) for second-order reaction: \(\textbf{mol}^{-1}\,\textbf{dm}^{3}\,\textbf{time}^{-1}\) (time: s, min, h etc)

The graphs associated with a second-order reaction are shown below.

* For a second-order reaction, half-life is **not constant**. In fact, the half-life gets greater as the reaction proceeds.
* Hence, the relationship: \(\textbf{t}_{1/2}=\frac{\text{ln 2}}{\textbf{{k}}}\) cannot be used for a second-order reaction.

**Checkpoint 4**

1. The rate equation for the reaction: \(\Gamma\) + CH\({}_{3}\)C\(I\)\(\rightarrow\) CH\({}_{3}\)I + C\(\Gamma\) is rate = \(k\) [\(\Gamma\)] [CH\({}_{3}\)C\(I\)]. Which one of the following statements is **false**?

**A** The overall order of reaction is 2.

**B** The rate of reaction is directly proportional to concentration of iodide ion.

**C** The unit for \(k\) is mol\({}^{-1}\) dm\({}^{3}\) s\({}^{-1}\).

**D** Doubling [\(\Gamma\)] and [CH\({}_{3}\)C\(I\)] will increase the rate of reaction 2 times.

Solution:

Option A: The order of reaction w.r.t. \(\Gamma\) and CH\({}_{3}\)C\(I\) is one. Therefore, the overall order of reaction is 2.

Option B: As the order of reaction w.r.t. \(\Gamma\) is one, increasing [\(\Gamma\)] will cause the rate to increase by the same factor, i.e. directly proportional.

Option C: units of \(k\) = \(\frac{\text{mol}\text{ dm}^{-3}\text{ s}^{-1}}{\text{(mol}\text{ dm}^{-3})^{2}}\) = mol\({}^{-1}\)dm\({}^{3}\)s\({}^{-1}\)

Option D: when [\(\Gamma\)] and [CH\({}_{3}\)C\(I\)] is doubled, the rate of reaction will increase 4 times.

Let the initial concentration of \(\Gamma\) and CH\({}_{3}\)C\(I\) each to be x.

rate = \(k\) [\(\Gamma\)] [CH\({}_{3}\)C\(I\)] = \(k\)\(\alpha\)\({}^{2}\)

When the [\(\Gamma\)] and [CH\({}_{3}\)C\(I\)] is doubled, the concentration of each will be 2x.

Substituting the new concentration into the rate equation,

rate = \(k\)(2x) (2x) = 4 \(k\)\(\alpha\)\({}^{2}\)

= 4 \(k\) [\(\Gamma\)] [CH\({}_{3}\)C\(I\)]

Therefore, the rate of reaction increases 4 times.

2. Which one of the following graphs will confirm that the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide is first order with respect to hydrogen peroxide?

Figure 10: For first–order reaction, the rate equation is rate = \(k\) [H\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{2}\)] which follows the graph of y = mx.

This is a straight–line graph passing through the origin.

### Pseudo first-order reaction

Under certain conditions, some reactions may exhibit a _pseudo first-order kinetics_. Some examples are shown below.

**(I) Presence of a large excess of a reactant**

Consider the reaction: \(2\Gamma(\text{aq})\ +\ S_{2}O_{8}{}^{2}(\text{aq})\ \to\ 2SO_{4}{}^{2}(\text{aq})\ +\ I_{2}(\text{aq})\)

The rate equation is found to be: **rate = \(k\) [S\({}_{2}\)O\({}^{2}\)] [\(\Gamma\)], the overall order of reaction = 2

If initial [S\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{8}{}^{2}\)] is much higher than initial [\(\Gamma\)], then [S\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{8}{}^{2}\)] will hardly change during the reaction relative to the change in [\(\Gamma\)].

Thus, [S\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{8}{}^{2}\)] is relatively constant throughout the reaction and will not affect the rate of reaction.

Hence, the rate equation can be simplified as:

\[\textbf{rate = }\textbf{\emph{k}}^{\prime}\textbf{[}\Gamma\textbf{]}\qquad\qquad \textbf{where }\textbf{\emph{k}}^{\prime}\textbf{\emph{= k}}\textbf{[}\text{S${}_{2}$O${}_{8}${}^{2}$-}\textbf{]}\]

Under this condition where there is excess of S\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{8}{}^{2}\), this reaction is regarded as a **pseudo first-order reaction** with respect to \(\Gamma\).

In this case, the [\(\Gamma\)]-time graph will indicate a constant half-life, t\({}_{1/2}\), where:

\[\textbf{t}_{3}=\frac{\text{ln}2}{\emph{k}}\ =\ \frac{\text{ln}2}{\emph{k}\left[ \text{S${}_{2}$O${}_{8}${}^{2}$-}\textbf{]}\right.}\]

**(II) When the Reactant is also a Solvent in the reaction**

Consider the hydrolysis of ethyl ethanoate in water.

\[\text{CH${}_{3}$CO${}_{2}$C${}_{2}$H${}_{8}$(aq)}\ +\ H_{2}$O$(l)\ \to\ \text{CH${}_{3}$CO${}_{2}$H$(aq)}\ +\ \text{CH${}_{3}$CH${}_{2}$OH$(aq)}\]

Given that **rate = \(k\) [CH\({}_{3}\)CO\({}_{2}\)C\({}_{2}\)H\({}_{3}\)] [H\({}_{2}\)O], the overall order of reaction = 2

As water is used as the solvent in this reaction, it is present in a large excess. Hence, [H\({}_{2}\)O] remains relatively constant throughout the reaction.

Hence, the rate equation can be simplified as:

\[\textbf{rate = }\textbf{\emph{k}}^{\prime}\textbf{[}\text{CH${}_{3}$CO${}_{2}$C$ {}_{2}$H${}_{8}$]}\qquad\text{where }\textbf{\emph{k}}^{\prime}\textbf{ = }\textbf{\emph{k}}\textbf{[}\text{H${}_{2}$O$]}\]

This reaction is regarded as a **pseudo first-order reaction** with respect to **CH\({}_{3}\)CO\({}_{2}\)C\({}_{2}\)H\({}_{5}\)**.

Similarly in this case, the [CH\({}_{3}\)CO\({}_{2}\)C\({}_{2}\)H\({}_{5}\)]-time graph will indicate a constant half-life, t\({}_{1/2}\):

\[\textbf{t}_{3}=\frac{\text{ln}2}{\emph{k}}\ =\ \frac{\text{ln}2}{\emph{k}\left[ \text{H${}_{2}$O$}\right]}\qquad\text{Note:}\]

Refer application of this relationship in Example 5 on page 36

### Presence of a Catalyst

Consider the hydrolysis of sucrose in the presence of hydrochloric acid as the catalyst.

\begin{tabular}{c c c c c c} C\({}_{12}\)H\({}_{22}\)O\({}_{11}\) & + & H\({}_{2}\)O & C\({}_{6}\)H\({}_{12}\)O\({}_{6}\) & + & C\({}_{6}\)H\({}_{12}\)O\({}_{6}\) \\ sucrose & & & glucose & fructose \\ \end{tabular}

* Experimentally, the rate equation is found to be: **rate = \(k\) [HC/] [sucrose]
* HC/ acts as a **cataly**, a substance that **increases** the **rate of the reaction without being consumed** in the reaction. It is **used** and then **regenerated**. Consequently, the [HC/] remains relatively constant during the reaction, i.e. [HC/] \(\approx\) constant
* Hence, the reaction is **pseudo first-order** with respect to **sucrose** and the rate equation can be simplified to: **rate = _k'_ [sucrose] & where _k' = \(k\) [HC/] \\ \end{tabular}

### Summary

* Consider the rate equation, rate = \(k\) [A]\({}^{m}\)_, where A is a reactant, and \(m\) can be 0, 1, 2, 3,....

\begin{tabular}{c c c c} \(m\) & order of reaction & & & \\ w.r.t.

## 5 Determination of Rate Equation (or Rate Law)

The rate of a reaction can be investigated by **monitoring measurable changes** over time during the course of the reaction, using either **continuous** or **initial rate method**

* Only **one set** of experiment is carried out and the **change in concentration** of either the **reactant or** the **product** is **monitored over a period of time**. Some of the methods to measure the change include sampling and titration method, measuring volume of gas produced etc.
- A **[reactant]-time or a [product]-time graph** is usually drawn and used to determine the orders of reaction and rate equation.

* Separate sets of the same experiment are performed by using **different starting concentrations of the reactants**.
- The **initial rate** of each set of experiment **or** the **time taken for the reaction to reach the same extent** for each set of experiment (e.g. clock reactions) is then **determined**.
- Such data collected from the different sets of experiments is usually tabulated and directly compared to determine the orders of reaction and rate equation.

_[Refer to Section 10 (to be provided with Practical) for the details on these kinetics experiments]_

* **Examples using data from INITIAL RATE method**

* **Examples**

The iodination of propanone is carried out in acidic medium as shown:

\(\mathrm{I_{2}(aq)}\) + \(\mathrm{CH_{3}COCH_{3}(aq)}\)\(\xrightarrow{H^{+}}\)\(\mathrm{CH_{3}COCH_{2}I(aq)}\) + HI(aq)

In employing the initial rate method, a series of experiments have been conducted and the following results were obtained:

* **Find the order of reaction with respect to each of the three species under investigation.** **Write down the rate equation for this reaction.** **Calculate the value of the rate constant** \(k\)**, specifying its unit.** **Predict the initial rate of reaction for experiment 5.**

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:25]

Example ("iodine Clock" Experiment)

A series of experiments is conducted to determine the order of reaction with respect to iodide ions for the reaction between H\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{2}\) and acidified potassium iodide solution. The rate of the reaction is followed by monitoring the rate of formation of iodine, I\({}_{2}\).

\(2\Gamma\)-(aq) + H\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{2}\)(aq) + 2H\({}^{+}\)(aq) \(\to\) 2H\({}_{2}\)O(\(l\)) + I\({}_{2}\)(aq) + 2Na\({}_{2}\)S\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{3}\)(aq) \(\to\) 2NaI(aq) + Na\({}_{2}\)S\({}_{4}\)O\({}_{6}\)(aq)

reaction 2

In each experiment, a small fixed amount of sodium thiosulfate and starch indicator are added to the reaction mixture. The iodine produced in reaction 1 will immediately react in reaction 2 until all the sodium thiosulfate has been used up. At that point, free iodine present in the solution will cause a sudden appearance of a blue-coloured complex in the presence of starch. The time taken for the appearance of the blue-coloured complex is recorded. The following results are obtained.

Important notes on Example 3

The rate of reaction between sodium thiosulfate and dilute HCl_t_ can be studied by measuring the time take for a **fixed**, **small amount** of **sulfur** to be formed.

How do we quantify this amount? A good gauge is observing sufficient yellow sulfur masking an image (an 'X') on a piece of white paper placed underneath the reaction beaker.

The volume of water is varied in each experiment to **keep the total volume of the reaction mixture constant** for the different experiments so that the **initial concentration of each reactant in the reaction mixture is directly proportional to its volume used**. (refer to explanation below)

Initial [Na${}_{2}$S${}_{2}$O${}_{3}$] \(\propto\) volume of Na${}_{2}$S${}_{2}$O${}_{3}$ used Initial [Na${}_{2}$S${}_{2}$O${}_{3}$] \(\propto\) V${}_{2}$ Similarly, initial [H+] $\propto\) V${}_{1}$

Explanation

Initial [Na${}_{2}$S${}_{2}$O${}_{3}$] in reaction mixture

since the same Na${}_{2}$S${}_{2}$O${}_{3}$ stock

= total volume of the reaction mixture

solution is used.

\[=\frac{\text{volume of Na${}_{2}$S${}_{2}$O${}_{3}$ used x concentration of Na${}_{2}$S${}_{2}$O${}_{3}$solution}}{\text{total volume of reaction mixture}}\]

total volume is kept constant for all the

experiments by adding appropriate volume of

water to each reaction mixture.

Thus, initial [Na${}_{2}$S${}_{2}$O${}_{3}$] \(\propto\) volume of Na${}_{2}$S${}_{2}$O${}_{3}$ used.

Since initial rate \(\alpha\) \(\frac{1}{\text{time taken, t}}\) (same extent of reaction)

initial [Na\({}_{2}\)S\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{3}\)] \(\propto\) V\({}_{2}\) and initial [HCI] \(\propto\) V\({}_{1}\)

Comparing Expt 1 and 2, when [HCI] is constant,

when [Na\({}_{2}\)S\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{3}\)] doubles (\(\frac{40}{20}=2\)), initial rate doubles (\(\frac{6.25\times 10^{-2}}{3.13\times 10^{-2}}=2\)).

Rate is **directly proportional** to [S\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{3}\)\({}^{-2}\)] and thus, order of reaction w.r.t. S\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{3}\)\({}^{-2}\) is.

Let the rate equation be rate \(=k\) [S\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{3}\)\({}^{-2}\)] [H\({}^{+}\)]\({}^{y}\)

Comparing experiments 4 and 5.

\[\frac{\text{rate }_{4}}{\text{rate }_{5}} = \frac{k(30)(40)^{y}}{k(30)(20)^{y}}\] \[\frac{5.26\times 10^{-2}}{5.00\times 10^{-2}} = \left(\frac{2}{1}\right)^{y}\] \[1.052=\left(\frac{2}{1}\right)^{y}\quad\Rightarrow\ y=0\]

Rate is **independent** of [H\({}^{+}\)] and thus, the order of reaction w.r.t. H\({}^{+}\) is.

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:30]

2024/ASRJC/Chemistryfrom the plotted graph,

time taken for volume of KMnO\({}_{4}\) required to reduce from 30 cm\({}^{3}\) to 15 cm\({}^{3}\) = 14 min

time taken for volume of KMnO\({}_{4}\) required to reduce from 15 cm\({}^{3}\) to 7.5 cm\({}^{3}\) = 28 - 14

= 14 min

Since **half-life** of the reaction is approximately **constant at 14 min**,

reaction is **first order** w.r.t. peroxide.

**Rate = \(k\left[\text{H}_{2}\text{O}_{2}\right]\)**, t\({}_{1/2}\) = **14.0 min**,

\[k=\ln 2\ /\ t_{1/2}=\text{0.05 min}^{-1}\]
**(c)**: When first portion of H\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{2}\) was withdrawn, volume of KMnO\({}_{4}\) used is 30 cm\({}^{3}\)

n(H\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{2}\)) present = \(\frac{5}{2}\) x 0.003 = 0.0075 mol

[H\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{2}\)] = \(\frac{0.0075}{\frac{10}{1000}}\) = **0.75 mol dm\({}^{-3}\)**

**Solution**

**(a)(i)** [refer to plotted graph on the next page]

**(a)(ii) (1) Using half-life method to show that the reaction is first order w.r.t. ester**

From the first graph where [HC/I] = 0.2 mol dm\({}^{-3}\),

* time taken for [ethyl ethanoate] to be reduced by half from 0.2 to 0.1 mol dm\({}^{-3}\) = 32 min

* = 32 min
* half-life is a **constant** at **32 min**.
* hence, reaction is first order with respect to ethyl ethanoate.

\begin{tabular}{l l l l}  & **Method 1: Finding initial rates from graphs** \\ \end{tabular}

\begin{tabular}{l l l}  & **Method 2: Finding time taken for reaction to proceed to the same extent** \\ \end{tabular}

Consider the table of values,

When [HC_I_] = 0.1 mol dm\({}^{-3}\), time taken for [ethyl ethanoate] to change from 0.200 to 0.115 is 50 min.

When [HC_I_] = 0.2 mol dm\({}^{-3}\), time taken for [ethyl ethanoate] to change from 0.200 to 0.115 is 25 min.

Alternatively, you can also use any other values convenient for you, e.g. half-life

From the graph,

When [HC_I_] = 0.1 mol dm\({}^{-3}\), time taken for [ethyl ethanoate] to change from 0.2 to 0.1 is 64 min.

When [HC_I_] = 0.2 mol dm\({}^{-3}\), time taken for [ethyl ethanoate] to change from 0.2 to 0.1 is 32 min.

Hence, when [HC_I_] doubles,

time taken for the reaction to proceed to the same extent is halved,

that is, the rate doubles (recall: initial rate of reaction \(\alpha\)\(\dfrac{1}{\text{time taken},\text{t}}\)).

Therefore, order of reaction w.r.t. HC_I_ is 1.

### (a)(iii) Determine the rate equation and rate constant

From the orders of reaction, it can be deduced that the rate equation for the reaction is

\[\textbf{Rate = }k\left[\textbf{ethyl ethanoate}\right]\left[\textbf{HC}\right]\]

To determine the rate constant:

**Method 1: By substitution**

\[\textbf{Rate = }k\left[\textbf{ethyl ethanoate}\right]\left[\textbf{HC}\right]\]

Substituting data from Experiment 1,

\[\textbf{Rate = }k\left[\textbf{ethyl ethanoate}\right]\left[\textbf{HC}\right]\]

\[\textbf{Rate = }k\left[\textbf{ethyl ethanoate}\right]\textbf{where }k\textbf{ = }k\left[\textbf{HC}\right]\]

\[\textbf{and }k\textbf{ = }\frac{\ln 2}{\textbf{t}_{v/2}}\textbf{ = }\frac{\ln 2}{32}\textbf{ min}^{-1}\textbf{ = }0.02167\textbf{ min}^{-1}\]

\[\therefore\textbf{ }k\textbf{ = }\frac{0.02167}{0.2}\textbf{ = }\textbf{0.108 mol}^{-1}\textbf{ dm}^{3}\textbf{ min}^{-1}\textbf{ (similar to value of }k\textbf{ calculated using Method 1)}\]

b) Water is used as a solvent and hence it is in large excess. 'Concentration' of water would remain approximately constant as the reaction proceeds and hence it is not possible to determine its order of reaction as its concentration is not changed.

## 6 Reaction Mechanism

* Most chemical reactions occur via a sequence of single reaction steps, one of which has a highest activation energy, \(E_{\text{a}}\), that determines the overall rate of the reaction.
* The sequence of single reaction steps, called **elementary steps**, by which an overall reaction occurs, is called the _mechanism of the reaction (or simply, reaction mechanism)_.
* The rate equation (or rate law) of a reaction can help to reveal the reaction mechanism.

* Consider the reaction: (CH\({}_{3}\))\({}_{3}\)CC\(l\) + OH\({}^{-}\) (CH\({}_{3}\))\({}_{3}\)COH + C\(l^{-}\)
* Products

The experimentally-determined rate equation for the reaction is

\[\text{Rate}=k\left[(\text{CH}_{3})_{3}\text{CC}l\right]\]

The **mechanism** of the above reaction has been studied and can be represented by the following two steps:

* Step 1: (CH\({}_{3}\))\({}_{3}\)CC\(l\) (CH\({}_{3}\))\({}_{3}\)C\({}^{+}\) + C\(l^{-}\) (slow)
* Step 2: (CH\({}_{3}\))\({}_{3}\)C\({}^{+}\) + OH\({}^{-}\) (CH\({}_{3}\))\({}_{3}\)COH (fast)

* **Some definitions of terms**
* **Elementary steps**
* are the **simplest** steps in a mechanism which cannot be further broken down into simpler steps;
* do not have the same rate.
* In Example 7 above, Steps 1 and 2 are elementary steps.
* **Intermediate**
* is a substance that is formed in one step of the mechanism and consumed in a later one during the overall reaction;
* does not appear in the overall balanced equation.
* In Example 7, (CH\({}_{3}\))\({}_{3}\)C\({}^{+}\) is an intermediate.
* **Rate-determining step**
* is the **slowest** elementary step (one with _highest activation energy_) which governs the overall rate of the chemical reaction.
* Because the rate-determining step limits the overall rate of the reaction, its rate law represents the rate law for the overall reaction.
* In Example 7, Step 1 is the **rate-determining step**.

* Notice in Example 7 that the **rate law for the rate-determining step (Step 1) in the mechanism is consistent with the observed kinetics shown in the rate equation**.
* The slow step (Step 1) in the mechanism (which determines the overall rate of the reaction) involves one reactant molecule of (CH\({}_{3}\))CC/ and does not involve the OH\({}^{-}\) ion, and is the same as the reaction order as reflected in the rate equation (i.e. first order w.r.t. (CH\({}_{3}\))\({}_{3}\)CC/ and zero order w.r.t. OH\({}^{+}\)).
* **Molecularity** The _molecularity_ of an elementary step refers to the number of reactant particles involved in that step.

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|} \hline _Unimolecular_ & One reactant particle. \\ \cline{2-3}  & In Example 7, the rate-determining step is unimolecular. \\ \hline _Bimolecular_ & Two reactant particles may collide and result in a rearrangement of chemical bonds. \\ \hline _Temolecular_ & Three reactant particles collide simultaneously. \\ \hline \end{tabular}

#### (b) Proposing a Reaction Mechanism

We can suggest a reasonable reaction mechanism by using observations and data from kinetics experiments to hypothesise what the individual steps might be.

Criteria to meet when suggesting a reaction mechanism:

1. The order of reaction with respect to each reactant in the experimentally determined rate equation appears as the coefficients of the respective reactants in the rate-determining step.
2. The elementary steps in the mechanism must add up to the overall balanced chemical equation.
3. The rate equation involves the reactants (exclude intermediates) that take part in the elementary steps preceding and including the rate-determining step.

## Appendix C Appendix

The reaction between nitric oxide and oxygen is an important intermediate step in the industrial production of nitric acid. It is also one of the reactions involved in atmospheric pollution from car exhausts.

Kinetic studies have shown that the reaction is third order overall, and it has been suggested that the mechanism involves the following two steps.

\begin{tabular}{c c} \hline fast & N\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{2}\) \\ N\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{2}\) + O\({}_{2}\) & slow \\ \hline \end{tabular}

Construct a rate equation for this reaction.

For the two-step mechanism, where the first step is fast and reversible, and the second step is slow, we focus on the **rate-determining step for the rate law**. The intermediate N\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{2}\) has a concentration that is quickly established by the equilibrium of the first step:

Rate of forward = Rate of backward

\(k[\)NO\(]^{2}=k_{b}[\)N\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{2}]\)

\([\)N\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{2}]=\dfrac{k_{f}}{k_{b}}[\)NO\(]^{2}\)

Based on the slow step, rate = \(k[\)N\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{2}][\)O\({}_{2}]\).

By substituting [N\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{2}\)] in the rate equation, we get:

\(\text{rate}=k[\)N\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{2}][\)O\({}_{2}]=k\dfrac{k_{f}}{k_{b}}\)\([\)NO\(]^{2}[\)O\({}_{2}]\)

This simplifies to:

\(\text{rate}=k[\)NO\(]^{2}[\)O\({}_{2}]\) where \(k=k\dfrac{k_{f}}{k_{b}}\)

The rate equation for the overall third order reaction will be:

\(\text{rate}=k\)\([\)NO\(]^{2}[\)O\({}_{2}]\)

If the 1st step is not the slow step, the reactants in the overall equation that take part in the elementary steps before and including the slow step will appear in the rate law.

## 7 Collision Theory and Factors affecting Rate of Reaction

* The basic tenet of **collision theory** is that reactant particles (atoms, molecules and ions) must collide with each other to react.
* In order for a reaction to take place between two colliding reactant particles,
* the particles must be _correctly orientated_
* the collision must occur with a minimum amount of energy called the _activation energy_, \(\underline{E_{a}}\)
* Collisions that fulfil both criteria are termed **effective collisions**.
* An increase in the _frequency of effective collisions_ (i.e. the number of effective collisions per unit time) leads to an _increase in rate of reaction_.

**Factors affecting the Rate of a Reaction**

* **Reactant particle size / surface area** (only for heterogeneous reaction) _Example:_ Reaction between CaCO\({}_{3}\) and HC\(I\): 

_Explanation_

For a fixed mass, \(\Rightarrow\) the smaller the size of reactants \(\Rightarrow\) the larger the surface area exposed for reaction to occur \(\Rightarrow\) frequency of effective collisions increases \(\Rightarrow\) hence rate of reaction increases.

**(b) Concentration**

Reaction between CaCO\({}_{3}\) and HC\(I\): reaction occurs much faster when a more concentrated HC\(I\) is used.

_Explanation_

An increase in the concentration causes

\(\Rightarrow\) an increase in the number of molecules per unit volume

\(\Rightarrow\) frequency of effective collisions increases

hence rate of reaction increases.

* [leftmargin=*]
* **Pressure** (for reactions involving gaseous reactants) An increase in pressure of gaseous reactants larger number of molecules per unit volume frequency of effective collisions increases hence rate of reaction increases.
* **Effect of Temperature Increasing the temperature gives the collisions more energy. This increases the frequency of effective collisions resulting in faster rate of reaction. A 10 \({}^{\circ}\)C rise in temperature often doubles the rate of reaction. _E_a remains unchanged but the rate constant, \(k\) of the reaction increases.

* **Maxwell Boltzmann distribution curve** In any chemical system, the particles will possess a range of energies. The Maxwell Boltzmann distribution curve shows the distribution of particles with collision energies at a particular temperature. The diagram below shows how the energy distribution changes for a system when the temperature is increased from T\({}_{1}\) to T\({}_{2}\).

* **With the aid of a sketch of the Boltzmann distribution, explain how an increase in temperature increases the rate of a chemical reaction.** When temperature increases from T\({}_{1}\) to T\({}_{2}\), the average kinetic energy of the molecules increases.
* As shown on the diagram, the number of reactant molecules with energy greater than or equal to the activation energy, _E_a increases significantly.
* This results in an increase in the frequency of effective collisions.
* The rate constant, \(k\), increases and hence rate of reaction increases.

**Additional points to note from the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution diagram**

Observe that when **temperature** is **increased from T\({}_{1}\) to T\({}_{2}\)**,**

* **The maximum of the curve shifts (or displaces) to the right and the kinetic energy of the particles are spread over a wider range, showing that the average kinetic energy of particles increases. More particles are moving at higher speed.**
* **The maximum is slightly lower because the energies become more spread out.**
* **The shaded area shows the number of molecules with energy greater than or equal to** \(E_{a}\) **is higher.**
* **Total area under the curve at T\({}_{2}\) **is the same as the total area under the curve at T**\({}_{1}\)**.** _(The total area under the curve represents the total number of molecules in the system, which does not change when temperature is increased)_

**Effect of Catalyst**

**A catalyst is a substance that increases the rate of the reaction without being consumed in the reaction. It is used and then regenerated.**

**Properties of a Catalyst**

* **A catalyst increases the reaction rate by providing an alternative reaction pathway which has a lower activation energy.**
* **It remains chemically unchanged at the end of the reaction.**
* **It does not affect the yield of the reaction.**
* **It increases the rate constant,** \(k\) **of the reaction.**

**Link to Chemical Energetics**

* **The energy profile below compares the difference in activation energies between a catalysed reaction and an uncatalysed reaction.**

* **A catalyst provides an alternative reaction pathway of lower activation energy, but it has no effect on the enthalpy change of reaction.**
With the aid of a sketch of the Boltzmann distribution, explain how the presence of a catalyst increases the rate of a chemical reaction.

In the **presence of a catalyst** at a certain temperature \(T\), the reaction proceeds via an alternative pathway which has lower activation energy (\(E_{a}\)' \(<E_{a}\)).

As shown on the diagram, more molecules have energies greater than or equal to the lowered activation energy \(E_{b}\)'.

This results in an increase in the frequency of effective collisions.

The rate constant, \(k\), increases and hence rate of reaction increases.

## 8 Catalysis

* Heterogeneous Catalysis
* Heterogeneous catalysts exist in a **different phase** from the reactants.
* They are often metals or metal oxides interacting with gaseous or liquid reactants.
* The areas where catalysis takes place on the **surface** of the catalysts are known as the active sites.

Stages involved in heterogeneous catalysis (refer to details on next page)

1. Adsorption (adhesion of a substance to the surface of another substance) of reactant molecules onto the catalyst surface.
2. New bonds are formed between reactant molecules.
3. Desorption of product molecules from the catalyst surface.

Rate of reaction **increases** in the **presence** of a **heterogeneous catalyst** because

- the **adsorption** increases the concentration of the reactant molecules** at the catalyst surface and allows the **reactant molecules to come into close contact with proper orientation** for reaction to take place.

- the **adsorption weakens the existing bonds within the reactant molecules**, thereby

lowering the activation energy for the reaction.

* **Autocatalysis**
* An autocatalytic reaction involves the formation of a product that acts as a catalyst for the reaction.
* This product is known as **autocatalyst**.

Characteristics of an autocatalyst reaction:

Reaction is initially slow.

Upon the formation of the product / autocatalyst, the reaction rate increases.

The rate will reach a maximum even as more of the product / autocatalyst is formed.

Towards the end of the reaction, the reaction rate decreases due to decreasing concentrations of reactants. The reaction eventually stops when one of the reactants is used up.

Example:

The reaction between MnO\({}_{4}\) and C\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{4}\)\({}^{2}\)- in acid solution is catalysed by the Mn\({}^{2+}\) formed during the reaction.

\(2\)MnO\({}_{4}\)\({}^{c}\)\({}^{2}\)+ \(16\)H\({}^{+}\)\(2\)Mn\({}^{2+}\) + \(10\)CO\({}_{2}\)+ \(8\)H\({}_{2}\)O

At the beginning, the rate of reaction is slow as it is not catalysed.

The reaction speeds up as the autocatalyst, Mn\({}^{2+}\) is produced. The purple MnO\({}_{4}\)\({}^{c}\) is rapidly decolourised.

Reaction slows down due to decreasing concentrations of reactants, even though there is an adequate supply of catalyst. Reactions eventually stops when one of the reactants is used up.

- catalysed reaction: E + S \(\rightarrow\) ES Enzyme + substrate \(\rightarrow\) Enzyme-substrate complex ES \(\rightarrow\) EP Enzyme-substrate complex \(\rightarrow\) Enzyme-product complex EP \(\rightarrow\) E + P Enzyme-product complex

* Conversion of enzyme-substrate (ES) to enzyme-product (EP) is the rate-determining step.
* **Relationship between substrate concentration and the rate of an enzyme-catalysed reaction**:

* At low concentration of substrate, the rate increases rapidly with increasing substrate concentration. Rate of reaction is directly proportional to [substrate] since active sites in the enzymes are not fully occupied.
* At high concentration of substrate, rate is independent of [substrate] since all the active sites are fully occupied.
* At and beyond this point, an increase in concentration of substrate does not affect the overall rate.

## 9 Thermodynamic Stability vs. Kinetic Stability

* **Thermodynamics** explains the **tendency for a reaction to occur**, while **kinetics** gives an indication of the rate** at which this tendency is realised.
* A thermodynamically spontaneous process will take place so slowly that it practically does not occur over the time period of observation if the activation energy of the process is too high.

Example: Consider the conversion of diamond to graphite

* The conversion of diamond to graphite is **exothermic** and diamond, having a higher energy content, is **energetically less stable** than graphite.
* The reaction, however, does _not_ happen under normal conditions due to the **high activation energy, \(E_{a}\)**, involved.
* Diamond is an example of an **energetically unstable**, yet **kinetically stable**, substance.
* The conversion of diamond to graphite is said to be energetically (thermodynamically) feasible but not kinetically feasible.
