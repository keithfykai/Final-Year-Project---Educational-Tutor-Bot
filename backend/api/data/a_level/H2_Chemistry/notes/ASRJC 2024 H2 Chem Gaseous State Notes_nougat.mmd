## 1 Kinetic Theory of Matter Quick recap from 'O' level Chemistry:

### Introduction

The Kinetic Theory of Matter describes the particles in solids, liquids and gases and the movement of these particles.

The bulk characteristics (i.e. physical properties) of matter can be explained by the **arrangement** and **movement** of the particles.

Many pure substances can exist in all of the three states of matter, depending on the conditions of the **temperature** and **pressure**.

### Kinetic Theory and their Assumptions as applied to an Ideal Gas

It can be observed from the table above that the bulk characteristics of gases differ from that of solids and liquids.

The _Kinetic Theory_ was put forward to _explain_ the behaviour of gases, based on the following assumptions:

**Basic Assumptions of the Kinetic Theory as applied to an Ideal Gas**

1

Gases consist of rigid, spherical molecules that are in **continuous, random motion.**

2

The **volume of the gas molecules** is **negligible** compared to the **volume** of the **container**.

3

The **forces of attraction between the gas molecules** as well as between the **gas molecules** and **walls of the container** are **negligible**.

4

All molecular collisions are **perfectly elastic**. There is **no loss of the kinetic energy** during collision.

5

The **average kinetic energy** of the molecules is proportional to the **absolute temperature** (measured on the Kelvin scale).

In summary,

An ideal gas is a hypothetical gas whose pressure, volume and temperature is completely described by the **ideal-gas equation**.

Note that ideal gases do **NOT** exist in real life! Section 5 discusses how gases deviate from ideality.

## 2 Gas Laws: Boyle's Law, Charles's Law, Gay-Lussac's Law and Avogadro's Law

All the four gas laws are discovered _experimentally_ and they express the mathematical relationships among T, \(p\), V and n.

\begin{tabular}{c c}  & \\ Boyle's Law & Charles's Law & Gay-Lussac's Law \\  & Law & Law \\  & \\ \end{tabular}

* Application of Boyle's Law:
* Scuba diving Scuba divers should not hold their breath whilst ascending to the water surface. For every 10 m of depth that a scuba diver descends, he will experience an additional 1 atm of pressure due to the weight of the water above him. When a diver inhaled a lungful of air at a pressure of 3 atm, and swam quickly to the surface of the water whilst holding his breath, the pressure would decrease by a factor of 3, the volume of air would increase by a factor of 3, causing severe damage to his lungs.
* Shaking a sealed can of fizzy drink results in a great "explosion" when opened The fizz in the drink is actually dissolved carbon dioxide gas, CO\({}_{2}\). Under high pressure, CO\({}_{2}\) molecules are forced into the drink in an amount that is greater than what would ordinarily dissolve under atmospheric conditions. Shaking the unopened can of fizzy drink causes bubbles of CO\({}_{2}\) to line the walls inside the can. As soon as the can is opened, the pressure in the can decreases and the volume of each bubble increases, most of the excess gas escapes into the room. Tapping the top of the can would dislodge the bubbles from the wall and bottom of the can so that they can float to the top of the can (since gas is lighter than liquid). Once the bubbles are at the top of the can, there will only be a small amount of liquid blocking their escape when the can is opened. As a result, the fizzy drink doesn't spray.

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:6]

### Gay-Lussac's Law: temperature-pressure relationship

* Gay-Lussac's Law states that the pressure of a fixed amount of gas (\(n\) is constant) maintained at constant volume is directly proportional to its absolute temperature (in Kelvin).

Mathematically, \(p\,\alpha\,\mathrm{T}\) or \(\frac{\mathbf{p}}{\mathrm{T}}=\mathrm{constant}\) (constant n and V)

Comparing the temperature and pressure of a given amount of a gas **under two different sets of conditions at constant volume**, the following equation is applicable.

\(\frac{P_{i}}{\mathrm{T}_{i}}=\frac{P_{i}}{\mathrm{T}_{r}}\)

Graphical representations (at fixed V):

* Application of Gay-Lussac's Law:
* Shooting of a gun
* As gunpowder burns, it creates superheated gas, which forces the bullet out of the gun barrel.
* Pumping Car Tires

In temperate countries, car tire pressures need to be checked in winter. This is because with the low temperatures in the winter months, car tires could be underinflated due to a drop in gas pressure. Driving under such conditions could reduce tire durability and fuel economy of the car.

Similarly, in tropical countries, car tires should only be pumped or checked in the morning and not after a long drive. This is because after travelling for some time, the temperature of the tires will increase, causing an increase in gas pressure.

### Combined Gas Law

* Mathematically, in combining Boyle's Law (\(V\propto\frac{1}{p}\)), Charles's Law (\(V\propto T\)) and Gay-Lussac's Law (\(p\propto T\)): \[V\propto\frac{T}{p}\qquad\qquad\text{(constant n)}\] \[V=k\frac{T}{p}\] \[\frac{PV}{T}=k\quad\text{where $k$ is a constant}\]
* Comparing the properties of a gas under all three conditions of pressure, volume and temperature, the following equation is applicable when the **amount of gaseous particles remains unchanged**.

\[\frac{p_{i}V_{i}}{T_{i}}=\frac{p_{i}V_{i}}{T_{i}}\]
* Hence, the quantitative effect of the gas can be calculated _when two quantities of the gas are varied at the same time_.

### Avogadro's Law: quantity-volume relationship

* Avogadro's Law states that _at constant temperature and pressure_, _the volume of a gas is directly proportional to the number of moles of the gas_.

\[\text{Mathematically,}\qquad\qquad\text{V $\alpha$ n}\qquad\text{or}\qquad\qquad\text{V $= constant $\times$ n}\]
* It then follows that _equal volumes of gases contain the same number of gas particles_ under constant T and \(p\) (Avogadro's Hypothesis). Therefore, \(\Rightarrow\) 1 mole of **any** gas will occupy the same volume! \(\Rightarrow\) Recap: molar gas volume, \(V_{m}\) At 0 \({}^{\circ}\)C (273 K) and 1 bar or 1 x 10\({}^{5}\) Pa (s.t.p.), 1 mole of any gas occupies a volume of **22.7 dm\({}^{3}\)**. \(\circ\) At 20 \({}^{\circ}\)C (293 K) and 1 atm or 101325 Pa (r.t.p.), 1 mole of any gas occupies a volume of **24.0 dm\({}^{3}\)**.
* Application of Avogadro's Law: When blowing a balloon, its size increases because more gaseous particles are being introduced into the balloon at constant external pressure and temperature.

## 3 Ideal Gas Equation

* The gas laws are: Boyle's law: V \(\alpha\) \(\frac{1}{P}\) (constant n, T) Charles's law: V \(\alpha\) T (constant n, \(p\)) Gay-Lussac's law: \(p\) \(\alpha\) T (constant n, V) Avogadro's law: V \(\alpha\) n (constant \(p\), T)
* Combining these relationships: \(\Rightarrow\) V \(\alpha\) \(\frac{nT}{P}\) \(\Rightarrow\) V = R \(\frac{nT}{P}\) Rearranging, where \(p\) = pressure of gas in Pascal (**Pa**) or **Nm-2** V = volume of gas in cubic metres (**m3**) n = number of moles of gas R = molar gas constant = **8.31 J K-1 mol-1** T = temperature in Kelvin (**K**) This equation is known as the _ideal gas equation_. Take note of the units!
* The ideal gas equation describes **how** gases behave as experimental conditions like temperature and pressure changes.

### Other useful forms of Ideal Gas Equation

* Since n = \(\frac{m}{M}\) where m = mass of gas in grams and M = molar mass of gas \(p\)V = \(\frac{m}{M}\) RT (1) \(\Rightarrow\) M = \(\frac{mRT}{pV}\) (2) **useful in calculating _M_** of the gas
* Rearranging above equation (1): \(p\) = \(\left(\frac{m}{V}\right)\) \(\frac{RT}{M}\) \(\Rightarrow\) \(p\) = \(p\) (\(\frac{RT}{M}\)) (3) where \(p\) = density of gas in **g m-3**
* Rearranging ideal gas equation: \(p\) = \(\left(\frac{n}{V}\right)RT\) \(\Rightarrow\) \(p\) = cRT (4) where c = gas concentration in **mol m-3**

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:10]

**Example 1 (N98/II/2)**

0.080 g of a liquid compound **X** was vapourised in a gas syringe at 127 \({}^{\circ}\)C and a pressure of 1 atmosphere, 81 cm\({}^{3}\) of vapour was produced.

(i): Calculate the relative molecular mass of the liquid.

**Take note of units! Remember to convert T to K, \(p\) to Pa and V to m\({}^{3}\)!!**

Using ideal gas equation, \(\rho\)V = nRT

M = \(\frac{\text{mRT}}{\rho\text{V}}\)

m = 0.080 g V = 81 x 10\({}^{-6}\) m\({}^{3}\) T = = K \(\rho\) = 101325 Pa

M = = **32.4 q mol\({}^{-1}\)**

Thus, the relative molecular mass of **X** is **32.4** (no units).

(ii): The liquid used was pure methanol (CH\({}_{3}\)OH). Suggest a reason why there is a difference between the theoretical value and the value obtained in (i).

The difference is due to the fact that methanol is assumed to be an gas when we perform the calculation. Methanol has strong intermolecular forces of attraction bonds) and deviates from ideal gas behaviour. Hence, the calculated value is different from the theoretical value.

**Example 2**

With the aid of the _Data Booklet_, determine the density, in g cm\({}^{-3}\), of SO\({}_{2}\) gas at 20 \({}^{\circ}\)C and 1 atm. (_M_, of SO\({}_{2}\) = 64.1)

\(\rho\)V = nRT

\(\rho\)V = \(\frac{\text{m}}{\text{M}}\)RT

= **2.67 x 10\({}^{-3}\) g cm\({}^{-3}\)** (3 s.f.)

**Example 3**

A sample of gas has a volume of 30 dm\({}^{3}\) at a pressure of 5 atm and a temperature of 28 \({}^{\circ}\)C.

(i) Find the new pressure if the gas is compressed to 20 dm\({}^{3}\) at a constant temperature.

**Approach**: Read the question carefully to decide which of the variables are changing: \(p\), V, n or T. T and n are constant. Use the ideal gas equation and simplify it by grouping all the constants together to derive a new expression (in this case, Boyle's Law).

Using the ideal gas equation,

\[\begin{array}{ll}\text{\rm{$p$V}=nRT}\\ \text{\rm{Since n, R and T are constant,}}&\text{\rm{$p$V}=constant (Boyle's Law)}\\ \text{\rm{$\Rightarrow$}}&\text{\rm{where $p_{r}$ is the new pressure}}\\ \text{\rm{Substituting the values,}}&\text{\rm{$p_{2}=7.5$ atm}}\\ \end{array}\]

(ii) At what temperature, in \({}^{\circ}\)C, will the volume of the gas be 50 dm\({}^{3}\) if the pressure is kept constant?

Using the ideal gas equation,

\[\begin{array}{ll}\text{\rm{$p$V}=nRT}\\ \text{\rm{Since n, R and $p$ are constant,}}&\text{\rm{$\frac{V}{T}=\frac{nR}{P}=constant (Charles's Law)}}\\ \text{\rm{$\Rightarrow$}}&\text{\rm{$\frac{V_{t}}{T_{i}}=\frac{V_{t}}{T_{f}} $}}&\text{\rm{where T_{r} is the new temperature}}\\ \text{\rm{$\Rightarrow$}}&\text{\rm{$T_{t}=\frac{K=229\,\,^{\circ}C}}{}}\\ \end{array}\]

(iii) When the temperature is doubled from 28 \({}^{\circ}\)C to 56 \({}^{\circ}\)C under constant \(p\), the volume will also be doubled from 30 dm\({}^{3}\) to 60 dm\({}^{3}\).

True \(I\) False

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:13]

* **Partial pressure** of a gas (usually annotated with small \(p\)) is equal to the pressure that the gas would exert **as if it alone occupied the container**.
* **Dalton's Law of Partial Pressure** states that _in a mixture of gases (which do not react chemically), the total pressure (\(p_{\rm total}\)) is the sum of the partial pressures (\(p\)) of all the constituent gases at the same temperature._ \[p_{\rm total}=p_{\rm A}+p_{\rm B}+p_{\rm C}+p_{\rm D}+....\] (where \(p_{\rm A}\) is the partial pressure of gas \(\rm A\), \(p_{\rm B}\) is the partial pressure of gas \(\rm B\)...... in the mixture) Let \(n_{\rm A}\), \(n_{\rm B}\), \(n_{\rm c}\), \(n_{\rm D}\) and so forth be the number of moles of each gas in the mixture and \(n_{\rm total}\) be the total number of moles of gas (\(n_{\rm total}=n_{\rm A}+n_{\rm B}+n_{\rm C}+n_{\rm D}+....\)) \[p_{\rm total}=\frac{n_{\rm A}RT}{V}+\frac{n_{\rm B}RT}{V}+\frac{n_{\rm C}RT}{V}+ \frac{n_{\rm D}RT}{V}+...=(n_{\rm A}+n_{\rm B}+n_{\rm C}+n_{\rm D}+...)\frac{ RT}{V}\] \[\Rightarrow\] (1)
* Assuming a mixture containing non-reacting gases behave ideally, From above equation (1), \[p_{\rm total}=\frac{n_{\rm total}RT}{V}\] \[p_{\rm total}V=n_{\rm total}RT\] (2) For _constituent_ gas A present, \[p_{\rm A}V=n_{\rm A}RT\] (3)

Dividing (3) by (2) under the **same conditions** of \(\rm T\) and \(\rm V\),

\[\Rightarrow\]

**Mole fraction (\(\chi\)) and its relation to partial pressure**

The **mole fraction** of a constituent gas A, \(\chi_{\rm A}\), in a gas mixture is the _ratio_ of number of moles of gas A to the total number of moles of gas components present._ \[\Rightarrow\]

**Mole fraction (\(\chi\)) and its relation to partial pressure**

The **mole fraction** of a constituent gas A, \(\chi_{\rm A}\), in a gas mixture is the _ratio_ of number of moles of gas A to the total number of moles of gas components present._

**Example 5**:

1. Calculate the mole fractions of nitrogen, argon and oxygen in a gas mixture containing 0.3 mol of N\({}_{2}\), 0.5 mol of Ar and 0.7 mol of O\({}_{2}\). \[\begin{array}{|c|c|c|}\hline n_{\text{total}}=&=1.5\text{ mol}\\ \chi_{\text{N2}}=\frac{n_{\text{N2}}}{n_{\text{total}}}=&=\underline{0.200}& \chi_{\text{N}^{A}}=\frac{n_{\text{A}r}}{n_{\text{total}}}=&=\underline{0.333} \\ \chi_{\text{O2}}=\frac{n_{\text{O2}}}{n_{\text{total}}}=&=\underline{0.467} \\ \hline\end{array}\] \[\begin{array}{|c|c|c|}\hline n_{\text{total}}=&=1.5\text{ mol}\\ \chi_{\text{N2}}=\frac{n_{\text{N2}}}{n_{\text{total}}}=&=\underline{0.200}& \chi_{\text{N}^{A}}=\frac{n_{\text{A}r}}{n_{\text{total}}}=&=\underline{0.333} \\ \hline\end{array}\] \[\begin{array}{|c|c|c|}\hline n_{\text{total}}=&=0.467\\ \hline\end{array}\] Note: all the mole fractions should add up to 1.
2. Calculate the partial pressure of nitrogen if the total pressure of the gas mixture is 20 atm. \[\begin{array}{|c|c|}\hline p_{\text{N2}}=\chi_{\text{N2}}\,p_{\text{total}}=&= \underline{4\text{ atm}}\\ \hline\end{array}\]

**Example 6**:

A gaseous mixture containing 8.0 g of hydrogen and 64.0 g of oxygen has a total pressure of 300 kPa. Calculate the partial pressures of each gas.

**Approach**: In order to find the partial pressure, the mole fraction of each gas has to be calculated first.

\[\begin{array}{|c|c|c|}\hline n_{\text{O2}}=&=2\text{ mol}&n_{\text{N2}}=&= \underline{\text{mol}}\\ n_{\text{total}}=&=&\underline{\text{mol}}\\ p_{\text{O2}}=&=\underline{100}\text{ kPa}&p_{\text{N2}}=&=\underline{200}\text{ kPa}\\ \hline\end{array}\]

**Example 7**

Flask X contains 1 dm\({}^{3}\) of helium at 2 kPa and flask Y contains 2 dm\({}^{3}\) of neon at 1 kPa. If the flasks are connected at constant temperature, what is the final pressure?

**Approach:** Upon connection, the gases from each flask will equilibrate and the new volume is 1 + 2 = 3 dm\({}^{3}\). Treat each flask as a system on its own and apply the ideal gas equation to each flask.

For He in Flask X,

Using the ideal gas equation, \(\rho\)V = nRT

with n, R and T constant, \(p_{2}\)V\({}_{1}\) = \(p_{2}\)V\({}_{2}\)

(2000)(1 x 10\({}^{-3}\)) = \(p_{2}\)(3 x 10\({}^{-3}\))

\(p_{2}\) = 666.67 Pa

**For Ne in Flask Y, \(p_{3}\)V\({}_{3}\) = \(p\)AV\({}_{4}\)**

\(p_{4}\) = 666.67 Pa

Using Dalton's Law,

Total (final) pressure = \(p_{2}\) + \(p_{4}\) = 666.67 + 666.67 = **1.33 kPa**

## 5 Deviations from Ideal Behaviour - Real Gases

An ideal gas is a **hypothetical** gas whose pressure, volume and temperature behaviour is completely described by the ideal gas equation, \(p\)V = nRT.

Recall the **three main basic assumptions** of an ideal gas (from page 3):

1. The **volume of the gas molecules** is **negligible** compared to the **volume** of the **container**.
2. The **forces of attraction between the gas molecules** as well as between the **gas molecules** and **walls of the container** are **negligible**.
3. All molecular collisions are **perfectly elastic**. There is **no loss of the kinetic energy** during collision. _(State the third assumption only if the question asks for the three assumptions.)_

However, ideal gas does **not** exist in real life!

_(Try compressing a gas in a sealed syringe, you will reach a point where you will feel strong resistance and you can no longer compress it further That's the volume of the gas molecules.)_

Real gases have finite volumes and the gas molecules attract one another. Hence, the two basic assumptions are not entirely true and real gases deviate from ideality (or ideal behaviour).

However, real gases can still **approach ideal behaviour** by changing the conditions such that the two main basic assumptions above can still be applied.

### Conditions for real gas to approach ideal behaviour:

1. Low Pressure Gases behave more ideally at low pressures because when pressure is low, the gas molecules are far apart. The volume of the gas molecules therefore becomes insignificant compared to the volume of the container. Similarly, the intermolecular forces of attraction are negligible.
2. High Temperature Gases behave more ideally at high temperatures because when the temperature is high, the gas molecules move faster (higher kinetic energy) and the intermolecular forces of attraction become negligible.

### Graphical representations of deviation from ideal behaviour

\begin{tabular}{l l l l} \(\bullet\) & For an ideal gas, & \(\rho V=nRT\)\(\Rightarrow\) & \(\frac{PV}{RT}=n\) \\ & For **1 mol** of an ideal gas, & \(n=1\)\(\Rightarrow\) & \(\frac{PV}{RT}=1\) \\ \end{tabular}

\begin{tabular}{l* Different gases deviate to a different extent from ideality, depending on the nature of the gas, the strength of the intermolecular forces of attraction and the molecular volume.

**With reference to the graph above:**

**At Low to Moderate Pressure**

* Generally, the stronger the intermolecular forces of attraction, the greater the deviation from ideal behaviour since the forces of attraction between the gas molecules will be more significant.

* Polar molecules such as NH\({}_{3}\) and H\({}_{2}\)O have stronger forces of attraction between the molecules compared to the non-polar molecules such as H\({}_{2}\) and N\({}_{2}\). Thus, the extent of deviation is greater for polar molecules.

* _Suggest reasons as to why N\({}_{2}\) deviates more from ideality as compared to H\({}_{2}\) when the pressure is high._ **At very High Pressure**__
* Generally, the **larger the volume of the gas molecules**_, the **greater the deviation from ideal behaviour** _since the_ **volume of the gas molecules** _will be significant as compared to the_ **volume of the container**_._
* The molecular volume of N\({}_{2}\) is greater than H\({}_{2}\), hence N\({}_{2}\) deviate more from ideality as compared to H\({}_{2}\) when the pressure is high._

Application: Bubble-jet printer

The ejection of ink from a thermal bubble-jet printer deduced from the ideal gas equation.

\[\frac{\text{pV}}{\text{T}}=\text{constant}\]

Ink is fed into thousands of tiny reservoirs in the print-head of the ink cartridge. The ink is heated rapidly by a tiny resistor and then boils, forming bubbles. As temperature increases (T increases), the bubbles expand (V increases) and coalesce to form an air pocket. The increase in temperature increases the pressure within the air pocket (P increases). The increased air pressure is sufficient to eject the ink bubble from the pore of printer head and onto a page. This pressure-activated ejection is similar to spitting.

### Additional Reading: Real Gases - Deviations from Ideal Behaviour

Although the ideal gas equation is a very useful description of gases, most gases do not obey this relationship. Gases which do not obey the ideal gas equation are called **real gases**.

To see how real gases behave, we will consider plotting the quotient \(\frac{\text{pV}}{\text{RT}}\) versus \(p\) for the gas.

The quotient is also known as the _compression factor_ of a gas.

For 1 mol of an ideal gas, a plot of this quotient against pressure is a constant (horizontal straight line) in Figure 1. This is because increasing the pressure decreases the volume, according to Boyle's law.

However, with real gases we observe deviation from this plot. Let's consider carbon dioxide and observe how this quotient changes as we increase the pressure.

We observe that initially the quotient for carbon dioxide deviates negatively (\(p\)V/RT < 1). However, as pressure continues to increase, we observe that the quotient starts to deviate positively (\(p\)V/RT > 1). The reason for such deviations is because real gases do not obey the assumptions of the Kinetic Theory of gases.

#### Positive Deviation - The Volume Effect

In Figure 1, carbon dioxide starts to exhibit a positive deviation, (\(p\)V/RT > 1) at about 500 atm. This is because unlike ideal gas, the molecules of real gases have significant volume. As the pressure on the gas increases, the gas molecules are packed more closely together as the volume of the container decreases. The volume of the gas molecules is no longer negligible compared to the volume of the container.

Since molecules of real gases have significant volume, the actual volume (free space volume) which is available for the gas molecules is smaller than the volume of the container as seen in Figure 2 (V\({}_{\text{container}}\) > V\({}_{\text{actual}}\)).

For ideal gas, V = V\({}_{\text{container}}\) - V\({}_{\text{gas molecules}}\) = V\({}_{\text{container}}\) (since V\({}_{\text{gas molecules is negligible}}\))

For real gas, V = V\({}_{\text{container}}\) - V\({}_{\text{gas molecules}}\) < V\({}_{\text{container}}\) (since V\({}_{\text{gas molecules is not negligible.}}\))

If you worked out the quotient \(\dfrac{\text{PV}}{\text{RT}}\), by putting the total volume of the container (V\({}_{\text{container}}\)) into the formula, **the product of _PV_ is greater than it should be**. Hence, we see a **positive deviation**.

Negative Deviation - The Pressure Effect

We also see that carbon dioxide exhibit a negative deviation (_p_V/RT < 1) initially. This is because unlike ideal gas, the intermolecular forces of attraction for real gases are significant. As the pressure increases, the gas molecules are forced closer together. When this happens, they experience attraction to adjacent molecules.

Now, imagine a gas molecule approaching the wall of a container. The force of impact by this molecule on the wall of the container decreases, due to the attraction of the neighbouring molecules (Figure 3). Since gas pressure measures the force exerted by the molecules when they strike the container wall, the real pressure is less than the ideal pressure.

Figure 3:

If you put the measured pressure into the quotient \(\frac{\text{PV}}{\text{RT}}\), the product \(\rho\)V is now less than is expected and we observe a negative deviation.

\[p_{real}<p_{ideal} \Rightarrow \frac{\text{P}_{real}\text{V}}{\text{RT}}<\frac{\text{P}_{ideal} \text{V}}{\text{RT}}\] \[\Rightarrow \frac{\text{P}_{real}\text{V}}{\text{RT}}<1\]

Negative deviation from ideality can also be observed at low temperatures (Graph on pg 18). At low temperatures, average kinetic energy of gas molecules decreases and the gas molecules move slowly and hence unable to overcome the attractive forces between them. Thus, the intermolecular forces of attraction become significant. As a result, the force with which the molecules strike the wall is reduced, resulting in lower pressure. The molecules also tend to "stick" to each other and the collisions are no longer elastic.

The degree of the negative deviation is thus a good measure of the strength of the attraction between the molecules. Hydrogen exhibits no negative deviation as the forces of attraction between the hydrogen molecules are very weak. Hence, the attraction between molecules is not as significant for hydrogen as compared to carbon dioxide.

The van der Waals Equation

The **van der Waals equation** corrects for the volume of, and attractive forces between, gas molecules:

\[(\text{p}+\frac{\text{an}^{2}}{\text{V}^{2}})(\text{V}-\text{nb})=\text{nRT}\]

There are two corrective factors in van der Waals equation. The first alters the pressure in the ideal gas equation. It accounts for the intermolecular attractive forces between gas molecules. The magnitude of 'a' is indicative of the strength of the intermolecular attractive forces. The factor 'nb' accounts for the volume occupied by the gas molecules.
