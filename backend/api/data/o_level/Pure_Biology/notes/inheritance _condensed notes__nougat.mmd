### 14.1 Learning Outcomes

_Candidates should be able to:_

* (a) distinguish between the terms gene and allele
* (b) explain the terms dominant, recessive, codominant, homozygous, heterozygous, phenotype and genotype
* (c) predict the results of simple crosses with expected ratios of 3:1 and 1:1, using the terms homozygous, heterozygous, F1 generation and F2 generation
* (d) explain why observed ratios often differ from expected ratios, especially when there are small numbers of progeny
* (e) use genetic diagrams to solve problems involving monohybrid inheritance
* (f) explain co-dominance and multiple alleles with reference to the inheritance of the ABO blood group phenotypes (A, B, AB, O) and the gene alleles (IA, IB and IO)
* XX and XY chromosomes
* (h) describe mutation as a change in the sequence of a gene such as in sickle cell anaemia, or in the chromosome number, such as the 47 chromosomes in the condition known as Down syndrome
* (i) name ionising radiation (e.g. X-ray) and chemical mutagens as factors which may increase the rate of mutation
* (j) distinguish between continuous and discontinuous variation and give examples of each.

## Chapter 14: Inheritance

Determining Blood Types

- The alleles for blood groups A, B and O are designated \(\mathbf{I^{A}}\), \(\mathbf{I^{B}}\), \(\mathbf{I^{O}}\) respectively.

- **IA and IB** are dominant over IO (eg people with alleles IO and IA will have blood group B, people with IO and IB will have blood group B

- \(\mathbf{I^{A}}\), \(\mathbf{I^{B}}\) express codominance and will have the blood group AB.

Determining Sex

- Females have XX chromosomes, males have XY

**Mutation:** a change in the sequence of a gene (eg in sickle cell anemia), or in the chromosome number eg people with Down syndrome have an extra chromosome, 47 in total)

Factors increasing rate of mutation:

- Ionising radiation

- Chemical mutagens

**Continuous vs Discontinuous Variation*** Variation and competition lead to differential survival of, and reproduction by, those organisms best fitted to the environment.
* Natural selection is a possible mechanism for evolution, which is a gradual change in the inheritable characteristics of a population over time.

An example of environmental factors that act as forces of natural selection:

* In 1848, England experienced industrialisation and many trees that surrounded factories producing smoke were covered in black dust. After this, the number of moths with dark coloured wings increased in the area. This was because they could camouflage better on the blackened tree trunks and could avoid getting eaten, and had more time to reproduce.
