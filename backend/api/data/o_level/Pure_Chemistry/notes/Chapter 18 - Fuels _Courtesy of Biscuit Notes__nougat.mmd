## Chapter 18 - Fuels and Crude Oil

Sources of fuel:

- Fossil fuels in the form of crude oil, natural gas and coal (carbon)

- Biofuels

Fossil fuels are burned in oxygen to form CO\({}_{2}\) and H\({}_{2}\)O. This exothermic reaction is combustion and the thermal energy generated from the combustion of fossil fuels can be converted to other forms of energy

Combustion: Fuel burns in the presence of excess/sufficient oxygen to produce CO\({}_{2}\) and H\({}_{2}\)O

Incomplete combustion: Fuels burn in the presence of insufficient oxygen to produce CO and/or C(s) and H\({}_{2}\)O

Characteristics of Natural gas

1. It is colourless
2. It is a mixture of light hydrocarbons, mainly consisting of methane
3. It can be easily liquefied (due to low boiling point) and stored in tanks. It can flow
4. It produces almost no pollutant
5. Combustion:

- Complete combustion

CH\({}_{4}\) burns in excess oxygen to form CO\({}_{2}\) and H\({}_{2}\)O to produce energy

- Incomplete combustion

CH\({}_{4}\) burns in insufficient oxygen to form CO and/or C(s) and H\({}_{2}\)O to produce energy

- Biorle

- Comparing complete and incomplete combustion, for 1 mole of CH\({}_{4}\), 2 moles of O\({}_{2}\) is required for complete combustion whereas only 1 mole of O\({}_{2}\) is required for incomplete combustion. Hence, when there is insufficient oxygen supply, complete combustion is more likely to occur as less mole of O\({}_{2}\) is required for the same mole of CH\({}_{4}\)

However, for methane, most of the times, complete combustion occurs 99% of the time, as in most cases, there will be sufficient oxygen supplied for complete combustion to the its low percentage mass of carbon (it has only 1 carbon atom in each molecule)

- Low percentage mass of carbon: \(CH_{4}(g)\,+\,2O_{2}(g)\to CO_{2}(g)\,+\,2H_{2}O(I)\)

- Higher percentage of carbon: \(C_{3}H_{8}(g)\,+\,5O_{2}(g)\to 3CO_{2}(g)\,+\,4H_{2}O(I)\)

Which equation [1] or [2] will give out sootier products/have more incomplete combustion?For the same mole of CH\({}_{4}\) and C\({}_{3}\)H\({}_{8}\), C\({}_{3}\)H\({}_{8}\) requires more oxygen than CH\({}_{4}\) for complete combustion. Hence, this means that C\({}_{3}\)H\({}_{8}\) will undergo more incomplete combustion as compared to \(CH_{4}\), hence producing more soot.
* Rule of thumb: For the same mole of fuel, the fuel that requires the greater number of moles of oxygen for complete combustion will undergo more incomplete combustion and hence more soot/CO will be produced

Characteristics of crude oil

1. It is a dark brown liquid
2. It is a mixture of hydrocarbons (compounds with hydrogen and carbon only)
3. It can be stored and transported easily by tankers. It can flow through a pipe easily.
4. It is moderately polluting as some soot is produced due to incomplete combustion (due to slightly higher percentage mass of carbon compared to natural gas)
5. It also undergoes combustion in the forms of complete and incomplete combustion.

Characteristics of coal:

1. It is a black solid
2. It is mainly just carbon
3. It is not easily stored and transported.
4. It is extremely polluting as large amount of soot is produced due to incomplete combustion (due to 100% percentage mass of carbo)
5. It undergoes combustion in the forms of complete and incomplete combustion.

Complete combustion:

- Coal burns in excess oxygen to form CO\({}_{2}\) to produce

- \(C(s)\,+\,O_{2}(g)\to CO_{2}(g)\)

Incomplete combustion:

- Coal burns in insufficient oxygen to form CO to produce energy

- \(2C(s)\,+\,O_{2}(g)\to 2C0(g)\)

**Hydrogen as a potential fuel**

* It is a renewable energy resource
* It is obtained from : 1. Reaction of natural gas with steam \[CH_{4}+H_{2}O(g)\to\text{CO}+3H_{2},H_{2}O+\text{CO}\to CO_{2}+H_{2}\] \[2.\] Electrolysis of water \[2H_{2}O(l)\to O_{2}(g)+2H_{2}(g)\] \[3.\] Cracking of hydrocarbons \[C_{2}H_{6}(g)\to C_{2}H_{4}(g)+H_{2}(g)\]

**Advantages of using hydrogen** :

* Hydrogen is renewable
* Hydrogen does not cause pollution as only water is formed when \(H_{2}\) reacts with \(O_{2}\) (fossil fuels form \(CO_{2}\))
* When hydrogen is burnt, it releases more than twice the amount of energy compared to many other fuels (efficient power source)

**Disadvantages of using hydrogen** :

* Expensive. Obtaining \(H_{2}\) from electrolysis is expensive / cracking of hydrocarbons
* Hydrogen is extremely flammable and explosive
* Hydrogen is a gas at rtp and requires large storage volumes compared to other fuels which are liquids at rtp (liquidus require less storage volume)

**Fuel cell (similar to a simple cell)** : A fuel cell is a chemical cell in which reactants (fuel and oxygen) are continuously supplied to produce electricity directly (chemical energy \(\to\) electrical energy)

Advantages of Fuel Cell:

* There are no pollutants formed as hydrogen reacts with oxygen to produce water
* It is more efficient as compared to coal/fossil fuels as it converts chemical energy directly to electrical energy

Disadvantages of Fuel Cell:

* It is expensive to source for hydrogen gas through electrolysis of water or cracking of hydrocarbons

**How is electricity produced?**

* Electrons are produced at the anode when hydrogen gas reacts with the electrolyte (\(OH^{-}\) ions)
* The electrons produced at the anodized will be transferred to the cathode where reduction occurs
* The flow of electrons from anode to cathode generates electricity
