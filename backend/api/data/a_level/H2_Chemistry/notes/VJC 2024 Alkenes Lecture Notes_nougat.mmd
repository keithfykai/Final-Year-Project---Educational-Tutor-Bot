## 2 Physical Properties of Alkenes

The structure and bonding of alkenes are similar to that of alkanes. Hence, they share **similar physical properties with alkanes**.

**I. Solubility and Density**

Alkenes are **non-polar**. They are **insoluble in polar solvents** such as **water** but **soluble** in **non-polar solvents** such as **CC**\({}_{4}\)**.**

Alkenes float on water and thus are **less dense than water**.

## 2 Boiling and Melting Points

**Boiling point increases** with **number of carbon atoms** as more energy is required to overcome the **increasing strength of instantaneous dipole-induced dipole interactions** due to **increasing number of electrons**.**

Ethene, propene and butene are gases at room temperature, but higher members of alkenes are liquids and then solids.

**Branched chain isomers have **lower boiling points** than their straight chain isomers. **Branched chain isomers** are **more spherical with **less surface**

### Dehydrohalogenation of Halogenoalkanes

* **Type of reaction:** Elimination
* **Reagents & conditions:** Heat with KOH in ethanol (or NaOH in ethanol)

**Making Thinking Visible**

**Question:** How are KX and H\({}_{2}\)O formed in the above reaction?

**Answer:** An acid-base reaction has happened as shown below:

HX (removed from halogenoalkane) + KOH \(\rightarrow\) KX + H\({}_{2}\)O

* The **major product** formed is the **more stable product** which is the **more substituted alkene.** E.g. There are **two ways to remove one HBr molecule** from the following halogenoalkane. **How to identify the more substituted alkene?** The more substituted alkene is the one with **more alkyl groups (-C\({}_{n}\)H\({}_{2n+1}\)) bonded to the C atoms in the C=C bond (inside the dotted boxes)** as shown in the example above. The enthalpy change of hydrogenation of the more substituted alkene to form the corresponding alkane has been found to be less exothermic than its isomeric alkene which is less substituted. This shows that more substituted alkenes are more stable. For instance, the enthalpy change of hydrogenation of but-2-ene (disubstituted alkene) is less exothermic compared to that of but-1-ene (monosubstituted alkene)

CH\({}_{3}\)CH\({}_{2}\)CH=CH\({}_{2}\) + H\({}_{2}\)\(\rightarrow\) CH\({}_{3}\)CH\({}_{2}\)CH\({}_{2}\)CH\({}_{3}\)\(\Delta\)H = -125.7 kJ mol\({}^{-1}\) (monosubstituted)

CH\({}_{3}\)CH=CHCH\({}_{3}\) + H\({}_{2}\)\(\rightarrow\) CH\({}_{3}\)CH\({}_{2}\)CH\({}_{3}\)\(\Delta\)H = -118.6 kJ mol\({}^{-1}\) (disubstituted)Reactions of Alkenes

### Electrophilic Addition

Candidates should be able to:

(a) explain the general reactivity of alkenes towards electrophilic reagents/electrophiles

The **C=C bond** in alkenes consists of a **strong sigma bond (\(\sigma\))** and **a weak pi (\(\pi\)) bond**.

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:7]

* **Markovnikov's Rule in Electrophilic Addition** For unsymmetrical alkenes, e.g. reaction between propene & HC_I_ **For unsymmetrical alkenes, e.g. reaction between propene & HC_I_ **For step 1** of the reaction mechanism, there is **electrophilic attack of H*** (from H***C**I***-) to the C atom of the C=C bond having greater number of H atoms directly bonded to it (C1 in this case). Hence, in the above example, 2-chloropropane is the major product.
* **Explanation for Markovnikov's Rule** This is to produce a more stable carbocation as the intermediate in the **first step of reaction mechanism**. The major product of the electrophilic addition reaction will be the **one formed from the more stable carbocation intermediate**. **Stability of carbocation: 3o > 2o > 1o**

**Tertiary (3\({}^{\circ}\)) carbocation** is the **most stable** as it has **three electron donating alkyl (R) groups**, which exert **electron donating inductive effect** to help **disperse the positive charge on carbocation** more than that of the secondary (2\({}^{\circ}\)) and primary (1\({}^{\circ}\)) carbocations.

### Formation of diol (mild oxidation)

Candidates should be able to:

(b) describe the chemistry of alkenes as exemplified, where relevant, by the following reactions of ethene:

(iii) oxidation by cold, alkaline solution of manganate(VII) ions to form the diol

**Type of reaction:** Oxidation

**Reagents and conditions:** cold KMnO\({}_{4}\) in NaOH(aq)

**Observation:** Purple KMnO\({}_{4}\) decolourised with formation of brown precipitate, MnO\({}_{2}\)

When there is **no heating**, **mild oxidation of the C=C bond** will take place where **only the \(\pi\) bond is broken** and a diol is formed.

### Formation of carboxylic acids, ketones and/or CO\({}_{2}\) (strong oxidation)

Candidates should be able to:

(b) describe the chemistry of alkenes as exemplified, where relevant, by the following reactions of ethene:

(iv) oxidation by hot, acidified solution of manganate(VII) ions leading to the rupture of the carbon-to-carbon double bond in order to determine the position of alkene linkages in larger molecules

**Type of reaction:** Oxidative cleavage

**Reagents and conditions:** KMnO\({}_{4}\) in H\({}_{2}\)SO\({}_{4}\)(aq), heat

**Observation:** Purple KMnO\({}_{4}\) decolourised

When heated, there will be **strong oxidation of the C=C bond** and **oxidative cleavage of C=C bond** occurs. The \(\pi\) bond in the C=C bond is first cleaved, followed by the cleavage of the C-C \(\sigma\) bond**.
