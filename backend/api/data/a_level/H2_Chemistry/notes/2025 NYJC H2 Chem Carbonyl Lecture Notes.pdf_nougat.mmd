**Difference in reactivity between Carbonyl compounds and Alkenes**

* Although both alkenes (C=C) and carbonyl compounds (C=O) are unsaturated with double bonds, they **behave differently towards nucleophilic reagents**.
* **Carbonyl carbon is electron-deficient** since it is bonded to electronegative oxygen. The electronegative oxygen pulls electrons from the carbonyl carbon, causing the carbonyl carbon to be electron deficient and attracts nucleophiles.
* On the other hand, there is no electronegativity difference between the two C atoms in the C=C bond, hence the bond is non-polar and there is **no electron deficient carbon** for the nucleophile to attack. In addition, the \(\pi\) bond causes the C=C bond to be electron-rich, repelling the approach of a nucleophile.

## 4 Physical properties

### Boiling Point

* permanent dipole attraction which cause them to have higher boiling point than alkanes and other non-polar compounds of comparable relative molecular mass, M\({}_{r}\).

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|} \hline compounds & M\({}_{r}\) & boiling point / \({}^{\circ}\)C \\ \hline \hline CH\({}_{3}\)CH\({}_{2}\)CH\({}_{2}\)CH\({}_{3}\) & 58.0 & - 0.5 \\ \hline CH\({}_{3}\)CH\({}_{2}\)CHO & 58.0 & 48 \\ \hline CH\({}_{3}\)COCH\({}_{3}\) & 58.0 & 56 \\ \hline \end{tabular}
* However they **do not exhibit hydrogen bonding** between molecules as there is no H attached to an electronegative atom like N, O, or F. Hence they have lower boiling points than alcohols and carboxylic acids of comparable relative molecular mass, M\({}_{r}\).

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|} \hline compounds & M\({}_{r}\) & boiling point / \({}^{\circ}\)C \\ \hline \hline CH\({}_{3}\)CH\({}_{2}\)CHO & 58.0 & 48 \\ \hline CH\({}_{3}\)CH\({}_{2}\)CH\({}_{2}\)OH & 60.0 & 97 \\ \hline CH\({}_{3}\)COOH & 60.0 & 118 \\ \hline \end{tabular}

The order of boiling points for compounds with **comparable M**, but different functional group is:

\[\begin{array}{c}\mbox{carboxylic acids > alcohols > aldehydes/ketones > alkanes}\\ \hline\mbox{\small Carboxylic acids}&\mbox{Alcohol}&\mbox{Aldehydes/Ketones}&\mbox{ Alkanes}\\ \hline\mbox{\small \bf Hydrogen bonding exists between molecules.}&\mbox{\small \bf Permanent dipole}&\mbox{\small Weak \bf instantaneous}\\ \mbox{\small \bf hydrogen bonding exists between molecules.}&\mbox{\small \bf permanent dipole}&\mbox{\small \bf dipole}-\mbox{\small induced}\\ \mbox{\small \bf molecules.}&\mbox{\small \bf attraction exist between molecules.}&\mbox{\small \bf dipole attraction exist between molecules.}\\ \hline\end{array}\]

### Solubility

* The **lower aliphatic** aldehydes and ketones (i.e. the carbonyl group is not attached to the benzene ring) are appreciably soluble in water due largely to their ability to form **hydrogen bonds** with water molecules. (Note that carbonyl compounds are however unable to form hydrogen bonding between themselves!)
* induced dipole attraction** between the hydrocarbon chains in the carbonyl molecules become more significant. The energy evolved from the formation of instantaneous dipole
- induced dipole attraction between water and carbonyl molecules is **insufficient** to overcome the instantaneous dipole
- induced dipole attraction between carbonyl molecules and hydrogen bonding between water molecules.

## Overview of carbonyl reactions

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:8]

In the case of controlled oxidation to form aldehydes from primary alcohols, the aldehyde formed is immediately removed by distillation as it is formed, preventing it from further oxidation to give carboxylic acids.

This method makes use of the higher volatility of the aldehyde due to a lack of hydrogen bonding. The reaction mixture is warmed to a temperature above the boiling point of the aldehyde, but below that of the alcohol. The aldehyde is distilled as soon as it is formed, avoiding any further contact with the oxidising agent.

Figure 1: The reaction mixture is warmed to a temperature above the boiling point of the aldehyde, but below that of the alcohol. The aldehyde is distilled as soon as it is formed, avoiding any further contact with the oxidising agent.

#### 6.2.2 Optical activity of cyanohydrin product

Recall in **Step 2** of the nucleophilic addition mechanism, the nucleophile attacks the electron deficient carbonyl carbon.

**Step 2:**

The CN\({}^{-}\) nucleophilic can attack the **trigonal planar carbonyl carbon** of the molecule from **either the top or bottom of the plane** with **equal probability**, producing **equal amounts of each enantiomer (a racemic mixture)**.

The product mixture is **optically inactive** (i.e. does not rotate plane-polarised light) as **each enantiomer rotate plane-polarised light in the opposite direction by the same magnitude** hence the **rotating powers of the enantiomers cancel out**.

**Note:**

\(\bullet\) Use of unsymmetrical carbonyl compounds are required to give a chiral product.

\(\bullet\) While chiral products are formed, no optical activity is observed as a racemic mixture is obtained.

#### Reactivity of Aldehydes and Ketones

Ketones are **generally less reactive** than aldehydes towards nucleophiles. This is because:

* the carbonyl carbon in ketone is **less electron-deficient** than aldehyde as it is attached to two electron-donating alkyl groups. Hence, ketones are less susceptible to nucleophilic attack.
* the carbonyl carbon in ketone is attached to two bulky alkyl groups hence it is **more sterically hindered**, preventing nucleophiles from attacking the carbonyl carbon.

### Mechanism for reaction of a carbonyl compound with 2,4-DNPH

\(\bullet\) The hydrazine acts as a nucleophile by attacking the electron deficient carbonyl carbon.

\(\bullet\) Proton transfer from nitrogen atom to oxygen atom.

\(\bullet\) Elimination of water molecule by removing OH from the carbon atom and H from the adjacent nitrogen atom, forming a C=N bond.

\(\bullet\)

### Mechanism for Tri-iodomethane Test

* The hydroxide ion acts as a nucleophile by abstracting the partial positive hydrogen atom to give an enolate. The enolate will then attack the iodine to give the first iodinated product.
* These two steps are repeated to give the second and third iodination products.
* Finally, the hydroxide ion will attack the partial positive carbonyl carbon atom to give a carboxylic acid and \(\bar{\text{CI}}_{3}\) ion. The \(\bar{\text{CI}}_{3}\) ion will then abstract the acidic proton from the carboxylic acid to give a carboxylate and tri-iodomethane, CHI\({}_{3}\).

* The two tautomers, ketone and enol, are isomers, and tautomerism is an equilibrium process.
* Tautomerism arises because of the proximity of an acidic hydrogen to a lone pair of electrons on the carbonyl oxygen atom. The enol is known as such because it contains both the alkene and hydroxy groups.
* The presence of the alkene group makes the enol susceptible to oxidative cleavage.
* As the concentration of enol is insignificant, the position of equilibrium will lie more to the left. Hence, oxidation of ketone is not very prominent.
* However, in the presence of a stronger oxidising agent, the position of equilibrium will lie more to the right, causing enol to be oxidised.
