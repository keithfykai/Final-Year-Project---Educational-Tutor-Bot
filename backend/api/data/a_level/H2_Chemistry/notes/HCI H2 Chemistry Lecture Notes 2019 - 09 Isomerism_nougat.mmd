## 1 Introduction

Molecules having the same molecular formula can have different arrangement of the atoms, giving rise to different forms called **isomers**. Isomers may have vastly different physical and chemical properties depending on the structure and functional groups present. These properties may affect the way the compounds are used and how they are applied in laboratories and the industry.

Isomerism can be broadly classified into 2-types:

(a) **constitutional isomerism**, in which atoms are linked together in different ways, and

(b) **stereoisomerism**, in which atoms have the same connectivity but different arrangements in space.

These two broad classes can be sub-divided into different categories which describe more precisely the various types of isomerism.

_Note: Other textbooks and websites may list the various terms differently as the A-level syllabus. You are required to use the terms listed above. The short list below is provided for clarity should you read beyond the notes._

_Constitutional isomerism may be referred to as structural isomerism_

_cis-trans isomerism may be referred to as geometric isomerism_

_Enantiomerism may be referred to as optical isomerism_

## 3 Stereoisomerism

Stereoisomers have the same structure and functional groups but differ in the way their atoms are arranged in space (orientated differently with respect to each other).

### _Cis-trans_ isomerism

#### 3.1.1 Restricted rotation of a covalent bond

A single \(\alpha\) covalent bond can be rotated freely without the bond breaking. For example, the C-C bond in ethane can be rotated with minimal energy, about 12 kJ mol\({}^{-1}\). The hydrogen atoms bonded to each carbon are constantly rotating about the C-C bond axis,

However, this rotation can be restricted in either the presence of double bonds or the presence of ring structures.

For rotation to occur when there's a double bond, the \(\pi\) bond must break and reform. Thus, the energy barrier to double bond rotation is at least as great as the energy needed to break the \(\pi\) bond, an estimated 268 kJ mol\({}^{-1}\) for a C=C double bond, which is far beyond the energy available at normal temperatures.

The result is that the atoms or groups of atoms bonded to each carbon are fixed in space with respect to one another and the 4 positions relative to the double bond are not easily interchangeable.

#### Rotation around the single bonds in a ring is prevented by the linkages in the ring.

For example, the structure of cyclopropane is shown below. Due to the ring structure, the C-C bonds that make up the ring cannot rotate without breaking the other C-C bonds. Again, the result is that the atoms or groups of atoms bonded to each carbon are fixed in space with respect to one another. i.e. The atoms on one side of the plane of the ring will stay on that side.

#### Occurrence of _cis_-_trans_ isomerism in alkenes

In a compound with an alkene functional group, _cis_-_trans_ isomerism occurs when the two groups on each carbon of the restricted bond are not identical.

Consider the molecule but-2-ene:

The criteria for _cis_-_trans_ isomerism are fulfilled, and but-2-ene exists as distinct and separate isomers. The isomer where the same groups are on the same side of the double bond is called the _cis_ isomer while the isomer where the same groups are on the opposite side of the double bond is called the _trans_ isomer.

#### 3.1.3 Occurrence of _cis-trans_ isomerism in cycloalkenes

Cycloalkenes with up to 7 carbon atoms exist only as the _cis_ isomer as the rings are not large enough to accommodate the _trans_ double bond. Thus, molecules such as cyclohexene, do not exhibit _cis-trans_ isomerism around the double bond.

Cycloalkenes with 8 or more carbon atoms can exist as _cis-trans_ isomers and they are usually named together with the prefix (_cis_ or _trans_) to avoid ambiguity.

#### 3.1.4 Occurrence of _cis-trans_ isomerism in ring structures

Similar to double bonds; the restricted rotation of a covalent bond due to a ring structure allows for _cis-trans_ isomerism.

For example, the compound 1,2-dichlorocyclopentane exists as _cis-trans_ isomers. This is due to the restricted bond rotation between C1 and C2 in the ring.

The _cis_ isomer is the one where the same groups exist on the same side with respect to the plane of the ring, whereas the _trans_ isomer is the one where the same groups exist on opposite sides of the plane of the ring.

Another example is illustrated below showing the _cis_ and _trans_ isomers of 1,2-dimethylcyclopropane.

#### 3.1.5 Summary

The definitive criteria for a molecule to exhibit _cis-trans_ isomerism are:

1. The molecule has a covalent bond with restricted rotation;
2. The groups bonded to each of the atoms on each end of the bond with restricted rotation cannot be the same.

#### Example of _cis-trans_ isomers in biological systems

Visual perception or sight is dependent on a compound known as retinal. The process is complicated but generally retinal molecules that are bound to opsin proteins in the eye are converted from the 11-_cis_ isomer to the all-_trans_ isomer, which starts the visual cycle. The visual cycle is a circular enzymatic pathway that eventually regenerates the _cis_ isomer.

Retinal is usually produced by the biological system through consumption of beta-carotene present in foods such as carrots, sweet potatoes and apricots. The beta-carotene then undergoes enzyme catalysed oxidative cleavage to produce retinal.

Linoleic acid is an essential fatty acid in human diet, with the following structural formula: \(\text{CH}_{3}(\text{CH}_{2})_{4}\text{CH}\text{=CHCH}_{2}\text{CH}\text{=CH}( \text{CH}_{2})\text{,CO}_{2}\text{H}\)

In linoleic acid, both double bonds are in the _cis_ configuration. Representing the formula by the abbreviated structure A-CH=CH-CH\({}_{2}\)-CH=CH-B, draw the displayed formulae of: (a) linoleic acid; and (b) all its _cis-trans_ isomers.

### 3.2 Enantiomerism

The non-superimposability of mirror images is the definitive criterion for a molecule to exhibit enantiomerism, i.e. to be chiral. If the mirror image is non-superimposable, the mirror image is the enantiomer of the compound. If the mirror image of a molecule is superimposable on itself, the compound is said to be achiral and does not have enantiomers.

Consider the molecule above, the carbon atom has four different groups attached to it and has a tetrahedral geometry about it. When this occurs, the carbon atom is referred to as a chiral centre. Similarly, any atom with a tetrahedral geometry around it that is bonded to four different groups is known as a chiral centre.

A chiral centre is denoted with an asterisk on the structure.

Now consider the mirror image of the above molecule - molecule II.

Molecule II also has a chiral centre attached to the same four groups that are present in molecule I. However, the two molecules differ in the spatial arrangement of these groups around the chiral centre. Because of this different arrangement in space, the two molecules are **not superimposable on each other**. In this situation, the two molecules, which are non-superimposable mirror images of each other, are known as ** enantiomers.** Each of these molecules is also said to be **chiral.

Further examples of compounds with chiral centres are shown below:You will need to learn how to draw a pair of enantiomers showing the three-dimensional orientation about their chiral centres, just as seen for molecules I and II on the previous page.

#### 3.2.2 Optical activity

All molecules, whether chiral or achiral, are able to rotate plane-polarised light due to interaction with the electron cloud of the molecule. For a particular molecule, the extent and direction of rotation depends on the orientation of the molecule in relation to the plane-polarised light.

In the case of achiral molecules, due to the symmetry of the molecules and the large number and random distribution of the molecules in a sample, each of these rotations are cancelled out, leading to no net rotation of the plane-polarised light and hence no optical activity is observed.

In the case of chiral molecule (compounds exhibiting enantiomerism), when the sample is of a pure enantiomer or one that is enantiomerically enriched, such exact cancellation of individual rotations is not possible as the chiral molecules are not symmetric. This results in optical activity, i.e. rotation of the plane-polarised light. This optical activity can be measured with a polarimeter. In a **racemic mixture**, where there are equal amounts of both enantiomers, the equal and opposite rotation of plane-polarised light cancels out, and results in optical inactivity.

Normally what we see is unpolarised light, which vibrates randomly in all directions. Plane-polarised light is composed of waves that vibrate in only one plane. When unpolarised light passes through a polariser, the randomly vibrating light waves are filtered so that the light passing through is vibrating in only one direction,

in a polarimeter, which measures the rotation of polarised light, monochromatic (one-colour) light from the source passes through a polariser, then through the sample cell containing a solution of optically active compound. On leaving the sample cell, the polarised light encounters another polariser, called the analyser. The analyser is movable and the operator rotates it until the maximum amount of light is transmitted, then reads the angle of observed rotation.

#### 3.2.3 Physical Properties of Enantiomers

Enantionmers have identical physical properties (e.g. b.p., m.p, conductivity, etc) except towards plane-polarised light.

Each enantiomer rotates plane-polarised light by the same angle, but in opposite directions. The direction in which a particular enantiomer rotates plane-polarised light cannot be predicted from the structure, but must be determined experimentally.

The enantiomer that rotates the plane-polarised light in a clockwise direction is said to be _dextrorotatory_ (from the Latin _dextro_ = "to the right"), and we use the identifier (+) prefixed to its name. The enantiomer that rotates the plane-polarised light in an anticlockwise direction is said to be _Iaevorotatory_ (Latin, _Iaevo_ = "to the left"), and we use the identifier (-) prefixed to its name.

A mixture containing equal proportion of both enantiomers is called a **racemic mixture** or racemate. A racemic mixture is **not** optically active. (Why?)

#### 3.2.4 _An note on nomenclature_

Since the (+)/(-) nomenclature can be assigned only from experiment, chemists use the R/S nomenclature to distinguish between enantiomers based on structure alone. Using systematic rules, each chiral centre can be assigned either an (R) or (S) configuration. However, learning how to assign these configurations is not part of the A-level H2 syllabus.

In the late 1950s and early 1960s, thalidomide was a drug prescribed to pregnant women for morning sickness. Thousands of pregnant women took the drug to relieve their symptoms. After the introduction of thalidomide, there was a huge increase in birth defects, especially in Europe and Canada. It was discovered that thalidomide was responsible for this, causing children to be born with various defects such as amelia (absence of limbs) and dysplasia (malformation, missing or extra limbs).

Thalidomide was prescribed as a racemic mixture, containing both the left-handed and right-handed isomers in equal amounts: It was later determined that only one of the isomers, the (R) isomer was effective against morning sickness, whereas the other isomer, the (S) isomer, was teratogenic (caused birth defects). However, the enantiomers can interconvert _in vivo_ (in the human body), so if a human is given pure (R)-thaldomide or (S)-thaldomide, both isomers will be present in the body eventually. Therefore, even administering the (R) isomer will NOT prevent the teratogenic effects in humans.

The two enantiomers of thalidomide

An important lessonFollowing the thalidomide incident, there was increased fear in the safety of pharmaceutical drugs. It brought on a change in drug testing and increased awareness of potential side effects of drugs. It led to much stricter testing before drug licensing.

The biological impact of enantiomers also highlights the importance of enantiomeric purity in the medicinal industry. This has to be achieved either through synthesis of only one particular enantiomer or the separation of mixtures of enantiomers.

#### 3.2.5 Unusual cases of chirality and achirality

_Meso_ compounds:

_Meso_ compounds are **achiral** molecules that possess multiple chiral centres. The reason why they are achiral is because they possess an **internal plane of symmetry** which cause their mirror image to be superimposable.

In the example below, there are 2 chiral carbons in molecule E, but because of the internal plane of symmetry, the molecule's mirror image is identical to itself. As such, molecule E is the _meso_ isomer of 2,3-dichlorobutane, and is therefore achiral. A pure sample of this molecule would be optically inactive.

**Some molecules without a plane of symmetry can also be achiral.**

While a molecule with an internal plane of symmetry must be achiral, _some_ molecules without an internal plane of symmetry can also be achiral.

Molecule F, for example, has no internal plane of symmetry, yet its mirror image is superimposable on itself. Molecule F is therefore achiral.

_Visualisation help:_ flip the mirror image of F about the plane of the ring (), then rotate it 180* () to superimpose it with the molecule on the left-hand side.

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:19]

### Counting the total number of stereoisomers

Stereoisomers include both _cis-trans_ isomers and enantiomers: Provided there is no internal plane of symmetry in the structure of a molecule, and chirality occurs only due to chiral centres, then:

the maximum number of stereoisomers a molecule can have = 2\({}^{mn}\)

where \(m\) = number of chiral centres; and

\(n\) = the number of double bonds that can give rise to _cis-trans_ isomers.

For example, in the methoprene molecule shown below, there is only one chiral centre, and both double bonds allow for _cis-trans_ isomerism. As such, the maximum number of possible stereoisomers for methoprene is 2\({}^{(1+2)}\) = 8.

## Appendix D Degrees of unsaturation

Calculating degrees of unsaturation is a useful tool to elucidate the structure of an organic compound. The degrees of unsaturation can tell us how many possible double/triple bonds or ring structures there are in a compound.

The degrees of unsaturation in a compound is determined from its molecular formula. A straight chain or branched aliphatic alkane has the general molecular formula, C\({}_{n}\)H\({}_{2n2}\). It is considered saturated and has zero degrees of unsaturation. For example, butane has the molecular formula C\({}_{n}\)H\({}_{10}\) and therefore is saturated and has zero degrees of unsaturation.

For hydrocarbons, every decrease of 2 hydrogen atoms from the general formula of C\({}_{n}\)H\({}_{2n2}\) contributes to 1 degree of unsaturation. For example, the molecular formulae C\({}_{n}\)H\({}_{5}\), C\({}_{3}\)H\({}_{6}\), and C\({}_{6}\)H\({}_{16}\) indicate 1 degree of unsaturation. The molecular formulae C\({}_{n}\)H\({}_{6}\), C\({}_{5}\)H\({}_{6}\), and C\({}_{6}\)H\({}_{14}\) indicate 2 degrees of unsaturation.

Singly bonded atoms like halogens can be counted towards the hydrogen atom count. For example, the molecular formulae C\({}_{n}\)H\({}_{5}\)Br, and C\({}_{5}\)H\({}_{5}\)Cl indicate 1 degree of unsaturation.

Divalent atoms like oxygen and sulfur do not affect the degree of unsaturation. For example, the molecular formulae C\({}_{n}\)H\({}_{10}\)O, and C\({}_{3}\)H\({}_{8}\)O indicate a saturated compound. The molecular formulae C\({}_{4}\)H\({}_{6}\)O, and C\({}_{6}\)H\({}_{14}\)O indicate 2 degrees of unsaturation.

The degree of unsaturation gives us information on the structure of the compound. If the molecular formula shows 1 degree of unsaturation, it can mean that the compound contains a double bond or a single ring. 2 degrees of unsaturation may possibly indicate 2 double bonds, or 2 ring structures, or 1 double bond and 1 ring structure, or a triple bond.

### Worked Example 1

The molecular formula C\({}_{n}\)H\({}_{6}\) is 4 H atoms short of the formula for saturated alkanes; This indicates 2 degrees of unsaturation. 2 degrees of unsaturation may possibly indicate 2 double bonds, or 2 ring structures, or 1 double bond and 1 ring structure, or a triple bond. Hence, some possible structures of the actual compound are shown below.

### Worked Example 2

The molecular formula C\({}_{n}\)H\({}_{5}\)O has an oxygen atom and fluorine atom. A saturated molecule should have a hydrogen count of 12. A halogen adds 1 to the hydrogen count but the oxygen atom does not add to the hydrogen count so the molecular formula has a hydrogen count of 8. This indicates that there are \((\frac{12-8}{2})=2\) degrees of unsaturation. This can be due to C=C bond/s, C=O bond and/or ring structures. Try drawing out some of the possible structures of C\({}_{5}\)H\({}_{7}\)O.
