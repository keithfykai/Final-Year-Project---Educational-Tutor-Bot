## ENERGY Changes

**Exothermic**

- A chemical reaction where energy in the form of heat is released to the surroundings and may increase the surrounding temperature

- Egs. condensation, freezing, metal displacement, neutralization, combustion

**Endothermic**

- A chemical reaction where energy is taken in from the surroundings and may decrease the temperature of the surroundings

- Egs. dissolving ammonium nitrate in water, boiling, melting

**MOLE**

**Mol**

- Volume divide by 24 (FOR GAS*)

- Mass divide by molar mass

- Molar Concentration times Volume (Mol/dm3 X dm3)

**Mass concentration (g/dm3)**

- Mass divide by volume

**Molar concentration (mol/dm3)**

- Mass concentration divide by molar mass

Molar mass -> g/mol

**Atomic Structure**

- nucleon/mass -> neutron + proton

- Proton = atomic number

Neutron -> 0, 1

Proton -> 1+, 1

Electron -> 1-, 1/1840

Isotopes

electron but different number of neutron

form a positively charged ion

negatively charged ion

## SPEED OF REACTIONI

Factors

- Temperature (increase)

- Surface area (smaller)

- Pressure (higher)

- Concentration (more)

Effect

- The more/higher the pressure/concentration, the more reacting particles per unit volume. The reacting gaseous particles are closer together, the frequency of effective collisions increases, more product formed and speed of reaction increases. The higher the concentration/pressure of gaseous reactants, the faster the speed of reaction.

- The smaller solid reactant particles, the larger the exposed surface area. There is more exposed surface area for other reactant particles to collide into. The frequency of effective collisions increases, more products are formed and speed of reaction increases. The smaller reactant size particles, the larger the exposed surface area, the faster the speed of reaction.

- As temp increases, more particles have energy greater than the activation energy and reacting particles gain more energy, moving faster. The frequency of effective collisions increases, more products are formed and speed of reaction increases. The higher the temp, the faster the speed of reaction.

Collision

- The higher the concentration of reactants, the greater the number of reactant particles in a given volume. OR A solid reactant that is smaller in particle size has greater exposed surface area. OR At higher pressure, the gas molecules are forced closer together. More frequent collisions between reactant particles can occur leading to greater frequency of effect collisions, increasing speed of reaction.

Experiments

Concentration

- Using a measuring cylinder, measure 50cm3 of 1mol/dm3 HCl in a beaker. Add 2cm magnesium ribbon into HC in beaker and start stopwatch. Once magnesium completely dissolved, stop stopwatch and record time taken. Repeat 3 times with 50cm3 of 2 mol/dm3 HCl using fresh magnesium ribbon. Record time taken in a table. The shorter the time taken, the faster speed of reaction.

Surface area

- Measure 2g of CaCO3 powder into conical flask. Add 100cm3 of 1mol/dm3 into flask. Co2 is produced and collected by gas syringe. Start stopwatch immediately and stop timing when 50cm3 of Co2 is produced. Repeat using 2g of CaCO3 lumps. (conclusion)

Temp

- 50cm3 of HCl is measured and placed in small beaker. Add strip of magniesum into small beaker w HCl at 20 degrees.Start stopwatch immediately and stop when magnesium ribbon fully disappeared. Record time taken and repeat with different temp at 30, 40, 50, 60 degrees of HCl. (conclusion)

Steeper the gradient, faster the speed of reaction.

The speed of reaction is highest at beginning. The gradient of graph is largest as blah blah. The speed of reaction decreases with time as blah. The gradient decreases. The reaction has stopped and no more products formed. The graph is horizontal and gradient is 0.

Fueles

- Petroleum (crude oil) ->mixture of hydrocarbons

- Natural gases (methane mainly 70%-90%)

Fractional distillation of crude oil

- In the furnace at the bottom of the fractional column, petroleum is heated into a vapour. The vapour is pumped into a huge fractionating column where fractions are separated by their boiling points. Hot vapour rises up the column and begins to condense and cool. The lighter fractions have lower boiling points and are collected at the top of the fractionating column as gases as the first fraction. Heavier fractions have higher boiling points and are collected at the lower sections of the fractionating column with bitumen as residue.
