## 1 Introduction

### Introduction (Nomenclature/Structure)

_Nomenclature_

General formula of C\({}_{n}\)H\({}_{2n+}\)OH or C\({}_{n}\)H\({}_{2n+2}\)O.

Ending '-e' of corresponding alkane is replaced by the suffix '-o'.

H H H H H H H H H H H H H

The methanol

Position of -OH group in carbon chain is specified by inserting the appropriate _number_ between the stem of the name and the '-ol'.

When choosing the parent of an alcohol, identify the longest chain that includes the carbon atom connected to the -OH group.

When numbering the parent chain of an alcohol, the C atom to which the -OH group is attached to should receive the lowest number possible.

Example:

Longest carbon chain bearing the -OH group is 6 carbons. The -OH group is attached to carbon 2 (not carbon 5) of this chain. Thus, the parent compound is **hexan-2-ol**.

There is a methyl group (-CH\({}_{3}\)) attached to carbon 5 of the chain. Thus, the full name of this compound is **5-methylhexan-2-ol**.

**Exercise 1**

Name the following alcohols.

### Physical Properties

#### Boiling Point

Compared to alkanes of similar M\({}_{r}\), alcohols have **higher boiling points**. This is because there are **intermolecular hydrogen bonds** between alcohol molecules, which are stronger than **instantaneous dipole - induced dipole interactions between alkane molecules**, and require more energy to overcome.

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:5]

### Laboratory Preparation

Alcohols can be synthesised from **alkenes**, **halogenoalkanes**, **carboxylic acids or carbonyl compounds (aldehydes or ketones)**.

### Reactions

\begin{tabular}{|p{284.5pt}|} \hline Candidates should be able to: \\ (a) & recall the chemistry of alcohols, exemplified by ethanol: \\ (i) & combustion \\ (ii) & nucleophilic substitution to give halogenalkanes \\ (iii) & reaction with sodium \\ (iv) & oxidation to carbonyl compounds and carboxylic acids \\ (v) & dehydration to alkenes \\ (b) & suggest characteristic distinguishing reactions for the different classes of alcohols (primary, secondary and tertiary alcohols), e.g. mild oxidation \\ \hline \end{tabular}

#### 1.4.1 Complete Combustion

Complete combustion produces **CO\({}_{2}\) and H\({}_{2}\)O**. The complete combustion of alcohols can be expressed with a general equation:

\[\text{C}_{i}\text{H}_{j}\text{OH}+\Big{(}x+\frac{y+1}{4}-\frac{1}{2}\Big{)} \text{O}_{2}\to x\text{CO}_{2}+\Big{(}\frac{y+1}{2}\Big{)}\text{H}_{2}\text{O}\]

#### 1.4.2 Nucleophilic Substitution - Formation of Halogenoalkanes

Substitution involves replacement of the hydroxy functional group with a halide.

Using **hydrogen halides,** HX (X = C_I_, Br or I)

reagent and condition: HX, heat. For HC_I_, ZnCl_2 catalyst is also required.

\begin{tabular}{|p{284.5pt}|} \hline ROH + HX heat & RX + H\({}_{2}\)O (where X = C_I_ or Br or I) \\ \hline \end{tabular}

Using **phosphorus trihalides,** PX\({}_{3}\) (X = C_I_ or Br)

reagent and condition: PX\({}_{3}\), heat.

\begin{tabular}{|p{284.5pt}|} \hline
3ROH + PX\({}_{3}\) heat & 3RX + H\({}_{3}\)PO\({}_{3}\) (where X = C_I_ or Br) \\ \hline \end{tabular}

*Pl\({}_{3}\) is unstable. Thus, to synthesise iodoalkanes in this way, Pl\({}_{3}\) is generated _in-situ_ by heating the red phosphorus (P) with iodine (I\({}_{2}\)). The Pl\({}_{3}\) formed will react with the alcohol directly, before it breaks down.
* Using **phosphorus pentachloride,** PCI\({}_{5}\) or **thionyl chloride, SOC\({}_{2}\)** (synthesis of chloroalkanes only)

reagent and condition: PCI\({}_{5}\), room temperature or SOC\({}_{2}\), heat

equation when PC\({}_{5}\) is used:

ROH + PC/\({}_{5}\) RC_I_ + POC/\({}_{3}\) + HC_I_
#### 1.4.3 Redox (Acid-Metal) Reaction with Sodium

Alcohols react rapidly with **sodium to form alkoxides (RO)**. This is a redox reaction where Na is oxidised (oxidation state increases from 0 to +1), while H is reduced (oxidation state decreases from +1 to 0).

Reagents and conditions: Na(s)

ROH + Na - RO-Na+ + % H2

Identification Test: test for **organic compounds with -OH group** (alcohol, phenol or carboxylic acid)

test: **add Na metal** to the unknown organic compound.

observation:

if the compound contains an -OH group, effervescence observed. Gas extinguishes lighted splint with 'pop' sound.

if -OH group is absent from the compound: no visible reaction 

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:10]

#### 1.4.5 Dehydration to Alkenes

Elimination of water from alcohol gives the corresponding _alkene_.

Reagents and conditions: excess concentrated H\({}_{2}\)SO\({}_{4}\), heat

Saytzeff's ruleDehydration of secondary and tertiary alcohols containing _four or more_ carbon atoms (e.g. butan-2-ol) yields a mixture of 2 structural alkenes as products.

Alkene produced in _greater abundance_ is predicted by Saytzeff's rule which states that the **more substituted alkene will be predominantly formed**, i.e. the one containing the _higher_ number of alkyl groups.

**Exercise 7**

Give the structural formula of the possible alkenes that are formed when the following alcohols are dehydrated with excess concentrated H\({}_{2}\)SO\({}_{4}\). Indicate the major and minor products.

#### 1.4.6 Condensation to Esters

In a condensation reaction, two molecules combine to form a larger single molecule with the loss of a small molecule.

Alcohols undergo condensation with **carboxylic acids, or acyl chlorides, (RCOCI) to form esters.**

_reaction between alcohols and_ _carbonylic acids_ _reaction between alcohols and acyl chlorides_

equation alcohol + carboxylic acid \(\rightleftharpoons\) ester + water + alcohol + acyl chloride + ester + hydrogen chloride gas

example **CH\({}_{3}\)CH\({}_{2}\)OH + CH\({}_{3}\)CCOCH\({}_{2}\)CH\({}_{3}\) + H\({}_{2}\)O**

reagent & condition heat the alcohol with carboxylic acid, with **concentrated H\({}_{2}\)SO\({}_{4}\) catalyst**

1. The catalyst provides H\({}^{+}\) ions which catalyse the reaction.
2. The catalyst serves as a dehydrating agent, removing water from the equilibrium reaction, shifting position of equilibrium to the right by Le Chatelier's Principle.

evaluation Using acyl chlorides to form esters from alcohols is the greatly preferred method of synthesising esters. As acyl chlorides are more reactive, the reaction goes to completion.

Alcohols

We will revisit this reaction in _Carboxylic Acids and Derivatives_.

#### Tri-lodomethane (lodoform) Formation

Test: warm the alcohol with **iodine and aqueous sodium hydroxide**

Note that carbonyl compounds containing a **methyl carbonyl group** ( ) also give a positive iodoform test. We will revisit this reaction in _Carbonyl Compounds_.

### _Physical Properties_

#### 2.2.1 Appearance

Phenol is a colourless, hygroscopic and crystalline solid (m.p. 42 \({}^{\circ}\)C).

#### 2.2.2 Boiling point

Compared to hydrocarbons with similar M\({}_{r}\) phenol has higher boiling point due to the presence of **intermolecular hydrogen bonding** between molecules, which are stronger than instantaneous dipole - induced dipole interactions between alkane molecules, and require more energy to overcome.

#### 2.2.3 Solubility

Partially soluble in water. The -OH group can engage in hydrogen bonding with water, but the large non-polar aryl group cannot. The solubility of phenol in water increases with temperature.

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:16]

### Reactions

\begin{tabular}{|l l|} \hline Candidates should be able to: & \\ (d) & recall the chemistry of phenol, as exemplified by the following reactions: \\ (i) & with bases \\ (ii) & with sodium \\ (iii) & nitration of, and bromination of, the benzene ring \\ \hline \end{tabular}

The reactions of phenol are of two types:

\begin{tabular}{|l l|} \hline Redox (acid-metal) and acid-base reactions of the hydroxy group & \\ Electrophic substitution at the benzene ring & \\ \hline

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:18]

#### 2.3.2 Electrophphilic Substitution at the Benzene Ring

The hydroxy group is _strongly activating_. The **delocalisation** of lone pair of electrons on oxygen into the benzene ring **enhances the electron density in the ring** so that phenol is **more susceptible to electrophilic attack**.

Phenol undergoes electrophilic substitution much more readily than benzene, often under much milder conditions.

The -OH group is 2,4-directing and strongly activating, often resulting in **polysubstitution.**

Nitration

With **dilute** nitric acid

Phenol reacts with **dilute HNO\({}_{3}\)** to form 2-nitropenol and 4-nitropenol (a mixture of both isomers is formed)

Reagents and conditions: dilute HNO\({}_{3}\), or HNO\({}_{3}\)(aq)

With **concentrated** nitric acid

Phenol reacts with concentrated HNO\({}_{3}\) to form 2,4,6-trinitrophenol.

Reagents and conditions: concentrated HNO\({}_{3}\)

On

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:20]

#### 2.3.3 Reaction with Neutral FeCl\({}_{3}\)(aq) - Test for Phenol

Phenol reacts with neutral aqueous iron(III) chloride to form a _purple_ or _violet_ colouration. [" the colour of the complex may vary if other substances are attached to the ring.]

This reaction is a useful distinguishing test for phenols in unknown organic compounds. A purple or violet colouration observed on reaction with neutral FeCl\({}_{3}\)(aq) confirms the presence of phenol.

Identification Test: test for **phenol** (highly specific)**

test: add **neutral FeCl\({}_{3}\)** to the compound.

observation:

if a phenol is present, **violet colouration is observed.**

if a phenol is absent, no visible reaction is observed.

**Thinkl**

How do the reactions of aromatic alcohols, e.g. phenylmethanol (benzyl alcohol) or phenylethanol compare with those of primary aliphatic alcohols and phenol?

**References**

**6** Alcohol **B** forms esters which are responsible for the flavours of various fruits and has the molecular formula C\({}_{5}\)H\({}_{12}\)O. Reaction of **B** with acidified potassium dichromate(VI) produces a compound **C**, C\({}_{5}\)H\({}_{10}\)O\({}_{2}\). Heating **B** with concentrated sulfuric acid produces **D**, C\({}_{5}\)H\({}_{10}\). Vigorous oxidation of **D** forms 2-methylpropanoic acid as one of the products.

**E**, a structural isomer of **B**, decolourises purple potassium manganate(VII) to produce a compound **F**, C\({}_{5}\)H\({}_{10}\)O. **E** forms a yellow precipitate **G**, when warmed with alkaline aqueous iodine. When **E** is heated with concentrated sulfuric acid, it produces CH\({}_{3}\)CH\({}_{2}\)CH=CHCH\({}_{3}\) as one of the products.

**H**, a structural isomer of **B**, produces an effervescence with sodium but does not decolourise acidified potassium manganate(VII) upon heating.

**Suggest structures for **B**, **C**, **D**, **E**, **F**, **G** and **H** and explain the reactions involved.

**[Remark: Explanation should include reaction type and functional group.]**Alcohol J, C,H,OH, is a volatile fungal metabolite whose presence when detected in air can indicate hidden fungal attack on the timbers of a house.

When 0.10 cm\({}^{3}\) of liquid J was dissolved in an inert solvent and an excess of sodium metal added, 10.9 cm\({}^{3}\) of gas (measured at 298 K) was produced.

When 0.10 cm\({}^{3}\) of liquid J was combusted in an excess of oxygen in an enclosed vessel, the volume of gas (measured at 298 K) was reduced by 54.4 cm\({}^{3}\). The addition of an excess of NaOH(aq) caused a further reduction in gas volume of 109 cm\({}^{3}\) (measured at 298 K).

**(a)**: Use these data to calculate values for \(x\) and \(y\) in the molecular formula C,H,OH for J.

Hints!

Consider the reaction of J with Na(s), what functional group can react with Na(s) to give a gas? What is the gas that is associated with Na(s) reaction in organic chemistry?

After combustion, there was a reduction of 54.4 cm\({}^{3}\). This reduction is due to two processes: the consumption of O\({}_{2}\)(g) and the production of CO\({}_{2}\)(g).

The reduction in gas volume after reaction with NaOH gives the volume of CO\({}_{2}\)(g). Use this information to determine the number of moles of carbon atoms per mole of J.

Alcohol J reacts with acidified K2Cr2O7, and can be dehydrated to alkene K. On treating K with an excess of hot acidified concentrated KMnO4, an equimolar mixture of ethanoic acid and propanone is produced.
