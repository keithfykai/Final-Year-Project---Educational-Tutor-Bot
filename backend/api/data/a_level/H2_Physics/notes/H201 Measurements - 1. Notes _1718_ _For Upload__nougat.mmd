### 0.0 Quantities and Units

The science of physics is based upon taking measurements. All scientific theories and laws must be tested experimentally, and all experiments necessitate making measurements.

### 0.1 Physical Quantities: Base Quantities and Derived Quantities

In Physics, quantities that can be measured are known as **physical quantities**. Each quantity consists of a **numerical magnitude** and a **unit**. (For vectors, there are **directions** as well.) **Base quantities** are physical quantities that are the most fundamental and they are independent of each other. The corresponding units for the base quantities are called the **base units**. It is important at all times to think of and write the value and the unit of any quantity together.

The metric system of units was introduced at the time of the French Revolution to rationalise the chaos of units that existed at that time. It has been modified since then and now most countries use the metric system of units called the Systeme International (SI). The advantage of the SI system of units is that any quantity has only one unit in which it can be measured.

* Quantities can be classified as **base quantities** or **derived quantities**.
* Base quantities are the 7 physical quantities of the _S.I. system_ by which all other physical quantities are defined. They arbitrarily chosen by scientists so that they:
* form the smallest set of physical quantities that will lead to a complete description of physics in the simplest terms.
* are based on international agreement by scientists.
* Derived quantities are obtained from one or more of the base quantities through a **defining equation.**

**Base Units**

* There are 7 base units, one for each of the base quantities.
* **Base units** are the 7 base units of the _S.I. system_, related to a base quantity, whose magnitude is defined without referring to any other units. The units used in measurement are the International System of Units (SI).

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|} \hline
**Base Quantity** & **Base Unit** & **Name** \\ \hline Length & m & metre \\ \hline Mass & kg & kilogram \\ \hline Time & s & second \\ \hline Electric current & A & ampere \\ \hline Temperature & K & kelvin \\ \hline Amount of substance & mol & mole \\ \hline Luminous Intensity & cd & candela \\ \hline \end{tabular}

### Derived Units

* A **derived unit** can be expressed in terms of base units by using the defining equation of the quantity.
* It is obtained from the base units by multiplication and/or division; without including any numerical factors.

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|} \hline
**DERIVED** & **Defining** & **Base SI** & **Derived** \\
**QUANTITIES** & **Equation** & **Units** & **Unit** \\ \hline Volume & \(V=l^{3}\) & m\({}^{3}\) & - \\ \hline Velocity & \(v=d/t\) & ms\({}^{-1}\) & - \\ \hline Frequency & \(f=1/T\) & s\({}^{-1}\) & Hz \\ \hline Force & \(F=ma\) & Kgms\({}^{-2}\) & N \\ \hline Work or Energy & \(W=Fd\) & kgm\({}^{-3}\)s\({}^{2}\) & J \\ \hline Pressure & \(P=F/A\) & kgm\({}^{-3}\)s\({}^{-2}\) & Pa \\ \hline Charge & \(Q=It\) & As & C \\ \hline \end{tabular}

**Example 1:**

The energy of a photon of light frequency \(f\) is given by \(hf\), where h is the Planck constant. What are the base units of \(h\)?

**Solution:**

The defining equation is \(E=hf\)

\[h=\frac{E}{f}\]

Base units of \(h=\frac{kgm^{2}s^{-2}}{s^{-1}}=kgm^{2}s^{-1}\)

**Example 2:**

The drag coefficient \(C_{0}\) of a car moving with speed \(\nu\) through air of density \(\rho\) is given by \(C_{D}=\frac{F}{2\,pv^{2}A}\) where \(F\) is the drag force exerted on the car and \(A\) is the maximum cross-sectional area of the car perpendicular to the direction of travel. Show that \(C_{D}\) is dimensionless.

**Solution:**

\[C_{D}=\frac{F}{2\rho v^{2}A}\]

Units of \(C_{D}=\frac{(kgms^{-2})}{(kgm^{-3})(ms^{-1})^{2}(m^{2})}\) & \(=\frac{kgms^{-2}}{kgms^{-2}}=1\) & \(C_{D}\) is dimensionless.

(Quantities that have no units are known as **dimensionless**.)

### Prefixes

In physics, it is common to encounter quantities that are very large or minute in magnitude. For example, Earth's mean radius is estimated to be 6 400 000 m. Radius of a hydrogen nucleus is approximately 0.000 000 000 000 001 3 m. To include all the zeros in all computation or steps will be undesirable and hence scientists adopted any of the 2 methods: use of scientific notation (standard form) or **prefixes**.

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|} \hline
**Prefix** & **Symbol** & **Sub-multiple** & **Prefix** & **Symbol** & **Sub-multiple** \\ \hline Pico & p & 10\({}^{-12}\) & Kilo & k & 10\({}^{3}\) \\ \hline Nano & n & 10\({}^{9}\) & Mega & M & 10\({}^{6}\) \\ \hline Micro & \(\mu\) & 10\({}^{6}\) & Giga & G & 10\({}^{9}\) \\ \hline Milli & m & 10\({}^{3}\) & Tera & T & 10\({}^{12}\) \\ \hline Centi & c & 10\({}^{2}\) & & \\ \hline Deci & d & 10\({}^{4}\) & & \\ \hline \end{tabular}

**Example 3:**

Convert the following to suitable units with prefix: 800, 000 W; 0.0000325 m; 2.65 x 10\({}^{\text{-10}}\) s

### Solution

800, 000 W = 800 kW = 0.8 MW

0.0000325 m = 0.0325 mm = 32.5 \(\mu\)m

2.65 x 10\({}^{\text{-10}}\) s = 2.65 x 10\({}^{\text{-1}}\) x (10\({}^{\text{-9}}\)) = 2.65 x 10\({}^{\text{-1}}\) ns

**Example 4:**

What is a reasonable estimate for the volume of a wooden metre rule found in a school laboratory?

**A 1.5 cm\({}^{3}\)****B 15 cm\({}^{3}\)****C 150 cm\({}^{3}\)****D 1500 cm\({}^{3}\)**

_Volume = 100 cm x 3 cm x 0.5 cm = 150 cm\({}^{2}\)_

_Answer C_

_2007 P1Q1_

**Example 5:**

Which of the following gives the estimated number of atoms in your body?

**A 10\({}^{24}\)****B 10\({}^{27}\)****C 10\({}^{30}\)****D 10\({}^{33}\)**

_VJC 2010 Prelim_

**Solution**

The mass of an average person is about 60 kg and it consists of mainly water. Molar mass of water is 18 g = 0.018 kg.

60 kg consist of 60/0.018 = 3.3 x 10\({}^{3}\) moles.

Hence no. of molecules = 3.3 x 10\({}^{3}\) x 6.02 x 10\({}^{23}\) = 2 x 10\({}^{27}\) molecules.

### _Homogeneity Of Physical Equations_

When we try to form equations that describe a physical system or phenomenon, it is important to understand how the concept of homogeneity helps us:

1. Equations that are not homogeneous are definitely wrong.
2. Equations that are homogeneous may or may not be correct. Possible causes of equations that are homogeneous but are incorrect. (i) Presence/absence of dimensionless constant (ii) Incorrect coefficient. (iii) Presence of extra term(s)/ Missing term(s).
* When an equation is _homogeneous (or dimensionally consistent)_, the following rules must be applicable:
* **Only terms with the same units can be added or subtracted*
* e.g. \(C=A+B\) implies that \(A\) and \(B\) must have the same units.
* **Units on both sides of the equation must be the same*
* e.g. \(A=B\) implies that \(A\) and \(B\) must have the same units.
* **The exponent of a term must not have any unit*
* e.g. \(e^{\frac{-t}{RC}}\) implies that units of \(RC\) combined must have the same unit as time, \(t\).

### _Plausibility of Physical Equations_

Checking the homogeneity of an equation using base units (or dimensional analysis) is a powerful way of establishing if the physical equation is reasonable. It narrows the numerous combinations that may exist.

For example, consider the period \(T\) of a simple pendulum. The possible factors which may affect it are its length \(l\), its mass \(m\) and the acceleration due to gravity \(g\).

We can therefore form an equation that describes the factors that affect the period of a simple pendulum:

\[T\propto l^{x}m^{y}g^{z}\] where \[x\], \[y\] and \[z\] are pure numbers without units \[\Rightarrow T=kl^{x}m^{y}g^{z}\] where \[k\] is a "unit-less" constant of proportionality.

In some situation, k may have a unit.

**Example 6:** Check that the equations (i) \[T=2\pi\sqrt{\frac{l}{g}}\] and (ii) \[x=ut+\frac{1}{2}\ \ a^{z}\] are homogenous.

**Solution**

**(a)** Unit of \(T=s\); units of \(l=m\); units of \(g=m\) s\({}^{2}\)

Units of \(2\pi\sqrt{\frac{l}{g}}=\sqrt{\frac{m}{m\,s^{-2}}}=\sqrt{\frac{1}{s^{-2}}}=\sqrt{s ^{2}}\) = s

Since units on LHS = units on RHS, equation is homogeneous.

* (b) Units of \(u\) = m s\({}^{\ast}\); unit of \(t\) = s; units of \(a\) = m s\({}^{\ast 2}\); unit of \(s\) = m. Units of \(ut\) = (m s\({}^{\ast}\))(s) = m; Units of \(\frac{1}{2}\)\(a\)\(\hat{t}\) = (m s\({}^{\ast}\))(s\({}^{\ast}\))= m. Since units of \(x\) = units of \(ut\) = units of \(\frac{1}{2}\)\(a\)\(\hat{t}\), equation is homogeneous.

## 2 Errors and Uncertainties

Error refers to the difference between a measured quantity and its true value. There are various factors that give rise to errors. However, in experiments, outright errors such as misreading a measurement (including parallax error), wrong calculations or poor execution of the experiment should not be considered as a legitimate set of errors when discussing the reliability of the results of the experiment. An experiment is only meaningful when such errors are avoided. Errors in measurement can result in costly or catastrophic outcome. An example of an error in measurement is the Hubble telescope. An error in calibration tool during the polishing process of the mirror led to the imperfect image sent back to earth when the Hubble telescope was first used in space in 1990. After a few costly repairs in outer space by the space shuttle missions, it was finally corrected and put to good use in 2009.

While the uncertainty in a reading is an inherent limitation of our measuring instruments, errors could also arise from different sources. They could be due to the following:

1. **The Instrument** Mass-produced instruments may not be correctly calibrated. Old instruments like ammeter and voltmeter may suffer drift in accuracy due to the weakening of magnet or spring inside the meters. External conditions, particularly at extreme temperatures, may affect the accuracy of many instruments. The drift of the zero reading contributes to **zero errors**.
2. **The Experimenter** Improper use of instruments is a common source of error. Examples are parallax error, misalignment of the zero scale or over-tigttening of the micrometer screw gauge.
3. **Nature of Quantity to be Measured** Some quantities may inherently change with time during the measurement (e.g. change in the resistance of a wire due to heating) or may give different values of measurements when taken at different points (e.g. diameter of a long wire).

Errors can be classified under 2 categories, namely **Systematic Errors** and **Random Errors**.

### Systematic Errors

A systematic error is one that leads to readings that are **consistently more or consistently less* than the actual reading**.

* Note that the phrase is _consistently more or consistently less_ **NOT** _consistently more or less_. A systematic error is either too high or too low, **NOT** both.

1. A systematic error is a reproducible error caused by imperfect equipment, calibration or technique. (e.g. a shrunken, bent or damaged meter rule)
2. It **can be eliminated** if the source is known and removed. (i.e. use more accurate equipment, calibrate the equipment properly or use a better/correct technique)
3. To detect systematic errors, you would need to either make measurements under different experimental conditions

_OR_ use another technique to perform the experiment.

A consistently different set of results reveals the presence of systematic errors.

#### 2.1.1 Some common systematic errors

* **Zero error** The pointer of an instrument does not exactly coincide with the zero mark when it is supposed to. Always check for zero errors before using an instrument such as a micrometer screw gauge or a vernier calipers.
* **End error** For example, in some nulers, the 0-cm mark starts right at the edge of the ruler. End error occurs when there is wear and tear at the ends of such a ruler after being used for many years such that the 0-cm mark is no longer present.

When conducting experiments, systematic errors that can be accounted for or rectified should be corrected immediately.

### 2 Random Errors

Even if every step of the experiment was done properly and all systematic errors accounted for, a quantity measured a number of times would not give identical results. There will be a fluctuation in the results and this is known as random error.

A random error is one that gives rise to a **scatter of readings about a mean value**.

Random errors **can be reduced** by taking the average of repeated readings.

Random errors **cannot be eliminated** even if the source is known because there is no way to reproduce exactly the same conditions in each measurement.

#### 2.2.1 Some common random errors

* such as temperature, pressure, vibrations etc.
* e.g. the observer's estimate of a fraction of the smallest division may vary from time to time.

**a) Parallax errors when reading from an inconsistent direction** Random errors can arise from parallax when an observer reads a scale from an _inconsistent_ direction. In Fig. 2, a plane mirror is placed alongside the scale so that the viewer may make the correct reading when the needle and its mirror image coincide; the plane of view is then perpendicular to the scale.

**b) Variations in environmental conditions**

Try as we may to preserve or maintain the experimental conditions, certain things are beyond our control e.g. variations in air pressure, temperature, reaction time etc. resulting in slight fluctuations in the readings.

**c) Irregularity of the quantity being measured**

Certain quantities by nature do not follow a regular pattern e.g. the spontaneous decay of radioactive nuclei, thickness of a wire, loudness of sound, reaction time etc.

**d) Limitation of the equipment.**

Certain equipment may be so sensitive that it can detect even the slightest variation on the signals which can be due to a number of reasons e.g. different applications of pressure on the jockey to the potentiometer or on the micrometer screw gauge etc. This may not be a good thing if a general reading is what you want.

#### 2.2.2 Ways to Reduce Random Errors

Random errors **cannot be eliminated** but can only be reduced by:

Taking repeated measurements to obtain an average value.

Plotting a graph to establish a pattern and obtaining the line or curve of best fit. In this way, the discrepancies or errors are reduced.

Maintaining good experimental technique (e.g. reading from a correct position)

**Example 2**

Which student obtained a set of results that could be described as precise but not accurate?

**Worked Example 3**

A student measures the time \(t\) for a ball to fall from rest through a vertical height, \(h\). He repeats the measurement for various different values of \(h\). Knowing that the equation \(h=\dfrac{1}{2}\,gt^{\,2}\) applies, he plots a graph of \(h\) against \(\hat{t}\). Comment on the accuracy and precision of the given data in the boxes below.

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|} \hline
**A** & \(\hat{

**Example 4**: The potential difference (p.d) across a resistor is 2.5 V and the current passing through it is 0.22 A. Calculate the resistance.

R = 2.5 V/0.22 A = 11.363636...\(\Omega\)

Is this answer correct?

Calculation cannot improve the precision of the measuring instruments. A p.d quoted as 2.5 V means that the measurement lies between 2.45 V and 2.55 V. Similarly, the current is between 0.215 A and 0.225 A. This enables us to calculate a range of possible values for the resistance.

R\({}_{\rm max}\) = 2.55 V/0.215 A = 11.860465...\(\Omega\)

R\({}_{\rm min}\) = 2.45V/0.225 A = 10.888888...\(\Omega\)

Hence the best we can say is that the resistance is near enough 11 \(\Omega\). The figures after the decimal pont are meaningless - they are not significant figures. Rather than doing this maximum/minimum calculation all the time, we use the rule that the calculated value can be no precise than the values used to obtain it. Hence we should only quote the answer to the same number of significant figures as the least precise measurement. Since the values 2.5 V and 0.22 A are quoted to 2 s.f, our answer must be quoted to 2 s.f, i.e R = 11 \(\Omega\).

### Uncertainty In A Measurement

Whenever a measurement of a physical quantity is made, some measuring instrument has to be used to make that measurement. Built in to the instrument is a limit of accuracy within which the experimenter is working. The result of this is that the readings that the experimenter takes have a degree of **uncertainty**.

Physical quantities cannot be measured exactly with any instrument. An accurate clock might measure a time interval to a millionth of a second, but even this is not quite exact.

If a person uses a ruler, the measurement will probably be taken to the nearest millimetre. The measurement might be stated as (208 \(\pm\) 1) mm. This implies that the person taking the measurement thinks that the best value is 208 mm, and that the value will not fall outside the range from 207 mm to 209 mm. The \(\pm\)1 mm is the **uncertainty** in the measurement. (Note: The symbol " \(\pm\)" is read as _plus-minus_.)

**Uncertainty** refers to the range of values on both sides of a measurement in which the actual value of the measurement is expected to lie. The **uncertainty** in a reading can be based on the **finite precision** in the instrument used.

The uncertainty in a reading **A** is represented by the symbols \(\Delta\)**A** (pronounced as "delta **A**").

The experimental reading of A together with its associated uncertainty is properly expressed in the form: \(\mathbf{A}\pm\Delta\mathbf{A}\). For example: the value of \(g\) is 9.81 \(\pm\) 0.01 ms\({}^{2}\).

In general, express

the uncertainty (\(\Delta\)A) to **1 significant figure**,

the calculated value (A) to the **same decimal place** as the uncertainty

both with the same units.

For example: 20.00 \(\pm\) 0.01 g; 19.1 \(\pm\) 0.1 cm

#### 2.4.1 Absolute Uncertainty

When a measurement is made using an instrument, the value obtained will always carry an uncertainty. The uncertainty of the measurement obtained is then determined by the division of the scale of an instrument.

**Scale reading:**

Uncertainty is read to **nearest half of the smallest division**.

Example: Using a thermometer to take temperature by reading the height of the mercury thread from the fixed scale.

**Measurement:**

Uncertainty is read to **nearest smallest division**.

Example: Using a ruler to measure the length of a strip of paper.

As these uncertainties are only estimated values, they are always quoted to **ONE SIGNIFICANT FIGURE**.

The numerical value of the uncertainty is known as the **absolute uncertainty**.

The uncertainty of an instrument determines the order of magnitude (or the number of decimal places) that should be quoted for the measurements made with it. The order of magnitude (or number of decimal places) in a reading is the same as that in the uncertainty. For example, an exact measurement of 20 cm using a ruler must be recorded as (\(20.0\pm 0.1\)) cm and not as (\(20\pm 0.1\)) cm.

#### 2.4.2 Fractional Uncertainty: How Suitable Is Your Instrument?

Generally, all readings can be recorded in the form \(R\pm\Delta R\) in which \(\Delta R\) is the **absolute uncertainty**. However, the suitability of an instrument in relation to a certain measurement is not reflected by the absolute uncertainty but by the fractional uncertainty (or percentage uncertainty) which is defined as follows:

**Fractional Uncertainty = \(\frac{\Delta R}{R}\)**

**Percentage Uncertainty = \(\frac{\Delta R}{R}\times 100\%\)**

**Note:** _A small reading (R) may give rise to a **large fractional uncertainty (\(\frac{\Delta R}{R}\))**._

_The fractional and percentage uncertainty give a better indication of the significance of the error and the reliability of the measurement and the suitability of the instrument used for it._

For example, when measuring small values such as the diameter of a wire, a precise instrument such as a micrometer screw gauge should be used in order to reduce the fractional and percentage uncertainty.

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:15]

**Example 6**: Given that \(a=(41.2\pm 0.1)\) cm, \(b=(20.1\pm 0.5)\) cm:

a) What is the value of \(X\) and its consequential uncertainty, if \(X=a+b\)?

X= 41.2 +20.1 = 61.3 cm

\(\Delta X=\Delta A+\Delta B=0.6\) cm

(61.3 \(\pm\) 0.6) cm

b) What is the value of \(Y\) and its associated uncertainty, if \(Y=a-b\)?

(21.1\(\pm\) 0.6) cm

**Important note:**

In general, if \(X=nA\pm mB\), where n and m are constants then

\(\Delta X=nA+mAB\)

**Example 7**: Given that \(A=(41.2\pm 0.1)\) cm, \(B=(20.1\pm 0.5)\) cm:

Find \(X\) and its uncertainty, if \(X=5A-2B\).

\(X=5(41.2)\cdot 2\) (20.1) = 165.8

\(\Delta X=5\Delta A+2\Delta B=1.5\) cm = 2 cm (1s.f)

\(X=(166\pm 2)\) cm

**2.5.2 Product and Quotient**

**If \(Y=a\times b\) or \(Y=a+b\), then the consequential uncertainty of \(Y\) is given by**

\(\frac{\Delta Y}{Y}=\frac{\Delta a}{a}+\frac{\Delta b}{b}\)

**Derivation (not required in syllabus)**

If \(R(x)=A(x)\)\(B(x)\), where \(A\) and \(B\) are functions of \(x\)

By differentiation (Product Rule) \[\Rightarrow \frac{dR}{dx}=\frac{dA}{dx}\,B+A\,\frac{dB}{dx},\] "Multiplying" \(dx\) throughout \[\Rightarrow \frac{dR}{R}=\frac{dA}{AB}\,B+A\,\frac{dB}{AB}\] \[\Rightarrow \frac{dR}{R}=\frac{dA}{A}+\frac{dB}{B}\] Replacing \(d\) with \(\Delta\) \[\Rightarrow \frac{\mathrm{D}R}{R}=\frac{\mathrm{D}A}{A}+\frac{\mathrm{D}B}{B}.\]

**Example 8**: Given that \(a=(10.3\pm 0.1)\) cm, \(b=(5.6\pm 0.1)\) cm: Find \(X\) and its consequential uncertainty, where \(X=a\times b\).

\[X= 57.68\] \[\frac{\Delta X}{X}= \left(0.1/10.3\right)\ +(0.1/5.6)\] \[=0.00971+0.01786\] \[=0.0276\]

Thus \(\Delta X=1.59=2\ (1\ \mathrm{sf})\)

Hence \(X\) should be written as

\(X=(58\pm 2)\) cm

Generally, if a quantity is a function of the product of a few variables, the percentage uncertainty of the quantity is the sum of the percentage uncertainties of the variables.

**If \(Y=a^{n}=a\times a\times a\)..., then**

\[\frac{\Delta Y}{Y}=n\frac{\Delta a}{a}\]

It can be seen that if a variable is raised to a power n, it contributes an uncertainty n times that of the variable towards the consequential uncertainty. Thus all high powered variables warrant careful measurement with instruments with small absolute uncertainties.

**Example 9**: Given that \(a=(3.04\pm 0.02)\) g and \(W=3a^{5}\), what is the actual uncertainty in \(W\)?

**W =778.9**

\[\frac{\Delta W}{W}=5\frac{\Delta a}{a}\] \[=5\ (0.02/3.04)\] \[=0.0329\] \[\Delta W=0.0329\] \[=25.6\] \[=30\ (1\ \mathrm{s.f})\] \[=(780\pm 30)\ \mathrm{g}\]

**Example 10**: The mass and diameter of a steel ball were used to determine its density. The mass was measured within 1% and the diameter within 3%. What is the percentage uncertainty in the calculated density of the steel?

\[\rho=\frac{M}{\nu}\] \[= M/(4/3\cdot\pi n^{3})\] \[= M/(4/3\cdot\pi(\mathrm{D/2})_{3}\] \[=(3/4)\cdot(8/\pi)\cdot M/\mathrm{D}\] \[=6M/\pi\mathrm{D}\]

\[\frac{\Delta\rho}{\rho}x100\%=\left(\frac{\Delta M}{M}+3\frac{\Delta D}{D} \right)x\ 100\ \%\]

\[=[0.01+3\ (0.03)]x100\ \%\] \[=0.1\ x100\ \%\] \[=10\ \%\]

**Important note:**

In general, if \(X=nA^{\alpha}.mB^{\beta}\) or \(X=\frac{nA^{\alpha}}{mB^{\beta}}\), where \(\alpha\), \(\beta\), \(n\) and \(m\) are constants, then

\[\frac{\Delta X}{X}=\alpha\frac{\Delta A}{A}+\beta\frac{\Delta\mathrm{B}}{ \mathrm{B}}\]

#### 2.5.3 Quantity with Mathematical Functions

For mathematical function such as trigonometric function of a reading, we can estimate the error as being the difference of the average value with either the smallest or largest possible value. You may need to consider the shape of the curve in order to make a meaningful judgement of the absolute uncertainty.

**General Method:**

\[\Delta z_{1}=z-z_{\min}\qquad\text{or}\quad\Delta z_{2}=z_{\max}-z\]

Consider \(z=\sin\theta\) where \(\theta=(48\pm 3)^{\circ}\),

Calculated value of \(z=\sin 48^{\circ}=0.743\)

Using the smallest and largest possible value of \(\theta\),

\(z_{\min}=\sin 45^{\circ}=0.707\)

\(z_{\max}=\sin 51^{\circ}=0.777\)

\[\Delta z=\nicefrac{{1}}{{2}}\ (z_{\max}-z_{\min})\] \[=\nicefrac{{2}}{{7}}\ (0.777-0.707)\]

**Choosing the larger of the two:**

Therefore, \(\Delta z=0.036=0.04\ (1\ \mathrm{s.f.})\)

\[z\pm\Delta z=0.74\pm 0.04\]Usually the \(\gamma_{2}\) (Max - Min) method will give a reasonable absolute uncertainty value. The general method may lead to a larger absolute uncertainty value.

The general method is usually used when the \(\gamma_{2}\) (Max - Min) fails to give a sensible value. For example, consider the above problem z = sin \(\theta\) where \(\theta\) = \((90\pm 10)^{\circ}\).

z = sin \(\theta\) where \(\theta\) = \((90\pm 10)^{\circ}\).

#### Calculating Uncertainties In A Derived Quantity

#### Suggested problem-solving strategy for uncertainty problems

**To determine the uncertainty of a physical quantity (A):**

1. Write down the relevant equation relating all physical quantities.

2. Make (A) the subject of the equation.

3. Based on the equation, choose the uncertainty formulae that apply.

4. Convert the equation into an equation for uncertainty. (i.e. remove all constants)

5. Put in the uncertainty values and calculate the final uncertainty of (A).

**In terms of presentation:**

6. Calculate and express the uncertainty (\(\Delta\)A) to 1 **significant figure.**

7. Write the calculated value (A) to the **same place value** as the uncertainty.

### Worked Example 11

Given that \(T=2\pi\sqrt{\frac{l}{g}}\), find an expression for the fractional uncertainty of

(a) \(T\) using measured values of \(l\) and \(g\).

(b) \(g\) using measured values of \(T\) and \(l\).

(a) \(T=2\pi(l)^{\alpha_{S}}(g)^{-\alpha_{S}}\)

\(\frac{\Delta T}{T}=\big{(}0.5\big{)}\frac{\Delta l}{l}+\big{(}0.5\big{)}\frac{ \Delta g}{g}\)

(b) Rearranging the equation and making g the subject:

\(g=\frac{4\pi^{2}l}{T^{2}}=4\pi^{2}lT^{-2}\)

\(\frac{\Delta g}{g}=\frac{\Delta l}{l}+\big{(}2\big{)}\frac{\Delta T}{T}\)

### Worked Example 12

Given the following quantities and their corresponding uncertainties:

\(r_{t}\) = \(2.2\pm 0.1\) cm

\(f_{2}\) = \(3.5\pm 0.1\) cm

\(h\) = \(7.2\pm 0.1\) cm

\(m\) = \(0.800\pm 0.001\) kg

Determine the value of \(S\) and its associated uncertainty for each of the cases:

(a) \(S=\frac{1}{2}\big{(}r_{1}+r_{2}\big{)}h\) (b) \(S=\frac{3m}{4\pi\big{(}r_{2}^{2}-r_{1}^{2}\big{)}}\)

### Solution:

**(a)**: Let \(R=r_{t}+r_{2}\), then \(S=\frac{1}{2}Rh=20.52\)

and

\(S=\frac{\Delta R}{R}+\frac{\Delta h}{h}\) (1)

Consider \(R=r_{t}+r_{2}\)= 5.7

\(\Delta R=\Delta r_{t}+\Delta r_{2}=0.1+0.1=0.2\)

From (1):

\(\Delta S=\frac{0.2}{5.7}+\frac{0.1}{7.2}\) = 0.049

\(\Delta\)S = 1.005 = 1 (to 1 sf)

Therefore,

**S \(\pm\)**\(\Delta\)S = (21 \(\pm\)1) cm\({}^{2}\)

## 3 Scalars and Vectors

### 1 Definitions of Scalar and Vector Quantities

**Scalar** quantities are physical quantities that can be represented by a **magnitude** only. They do not have a direction associated with them.

**Vector** quantities are physical quantities that can be represented by a **magnitude** and a **direction** in space.

**Examples of scalar and vector quantities**

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|} \hline
**Scalar Quantity** & **Vector Quantity** \\ \hline distance & displacement \\ \hline speed & velocity \\ \hline temperature & acceleration \\ \hline energy & force \\ \hline power & momentum \\ \hline mass & weight \\ \hline density & moment \\ \hline \end{tabular}

**Some mathematical operations involving scalars and vectors**

* scalar \(\times\) (or \(\div\)) scalar gives a scalar quantity
* vector \(\times\) (or \(\div\)) scalar gives a vector quantity For e.g., _weight = mass \(\times\)g, momentum = m \(\times\)v_
* a scalar quantity This type of multiplication is called the **scalar (dot) product of two vectors** and is in your H2 Mathematics syllabus. _For e.g., work done (scalar) = force (vector) \(\bullet\) displacement (vector)._
* - a vector quantity This type of multiplication is called the **vector (cross) product** and might be something you would learn in university.

## 2 ADDITION OF VECTORS

There are in general two methods of vector addition - Triangle Law and Parallelogram Law.

We will focus on using the Triangle Law for the 'A' Levels.

**TRIANGLE LAW**

**PARALLELOGRAM LAW**

**RULE:**

_Head_ of one to _Tail_ of the other and the **Resultant** is from the tail of the first to the head of the second.

**RULE:**

_Tail_ to _Tail_. Then draw a parallelogram in the following way.

**Useful for subtraction of vectors.**

**Useful for giving an approximate indication of the direction of resultant.**

**Useful for perpendicular vectors.**

**Useful for perpendicular vectors.**

**Note:** Addition is commutative, i.e. \(\vec{A}+\vec{B}=\vec{B}+\vec{A}\).

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:26]

**Example 1:**

Find the resultant of the following forces:

\(F_{A}\) = 5.00 N along the east and \(F_{B}\) = 3.00 N along the north.

_Solution:_

\(F_{R}\) = \(\sqrt{(F_{A}^{2}+F_{B}^{2})}\)

\(=\sqrt{(5.00^{2}+3.00^{2})}\)

\(=5.83\) N

\(\rm{F_{A}}\)

\(\rm{tan}\) 0 = \(F_{B}/F_{A}\) = 3.00/5.00 = 0.600

\(\rm{\theta}\) = 30.96\({}^{\circ}\) = 31\({}^{\circ}\) measured anti-clockwise from the eastward direction.

**Example 2:**

Two forces act on a body. One force has magnitude of 2.00 N acting in the easterly direction, the other 4.00 N acting in the direction 30\({}^{\circ}\) East of North. Find the resultant of these two forces.

_Solution:_

_Using cosine rule:_

\(R^{2}\) = 4.00\({}^{\circ}\)+2.00\({}^{\circ}\)-2x4.00x2.00cos 120\({}^{\circ}\)

\(R\) = 5.29 N_

_Using sine rule:_

_4/sin 0 = R/sin 120\({}^{\circ}\)_

\(\rm{\theta}\) = 40.9\({}^{\circ}\) measured anti-clockwise from the easterly direction._

## 3 SUBTRACTION OF VECTORS

* Subtraction is a special form of addition.
* To subtract vector \(\vec{A}\) from \(\vec{B}\) is actually to add vector \(\vec{B}\) to vector \(-\vec{A}\), i.e. \(\vec{B}-\vec{A}=\vec{B}+\left(-\vec{A}\right)\)

\(\vec{B}\)

\(\vec{B}-\vec{A}\)

\(\vec{A}\)

\(\vec{B}\)

\(\vec{B}-\vec{A}\)

\(\vec{B}\)

\(\vec{B}-\vec{A}\)

\(\vec{B}\)

\(\vec{B}-\vec{A}\)

Hence subtracting a vector is equivalent to adding the negative of the vector. The negative vector has the same magnitude as the original (positive) vector but is rotated 180\({}^{o}\).

### Applications of Vector Subtraction

Change in vector

If a vector \(\vec{V}\) changes either its magnitude or direction (or both), the change in \(\vec{V}\), \(\Delta\vec{V}\) is defined as \(\Delta\vec{V}=\vec{V}_{final}-\vec{V}_{initial}\) where \(\vec{V}_{initial}\) is the initial vector and \(\vec{V}_{final}\) is the final vector.

The above vector equation can be re-written as:

\(\Delta\vec{V}=\vec{V}_{final}+\left(-\vec{V}_{initial}\right)\)

Now the change in vector \(\Delta\vec{V}\) can be found by the vector addition of the vector \(\vec{V}_{final}\) and (\(-\vec{V}_{initial}\)) as shown in the figure below.

\(\vec{V}_{initial}\)\(\vec{V}_{final}\)\(\vec{V}_{final}\)\(\Delta\vec{V}\)\(\vec{V}_{final}\)

**Example 3:**

A car is initially travelling 12 ms\({}^{-1}\) due east. What is the change in velocity if its final velocity is

(a) 16 ms\({}^{-1}\) due east? [4 ms\({}^{-1}\) due east]

(b) 9 ms\({}^{-1}\) due east?

\(\Delta\)v = 9 - (12) = - 3ms\({}^{-1}\) = 3ms\({}^{-1}\) due west

(c) 10 ms\({}^{-1}\) due west?

\(\Delta\)v = -10 - (12) = - 22ms\({}^{-1}\) = 22 ms\({}^{-1}\) due west

## 4 Resolving vectors into two perpendicular components

The vector \(\vec{V}\) in the figure below is the resultant of two perpendicular vectors, \(\vec{V}_{x}\) and \(\vec{V}_{y}\) along the \(x\) and \(y\)-axis respectively.

We can represent any vector lying in the \(xy\)-plane as the sum of a vector parallel to the x-axis and a a vector parallel to the \(y\)-axis. In the figure below, these two vectors are labelled \(\vec{V}_{x}\) and \(\vec{V}_{y}\); they are called the **component vectors** of vector \(\vec{V}\), and their vector sum is equal to \(\vec{V}\).

\(V_{x}\) (equal to the magnitude of \(\vec{V}_{x}\)) is known as the x-component of \(\vec{V}\) and \(V_{y}\) (equal to the magnitude of \(\vec{V}_{y}\)) is known as the y-component of \(\vec{V}\).

From the figure, \(\sin\theta=V_{y}/\ V\).

Thus, we have \(V_{y}=V\sin\theta\).

Similarly, \(\cos\theta=V_{x}/\ V\)and we have \(V_{x}\)= \(V\cos\theta\).

The magnitude of \(\vec{V}\) is given by \(\left|\vec{V}\right|=\sqrt{{V_{x}^{{}^{2}}+V_{y}^{{}^{2}}}}\).

The direction of \(V\) is given by \(\tan\theta=\dfrac{\left|V_{y}\right|}{\left|V_{x}\right|}\).

**Note:** When we resolve the vector \(\vec{V}\) into its perpendicular component vectors \(\vec{V}_{x}\) and \(\vec{V}_{y}\),

**DOTTED ARROW LINES** are used to represent \(\vec{V}_{x}\) and \(\vec{V}_{y}\).

**Example 4:**

In the diagram below, find the resultant of the 3 forces.

**Solution:**

\(\Sigma\)Fy = 500 sin 45\({}^{\circ}\) + 600 sin 60\({}^{\circ}\) - 300 sin 30\({}^{\circ}\)

= 723.2N

\(\Sigma\)Fx = -600 cos 60\({}^{\circ}\) + 500 cos 45\({}^{\circ}\) + 300 cos 30\({}^{\circ}\)

= 313.4 N

Resultent F = \(\psi\)[(723.2)\({}^{2}\) + (313.4)\({}^{2}\)] = 788 N

Fx

Tan \(\theta\) =Fy/Fx

= 723.2/313.4

\(\Theta\) = 66.6\({}^{\circ}\)

Measured anti-clockwise from the x-axis

**Example 5:**

In the diagram below, a body S of weight \(W\) hangs vertically by a thread tied at Q to the string PQR. If the system is in equilibrium, what is the tension in terms of W in the section PQ?

_Solution:_

T2 sin30o = W

T2 = W/sin 30o = 2W

T1 = T2cos 30o = 2W 3/2

= 3W or 1.73 W

**Example 6:**

An object of mass 10 kg lies on a slope that is inclined at 30o to the horizontal. Find the components of the weight of the object along and perpendicular to the slope.

_Solution: (draw a diagram)_

_Step 1 - Draw the components of the vector parallel and perpendicular to the plane._

_Step 2 - Indicate the angle that one of the components makes with the original vector._

(You should be able to identify the angle immediately without much calculation after some practice).

_Step 3 - Calculate the magnitude of each component._

Weight along the slope = mgsin 0

= 10x9.81sin 30 =49.1 N

Weight perpend. to the slope = mgcos 0

= 10x9.81cos 30

= 85.0 N
