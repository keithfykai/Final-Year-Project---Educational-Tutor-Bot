**Name:**

**Class:**Qualitative Analysis

Qualitative Analysis is a method used to identify ions in compounds based on chemical reactions that involve:

* Evolution of gas
* Formation of precipitate
* Colour change

### Safety

In addition to the general lab safety rules, the following should be observed at all times when implementing qualitative analysis experiments:

* Students **must** wear safety goggles.
* **Do not** touch chemicals with your hands. Wash off immediately any chemicals that comes into contact with the skin.
* Note the smell of a gas by wafting it gently to the nose. **Do not** take in deep breath of gas.
* Dispose wastes carefully. **Dilute** concentrated acids and alkalis before pouring them away and **flush** the sink with plenty of water. **Dispose** solid waste into waste bins**, not the sink.
* A **test-tube holder must be used** when tests involve:
* warming
* adding concentrated acids, alkalis and flammable reagents. Such experiments should be carried out in the fume cupboard.
* When warming the mixture or burning, direct the mouth of test-tubes **away** from people.
* **Turn off** the Bunsen flame when not in use.

## 2 Manipulative Skills

### Quantity of Chemicals

* Collect sufficient quantities but not in excess. The use of large quantities of a chemical often leads to a waste of time as it takes a longer time to dissolve. In addition, this may lead to wreng results, e.g. if too much of lead iodide is used, its solubility in hot water will not be observed.
* The following quantities should be used, unless otherwise specified:

* **Solid**:
* Enough to fill the **hemisphere** at the bottom of a **clean** and **dry** test-tube.
* The solid should be transferred by means of a **clean** and **dry spatula** into the bottom of the test-tube.
* **Solution**:
* **-1 cm depth** (unless otherwise specified) of a **clean** test-tube.

When testing the **solubility of precipitate in excess reagent**, pour out the excess precipitate until about 1 cm depth is left, before adding the excess reagent.

### Handling of Reagents

When adding reagent, dropper or tip of squeeze bottle should be held just above the mouth of the test-tube. The tip of the dropper/bottle should not touch the sides of the test-tube. This is to avoid contamination of the bench reagents.

Add the reagent **dropwise** and **shake** until no further change in mixture or when reagent is in excess.

### Gravity Filtration technique

1. Fold filter paper:

2. Place the filter paper in the funnel and wet it with a little deionised water.

3. Carefully pour the mixture from the test tube into the filter funnel.

4. Retain the filtrate and residue for further analysis if necessary.

Figure 1: **How to test for solubility of precipitate formed in excess reagent**

## 3 Recording of Observations

* Indicate at which stage a change occurs by writing the observations alongside the tests performed. Record them **immediately after each test in ink**. Answers should include details such as:
* of salt or solution
* of precipitate (ppt) & its **solubility*
* in excess reagent
* **Colour change*
* of solution
* of **residue and filtrate*
* after filtration
* **Colour of solid, before and after heating
* **Solubility of solid
* **Chemical test results*
* for gas
* "Clear" is different from "Colourless". A clear solution may still be coloured. For example, aqueous Cu(NO)\({}_{2}\) is a clear blue solution.
* "Effervescence" vs "Evolved":
* "Effervescence" is for gases formed as bubbles during the reaction.
* "Evolved" is when gases are produced but no bubbing is seen.
* Making deduction:
* Make logical deductions based on the nature of the test reagents used.
* Deduction is consequential - ions that have been eliminated in the earlier tests need not be considered again in later deductions.
* Deduction should include the word present or 'absent'.
* Deductions should also be made for negative results, e.g. no ppt, no colour change, no gas evolved etc.
* DO NOT write 'no change or no observation' for negative results.
* For a test with more than one step, align your observations and deductions with the corresponding steps in the test or state clearly at which stage the observations were made.
* _Acceptable short form:_ ppt (precipitate)

### Testing of cations [See experiment 12]

**Technique**

1. Add reagent [NH\({}_{3}\) (aq) / NaOH (aq) / Na\({}_{2}\)CO\({}_{3}\) (aq)] **dropwise at first** to check for formation of precipitate. Observe and record colour of ppt.
2. For NaOH (aq) and NH\({}_{3}\) (aq), add these reagents **in excess** to check if ppt dissolves. Observe and record colour of solution formed. _(refer to Section 2.1 on how to check if ppt dissolves in excess)_

#### 6.1.1 Addition of aqueous sodium hydroxide

* precipitates insoluble hydroxides from solutions of metallic salts
* hydroxides of transition metals are usually coloured
* hydroxides such as Al(OH)\({}_{3}\), Cr(OH)\({}_{3}\) and Zn(OH)\({}_{2}\) are amphoteric and can dissolve in both acids and bases
* liberates weak volatile bases such as NH\({}_{3}\) on heating with ammonium salts

#### 6.1.3 Addition of aqueous sodium carbonate

* Sodium carbonate solution is usually used to precipitate insoluble carbonates from solutions of metallic salts.
* In the presence of high charge density cations, effervescence of CO\({}_{2}\) will be observed (see
* Due to hydrolysis, it can also act as base to produce hydroxide ions in solution. CO\({}_{3}\)\({}^{2-}\) + H\({}_{2}\)O \(\Longleftarrow\) HCO\({}_{3}\)\({}^{-}\) + OH\({}^{-}\)

* Why is CO\({}_{2}\) gas produced when Na\({}_{2}\)CO\({}_{3}\) (aq) is added to a solution of AI\({}^{3+}\) ions?

* Due to the **smaller cation size** and a **larger positive charge**, and hence a **higher charge density** of AI\({}^{3+}\) (high polarising power), it is able to polarise the O-H bonds of the neighbouring water molecules, thereby producing H\({}^{+}\) in the solution. [AI(H\({}_{2}\)O)\({}_{6}\)]\({}^{3+}\) (aq) \(\Rightarrow\) [AI(H\({}_{2}\)O)\({}_{5}\)(OH)]\({}^{2+}\) (aq) + H\({}^{+}\)(aq) 2H\({}^{+}\) (aq) + CO\({}_{3}\)\({}^{2-}\) (aq) \(\rightarrow\) CO\({}_{2}\) (g) + H\({}_{2}\)O (_l_)

Note: AI\({}_{2}\)(CO\({}_{3}\))\({}_{3}\) (s) is not produced. A similar explanation can be used for Fe\({}^{3+}\) and Cr\({}^{3+}\) ions.

**Re-precipitation of silver halides**

Silver chloride can be re-precipitated from the diammine silver(I) complex by the dropwise addition of dilute nitric acid.

## 7 Separation of Ions

This section is concerned with how to separate ions in a given mixture of ions. Separation of ions is based on the different solubilities of compounds in different reagents. You will have to be familiar with the different reactions of cations and anions with the common reagents described in **Section 6**.

### Example (given a mixture of Zn\({}^{2+}\) and Cu\({}^{2+}\))

Zn\({}^{2+}\) reacts with NaOH to form Zn(OH)\({}_{2}\) (white ppt) which dissolves in excess NaOH to give a soluble complex Zn(OH)\({}_{4}\)- (colourless solution). On the other hand, Cu\({}^{2+}\) reacts with NaOH to form Cu(OH)\({}_{2}\) (pale blue ppt) which is insoluble in excess NaOH.

Since the two hydroxides formed dissolve in excess NaOH to different extent, by filtering the insoluble hydroxide, we can separate the ions from each other.

Recovery of the dissolved Zn\({}^{2+}\) ions can be effected by adding another reagent to re-precipitate the hydroxide.

## 9 Test for Gases

* **[See experiment 13]**
* Gases or vapours liberated during **dry heating** or by the **addition of reagents such as acids or alkalis** should first be detected according to their colour, odour and action on damp litmus paper. They should then be identified using chemical tests.
* Quantity of substance to use, unless otherwise specified:
* Solid: at least 2 to 3 spatula OR enough to cover the bottom hemisphere of boiling tube
* Amount of limewater to test for CO\({}_{2}\): about 1/3 length of a test-tube
* Prepare the necessary reagent/ apparatus **beforehand** and conduct the test as follows:

\begin{tabular}{|p{142.3pt}|p{142.3pt}|p{142.3pt}|} \hline

### Colour of halogens

\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|c|} \hline
**halogen** & **colour of element** & **colour in aqueous** & **colour in hexane** \\  & & **solution** & \\ \hline chlorine, C\(l_{2}\) & greenish yellow gas & pale yellow & pale yellow \\ \hline bromine, Br\({}_{2}\) & reddish brown gas / liquid & orange & orange-red \\ \hline iodine, I\({}_{2}\) & black solid / purple gas & brown & purple \\ \hline \end{tabular}

In organic reactions and other reactions, a test for halogens is sometimes carried out as follows.

\begin{tabular}{|l|c|} \hline
**Test** & **Observation for positive test** \\ \hline To a test-tube containing 1 cm\({}^{3}\) of the sample, add a few drops of organic solvent (e.g. hexane) and shake. & The organic layer turns from colourless to (colour of halogen). \\ \hline \end{tabular}

## 10 Heating

### Technique

* Close the air hole of the bunsen burner when lighting the flame. Once the flame is on, adjust the air hole to give a non-luminous flame. Normal heating is usually done with a bunsen flame in which the air hole of the burner is half opened.
* Get ready the materials needed to test for gas liberated before carrying out the heating.

When heating a solid,

* Use a clean and dry test tube / boiling tube.
* Hold the tube in an almost horizontal position.
* Apply heat gently initially (to remove any water of crystallisation present) and then strongly until no further change takes place.
* Be careful not to heat till the solid decomposes.
* Test for gas (if any) liberated. This would indicate the presence of a certain anion. The following sequence can be used:

1. use damp red and blue litmus papers. [to test for acidic gases or NH\({}_{3}\) (g)]

2. double gas through another test-tube containing limewater (aqueous calcium hydroxide) [to test for CO\({}_{2}\) (g)]

3. use glowing splint [to test for O\({}_{2}\) (g)]

### Observations and Deductions

* Most solids undergo changes when heated. These changes often provide a clue to the cation and/or anion present in the solid.

**presence of** & **observation of residue** \\ \hline Zn\({}^{2+}\) & yellow when hot, white when cold \\ \hline Cu\({}^{2+}\), Mn\({}^{2+}\), Ni\({}^{2+}\) & black residue from blue/ green substances \\ \hline Fe\({}^{2+}\), Fe\({}^{3+}\) & brown \\ \hline Cr\({}^{3+}\) & green \\ \hline
