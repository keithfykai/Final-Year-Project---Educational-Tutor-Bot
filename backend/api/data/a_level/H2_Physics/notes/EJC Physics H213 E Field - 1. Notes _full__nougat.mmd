**9749(2020) H2 Physics**

(within the same diagram) electric field strength is stronger where electric field lines are closer together weaker where electric field lines are further away from each other

_3 isolated point charges are shown above. X and Y are both positively charged. X has less charge than Y. Y and Z have equal magnitude of electric charges of opposite polarities. Individually, the electric fields weaken with increasing distance from the charges._

_Two positive charges of same magnitude._

_A point positive charge and a negatively-charged flat plate. The electric field lines reach the flat plate at right-angles._

_Two identical parallel plates of opposite charge. The strength of the uniform electric field in-between is stronger when the plates are closer to each other._

**13.3 Electric Field Strength**

**Electric field strength \(E\)**

at a point in the field is

**[type of force]** electric force

**[ratio]** _per_ unit positive charge

The units of \(E\) is: [N C\({}^{-1}\)] or [V m\({}^{-1}\)].

Electric field strength is a vector quantity and therefore undergoes vector addition.

The two basic geometries for electric field are (i) radial electric field due to an isolated point charge and (ii) a uniform electric field in-between oppositely-charged parallel plates.

electric field strength of a point charge

in free space or air:

\[E=\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_{0}}\left(\frac{Q}{r^{2}}\right)\]

electric field strength of uniform electric field

in free space or air:

\[E=\frac{\Delta V}{d}\]

(\(\Delta V:\) potential difference, \(V_{*}-V_{-}\))

The electric force \(F_{E}\) experienced by an electric charge \(q\) at a point in an electric field \(E\) where \(E\) is the resultant electric field strength at that point.

This is analogous to placing a mass \(m\) inside a gravitational field of field strength \(g\), \(F_{g}=mg\).

**13.4.1 Coulomb's Law**

Coulomb's Law states that the

**[type of force ]** electric force between two point charges is

**[magnitude]** directly proportional to product of the two charges and inversely proportional to the square of separation

between the two chargesThe direction of the electric force acts along the line joining the two point charges.

The electric force can be attractive between unlike charges, or repulsive between like charges (in comparison to gravitational force which can only be attractive).

By Newton's 3\({}^{\alpha}\) Law, the electric force that \(Q_{1}\) exerts on \(Q_{2}\) is equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to the electric force that \(Q_{2}\) exerts on \(Q_{1}\) i.e. \(\vec{F}_{\alpha_{0}\alpha_{0}}=-\vec{F}_{\alpha_{0}\alpha_{0}}\)

\(\varepsilon_{0}\) is a constant known as the permittivity of free space (vacuum) or air at \(8.85\times 10^{-12}\) C\({}^{2}\) N\({}^{+}\) m \({}^{-2}\).

By reference to electric field fields, for a point outside a spherical conductor, the charge on the sphere seems to act as a point charge at its centre because the

electric field lines are perpendicular to the surface of sphere, radial pattern make field lines appear to originate from centre of sphere 

**Example 1**

By considering electric field strength and Coulomb's Law, provide the expression describing the electric field strength generated by a single point charge.

**Solution:**

By Coulomb's Law:

\[F_{e}=\frac{Q_{1}Q_{2}}{4\pi\varepsilon_{0}r^{2}}\]

Recall that electric field strength is the electric force per unit positive charge experienced by a small stationary positive test charge at that point.

The field strength due to \(Q_{1}\) is:

\[E =\frac{F}{Q_{2}}\]

**Note:** similar to gravitational field strength, electric field strength due to a point charge follows an inverse square law, \(E\propto\frac{1}{r^{2}}\)

(\(F\) is the electric force experienced by \(Q_{2}\) due to the electric field set up by \(Q_{1}\))

**Example 2**

A hydrogen atom consists of an electron (\(m_{e}\) = 9.11 x 10\({}^{31}\) kg) orbiting around a nucleus of 1 proton (\(m_{p}\) = 1.67 x 10\({}^{27}\) kg). 1 electronic charge of a proton or electron is \(\pm\)1.6 x 10\({}^{-19}\) C. Find the ratio of the electrical force to the gravitational force between the proton and electron.

**Solution:**

By Newton's Law of Gravitation:

\[F_{g}=\frac{Gm_{e}m_{p}}{r^{2}}\]

By Coulomb's Law:

\[F_{e}=\frac{1}{4\pi\varepsilon_{0}}\frac{q_{e}^{2}}{r^{2}}\]

**Example 3**

The radius of a hydrogen atom can be estimated by the radius of orbit of the lone electron. Calculate the velocity of the electron (of mass \(m_{e}=9.11\times 10^{-31}\) kg) if the radius is about 25 pm.

**Solution:**

Electric force of attraction provides the centripetal force that keeps electron in circular motion: By Coulomb's Law:

\[F_{e} =\frac{1}{4\pi c_{0}}\frac{q_{e}^{2}}{r^{2}}=\frac{m_{e}\nu^{2}}{r}\] \[\nu =q_{e}\sqrt{\frac{1}{4\pi c_{0}m_{e}r}}\] \[=(1.6\times 10^{-19})\sqrt{\frac{1}{4\pi(8.85\times 10^{-12})(9.11 \times 10^{-31})(25\times 10^{-12})}}\] \[=3.2\times 10^{6}\text{ m s}^{-1}\]

**Example 4**: Two charges \(q_{i}\) and \(q_{z}\), of \(-6.0\) nC and \(3.0\) nC respectively, are arranged as shown.

(i): Calculate the magnitude and direction of the electric field strength at O. (ii): Hence calculate the force experienced by a \(-5.0\) nC charge placed at O the origin and state its direction.

**Solution:**

(i) Let \(E_{i}\) be the electric field due to the \(-6.0\) nC charge.

Let \(E_{2}\) be the electric field due to the \(3.0\) nC charge.

By Coulomb's Law:

\[E_{i} =\frac{q_{i}}{4\pi\varepsilon_{0}r^{2}}=\frac{6.0\times 10^{-9}}{4\pi \left(8.85\times 10^{-12}\right)\left(0.300^{2}\right)}=599\text{ N C}^{-1}\text{ to right}\] \[E_{2} =\frac{q_{2}}{4\pi\varepsilon_{0}r^{2}}=\frac{3.0\times 10^{-9}}{4 \pi\left(8.85\times 10^{-12}\right)\left(0.100^{2}\right)}=2698\text{ N C}^{-1}\text{ to top}\] \[\left|E_{\text{resultant}}\right| =\sqrt{E_{1}^{2}+E_{2}^{2}}=\sqrt{599^{2}+2698^{2}}=2764\approx 2 760\text{ N C}^{-1}\] \[\tan\theta =\frac{E_{2}}{E_{1}}\] \[\theta =\tan^{-1}\left(\frac{2698}{599}\right)=77.5^{\circ}\] \[\text{anticlockwise from positive x-axis}\] \[F =qE_{\text{resultant}}=\left(-5.0\times 10^{-9}\right)\left(2764 \right)=1.34\times 10^{-5}\text{ N}\]

directed \(180^{\circ}-77.5^{\circ}=102.5^{\circ}\) clockwise from positive x-axis (i.e. opposite direction from electric field line)

**13.4.2 Electric Field Due to 2 or more Charged Particles**

We perform vector addition to find the resultant electric field \(E_{\text{resultant}}\) at a point if the field is set up by multiple charged particles. The force acting on an _additional_ charged particle that is later placed inside that field at a point is \(F=q_{\text{additional}}E_{\text{resultant}}\).

**13.4.3 Point Charges vs Conducting Shells**

Electric charges are redistributed in a conductor to achieve electrostatic equilibrium i.e. the charges do not move at equilibrium. If a conductor has a net electric charge, then the net excess charges will be positioned furthest away from each other / spread out as far as possible:

electric charges in a conductor always reside entirely on the conductor's surface
Since the electric field inside a conducting surface must be zero, a thin metallic shell effectively shields its inside from external fields.

A Faraday's Cage (cover photo) shields its contents from external fields. Cables carrying digital data are often shielded against stray EM waves from corrupting the signals. This is why our mobile connection may be cut when entering a lift.

Figure 11: Explain why the electric field strength inside a thin conducting sphere is zero.

between charged parallel plates, the electric field strength is uniform at every point in the region:

\[E=\frac{\Delta V}{d}\]

We assume the separation between the plates, \(d\), to be small compared to the dimensions of the plate. More accurate diagrams may choose to include "fringing of the electric field", where the field lines bend outward at the edge of the charged parallel plates.

As the electric field strength is uniform, the force experienced by a charged particle inside the uniform electric field is uniform, and therefore the charged particle exhibits constant acceleration. We can use the kinematics equations to analyse motion of charged particles inside a uniform electric field.

#### Motion Porallel to Uniform Electric Field

**Example 5a**

2 plates placed 10.0 cm apart have potential values of +750 V and +150 V. Calculate

a) the electric field between the plates, and

b) the acceleration experienced by a Ca\({}^{2+}\) ion (40 g mol\({}^{1-}\)) placed in between the plates.

**Solution:**

a) electric field strength:

\[E =\frac{\Delta V}{d}\]

By Newton's 2\({}^{\text{nd}}\) Law: \(F=ma\)

\[qE =ma\to a=\frac{(2q_{o})E}{m_{\text{Ca}}}\] \[=6000\text{ V m}^{-1}\]

\[=2.9\times 10^{10}\text{ m s}^{-2}\]

**Example 5b**

An electron beam enters a uniform electric field between a pair of parallel charged plates near the plate of lower potential as shown.

(i) Show that the magnitude of acceleration experienced by an electron is given by \(\dfrac{4.4\times 10^{13}}{d}\).

(ii) Find the expression, in terms of \(u_{{}_{x}}\) and \(d\), for the maximum length \(L\) such that the electrons do not collide with the upper plate.

**Solution:**

\[\begin{split}\text{vertical acceleration }\mathfrak{a}_{y}& =\dfrac{qE}{m}=\dfrac{q_{e}}{m_{e}}\dfrac{\Delta V}{d}\\ &=\dfrac{1.6\times 10^{-19}}{9.11\times 10^{-31}}\dfrac{\left(400 -150\right)}{d}\\ &=\dfrac{4.4\times 10^{13}}{d}\\ & S_{y}=u_{y}t+\dfrac{1}{2}\mathfrak{a}_{y}t^{2}=0+\dfrac{1}{2} \mathfrak{a}_{y}t^{2}\\ \text{time of flight inside field }t&=\sqrt{\dfrac{2S_{y}}{ \mathfrak{a}_{y}}}=\sqrt{\dfrac{2d}{\mathfrak{a}_{y}}}\\ & L_{\text{max}}=u_{x}t=u_{x}\sqrt{\dfrac{2d}{\mathfrak{a}_{y}}} \\ &=u_{x}\sqrt{2d\bigg{(}\dfrac{d}{4.4\times 10^{13}}\bigg{)}}\\ &=\left(2.13\times 10^{-7}\right)u_{x}d\end{split}\]

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:12]

The potential at a point outside a spherical charged conductor (of radius \(R\), carrying charge \(Q\)) has the same form as that due to a point charge of the same charge.

#### 13.5.2 Electric Potential Energy of a System of 2 Point Charges

For an electric field generated by point charge \(Q_{1}\), the electric potential energy \(U\) of the system when another charge \(Q_{2}\) is brought from infinity to a distance \(r\) away from the centre of \(Q_{1}\):

\(U=Q_{2}V_{\text{\tiny{dee to }Q_{2}}}=Q_{2}\Bigg{(}\dfrac{1}{4\pi\varepsilon_{0}} \dfrac{Q_{1}}{r}\Bigg{)}\)\(Q_{1}\)\(r\)\(Q_{2}\)electric potential energy stored between two isolated point charges \(U=\dfrac{Q_{1}Q_{2}}{4\pi\varepsilon_{0}r}\)

Charges \(Q_{1}\) and \(Q_{2}\) should be substituted together with their electrical polarities (+ or -).

**Example 6**:
1. A spherical conductor of radius 25 cm carries a charge of +6.0 \(\mu\)C. Calculate the
2. electric potential at a point X, 25 cm from the surface of the sphere, \[V_{x}=\dfrac{1}{4\pi\varepsilon_{0}}\dfrac{Q}{r}=\dfrac{+6.0\times 10^{-6}}{4\pi( 8.85\times 10^{-12})[(25+25)\times 10^{-2}]}=1.08\times 10^{5}\ \text{V}\]
3. electric potential at a point Y, 50 cm from the surface of the sphere, \[V_{\gamma}=\dfrac{1}{4\pi\varepsilon_{0}}\dfrac{Q}{r}=\dfrac{+6.0\times 10^{-6}} {4\pi(8.85\times 10^{-12})[(25+50)\times 10^{-2}]}=7.19\times 10^{4}\ \text{V}\]
4. change in potential energy of a +10 \(\mu\)C in moving from point X to point Y, \[\Delta U=q\Delta V=q\big{(}V_{\text{\tiny{final}}}-V_{\text{\tiny{final}}} \big{)}=q\big{(}V_{\gamma}-V_{\text{\tiny{X}}}\big{)}=\big{(}+10\times 10^{-6} \big{)}(7.19\times 10^{4}-1.08\times 10^{5})=-0.361\ \text{J}\]
5. the change in potential energy of a -10 \(\mu\)C in moving from point Y to point X. \[\Delta U=q\Delta V=q\big{(}V_{\text{\tiny{final}}}-V_{\text{\tiny{final}}} \big{)}=q\big{(}V_{\gamma}-V_{\text{\tiny{X}}}\big{)}=\big{(}-10\times 10^{-6} \big{)}(7.19\times 10^{4}-1.08\times 10^{5})=+0.361\ \text{J}\]
6. the change in potential energy of a -10 \(\mu\)C in moving from point Y to point X. \[\Delta U=q\Delta V=q\big{(}V_{\text{\tiny{final}}}-V_{\text{\tiny{final}}} \big{)}=q\big{(}V_{X}-V_{\text{\tiny{Y}}}\big{)}=\big{(}-10\times 10^{-6} \big{)}(1.08\times 10^{5}-7.19\times 10^{4})=-0.361\ \text{J}\]

#### 13.5.3 Electric Potential of a System of Multiple Point Charges

Electric potential is a scalar quantity. The total electric potential at a point \(V_{\text{total}}\) due to 3 point charges \(Q_{1},\ Q_{2}\) and \(Q_{3}\) is the scalar sum of electric potential \(V_{1},\ V_{2}\)_and_\(V_{3}\) at that point, due to the individual charges \(Q_{1},\ Q_{2}\)_and_\(Q_{3}\).

#### 13.5.4 Electric Potential Energy of a System of Multiple Point Charges

The electric potential energy of a charge \(q\) placed at a point due to multiple point charges can be found by the product of \(q\) and the scalar sum of electric potential \(V_{\text{total}}\) at that point.

\[\begin{split} U_{\text{total}}&=qV_{\text{total}} \\ &=q\big{(}V_{1}+V_{2}+V_{3}\big{)}\\ &=q\bigg{(}\frac{1}{4\pi\varepsilon_{0}}\bigg{)}\bigg{(}\frac{Q_ {1}}{r_{1}}+\frac{Q_{2}}{r_{2}}+\frac{Q_{3}}{r_{3}}\bigg{)}\end{split}\]

**Example 7**: Consider the set up in Example 4 where there are two charges \(q_{i}\) and \(q_{2}\), of \(-6.0\) nC and \(3.0\) nC respectively. Determine the (i) electric potential at \(O\), (ii) electric potential energy that a \(-5.0\) nC charge has when placed at \(O\), (iii) work done in bringing a charge of \(-5.0\) nC from \(O\) to infinity.

**Solution:**

\[\begin{split}\text{(i)}\ V_{\text{total}}&=\frac{q _{1}}{4\pi\varepsilon_{0}r_{1}}+\frac{q_{2}}{4\pi\varepsilon_{0}r_{2}}\\ &=\frac{-6.0\times 10^{-9}}{4\pi\Big{(}8.85\times 10^{-12}\Big{)}(0.30 0)}+\frac{3.0\times 10^{-9}}{4\pi\Big{(}8.85\times 10^{-12}\Big{)}(0.100)}\\ &=89.9\ \text{V}\end{split}\]

\[\begin{split}\text{(ii)}\ U&=qV\\ &=\Big{(}-5.0\times 10^{-9}\Big{)}(89.9)\\ &=-4.50\times 10^{-7}\ \text{J}\end{split}\]

\[\begin{split}\text{(iii) work done to bring to infinity}&=-\big{(}\text{ work done to bring FROM infinity}\big{)}\\ &=-U\\ &=4.50\times 10^{-7}\ \text{J}\end{split}\]13.5.5 explains in detail how the shape and critical values of the above curves are obtained.

### Equipotential Lines

For 3D geometries, there would be equipotential surfaces as opposed to equipotential lines for 2D geometries. No work is done when a (external) charge is moved along an equipotential line or surface. In the following diagrams, equipotential lines are shown as dotted lines. In particular for the pair of charged parallel plates, the (non-ideal case) field fring is shown here.
