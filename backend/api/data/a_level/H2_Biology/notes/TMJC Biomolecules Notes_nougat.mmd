## Topic Synopsis

Core Idea 1: The Cell & Biomolecules of Life - entails the study of cells, which are the basic units of life.

The following questions should help you frame your learning:

How are the structures of biomolecules related to their functions?

How do cells regulate the movement of substances into and out of themselves; and what are the implications of such movements?

_Biomolecules make up cells and cells regulate the movement of substances into and out of themselves and cellular processes through membranes_

The different classes of biomolecules (sugars, lipids, proteins and nucleic acids) function as molecular building blocks for macromolecules to be assembled. Nucleic acids, which include DNA and RNA, are made from monomers known as nucleotides. Phospholipids, cholesterol, carbohydrates and proteins are important components in biological membranes.

Cells need to regulate the movement of substances into and out of themselves. Substances such as water, oxygen, glucose, minerals are important in the synthesis of new molecules and important cellular processes. According to the fluid mosaic model, cell membranes are selectively permeable due to the nature of the phospholipids and proteins from which they are made. The movement of different molecules depends on the nature of the substances through transport processes such as osmosis, diffusion and active transport. Membranes allow cells to create and maintain internal environments that are different from external environments.

_Proteins, which are class of biomolecules, play a significant role in cells_

Proteins play a variety of roles in cells including structural, transport, enzymatic and signalling functions. They are essential for biological processes and functions, such as chemiosmosis, protein synthesis, cell signalling, immunology and blood glucose homeostasis. Protein structure can be affected by temperature and pH. Enzymes are an important group of proteins that control many biological reactions. The functions of these proteins will be revisited in other core ideas.

## Learning Outcomes

**Core Idea 1B: Biomolecules of Life and Cellular Transport**

_This concept focuses on how the structures of biomolecules give rise to properties that allow these biomolecules to carry out their functions. One of these functions involves regulating transport of substances into and out of the cell. This regulation is afforded by the properties of the cell membrane, which comprise phospholipids and proteins. Regulation of the movements is important for several biochemical processes to occur._

**g)**: Describe the structure and properties of the following monomers:

**i)**: \(\alpha\)-glucose and \(\beta\)-glucose (in carbohydrates)
**ii)**: glycerol and fatty acids (in lipids)

**Core Idea 2A: The Structure of Nucleic Acids and Gene Expression**

_The structure of DNA was proposed by Watson and Crick in 1953. With an understanding of DNA structure, experimental evidence supported the proposal that DNA replicates in a semi-conservative manner. The central dogma states that genetic information is encoded in the DNA and transferred to the mRNA during transcription. In addition to mRNA transcription, tRNA and rRNA are transcribed; tRNA is needed during translation while rRNA is a component of ribosomes. In eukaryotic transcription, pre-mRNA is synthesised and then processed to produce mature mRNA. Subsequently, through translation, the information on the mRNA is used to synthesise polypeptides, which are folded into functional proteins_

**a)**: Describe the structure and roles of DNA and RNA (tfRNA, rRNA and mRNA). (Mitochondrial DNA is not required)

**Core Idea 1C: Proteins**

_Proteins play a variety of roles in structural, transport, enzymatic and signalling functions. This concept focuses on the structure and properties of proteins and how temperature and pH may contribute to denaturation of proteins. The structure of a protein is related to its function._

**m)**: Explain primary structure, secondary structure, tertiary structure and quaternary structure of proteins, and describe the types of bonds that hold the molecule in shape (hydrogen, ionic, disulfide bonds and hydrophobic interactions).
**n)**: Explain the effects of temperature and pH on protein structure.
**o)**: Describe the molecular structure of the following proteins and explain how the structure of each protein relates to the function it plays:

**q)**: Investigate and explain the effects of temperature, pH, enzyme concentration and substrate concentration on the rate of an enzyme-catalysed reaction by measuring rates of formation of products (e.g. measuring gas produced using catalase) or rate of disappearance of substrate (e.g. using amylase, starch and iodine).
**r)**: Describe the structure of competitive and non-competitive inhibitors with reference to the binding sites of the inhibitor.
**s)**: Explain the effects of competitive and non-competitive inhibitors (including allosteric inhibitors) on the rate of enzyme activity.

## 1 Introduction

### Overview of the biomolecules of life

This topic gives an overview of the various biological molecules you will encounter in the 'A' Level syllabus.

* Living matter consists mainly of carbon, hydrogen, oxygen and nitrogen, with smaller amounts of sulfur and phosphorus. These elements all form strong covalent bonds, an essential characteristic in the architecture of complex organic molecules. Of all these elements, carbon is central to the organic molecules of life. The formation of four covalent bonds per carbon molecule with other atoms makes possible the great diversity of organic molecules. This forms the foundation of life at the molecular level.
* There are four main classes of biological molecules: (i) Carbondyrates (Section 2) (ii) Lipids (Section 3) (iii) Nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) (Section 4) (iv) Proteins (Section 5)
* Let us look at various properties of molecules first.

### Basic Biochemistry

* **Charged molecule/particle (ion) -** An atom or molecule that has gained or lost one or more electrons, thus giving the molecule a net positive or negative charge (Fig. 1).
* **Ionic bond -** A chemical bond resulting from the attraction between oppositely **charged** ions (Fig. 2).

Figure 2: An example of ionic bond (between sodium and chlorine).

### 1.3 Water

* Water is the most abundant and important molecule in cells and tissues.
* Water has many functions:
* Solvent for almost all other compounds in the cell (e.g. urea, proteins) by forming hydrogen bonds with polar groups or charges of many cellular constituents.
* Reactant or product in thousands of different biochemical reactions (e.g. synthesis of proteins and ATP).
* Important determinant of the biological structures of lipid bilayers, folded proteins, and macromolecules, which are all influenced by the aqueous environment they reside in.

### 1.4 Macromolecules of life

* The macromolecules of life are polymers built from monomers.
* carbohydrates, proteins and nucleic acids are chain-like molecules called **polymers** (from the Greek _polys_, many, and _meros_, part).
* A polymer is a long molecule consisting of many **identical or similar building blocks** linked by **covalent** bonds.
* The repeating units that serve as the building blocks of a polymer are called **monomers** (from the Greek _monos_, single) (or sometimes referred to as '**residues'). Some of the molecules that serve as monomers also have other functions of their own (e.g. glucose, amino acids).
* The Synthesis and Breakdown of Polymers (carbohydrates, lipids, proteins).
* Although each class of polymer is made up of a different type of monomer, the chemical reactions by which cells make or break down polymers are similar. These reactions are usually catalysed by **enzymes**.
* Monomers are covalently bonded to each other, with the **loss of a water molecule**, by a **condensation** reaction: One monomer contributes a hydroxyl group (-OH), while the other provides a hydrogen (-H). This reaction is repeated as monomers are added (Fig. 1.9).

Figure 1.9: Condensation reaction in the synthesis of a polymer* Polymers are disassembled to monomers by _**hydrolysis** _("hydro" = water, "lysis" = to break)_ where the bond between monomers is broken by the **addition of a water molecule** (Fig. 1.10).
* Biomolecules such as glucose can function as energy sources as **chemical energy** is **stored** in the **C-H and C-C bonds**. Energy is released when these bonds are broken by reactions e.g. hydrolysis.
* An example of hydrolysis and condensation reactions in our body is shown in Fig. 1.11.

In the study of biological molecules, you will need to take note of the following:

* The **type of monomers**.
* The type of chemical **bonds that hold the monomers** together.
* **Other bonds** that holds the molecule in its three-dimensional configuration.
* How the **structure** of the polymer is related to its **property** which affects its biological **function(s)**. ["S > P > F"]
* Knowledge of **where** these macromolecules are assembled.
* What type of **enzymes** are involved in these reactions.

Fig. 1.11: Most of the organic material in the food we consume is in the form of polymers that are too large to be absorbed into our cells. In the digestive tract, various enzymes digest the polymers _via_ hydrolysis reactions. The released monomers are then absorbed into the blood stream for distribution to all cells. The cells can then use condensation reactions to reassemble the monomers into new and different types of polymers that can perform specific functions required by the cell.

Fig. 1.10: Hydrolysis reaction.

## Chapter 2 Carbohydrates

### 2.1 Monosaccharides

* Monosaccharides (from the Greek _sacchar_, sugar) are **single sugar units**.
* Consist of elements C, H and O. The general formula of monosaccharides is **(CH\({}_{2}\)O)**.
* They are classified according to the **number of carbon atoms** such as trioses (3C), tetroses (4C), pentoses (5C), hexoses (6C) and heptoses (7C). Of these, pentoses and hexoses are the most common.
* The most common monosaccharide is glucose, which is of central importance in the chemistry of life as it serves as the _primary_ energy source for respiration.

#### Glucose

* **Structure of glucose** (**C\({}_{6}\)H\({}_{12}\)O\({}_{6}\)**) is a **hexose** sugar. Glucose can exist in **linear** and **ring** forms (Fig. 2.1).
* Depending on how the ring closes, glucose can exist as \(\alpha\)-glucose or \(\beta\)-glucose ring structures (isomers) (Fig. 2.2). This difference in position of the hydroxyl groups has important implications when they polymerise to form different polysaccharides (_Section 2.4_).

For **\(\alpha\)-glucose**, the **hydroxyl group (-OH)** of **carbon one (C1)** lies **below** the ring.

For **\(\beta\)-glucose**, the **-OH group** of **carbon one (C1)** lies **above** the ring.

Figure 2.1: Linear and ring forms of glucose. In glucose the first carbon atom (C1) forms a covalent bond with the oxygen atom on carbon number five (C5) to give a six-membered ring, known as a pyranose ring. The hydroxyl group attached to carbon atom five is oxidised. This result in carbon atom number six sticking out of the ring.

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:17]

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:18]

### 2.3 Polysaccharides

* Many monosaccharides combine by **condensation** reactions to give a **polysaccharide** linked by **glycosidic bonds**.
* General formula is (C6H10O5)n where n = variable number of monosaccharide molecules linked together in the polysaccharides.
* The chains produced can be **branched** or **unbranched**.
* The chains may be **folded (cailed)**, thus making them **compact** and ideal for storage.
* The **large size** of the molecules make them **insoluble in water**, making them ideal as a storage or structural molecule as they **do not affect the water potential** of the cell and do not easily diffuse out of the cell.
* Upon **hydrolysis**, polysaccharides can be converted to their constituent monosaccharides ready for use in respiration.

### 2.4 Examples of polysaccharides

Based on the functions, polysaccharides can be divided into:

* Storage polysaccharides
* serve as storage material, hydrolys as needed to provide sugar for the cells
* Structural polysaccharides
* serve as building material for structures that protect the cell or the whole organism

#### 2.4.1 Starch (storage polysaccharide)

* **Starch** is found in most parts of the **plant** in the form of small **granules** (Fig. 2.6). They are visible in plant cells, notably in the **chloroplasts of leaves**, in storage organs such as potato tubers, and in seeds of legumes and cereals.

Figure 2.6: Part of a plant cell with a chloroplast, where starch granules can be found.

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:20]

## 23 Starch (Structure)

Figure 2.8: Comparison between structure of amylose and amylopectin.

#### Glycogen (storage polysaccharide)

* **Glycogen** is **stored** as free compact **granules** (Fig. 2.9) in liver and skeletal muscles (usually in close proximity to the smooth endoplasmic reticulum) in **animals**.
* **Glycogen** functions to store excess glucose when blood glucose levels are high, and serves as a ready source of glucose for tissues in the body when blood glucose level decreases.
* **For the lodine test, the result is similar to that of amylopectin, i.e. reddish brown.**

**GLYCOGEN (STRUCTURE)**

* **A single glycogen polymer consists of approximately 54,000** \(\underline{\alpha}\)**-glucose monomers.**
* **Bonds between monomers are** \(\underline{\alpha}\)**-1,4 glycosidic bonds, which cause the polymer to twist into a helix. This helical structure is stabilised by hydrogen bonds between glucose molecules (similar to amylose and amylopectin).**
* **In addition, glycogen also has** \(\underline{\alpha}\)**-1,6 glycosidic bonds**, which gives branch points every 10-20 residues making a multi-branched, compact polymer. Glycogen is similar to amylopectin but more highly branched and is thus heavier and more compact (Fig. 2.10).**
* **Glycogen is relatively more soluble than amylopectin due to more branches in glycogen than in amylopectin.**

**Figure 2.10: The glycosidic bonds in glycogen.**

_Note that the \(\alpha\)-1,4 glycosidic bonds make an angle of 109\({}^{\circ}\)between two C-O bonds to give a helical shape._

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:23]

#### Cellulose (structural polysaccharide)

* It is a **component of cell wall in plants** and it is not easily broken down. The cell wall comprises many cellulose molecules in its entire structure.
* It functions to provide support and mechanical strength in addition to maintaining the cell shape.

## 2 Structure of Cellulose

* A single cellulose polymer consists of approximately 10,000 **g-glucose** monomers.
* In \(\beta\)-glucose, the -OH group is above the ring at C1. Hence in order to form a bond with C4 of another \(\beta\)-glucose, one glucose molecule must be **rotated 180\({}^{\circ}\)** and is upside down relative to the adjacent molecule. This gives a **g-1.4 glycosidic bond** (Fig. 11) and forms a **straight** cellulose chain.

## Chapter 3 Lipids

* Lipids are the one class of biological molecules that does not include true polymers, and they are generally not big enough to be considered macromolecules. They are a large and diverse group of naturally occurring organic compounds that are grouped together due to their general **insolubility in water** and **solubility in nonpolar organic solvents** (e.g. ether, chloroform, acetone and benzene).
* Consist of only **C, H and O**, with no generalised formula. Characterised by low O, high H (e.g. C\({}_{5}\)H\({}_{1}\)COOH).
* Lipids consist mostly of non-polar hydrocarbon (C-H) regions, which accounts for their solubility behaviour.
* **Ethanol emulsion test** on lipids will give rise to a **cloudy white suspension** (Fig. 3.1).

### 3.1 Classification of Lipids

* Lipids are varied in form and function. They can be generally classified into: (1) Simple lipids (2) Compound lipids (3) Steroids and sterols (1) Simple lipids
* Triglycerides (Fats and Oils)
* Formed from **fatty acids*
* that are joined to a **glycerol*
* molecule. At 20\({}^{\circ}\)C, solid state lipids are referred to "fats" while liquid state lipids are referred to "oils".
* Formed from **fatty acids*
* that are joined to **high-molecular weight alcohols**, e.g. waxes in cuticles of leaves.
* Compound lipids (lipid and non-lipid component)
* Formed from joining **fatty acids*
* and **one phosphate group*
* to a **glycerol*
* molecule. Non-lipid component is the **phosphate group**.
* (details covered in Section 6.1)
* Formed from joining **fatty acids*
* and a **carbohydrate chain*
* to a **glycerol*
* molecule. Non-lipid component is the **carbohydrate.

Figure 3.1: Lipids give a cloudy white suspension with the ethanol emulsion test.

(3) Steroids

\(\circ\) Lipids characterised by a **carbon skeleton consisting of 4 interconnected rings**. Examples of steroids: testosterone (Fig. 3.2) and cholesterol (Fig. 3.7).

### 3.2 Functions of Lipids

* Lipids serve as a good source of **energy**.
* They are also an important part of a healthy diet in the form of fat-soluble vitamins and essential fatty acids.
* Lipids also act as **insulating material** in the subcutaneous tissues and are also seen around certain organs.
* Lipids combined with proteins are **important constituents** of the cell membranes and mitochondria of the cell.

### 3.3 Examples of Lipids

#### 3.3.1 Triglycerides

* Triglycerides are the commonest lipids in nature. They are generally called **fats** (solid at 20\({}^{\circ}\)C) or **oils** (liquid at 20\({}^{\circ}\)C).
* The structure consists of a **glycerol** and **three fatty acid chains** (Fig. 3.3).
* **Glycerol** (C\({}_{3}\)H\({}_{5}\)O\({}_{3}\)): An alcohol with three carbons, each bearing a **hydroxyl group (-OH)**.
* **Fatty acid**: A **hydrocarbon chain** of varying number of carbon atoms (represented by R), with a **carboxyl group (COOH)** at one end of the molecule.
* The enzyme-catalysed **condensation reaction** between the **fatty acids** and the **glycerol** results in the formation of three **ester bonds** in a triglyceride molecule.

Figure 3.3: The condensation reaction between one glycerol and three fatty acids (may or may not be the same) gives rise to a triacy/glycerol/triglyceride/fat molecules and three water molecules.

Other functions:

Triglycerides are less dense than water, so they allow marine mammals (e.g. whales) to be **buoyant**.

Triglycerides are poor conductor of heat, so they provide **thermal insulation** / prevent excessive heat loss for aquatic animals and animals living in cold climates (e.g. whales and polar bears).

Triglycerides are important for **mechanical protection** as it surrounds delicate organs (e.g. heart and kidneys).

Triglycerides are a **long-term energy store** as it is oxidised only after carbohydrates are depleted. This is important in hibernating animals living in cold climates.

Triglycerides **reduce water loss** from the external surfaces of plants (cuticle) and animals (sebum).

If triglycerides are not soluble in water, suggest a possible solvent.

Q1) The diagram below shows a micelle, a structure formed by phospholipids in aqueous solution. Why do phospholipids form such a structure in aqueous solution?

Q2) How would phospholipid molecules respond differently when placed in a hydrophobic solution? (You may _sketch your answer!_)

#### Cholesterol

* Cholesterol is a **steroid** found in **cell membranes** of animals and transported in the blood plasma of animals.
* Cholesterol consists of a hydrocarbon chain, a ring structure region with 4 hydrocarbon rings and a hydroxyl group (Fig. 3.7). It has both **polar** (due to presence of -OH group) and **non-polar** properties (due to the hydrophobic hydrocarbon chain and steroid ring structure) and is considered an **amphipathic** molecule.
* In an aqueous environment, the hydrophilic hydroxyl group would interact with the aqueous environment, while the hydrophobic hydrocarbon chain and steroid ring structure would be shielded away from the aqueous environment and interact with other non-polar groups.

### Relating Structure to Function (Cholesterol)

Cholesterol is **amphipathic**, as it has both hydrophilic (OH group) and (largely) hydrophobic (steroid ring structure and hydrocarbon chains) groups, which allow cholesterol to:

* Regulate membrane fluidity (details covered in Section 6.1.3).
* OH group of cholesterol is **polar*
* and thus is able to **interact with*
* the **phosphate groups*
* of phospholipids.
* **Steroid ring structure and hydrocarbon chain** are **non-polar** **(hydrophobic)** and thus are able to interact with the **hydrophobic fatty acid chains** of phospholipids.
* Aid in the formation of bile salts.
* As a precursor molecule for the synthesis of Vitamin D, steroid hormones (e.g. estrogen, testosterone) and the hormones of the adrenal cortex.

### Formation of a Polynucleotide by Phosphodiester Bond

* Many **free nucleoside triphosphates** join together to form a **polynucleotide** by a **condensation reaction** which occurs between the **5' phosphate group** of one free nucleoside triphosphate and the **hydroxyl group** (-OH) of the **3' carbon** of the previous nucleotide, forming **a phosphodiester bond**, which is a strong covalent bond (Fig. 4.6). Pyrophosphate (PPi) and water are released.

* _Note that the direction of the reaction and attachment of nucleotides occurs only in the 5' to 3' direction (i.e. free nucleoside triphosphates are added only to the 3' end of the elongating chain)_

* This bonding of several nucleotides creates a **sugar-phosphate backbone** consisting of alternating sugar and phosphate groups with the bases projecting sideways from the sugars (Fig. 4.7).

* The **5' end** of a polynucleotide ends with a **phosphate group** attached to carbon atom 5 of the pentose sugar.

* The **3' end** of a polynucleotide ends with a **free hydroxyl group** on carbon atom 3 of the pentose sugar.

* The conventional way to write **nucleic acid sequences** is in the **5' to 3' direction**, for example: 5' AGGTTACCT 3'.

* The stability and integrity of the double helix is maintained by:
* **Hydrogen bonds*
* between the **complementary bases**.
* **Hydrophobic interactions*
* between the **stacked bases**.
* Strong covalent **phosphodiester bonds*
* between **adjacent deoxyribonucleotides**.
* The double helix measures **2 nm** or **20 A** in **diameter**, equal to the width of one purine (A,G) complementary base-paired with one pyrimidine (C,T) (Fig. 4.10 and 4.11). [Note: A represents the Angstrom unit. 1 A = 0.1 nm = 1 x 10\({}^{\text{-10}}\) m]
* **Each complete turn** of the helix is **3.4nm** or **34 A**, consisting of **10 base pairs per turn** in a double helix (Fig. 4.10, centre).
* In any segment of the molecule, alternating larger **major grooves** and smaller **minor grooves** are present along the axis (Fig. 4.10, right). **Proteins** can interact specifically with the exposed atoms in these grooves.
* **Function** of DNA: stores genetic information in the form of genes, which are unique sequences of deoxyribonucleotides that code for rRNA, tRNA and mRNA sequences. mRNA is then used to synthesise proteins, which carry out many cellular processes.
* DNA is also able to make more copies of itself _(Topic: DNA replication)_ via complementary base pairing, without the loss of genetic information.

**Discovery of the DNA Structure**

(Source: [http://www.dnai.org](http://www.dnai.org) and www.nature.com)

James Watson and Francis Crick are given credit for developing the three-dimensional structural model of DNA used today. The stunning find made possible the era of "new biology" that led to the biotechnology industry and, most recently, the deciphering of the human genetic blueprint. However, they were not the first to discover DNA, or the first to ask the question, "How is hereditary information carried from one generation to the next?"

Throughout history, our understanding of science changes as small modifications are made to what is known. Each discovery makes it possible for the next step in our understanding of scientific concepts to occur. The Watson and Crick model of DNA structure would not have happened without previous contributions by other scientists:

**Friedrich Miescher -** In 1869, Swiss Chemist Miescher first isolated nuclein (DNA and its protein scaffold) from white blood cells. The term "nuclein" was later changed to "nucleic acid" and eventually to "deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)".

**Phoebus Levene -** In 1919, Russian Biochemist Levene was the first to discover the order of the three major components of a single nucleotide (phosphate-sugar-base), and the carbohydrate component of DNA (deoxyribose) and RNA (ribose).

**Oswald Avery -** In 1944, Canadian-American physician Avery and his colleagues identified that hereditary units, or genes, are composed of DNA ("the transforming principle").

**Edwin Chargaff -** In 1950, Austrian Biochemist Chargaff discovered that in all DNA, the amount of adenine (A) is usually similar to the amount of Thymine (T), and the amount of guanine (G) usually approximates the amount of cytosine (C). In other words, the total amount of purines (A+T) and the total amount of pyrimidines (C+T) are usually nearly equal. This discovery is later known as "Chargaff's rule".

**Rosalind Franklin and Maurice Wilkins -** In 1952, English researchers Franklin's and Wilkins' X-ray crystallography work (using X-ray diffraction to beam X-ray through DNA which yielded a shadow picture of the molecule's structure) provided key information to the structure and dimensions of DNA: DNA's phosphate groups are on the outside of the molecule, DNA could be a helical structure, and DNA has a uniform diameter along the length of the molecule (2nm).

**James Watson and Francis Crick -** In 1953, American Biologist Watson and English Physicist Crick used available information (e.g. Chargaff's rule, X-ray data) and model building technique (e.g. using known molecular distances and bond angles) to decipher the three-dimensional structure of DNA. Using cardboard cut-outs representing the individual components of the four bases and other nucleotide subunits, Watson and Crick shifted molecules around until the complementary bases fit together perfectly, with each pair held by hydrogen bonds (based on the location of hydrogen atoms).

### 4.4 Macromolecular Structure of Ribonucleic Acid (RNA)

Polynucleotides of RNA are structurally similar to DNA, except that RNA is usually **single-stranded**.

Basic unit of each RNA polynucleotide: **ribonucleotides**.

Similar to DNA, RNA nucleotides are bonded together via **5'-3' phosphodiester linkages** to form **polynucleotides**.

Other than in some RNA viruses where the genetic material is double-stranded RNA, **RNA polynucleotides do not associate** to form a double-stranded helix.

Some RNA polynucleotides e.g. tRNA and rRNA form **intra-molecular** hydrogen bonds between complementary bases (**A with U** and **G with C**) within one strand to form a 3D structure.

There are mainly **three** types of RNA structures, each with different functions.

#### 4.4.1 Types of RNA: mRNA, tRNA, rRNA

* _Details of mRNA function will be covered in Topic 5 on Gene Expression_
* mRNA is a **single stranded** polyribonucleotide, containing the information **transcribed** from DNA (Fig. 4.12).
* **Function**: mRNA acts as a messenger that transfers genetic messages encoded in DNA from the nucleus to the ribosomes. It acts as a **template** for **translation** (protein synthesis).

* Bases are read in triplets known as **codons**. Each **codon** codes for an **amino acid** (Fig. 4.13).

Figure 4.12: The Central Dogma of Molecular Biology. The mRNA conveys information from the DNA, acting as a template for the synthesis of proteins.

Figure 4.13: Each mRNA codon codes for an amino acid.

**Transfer RNA (tRNA)** - _Details of tRNA function will be covered in Topic 5 on Gene Expression_
* Usually a single strand of RNA made up of ~70 to 90 ribonucleotides.
* tRNA has a specific sequence that allows folding of the single RNA strand unto itself by forming hydrogen bonds between complementary bases.
* Due to complementary base pairing occurring in some regions, 'hair-pin loops' form.
* Forms a '**clover leaf structure'** (Fig. 4.14(a)).

**Function**: tRNA **transfers** specific **amino acids** from the cytoplasmic pool of amino acid to a ribosome during **translation of proteins**.
* It has dual recognition sites (Fig. 4.14a-c) for its involvement in the **protein synthesis** process:

**(i) Amino acid attachment site**

The triplet CCA is always the site at the **3' end** of a tRNA.

**Function**: Site where amino acid is attached to the tRNA by an enzyme.

**(ii) Anticodon site**

Composed of 3 nucleotides.

Each **anticodon** is **complementary** to a **corresponding codon** on the **mRNA** template.

**Function**: allows the correct sequence of amino acids to be added to a growing polypeptide chain.

**Fig. 4.14: **(a)** Intramolecular H-bonds in tRNA that maintain its 3D structure. **(b)** 3D depiction of how tRNA folds.

**(c)** Simplest depiction of tRNA.

- Details of rRNA function will be covered in Topic 5 on Gene expression**
* rRNA, together with proteins, are the **components of ribosomes**.
* The assembly of **proteins*
* and **rRNA*
* **80S ribosomes in eukaryotic cells**. Each ribosome comprises a **40S small subunit*
* and a **60S large subunit*
* (Fig. 4.15).
* ribosomes can be found in **prokaryotic*
* cells. Each ribosome comprises a **30S small subunits*
* and a **50S large subunit**.
* The rRNA molecule folds into a 3D structure via **intramolecular H-bonding between bases A=U, C=G*
* (Fig. 4.16).
* **Functions of rRNA**:
* During translation, rRNA acts as an enzyme (ribozyme) providing **peptidyl transferase activity to catalyse the formation of peptide bonds*
* between the amino acids.
* It has a structural role in helping to **orientate the ribosomal proteins into the correct position*
* within the ribosome.
* rRNA from the large and small subunit interact, aiding in the **binding of the two subunits*
* during translation.
* the **interaction*
* between **mRNA*
* and **tRNA**.

## 5 Proteins

* A protein consists of **one or more polypeptide(s)** typically folded into a **globular** structure or forming a **fibrous** structure (Fig. 5.1), facilitating a specific **biological function**.

* A polypeptide is a single linear polymer chain of amino acids held together by **peptide bonds**.

* The **Biuret test** conducted on proteins will cause the biuret reagent to turn from **blue to violet**. This is due to the presence of peptide bonds (Fig. 5.2).

* Many proteins are **enzymes** that **catalyse biochemical reactions** and are vital to metabolism.

* Proteins also have **structural** or **mechanical** functions, such as actin and myosin in muscle and the proteins in the cytoskeleton, which form a system of scaffolding that **maintains cell shape**.

* Other proteins are important in **cell signalling**, **immune responses**, **cell adhesion**, and the **cell cycle**.

**Fig.5.4:** The 20 amino acids that are encoded by the genetic code, classified by their R groups/side chains.

Note that the amino acids are depicted in the ionised form, the way they usually exist at the pH found in a cell.

The R side chain may be as simple as a hydrogen atom (glycine) or it may be a carbon skeleton with various functional groups attached (e.g. glutamine).

(*Note: You are not required to remember the chemical formulae of each amino acid side chain.)

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:59]

#### Disulfide bonds

* Disulfide bonds are **strong**, **covalent bonds** formed from oxidation of **sulfhydryl** (-SH) groups on the **R groups** of two **cysteine** amino acids (Fig. 5.6).
* These disulfide bonds can be broken by reducing agents (e.g. urea), even though they are the strongest of all the chemical bonds.

#### Ionic bonds

* Ionic bonds are **strong bonds** which are formed between **ionised / charged** amine (NH3*) and carboxylic groups (COO) present in **R groups** of amino acids (Fig. 5.7).
* Ionic bonds are formed at a suitable pH but can be broken if pH changes _(details will be covered in Enzymes lecture)_.

With reference to Fig 5.4, state one possible pair of amino acids that can form ionic bonds with each other. The first example is given.

Figure 5.7: An ionic bond formed between the R groups of aspartic acid and lysine.

Figure 5.6: (Left) The formation of a disulfide bridge between two cysteine residues.

(Right) The disulfide bridges between cysteine residues spaced throughout the polypeptide help to stabilise the polypeptide into a globular 3D structure.

#### Hydrophobic interactions

* As a polypeptide folds into its 3-dimentional shape, amino acids with **hydrophobic R groups** usually end up clustered at the core of the protein so that they are shielded from contact with the aqueous environment. These R groups form **hydrophobic interactions** with each other.
* Hence, in the aqueous cytoplasm of cells, many proteins assume a globular shape with their hydrophobic R groups located in the core region and the hydrophilic R groups (polar and charged) on the exterior surface to form hydrogen bonds with water molecules (Fig. 5.8).

#### Hydrogen bonds

* Hydrogen bonds are formed between polar groups.
* In proteins, **hydrogen atoms in amine (-NH) groups or hydroxyl (-OH) groups** form hydrogen bonds with **oxygen atoms in hydroxyl groups** (Fig. 5.9).
* Hydrogen bonds can stabilise the secondary structure and tertiary structure of proteins. **a. Secondary structure**: hydrogen bonds are formed between **C=O and N-H groups within the polypeptide backbone**. **b. Tertiary structure**: hydrogen bonds are formed between the **R-groups** of amino acids
* These bonds are **numerous** and stabilise the structure even though they are very **weak** on their own.

Figure 5.9: Hydrogen bonding formed between the side chains of two serine residues.

Figure 5.8: Hydrophobic R groups tend to cluster into the core of the protein, away from the aqueous cytosolic environment in the cell. Hydrophilic R groups project out of the protein and interact with water.

d. **Quaternary structure**
* Proteins with quaternary structure are highly complex and consist of an aggregation of **two or more extensively coiled polypeptide chains** held together by combinations of **disulfide bonds**, **ionic bonds**, **hydrogen bonds** and **hydrophobic interactions** between the **R groups of amino acids**. For example, **haemoglobin** has **four** polypeptide chains linked by various bonds (Fig. 5.17a).
* Tertiary and quaternary structures are important because the **conformation** of the protein when **folded** is responsible for the biological activity of the protein.

Read through _Section 5.3_. Complete the table below summarising the type(s) of chemical bonds that are involved in maintaining the four levels of protein structure. The first example is given.

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|} \hline
**Level of Protein** & **Type(s) of chemical bonds involved in** & **Number of polypeptide** \\
**Structure** & **maintaining the structure** & **chain(s)** \\ \hline Primary & \multicolumn{2}{|c|}{**Peotide bonds between amino acids**} & 1 \\ \hline Secondary & \multicolumn{2}{|c|}{} \\ \hline Tertiary & \multicolumn{2}{|c|}{} \\ \hline Quaternary & \multicolumn{2}{|c|}{} \\ \hline \end{tabular}

Heat/chemical denaturation can alter the structure of proteins. Why?

### Examples of Proteins

* Nearly every dynamic function of a living being depends on proteins. Some proteins (enzymes) speed up chemical reactions (_Section 5.5_), while others play a role in storage, transport, cellular communication, movement or structural support.
* A human has tens of thousands of different proteins, each with a unique **three dimensional structure** that **determines its specific function**.
* Based on the shape of molecule, proteins can be classified into globular proteins or fibrous proteins. The differences between them are shown in the following table:

#### Haemoglobin (Globular protein, Transport function)

* An example of a **globular protein** with a **quaternary** structure is haemoglobin.
* It is the red, oxygen-carrying pigment found in the cytoplasm of red blood cells.
* Haemoglobin consists of **four*
* separate polypeptide chains (Fig. 5.17a):
* Two **\(\alpha\)-chains*
* (each chain a specific sequence of 141 amino acids).
* Two **\(\beta\)-chains*
* (each chain a specific sequence of 146 amino acids).

* **Note:** The \(\beta\)-chain does not refer to \(\beta\)-pleated sheets. It is just so named.
* Each polypeptide chain is first coiled into **\(\alpha\)-helices** (**secondary structure**). The \(\alpha\)-helices are in turn folded into the **tertiary structure** to yield a spherical **globular** protein that has a specific conformation that is held by **hydrogen bonds, ionic bonds** and **hydrophobic interactions** between **R groups** (tertiary structure).
* Amino acids with **hydrophobic** side-chains point inwards, holding the molecule in its correct three-dimensional shape. Amino acids with **hydrophilic** side-chains point outwards so that it is soluble in aqueous medium and hence a good transport protein for oxygen in blood.
* The four polypeptide chains are linked together by **ionic bonds**, **hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions** between **R groups** (**quaternary structure**) (Fig. 5.17).

(**"Note: Haemoglobin does not have disulfide bonds** in its structure.)
* **Each chain** carries a prosthetic (non-proteinaceous) **haem** group (Fig. 5.17a).
* The haem group contains **Fe2+** which can **bind reversibly to a molecule of oxygen** and hence enhance the release of oxygen in metabolically active tissues such as muscle.
* Each haemoglobin molecule can bind **four** oxygen molecules since it has four haem groups.
* Collectively, the 4 polypeptides and their haem groups form a **specific conformation**, which allows it to carry out its function--to bind to oxygen molecules.

#### Collagen (Fibrous protein, Structural function)

* Collagen (Fig. 5.19) is a **fibrous** protein with a **quaternary** structure. It has **no tertiary structure**.
* Collagen is a protein found in skin, tendons, cartilage, bones, teeth and connective tissue of blood vessels to provide support for these structures.

#### Formation of tropocollagen

* Tropocollagen is the basic functional unit of collagen.
* A **tropocollagen** molecule consists of **three polypeptide chains** wound around each other to give a **triple helix** (Fig. 5.20).
* **Each collagen polypeptide chain** consists of about 1000 amino acid residues and is in the shape of a **loosely wound** left-handed **helix (NOT an \(\alpha\)-helix).**
* hydroxyproline and hydroxylysine. Hydroxylation of proline and lysine occurs in the rough endoplasmic reticulum.

- X, or \(\circ\)**Glycine
- Hydroxyproline** where X is any other amino acids except glycine (Fig. 5.21)
* The presence of **glycine** (R group is only a hydrogen atom) at **every third amino acid within each polypeptide chain** allows **close packing** of the triple helix to form a **tight coil** (Fig. 5.21).
* Because of their high content of glycine, proline, and hydroxyproline, collagen fibres are incapable of forming traditional secondary structures such as \(\alpha\)-helices and \(\beta\)-sheets. Instead, collagen polypeptides intertwine to form the unique triple helix, with each of the three strands arranged in a helical fashion.
* The three strands in the triple helix are linked together by **hydrogen bonds** formed between **peptide N-H group** of glycine and **peptide C=O group** (within the polypeptide backbone) of other amino acids on the other chains.

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:76]

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:77]

Formation and Assembly of collagen fibre in the cell (Fig. 5.24) - FYI (Recall: secretory pathway)

1. Synthesis of collagen polypeptides occurs at the **ribosomes** on the **rough endoplasmic reticulum.**
2. The collagen polypeptide is then threaded into the **rough endoplasmic reticulum lumen** where the loose winding of polypeptide and hydroxylation (adding of OH groups) of selected prolines and lysines occur. Some glycosylation (addition of saccharides) of selected hydroxylysines occur.
3. ER vesicles carrying the polypeptide bud off from the ER and travel towards the **Golgi apparatus** where glycosylation of selected hydroxylysines occur (most glycosylation occurs in the Golgi Apparatus).
4. Further assembly of 3 collagen polypeptides forms procollagen. Glycine molecule at every 3\({}^{\text{\tiny{ac}}}\) amino acid residue allows close packing of the molecule. This molecule is eventually packaged into a **secretory vesicle** which buds off from the Golgi apparatus.
5. The secretory vesicle moves towards the **cell surface membrane** and fuses with it (exocytosis).
6. Procollagen is thus secreted into the extracellular matrix.
7. At the extracellular matrix, polypeptides are cleaved to remove the N and C terminals to form tropocollagen.
8. Tropocollagen self-assemble into fibrils via cross-linking between lysine and/or hydroxylysine residues and overlapping of staggered ends.
9. Aggregation of collagen fibrils into bundles forms collagen fibres.

#### 5.4.3 G-protein linked receptor (Globular Protein, Signalling function)

_This will be covered in greater depth in Topic 12 on Communication._

* A G-protein linked receptor (GPLR) (Fig. 5.25a) consists of a **single polypeptide*
* that is folded into a **globular shape*
* and embedded in a cell's plasma membrane.
* GPLR is able to form **hydrophobic interactions*
* with the phospholipid bilayer as it contains large numbers of non-polar amino acids.
* It is a **plasma membrane protein receptor*
* with **seven \(\alpha\)-helices*
* spanning the cell membrane and specific loops between the helices that form **binding sites*
* for (Fig. 5.25a):
* **Extracellular ligand/signal molecule*
* **Intracellular G-protein*
* (a trimeric protein)
* G-protein linked receptor proteins are all remarkably similar in structure. However, these receptors vary in the binding sites for their signalling molecules and also for different types of G proteins inside the cell.
* This is due to specific amino acids that form the binding sites on different GPLR.
* G-protein linked receptors are a large family of cell surface receptors that respond to a variety of external signals. When an external signalling molecule binds to a receptor, it causes a conformational change in the receptor. This change then triggers the interaction between the receptor and a nearby G protein (Fig. 5.25b). G-protein linked receptor-based signalling systems are extremely widespread and diverse in their functions, including roles in embryonic development and sensory reception (_linked to the topic of "Cell Signalling"_).

Figure 5.25c: Structure of the G-protein-linked receptor

### Enzymes

* One of the key features to the success of life on Earth was the development and the complexity of enzymes.
* Enzymes allowed **biochemical reactions** in most cells to **take place speedily** and **within a modest temperature range** (i.e. \(0-50\)\({}^{\circ}\)C). A few organisms (mainly bacteria) exist in extreme conditions outside this range.
* Enzymes act as **highly specific biological catalysts** that **speed up the rate of metabolic reactions**. (\(\Rightarrow\)**Function: Catalysis**)
* Enzymes often **work consecutively to catalyse a chain of reactions**. In such a chain, the **product of one enzyme-catalysed reaction** becomes the **substrate** for the **next enzyme in the sequence**, and so on. Hence, enzymes of a cell play a part in the **control of metabolic pathways**. (\(\Rightarrow\)**Function: Regulation**)

#### 5.5.1 Metabolic reactions and pathways in a cell

* **Metabolism** is the term to describe all the chemical reactions occurring in living organisms.
* A metabolic pathway begins with a specific molecule, which is then altered in a series of **defined steps**, resulting in a certain product. A specific enzyme (Fig.5.26) catalyses each step of the pathway.
* Metabolic reactions are not performed in a single reaction. Instead, a **series of chemical reactions** constitute a metabolic pathway. Each reaction produces an **intermediate**, which is then used as a **substrate** for the next reaction, until the desired product is produced.
* Metabolic reactions occur in **small steps*
* Large catabolic reactions would create unfavourable conditions, such as production of excessive heat, which is detrimental to the cells.
* Energy derived from small catabolic reactions can be used more efficiently.
* Substances can be partially broken down to provide raw materials for other reactions.
* It allows the cell to **control*
* the **rate of reactions*
* and products made.
* A living system's **free energy** is energy that can do work under cellular conditions. The change in free energy (\(\Delta\)G) during a biological process is related directly to enthalpy change (\(\Delta\)H) and to the change in entropy (\(\Delta\)S): \(\Delta\)G=\(\Delta\)H-\(\Delta\)S.

Figure 5.26: A metabolic pathway comprising multiple smaller reactions* **Two types*
* of metabolic reactions/pathways occur within the cell (Fig. 5.27 & 5.28): 1. **Catabolic reactions/pathways >*
* involved in the **breakdown*
* of complex compounds into simpler molecules.
* Such reactions **generally release energy*
* and are involved with using food stores and making energy available in cells.
* These reactions are called exergonic reactions, and the products have less free energy than the reactants (-\(\Delta\)G). 2. **Analobic reactions/pathways >*
* involved in the **synthesis*
* of complex compounds from simple molecules.
* Such reactions **generally require energy*
* and are involved in the building up of structures, storage compounds and complex metabolites in the cell.
* These reactions are called endergonic reactions, and they require an input of energy (+\(\Delta\)G).
* The substrate binds to the enzyme active site.
* The substrate binds to the enzyme active site.
* The substrate molecules are released to allow the enzyme to work again.
* The substrate molecules are released to allow the enzyme to work again.
* **Catabolic reactions*
* Some enzymes can cause two substrate molecules to bind to the enzyme active site.
* Chemical bonds are formed, causing the two substrate molecule to form bonds and become a single molecule. **Examples:**_protein synthesis_

Figure 5.27: Catabolic (left) and anabolic (right) reactions.

### Activation energy

* During chemical reactions between molecules, chemical bonds are either broken or formed.
* However, before bonds are broken, reactant molecules must first absorb energy from its surroundings to contort to an unstable transition state, after which they can then form products. This initial investment of energy for starting a reaction is the **activation energy**.
* **Activation energy** is the **initial energy barrier that needs to be overcome** to start a chemical reaction to form products (Fig.5.29).
* Activation energy is the difference between the maximum energy (where reactants are at their transition state) and the energy of the reactants.
* This energy barrier can be overcome by heating, but...
* High temperature would denature proteins and kill the cells.
* Heat will speed up all reactions, not just those that are needed.
* Enzymes can overcome the energy barrier.
* Enzymes lower the activation energy of chemical reactions (Fig.5.30) without denaturing proteins and killing the cells, thus
* Speeding up the rate of reaction of any **specific*

#### What are enzymes?

_Key Concept:_

Enzymes are biological catalysts, which speed up the rate of chemical reactions by lowering the activation energy.

**Properties of Enzymes**

* Enzymes speed up the rate of chemical reactions.
* by lowering the activation energy (_Section 5.5.1_)
* They are **highly specific**.
* The **specific 3D conformation of the enzyme*
* defines the **specific shape of its active site*
* which acts on specific substrate.
* Specific **shape of the active site*
* is **complementary to the shape of the substrate**
* They **remain chemically unchanged*
* at the end of the reaction and can be **reused**.
* Hence, enzymes are only **required in small quantities**.
* Most enzymes are **globular proteins**.
* However, some RNA molecules have enzymatic activity and are known as **ribozymes**.
* E.g. peptidyl transferase found in ribosomes, which functions to form peptide bonds between adjacent amino acids during translation (_refer to Gene expression_) is made up of rRNA.

**Structural features of an enzyme molecule**

* Enzymes are **large globular proteins** with **tertiary** (Fig. 5.31 left) and/or **quaternary** (Fig. 5.31 right) structures.

* Enzymes are **macromolecules** with **specific overall 3-dimensional conformations**.

_What determines the specific 3-dimensional conformation of the enzyme?_

Figure 5.31: Enzymes with tertiary structure (Left) and quaternary structure (Right)* A small portion of enzyme (about 3-12 amino acids) makes up the **active site**. The active site has **specific shape** that is **complementary to the shape of its substrate molecule**.
* The **active site** consists of **contact** and **catalytic residues** (Fig. 5.32), which are directly involved in enzyme action.
* Koshland (1963) suggested that an enzyme consists of essentially 4 categories of amino acids.

1. **Catalytic residues (catalytic site)** - these **make** and **break chemical bonds within the substrate(s) to form products.
2. **Contact residues (binding site)** - these **recognise and bind** with the substrate and **hold the substrate in place** while catalysis is taking place. Take note: * The **catalytic** and **contact residues** together form its **active site**. * Active site is always found in a **cleft** or crevice in the **enzyme structure**. * The active site determines the **catalytic properties** and **specificity** of an enzyme.
3. **Structural residues** - these hold the active site in the correct shape so that it can function properly.
4. **Non-essential residues** - these have no specific function. They are often near the surface of an enzyme and can be removed or replaced without loss of function.

* The **structural** and **non-essential residues maintain the specific globular structure** of the enzyme via **hydrogen bonds, ionic bonds, disulfide bonds and hydrophobic interactions between the R groups** of amino acids in the enzyme.

#### Mode of action of enzymes

* **Mechanism of enzyme action**

**Key Concept:**

* The specificity of enzyme action can be described using the _lock and key hypothesis_ and the _induced fit hypothesis_.
* **Substrate binds at the active site** of the **enzyme** and forms the **enzyme**-substrate complex.
* R groups of the amino acids, at the active site, **lower the activation energy barrier**.

* The specificity of enzyme action can be described using the **1) lock and key hypothesis** and **2) Induced fit hypothesis**.

**Lock and key hypothesis** (Fig. 5.34)

* First proposed by Emil Fischer in 1894.
* According to the hypothesis, the enzyme molecule has a fixed structure. The **specific substrate** molecule has a **shape that is complementary to the specific shape of the active site** of the enzyme and **fits exactly** into the active site.
* The substrate is imagined as the 'key', whose shape is complementary to the enzyme, which is the 'lock'.
* **Effective collision** of specific substrate (key) and active site of enzyme (lock) at their **correct orientation** forms the **enzyme**-substrate complex**. This complex is **stabilised by ionic and hydrogen bonds** between the **contact residues** of the enzyme and substrate molecule.
* **Catalytic residues** catalyse the reaction by **acting on specific bonds within the substrate** to form products.

* The R-groups of the catalytic residues are positioned in such a way that enables them to interact with and act on the bonds within the substrate molecules (Fig. 5.33).
* Regions of the substrate molecule where bonds are to be broken or formed are positioned exactly with the catalytic R-groups at the active site of the enzymes.
* The hydrogen and ionic bonds between the substrate and catalytic R-groups weaken the bonds within the substrate, causing the bonds within the substrate to break.
* This lowers the activation energy barrier for the reaction to proceed. (Fig. 5.35)

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:87]

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:88]

### (b)How enzymes lower the activation energy of a reaction

* Enzymes are able to lower the activation energy of the reaction when they (_Fig. 5.37_):
* Hold their substrates in an arrangement that forces and **maintains the precise orientation of the substrates*
* at the **active site*
* for the anabolic/catabolic reaction to occur.
* The precise orientation of the substrate in the active site of the enzyme ensures that the bonds are **exposed to the catalytic residues**.
* **Stress/Strain the bonds*
* within the substrates to **distort the substrate molecules*
* (for catabolic reactions).
* This increases the likelihood of breaking the bonds
* **Increase the substrate reactivity*
* for anabolic/catabolic reactions.
* When the R-groups of the amino acids of the enzyme are in close proximity to part of the substrate, they can:
* **Change the charges*
* of the **substrate*
* **Alter the distribution of the electrons within the bonds*
* of the substrate
* Cause other chemical changes**.
* Provide a **favourable microenvironment*
* for catalysis. For example, hydrophobic amino acids create a water-free zone in which non-polar reactants may react more easily.

#### Measuring the rate of an enzyme-catalysed reaction

**Key Concept:**

The rate of an enzyme-catalysed reaction can be determined by the rate of formation of products or the rate of disappearance/change of substrate.

In a reaction with fixed conditions and fixed substrate and enzyme concentrations, the rate of reaction is the greatest initially. As the reaction progresses with time, the rate of reaction will slow down and eventually reach zero when all the substrates are changed into products (Fig. 39).

* Consider this reaction: A + B + C + D
* As the reaction progresses, the concentration of products C and D will increase, while the concentration of substrates A and B will decrease.
* The rate of an enzymatic reaction can therefore be determined by

1. **rate of formation of products** OR
2. **rate of disappearance/change of substrate**

_To calculate rate of reaction:_

**Rate of reaction = amount of reactant used or amount of product formed Time taken**

Figure 39: The rate of reaction as time progresses in a chemical reaction

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:92]

* Example of how rate of formation of oxygen can be measured by volume of oxygen gas produced over fixed period of time. (Fig. 5.40)

#### Factors affecting the rate of enzymatic reaction

When a biochemical reaction is affected by more than one factor, the **rate is limited by the factor that is nearest to its minimum value**. This factor is known as the **limiting factor**.

Any change in the concentration of the limiting factor will directly affect the rate of the biochemical reaction.

Rate of enzymatic reaction can be affected by **substrate concentration, enzyme concentration, pH and temperature.**

DO YOU KNOW?

In any experiment, one variable is usually changed to find out how it affects another variable, while keeping all the **other variables constant**.

The **variable that is changed** is commonly referred to as the **independent variable** which is plotted on the **x-axis**.

The **variable that is measured** as a result of the independent variable is referred to as the **dependent variable** which is plotted on the **y-axis**.

#### (a) Effects of substrate concentration (Fig. 5.42)

*** To study the effect of substrate concentration on enzyme activity, all other factors are assumed to be constant (fixed enzyme concentration, constant pH and temperature).***

* As **substrate concentration increases**, the **rate of enzymatic reaction*
* increases proportionally [Fig. 5.42 section (a)]
* _The frequency of effective collisions between enzyme and substrate molecules increases_.
* _This results in an increase in rate of formation of enzyme-substrate complexes and hence increases the rate of products formed_.
* _The rate of reaction is limited by **substrate concentration**_ hence, substrate concentration is the **limiting factor**.
* _As substrate concentration increases beyond a point, the **rate of reaction**_ will _plateau at maximum rate of reaction_ (\(V_{max}\)) [Fig. 5.42 section (b)], where
* _All active sites of all enzyme molecules are saturated with substrate molecules_.
* _Any free substrate molecules will have to wait until the product is released before it can bind to the active site_.
* _The rate of reaction is now limited by **enzyme concentration*
* i.e. enzyme concentration is the limiting factor_.

Figure 5.42: Graph for effect of substrate concentration on rate of reaction

#### (b)Effects of enzyme concentration (Fig. 5.43)

*** To study the effect of enzyme concentration on enzyme activity, **all other factors are assumed to be constant (fixed substrate concentration, constant pH and temperature).***

* As **enzyme concentration increases**, the **rate of enzymatic reaction increases proportionally [Fig.5.43 section (a)]
* _The frequency of effective collisions between enzyme and substrate molecules increases_.
* _This results in an increase in rate of formation of enzyme-substrate complexes and hence increases in rate of products formed._
* _The rate of reaction is limited by **enzyme concentration*
* i.e. enzyme concentration is the limiting factor_.
* As _enzyme concentration increases beyond a point_, the **rate of reaction*
* will _plateau at_ the **maximum rate of reaction (Vmax)*
* [Fig. 5.36 section (b)], where
* _All available substrates_ are _now bound to active sites_ on _enzymes_.
* _Any further increase in enzyme concentration would not result in an increase in the rate of reaction._
* _The rate of reaction is now limited by **substrate concentration*
* i.e. substrate concentration is the limiting factor_.
* If there is **unlimited supply of substrates**, the rate of reaction will continue to increase [Fig. 5.43 section (c)].

Fig. 5.43: Graph for effect of enzyme concentration on rate of reaction

### (c) Effects of pH (Fig. 5.44)

\({}^{***}\) To study the effect of pH on enzyme activity, **all other factors are assumed to be constant (fixed substrate concentration, fixed enzyme concentration and constant temperature). \({}^{***}\)**

* V\({}_{\text{max}}\)** occurs [Fig.5.44 section (a)] * _At this optimum pH, the **bonds which maintain the secondary and tertiary structures** of the enzymes are **inact**. * _The conformation of the active site is **most ideal** for substrate binding. * _Hence the **greatest number of enzyme-substrate complexes** is **formed per unit time**. Rate of reaction is at its maximum.
* If the pH deviates from the optimum, enzyme activity decreases drastically [Fig.5.44 section (b)]
* _At pH higher or lower than optimum pH, the concentration of hydrogen (H\({}^{+}\)) and hydroxide (OH) ions in the solution would **change**. This results in reduced enzymatic activity as there is:_ 1. Change in **enzyme structure*
* due to **neutralisation*
* of the **charged/polar R-groups*
* of amino acids **in the enzyme*
* _This disrupts the ionic and hydrogen bonds maintaining the secondary, tertiary and/or quaternary structure of the enzyme_.
* The **specific conformation*
* of enzyme is disrupted.
* This results in the **loss of the specific shape of the active site*
* and result in less effective substrate binding.
* Less effective formation of enzyme-substrate complexes and hence, less products are formed per unit time.

Figure 5.44: Graph for rate of enzyme-catalysed reaction across a pH range

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:100]

* At **very low temperature**, the **rate of enzyme reaction*
* is **very low**. [Fig.5.46 section (a)]
* _The kinetic energy of both substrate and enzyme molecules is low, leading to a low frequency of effective collision between substrate and enzyme molecules_.
* _This results in a low /reduced rate of formation of enzyme-substrate complexes, and hence low rate of product formation_.
* _The enzymes are inactivated but can regain its catalytic ability when temperature is increased._
* As **temperature increases**, the **rate of reaction increases gradually*
* till it reaches the optimum temperature (\(\mathbf{V_{max}}\)). [Fig.5.46 section (b)]
* _There is an increase in kinetic energy of both enzyme and substrate molecules_.
* _This leads to an increase in frequency of effective collision between enzyme and substrate molecules_.
* _Rate of formation of enzyme-substrate complexes increases, hence increased rate of product formation._
* As **optimum temperature**, rate of reaction is at **its maximum*
* (\(\mathbf{V_{max}}\)). [Fig.5.46 section (c)]
* _Is kinetic energy of both enzyme and substrate molecules maximum at optimum temperature?_

Figure 5.46: Effect of temperature on enzyme activity

* **Beyond optimum temperature**, the rate of reaction decreases steeply/sharply. [Fig.5.46 section (d)]
* _The excess heat increases the kinetic energy of the molecules even further, leading to disruption of hydrogen bond, ionic bond and hydrophobic interactions holding the secondary and tertiary structures of the enzymes._
* _The enzyme loses its specific 3D conformation, and hence loses the specific shape of the active site. The enzyme is denatured._
* _The shape of the active site is no longer complementary to the substrate, hence, rate of formation of enzyme-substrate complex decreases, decreasing the rate of product formed._
* **Each enzyme has its own optimum temperature at which maximum rate of reaction (Vmax) occurs. (Fig. 5.47)
* The effect of temperature on the rate of enzymatic reaction is expressed as the temperature coefficient, Q10.
* _\[Q_{10}=\frac{Rate\ of\ reaction\ at\ (x+10)^{\circ}C}{Rate\ of\ reaction\ at\ x^{\circ}C}\]_
* For most enzymes, the Q10 value is approximately 2. This means that **the rate of reaction doubles for every 10\({}^{\circ}\)C increase in temperature**. This Q10 value = 2 is only applicable to the temperature range below the optimum temperature.

Figure 5.47: Optimum temperature for two enzymes

#### Enzyme cofactors

* Many enzymes require **non-protein** components called **cofactors** for efficient catalytic activity. Cofactors may vary from simple inorganic ions to complex organic molecules.
* A catalytically active complex comprising the **enzyme and its cofactor** is known as a **holoenzyme**. The inactive enzyme that is not associated with its cofactor is known as **apoenzyme**. (Fig. 5.48)
* Cofactor may be bound to the enzyme tightly and permanently, or loosely and reversibly to the active site, or **allosteric site**.
* There are three types of cofactors:
* **Inorganic ions*
* (enzyme activators)
* They function to **mould the active site*
* of the enzyme **into shape*
* complementary to shape of substrate to **facilitate the formation of enzyme-substrate complex**, thereby increasing the rate of reaction catalysed by that particular enzyme (Fig. 5.48).
* E.g. salivary amylase activity is increased by the presence of chloride ions (Cl').
* E.g. Metal ions such as Zn\({}^{2+}\) are required for catalytic activity of carboxypeptidase A.
* **Prosthetic groups*
* Can be **inorganic or organic*
* in nature.
* These are cofactors that are **tightly and permanently bound to the enzyme**.
* E.g. Haem is an iron-containing prosthetic group, found in catalase, peroxidase, and in cytochrome _(refer to chapter on Respiration)_ to function as an electron carrier.

* These are **organic cofactors derived from vitamins**.
* They are **loosely associated*
* with the enzyme during reaction,
* E.g.Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) is an important coenzyme in respiration.

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:105]

**(a) Competitive inhibitors**

**Key Concept:**

**Competitive inhibitors are structurally similar to the substrate and bind to the active site of the enzyme.**

**The effect of inhibition can be reduced by increasing the substrate concentration.**

**Competitive inhibitors are** **structurally similar to substrate** **molecules, therefore complementary in shape to the enzyme active site.**

**They compete with the substrate molecules for binding** _reversibly_ **to the** **active site** **of the enzyme (Fig.** 5.50**) to form unreactive enzyme-inhibitor complexes.**

**This prevents substrate molecules from binding to the active sites to form enzyme-substrate complexes. Hence, this** **decreases the rate of the enzyme reaction.**

**Example of reversible competitive inhibition: Malonate competes with succinic acid for succinic dehydrogenase (an enzyme of the Krebs cycle in cellular respiration). (Fig.** 5.51**)**

**Fig.** 5.50**: Both the substrate and competitive inhibitor compete for an enzyme’s active site* The **effect of competitive inhibitors can be reduced by increasing substrate concentration**..
* With an increase in the number of substrate molecules at the start of the reaction, the **probability of effective collisions between enzymes and substrate increases**.
* The substrate molecules thus **outcompete** the inhibitor molecules for the **active sites** of the enzymes.
* The **rate of reaction** increases to **reach its maximum value** (\(\textbf{V}_{\text{max}}\)), but **at a slower rate** and at **higher substrate concentration**. (Fig. 5.52)

**Fig 5.52**: Rate of reaction with and without competitive inhibitor

**(b) Non-Competitive Inhibitors**

**(c) Non-competitive inhibitors** have **no structural similarity/resemblance** to the **substrates**.

**(d) Non-competitive inhibitors** have **no structural similarity to the substrate and bind to a site other than the active site**.

**(e) The effect of inhibition cannot be reduced by increasing the substrate concentration.**

**(e) Non-competitive inhibitors** have **no structural similarity/resemblance** to the **substrates**.

**(f) Therefore they do not compete directly with the substrate to bind to the active site.

**(f) Instead, they **bind** to the enzyme at a **site other than the active site** (Fig. 5.53a, 5.53b).

**(f) This results in a **change in conformation of the enzyme** molecule, hence **altering the shape of the active site**, which is then

1. **Unable to bind to the substrate** (Fig. 5.53a), or
2. **Can bind to the substrate but **cannot act on it**. (Fig. 5.53b)

**(e) Example of irreversible non-competitive inhibition: Cyanide is known to inhibit many enzymes and acts by combining with metallic ions, which serve as prosthetic groups (e.g. Cu\({}^{2+}\) of cytochrome oxidase).*** Thus, non-competitive inhibitors render a proportion of the enzyme molecules non-functional i.e. the **effective enzyme concentration is lowered**.
* Since non-competitive inhibitors do not compete with the substrate for the active site, **increasing the substrate concentration does not reduce the effect of inhibition**.
* Therefore, the **original maximum rate of reaction (Vmax) can never be reached**, even at very high substrate concentrations (Fig. 5.54).

_TOKYO GAS ATACK IN 1995_

Sarin gas was used in the attack, killing at least a dozen people, severly injuring 50, and causing temporary vision problem in more than a thousand people.

**Other examples of non-competitive irreversible inhibition:**

* **Sarin** forms an enzyme inhibitor complex with the amino acid serine at the active site of the enzyme acetylcholinesteraseinesterase. The enzyme deactivates the transmitter substance acetylcholine, in nerve impulse transmission across a synapse. If acetylcholinesteraseinesterase is inhibited, then acetylcholine accumulates. This results in the constant propagation of nerve impulses and therefore prolonged muscle contraction. This leads to **paralysis** and **eventually death**.
* Metabolic poisons like **DDT, partition** and **malathion** (common pesticides used). These **affect enzymes of the nervous system**.

#### Regulation of metabolic pathways by cells

* An organism must be able to regulate the catalytic activities of its enzymes so that it can coordinate its numerous metabolic processes, respond to changes in its environment, and grow and differentiate, all in an orderly manner.
* Thus, a cell has to control when and where its various enzymes are active. This is done by controlling enzyme synthesis (i.e. switching on/off the genes that encode specific enzymes) _(see topic: Organisation and Control of Gene expression)_ or by **regulating the activity of enzymes once they are made** (_Section 5.5.8_).

#### Allosteric Regulation

**Key Concept:**

* Allosteric inhibitors bind to an allosteric site (site other than the active site) of an enzyme and stabilises the inactive form of the enzyme. This reduces the rate of reaction.
* Allosteric regulation is the control of enzyme activity by the binding of a regulatory molecule to the allosteric site of an enzyme. The enzymes that are allosterically regulated are called **allosteric enzymes.**
* Allosteric inhibitors behave like **reversible non-competitive inhibitors** _(Section 5.5.7b)._
* This is because these regulatory molecules loosely **bind to the allosteric site** via **non-covalent interactions**, causing a change in the shape of the enzyme's active site.
* Features of allosteric enzymes: (Fig 5.56)
* They usually **consist of two or more subunits (multimeric)*
* interacting with one another.
* Each subunit is composed of **one polypeptide chain** and has its **own active site** and **allosteric site**.
* The subunits are arranged in such a way that a **change in shape of one subunit** due to the binding of regulatory molecules at the allosteric site changes the **other subunits**.

### (b) End-Product / Feedback Inhibition

* Many enzymes in metabolic pathways are **allosterically controlled** by molecules that are also in the same pathway.
* **End-product / Feedback inhibition** occurs when the **metabolic pathway is switched off** / inhibited by the **pathway's final product** when its **concentration increases** and exceeds a certain level (Fig. 5.60).
* The final product acts as an **allosteric inhibitor** of an enzyme earlier in the pathway (usually the _first_ enzyme).
* This prevents the overproduction of the end-product and is therefore a form of **negative feedback**.
* End-product inhibition is **self-regulatory**. As product is used up, the inhibition is lifted, and the pathway is switched on again.
* This adjusts the rate of synthesis of products according to the demands of the cells which helps to:
* **Prevent wasting chemical resources and energy*
* by synthesising more products than required.
* **Maintain a stable internal environment** (homeostasis) in living organisms.

Figure 5.60: Feedback inhibition in isoleucine productionExample of feedback inhibition on phosphofructokinase-1 (PFK-1) - For your information only

* Respiration is a process that produces ATP (an energy molecule in the cell) as a final product. PFK-1 is an enzyme that is involved in the glycolysis stage of respiration _(Topic: Cellular Respiration)_.
* PFK-1 catalyses the conversion of fructose-6-phosphate (F6P) to fructose-1,6-bisphosphate, by transferring a phosphate from ATP (Fig. 5.61).
* PFK-1 is a **tetrameric allosteric enzyme** that oscillates between its active and inactive forms.
* **ATP** is both a **substrate** and **allosteric inhibitor** of **PFK-1**. ATP can bind to the active site and stabilise the active form. ATP, at high concentration, can also bind to the allosteric site to stabilise the inactive form (Fig. 5.62).
* At **high ATP concentrations** (the final product of respiration), ATP acts as an **allosteric inhibitor of PFK-1**. ATP binds to an **allosteric site** on PFK-1 to stabilise its **inactive form**.
* In the inactive form of PFK-1, the other substrate fructose 6-phosphate is then unable to bind to its active site. Thus this prevents the progression of glycolysis, and eventually prevents an overproduction of ATP (the final product of respiration).
* On the other hand, **high concentrations of AMP** (which indicate low levels of ATP in the cell) can reverse the allosteric inhibition of PFK-1 by ATP. AMP acts as an **allosteric activator** of PFK-1, where it binds to an **allosteric site** on PFK-1 to stabilise its **active form**.
* In the active form of PFK-1, the other substrate fructose 6-phosphate is able to bind to the active site on PFK-1. Thus, the **feedback inhibition is lifted**.

Figure 5.62: Diagram shows one of the subunits in phosphofructokinase-1. Each subunit has two binding sites for ATP – an active site and a allosteric site. ATP is both a substrate and allosteric inhibitor.

Figure 5.61: Phosphofructokinase-1 catalyses one of the first reactions in glycolysis of respiration. AMP at high concentrations allosterically activates PFK-1, while ATP at high concentrations allosterically inhibit PFK-1.

## 6 Cellular Transport

### Membrane Structure and Function

* The cell surface membrane is the edge of life, the boundary that separates the living cell from its surroundings and controls the traffic of molecules into and out of the cell it surrounds.
* Membranes also form various internal organelles to allow these organelles to take on specialised functions.
* The membrane constitutes various biomolecules to carry out different functions.

#### Membrane Structure

* All biological membranes have the **same basic structure.** The cell surface membrane and membrane of organelles (e.g. mitochondrion, chloroplast) comprise of a **phospholipid bilayer** (Fig. 6.1).
* The bilayer is approximately **7 to 10 nm** in width. Cell surface membranes are approximately 7.5 nm.
* The bilayer is formed as phospholipids are **amphipathic** molecules. The cell membrane comprises **phospholipids** arranged in **bilayers** with the **hydrophobic fatty acid chains** (or **hydrocarbons**) facing inwards and the **hydrophilic phosphate heads** facing the aqueous environment.
* Besides phospholipids, most other membrane constituents (e.g. proteins, cholesterol) are also **amphipathic** molecules. Hence the membrane is able to **reseal** itself when the bilayer is disrupted.
* The bilayer is **dynamic** and its components are constantly in motion (Fig. 6.2). Hence the term **"fluid mosaic model"** is used to describe membrane structure.

How would you expect the structure of the plasma membrane to differ in plants adapted to cold environments and plants adapted to warmer environments?

#### 6.2.2 Cholesterol

* Cholesterol molecules are **amphipathic** (Fig. 6.7 left). They have a **hydrophilic region** made up of **hydroxyl group** that **interacts with the phosphate heads** of phospholipids and a **hydrophobic region** made up of the **ring structure** that **interacts with the fatty acid chains** of phospholipids. Hence they are wedged between the hydrophobic regions of phospholipid molecules (Fig. 6.7 right).

* To **regulate membrane fluidity*
* according to the environment. At high temperatures, presence of cholesterol prevents the membrane from becoming too fluid, while at low temperatures, presence of cholesterol prevents the membrane from becoming too rigid.
* At relatively **high*
* temperatures (e.g. 38\({}^{\circ}\)C)
* Cholesterol makes membrane **less fluid*
* by decreasing the mobility of hydrocarbon tails of phospholipids
* At **lower*
* temperatures (e.g. 5\({}^{\circ}\)C)
* Cholesterol **prevents close packing*
* of phospholipids
* lowers the temperature required for the membrane to solidify
* This is important as the fluidity of the membrane influences many of its functions. For example:
* A completely frozen and therefore rigid membrane will be impermeable to even lipid-soluble, non-polar substances.
* Membrane components (e.g. proteins) may not be able to perform their functions if a membrane is not fluid enough.
* Fluidity is important in facilitating self-sealing (e.g. during endocytosis and exocytosis).

In the formation of glycoproteins and glycolipids, the short carbohydrate chains (oligosaccharides) are added to the proteins and lipids of the plasma membrane in ER or Golgi apparatus via _glycosylation_.

On which side of the transport vesicle membrane (i.e. inner or outer) are the short carbohydrate chain found? Explain.

**Function of membranes within the cell (i.e. intracellular membranes):**

1. Form compartments (**compartmentalisation**) within the cell (i.e. formation of organelles). (_For details the function of these organelle membranes, please refer to Topic 1: Cell_)

Advantages of compartmentalization:

* **Isolating enzymes and reactants** from the rest of the cell allows them to be in **high concentration, speeding up the rate of reactions**.
* Localizing products within the organelle for use especially in a multi-step biochemical pathway (e.g. the intermediate molecules of Krebs cycle are kept within the mitochondrial matrix).
* Attachment of specific proteins/enzymes within organelle membrane allows enzyme-catalyzed reactions to take place in a sequential manner in a metabolic pathway (Fig. 6.10)
* Ensuring maintenance of optimal conditions (e.g. pH5 in lysosomes) for **specialized biochemical reactions** to occur
* **Isolating harmful molecules** (e.g. free radicals such as superoxide in mitochondria) from the rest of the cell
* Allowing organelles to move within cytoplasm where they are needed (e.g. mitochondria can be streamed to areas needing ATP)
* Allowing **different/specialized metabolic pathway to occur at the same time** (e.g. Krebs cycle in the mitochondria and Calvin cycle in the chloroplast)
2. Membranes are required for the **formation of transport vesicles** during intracellular transport.

**Function of membrane at the surface of cell (i.e. cell surface membrane):**

1. The cell surface membrane separates cell contents from the external environment, so that the cell can function independently of its environment.
2. **Control the exchange of substances across the membrane** as they are selectively permeable (Section 6.2). The selective permeability of the membrane depends on both the discriminating barrier of the lipid bilayer and the specific transport proteins present on the membrane.

Why is it important to control the exchange of substances between the cell and the external environment?

5. Allows the **adhesion of cells** for tissue formation.
* Membrane proteins of adjacent cells may be joined together in various kinds of junctions (Fig. 13).

Examples of the various junctions between adjacent cells (Fig. 14) include:

1. Tight junctions * Plasma membrane of neighboring cells are tightly pressed against each other, forming continuous seal around the cell. * This prevents extracellular fluids from moving across a layer of epithelial cells.
2. Gap junctions * Consist of membrane proteins that surrounds a pore through which ions, sugar, amino acids and other small molecules may pass. * This provides a cytoplasmic channel from one cell to an adjacent cell, allowing for cellular communication.
3. Desmosomes * Function like rivets, fastening cells together into strong sheets. Desmosomes attach muscle cells to each other in a muscle. Some'muscle tears' involves the rupture of desmosomes.

### Transport across the Membrane

* Gases and small hydrophobic molecules diffuse directly across phospholipid bilayer.
* Polar and charged molecules such as ions, sugars and amino acids cannot diffuse across the phospholipid bilayer.
* Water is a polar molecule, but because it is very small, a small percentage can still diffuse through the phospholipid bilayer.
* Charged and polar molecules require integral membrane proteins e.g. channels, carriers and pumps for the transport of molecules across the phospholipid bilayer.
* Types of integral membrane proteins for transport across membrane:

* A **channel protein** (ungated) forms an open hydrophilic pore across the membrane, allowing **facilitated diffusion** of any charged ions or polar molecule of the appropriate size and charge. An example of a channel protein is the aquaporin (water channel), which allows the facilitated diffusion of water, thus increases the rate of osmosis.
* A **carrier protein** (sometimes known as transporter) binds to specific molecules to be transported on one side of the membrane, and then undergo a **conformational change** (change in shape). This allows the molecule to pass through the membrane and be released on the other side. An example of a carrier protein is the glucose transporter, which is responsible for the uptake of glucose (main respiratory substrate).
* A **pump _utilises energy from ATP_** to move ions and other solutes _against a concentration gradient_** via _active transport_ process. An example of a pump is sodium-potassium pump that helps to restore the electrochemical gradient across the membrane, which is especially important in nerve and muscle cells.

\begin{tabular}{|p{113.8pt}|p{113.8pt}|p{113.8pt}|p{113.8pt}|} \hline  & **Channel** & **Carrier** & **Pump** \\ \hline  & & Only binds to 1 or very few molecules at a time, hence, only allows 1 or few molecules to move across membrane per second & Only binds to 1 or very few molecules at a time, hence, only allows 1 or few molecules to move across membrane per second & Only binds to 1 or very few molecules at a time, hence, only allows 1 or few molecules to move across membrane per second & Only binds to 1 or very few molecules at a time, hence, only allows 1 or few molecules to move across membrane per second & Only binds to 1 or very few molecules at a time, hence, only allows 1 or few molecules to move across membrane per second & Only binds to 1 or very few molecules at a time, hence, only allows 1 or few molecules to move across membrane per second & Only finds to 1 or very few molecules at a time, hence, only allows 1 or few molecules to move across membrane per second & Allows multiple time, hence, only allows 1 or few molecules to move across membrane per second & Allows 1 or few molecules to move across membrane per second* Substances are transported across the cell surface membrane by various processes: 1. Osmosis 2. Simple diffusion 3. Facilitated diffusion 4. Active transport 5. Bulk transport (exocytosis and endocytosis)

#### Osmosis

* These substances dissolved in water are termed **solutes**, and water is a **solvent**. Water molecules **cluster** around molecules of a solute.
* Because some water molecules cluster around a solute when it is dissolved, there are less 'free' water molecules which can diffuse to other areas. This effectively **lowers the concentration** of water.
* **Water potential** is a measure of the **tendency** of free water molecules to **diffuse** to one area to another. The **more free water molecules there are**, the **higher the water potential**.

* is the **net movement*
* of **water molecules*
* from a region of **higher water potential*
* to a region of **lower water potential**, across a **selectively permeable membrane.*
* There are three types of solution that a living cell can be placed in. 1. **Hypertonic solution*
* - Solution contains a higher concentration of solutes, so it has a lower water potential. 2. **Hypotonic solution*
* - Solution contains a lower concentration of solutes, so it has a higher water potential. 3. **Isotonic solution*
* - Concentration of solutes on both sides of the membrane is the same, so the net movement of water is zero.
* It is a **passive process** as no energy input is required. The energy for movement comes from the water potential.

Figure 6.16: Animal cells fare best in an isotonic environment while plant cells are generally healthiest in a hypotonic environment.

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:133]

#### Facilitated diffusion

* **Facilitated diffusion** is the **net movement** of particles **down a concentration gradient** via a transmembrane transport protein, which may be a channel protein or carrier protein (Fig. 6.18).
* **Polar or charged** substances are able to cross the membrane with the aid of these transport proteins, as these transport proteins shield these substances from the hydrophobic interior of the membrane and provide a **hydrophilic passage** for these substances to pass through.
* It is a **passive process** as no energy input is required.

What are some factors that affect the rate of facilitated diffusion?

Figure 6.18: Facilitated diffusion requires transport proteins, while simple diffusion does not require transport proteins.

#### Active transport

* Living cells are able to absorb certain substances even though these substances are of high concentration inside the cell than they are in the external environment. These substances are important for the cell to grow and survive.
* Active transport is the process of transporting substances **against its concentration gradient** from a region of lower concentration to a region of higher concentration.
* It is an **active process** as energy input from the **hydrolysis of adenosine triphosphate (ATP)** is required.
* ATP hydrolysis is the reaction by which chemical energy that has been stored in the high-energy phosphate bond in ATP is released.
* When ATP is hydrolys to ADP, the phosphate group released from ATP is shifted to the transport protein.
* This induces a **conformational change** in the transport protein, thus translocating the ion or molecule across the membrane.
* Active transport is performed by specific transmembrane **protein pumps** embedded in the membrane.
* Examples of protein carriers/pumps include:
* **Proton pump*
* (Fig. 6.19) on lysosomal membranes.
* H+ from the cytosol is pumped into the lysosome to maintain its acidic pH. This is important as lysosomal enzymes are only active at acidic pH.

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:136]

#### Bulk transport (Endocytosis and Exocytosis)

* Certain particles are too large (E.g. polysaccharides or proteins) to diffuse through the membrane. Hence they cross the membrane by bulk transport, which is the transport of material into or out of a cell by enclosing it within a fluid-filled, membrane bound sac called **vesicles**.
* In bulk transport, materials are taken into cells by **endocytosis** (Fig. 21a), while materials are **secreted** out of the cells by **exocytosis** (Fig. 21b).
* Both are **active processes** that require energy input. Energy is required for the movement of vesicles (e.g. to the cell surface membrane) along the **microtubules** of the cell cytoskeleton (Fig. 21c).

Figure 21c: Movement of vesicles along microtubules occurs with the aid of motor proteins (kines and dynein). These motor proteins are powered by energy from ATP hydrolysis.

a) Endocytosis
* Endocytosis is the process by which a cell brings in macromolecules and particulate matter, by forming new vesicles from the cell surface membrane.
* During endocytosis, a small area of the cell surface membrane sinks inward to form an invagination (infolding). As the invagination deepens, it pinches inwards, forming a vesicle containing the material that had been outside the cell. This vesicle is called an endosome.
* There are 3 types of endocytosis (Fig. 6.22): (i) Phagocytosis ("cellular eating")
* Process whereby a phagocytic cell engulfs a **solid particle*
* (eg. food, bacterium).
* The cell surface membrane extends **pseudopodia*
* (**cytoplasmic extensions**) around it the particle. The pseudopodia fuse to form a large vesicle around the particle, known as a **phagosome**.
* The contents of the vacuole are digested when the phagosome fuses with a primary lysosome to form a secondary lysosome.
* Phagocytosis is a **specific*
* process (eg. amoeba ingests only particles of nutritional value, while phagocytic white blood cells engulf bacteria)
* ("cellular drinking")
* Process whereby a cell **invariates*
* a region of the cell surface membrane, forming a **vesicle*
* around a small volume of **extracellular fluid**. It is not the fluid itself but the dissolved solutes that is needed by the cell.
* This is a **non-specific*
* **Receptor-mediated endocytosis (RME)*
* Process by which a cell can acquire **specific molecules*
* (e.g. cholesterol), even those that may be in low concentrations in the extracellular fluid.
* The specific ligands/molecules (e.g. cholesterol-LDL) bind to proteins embedded on the cell surface membrane (e.g. LDL receptors). These proteins have binding sites that are specific to the ligands.
* After binding, the receptor proteins cluster in regions of the membrane called **coated pits**, which are lined on their cytoplasmic side by a layer of coat proteins (e.g. clathrin).
* Each coated pit forms a vesicle containing the ligand molecules.
* After the ligand molecules are released from the vesicle, the vesicle (and receptors) is then recycled to the cell surface membrane.

**Additional Information**

Mitochondria and chloroplasts are organelles present in eukaryotic cells.

They are hypothesised to be derived from prokaryotic origin, due to the presence of 70S ribosomes and circular DNA.

Based on your knowledge on **endocytosis,** suggest a third feature of these two organelles that further support this hypothesis.
