### Gravitational Field

**Newton's Law of Gravitation** - mutual force of attraction, \(F_{G}\), between two point masses is proportional to the product of their masses (\(m_{1}\) & \(m_{2}\)) and inversely proportional to the square of their separation, \(r\).

**Gravitational Potential Energy** - work done, \(U\), by an external agent on a mass in moving it from infinity to that point.

**Gravitational Field Strength, \(g\)** - at a point in a gravitational field is defined as the gravitational force per unit mass acting on a small mass placed at that point.

**Gravitational Potential, \(\phi\)** - at a point in a gravitational field is defined as the work done per unit mass by an external agent in bringing a point mass from infinity to that point.

**Field Lines**

Tangent of the lines points in the direction of the force on a test mass

Point in the direction of decreasing gravitational potentials

Closer lines indicate larger \(g\)

No two lines intersect one another

Perpendicular to Equipotential Lines

**Equipotential Lines**

All points along a line has the same gravitational potential

No work done when moving a mass along a equipipotential line

Perpendicular to Field Lines

**Geostationary Satellite** - in a geostationary orbit in which the orbiting object remains stationary relative to an observer on the Earth.

Conditions for Geostationary Orbit:

* Centre of the Earth coincides with the centre of orbit of the object/satellite, and, axis of rotation of the Earth coincides with the axis of orbit of the object/satellite. [OR The orbit of the object/satellite lies in the equatorial plane.]
* The object/satellite orbits from West to East.
* The period of one orbit of the object/satellite is 24 hours.
