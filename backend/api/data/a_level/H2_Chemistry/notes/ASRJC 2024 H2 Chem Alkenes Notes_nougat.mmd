## 1 Introduction

Alkenes are unsaturated hydrocarbons which contain one or more C=C double bonds in their structures.

Alkenes have the general formula **C\({}_{n}\)H\({}_{2n}\)**. Cycloalkenes have the general formula **C\({}_{n}\)H\({}_{2n-2}\)**.

(Note that cycloalkenes have the same general formula as alkenes e.g. C\({}_{3}\)H\({}_{6}\) represents propene as well as cyclopropane.)

Each C atom of the C=C is. Hence the geometry (shape) about each of the double bonded C is trigonal planar.

Two of the three sp\({}^{2}\) hybrid orbitals of the carbon atom overlap head-on with the 1s orbitals of the two hydrogen atoms to form two C-H sigma (\(\sigma\)) bonds.

The remaining sp\({}^{2}\) hybrid orbital overlaps head-on with the sp\({}^{2}\) hybrid orbital of the neighbouring carbon atom to form a C-C sigma (\(\sigma\)) bond.

The unhybridised 2p orbital, which is perpendicular to the plane of the inter-nuclear axis, overlaps side-on with the 2p orbital of the neighbouring carbon atom to form a pi (\(\pi\)) bond. The \(\pi\) electron cloud lies above and below the plane of the inter-nuclear axis.

## 2 Nomenclature

The name of an alkene is derived from an alkane with same number of carbon atoms by changing the suffix from **-ane** to **-ene**.

The longest continuous carbon chain that **contains the C=C** is named as the parent chain.

The **position of the double bond** and any substituents are indicated by **numbering the carbon atoms** in the chain, as shown below.

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|} \hline n & Molecular formula & Name & Structural formula \\ \hline
2 & C\({}_{2}\)H\({}_{4}\) & ethene & CH\({}_{2}\)=CH\({}_{2}\) \\ \hline
3 & C\({}_{3}\)H\({}_{6}\) & propene & CH\({}_{2}\)=CHCH\({}_{3}\) \\ \hline
4 & C\({}_{4}\)H\({}_{8}\) & but\(-\)1\(-\)ene & CH\({}_{2}\)=CHCH\({}_{2}\)CH\({}_{3}\) \\ \hline \end{tabular}

If the molecule has **two C=C double bonds**, it is named as a **diene**.

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|} \hline Structural formula & Appropriate IUPAC name \\ \hline CH\({}_{2}\)=CH\({}_{4}\)=CH\({}_{2}\) & buta\(-\)1,3\(-\)diene \\ \hline CH\({}_{2}\)=CHCH\({}_{2}\)CH\({}_{2}\)=CH\({}_{2}\) & penta\(-\)1,4\(-\)diene \\ \hline
6 & cyclohexa\(-\)1,4\(-\)diene \\ \hline \end{tabular}

## 4 Physical Properties _(Recall and apply Chemical Bonding concepts here)_

### Boiling point/volatility

1. Boiling point increases as the number of carbon atoms increases (as with alkanes) 

* As the **size of electron cloud increases,** the ease of distortion of the electron cloud increases.
* This results in **stronger instantaneous dipole-induced dipole (id-id) attractions between** the alkene **molecules.**
* Hence, **more energy** is required to overcome the stronger id-id attractions between the molecules.
* For the same molecular formula, branched chain alkenes have lower boiling points than their corresponding straight chain alkenes (as with alkanes). Example 

* Pent-1-ene is an **elongated** molecule which provides a **greater surface area** of contact compared to the more **compact (or spherical)** 3-methylbut-1-ene molecule.
* This leads to **stronger instantaneous dipole-induced dipole (id-id) attractions between** pent-1-ene **molecules**.
* Hence, **more energy** is required to overcome the stronger id-id attractions between pent-1-ene molecules.

3. _Cis_-isomers generally have higher boiling points than _trans_-isomers

## 5 Preparation of Alkenes

Alkenes can be obtained from three main groups of organic compounds, namely, alkanes, alcohols and halogenoalkanes.

### 5.1 Cracking of alkanes _(Refer to 'Alkanes' Lecture Notes for more details)_

1. Thermal cracking * Conditions: heat with steam at high temperature and pressure * E.g. C\({}_{12}\)H\({}_{26}\) * dodecane * hexane * 2. Catalytic cracking * Catalyst: zeolites (mixture of A\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{3}\) and SiO\({}_{2}\)). * Conditions: high temperature and pressure * E.g. C\({}_{12}\)H\({}_{26}\) * dodecane * CH\({}_{3}\)CHCH\({}_{2}\)CHCH\({}_{3}\) * but-1-ene * branched chain C\({}_{8}\)H\({}_{18}\)

### 5.2 Elimination

A type of reaction which involves the removal of atoms or group of atoms from two adjacent carbon atoms to form a carbon-carbon double bond in the product

#### 5.2.1 Elimination of water (H\({}_{2}\)O) from alcohols

A hydrogen atom and a hydroxyl group, -OH, from **adjacent** carbon atoms in an alcohol molecule are eliminated as a molecule of water.

What is meant by 'heat under reflux'? Heating under reflux' is carried out with a condenser connected vertically to the reaction flask. Cooling water is circulated in the outer jacket of the condenser and the vapour formed will be condensed back into the reaction flask as shown in the diagram below.

Why is reflux condition necessary?Organic reactions are usually slow and heating is often required for the reaction to proceed. Since organic reactants / solvents are highly volatile, the reflux set-up will prevent volatile components of the reaction mixture from boiling off, and hence achieving maximum yield.

## 6 Chemical Property

Which classes of reagents do alkenes react with and why?

What types of reactions do alkenes undergo and why?

The C=C double bond in alkene is **electron rich** due to the presence of the \(\pi\) electron cloud.

The \(\pi\) electrons provide the reactive site which attracts **electrophiles** or **electrophilic reagents** (electron-deficient species). Thus, alkenes have greater chemical reactivity compared to the corresponding alkanes.

Due to the relatively strong C-H and C-C bonds present in the alkene molecules, the reaction that alkenes undergo is mainly **addition** in nature, which involves the **breaking of the weaker \(\pi\) bond**.

Hence, the main type of reaction that alkenes undergo is **ELECTROPHILIC ADDITION**.

### 6.1 Electrophilic Addition

An _addition_ reaction is a reaction in which _two molecules combine to form a single molecule_.

_Electrophilic addition_ is an addition reaction in which _an electron-rich molecule donates a pair of electrons to an electrophile_.

_Electrophile_ - a cation or _electrically neutral molecule_ which has an electron-deficient atom_ (i.e. molecule has an atom with a \(\delta\)+ charge). Electrophiles are 'electron-lovers' and they tend to be attacked by electron-rich regions of organic molecules such as double bonds. They are also known as _Lewis acid_ (electron-pair acceptor).

In the **electrophilic addition** of an alkene, an electrophile is attracted to the C=C bond. The alkene molecule donates a pair of electrons from the \(\pi\) bond to the electrophile and breaks the \(\pi\) bond in the process.

* [30] _The positive end of the polarised Br-Br acts as an electrophile and is attracted towards the C=C double bond._
* [31] _As a pair of electrons from the electron-rich C=C moves to the electrophile Br+ (as shown by the curly arrow), the_ \(\pi\) _bond is broken and the pair of electrons is now shared between the carbon and the bromine atom._
* [32] _The adjacent carbon atom becomes positively charged, thus forming a_ **carboncation intermediate**_._
* [33] _Heterolytic fission of the Br-Br bond results in the formation of a Br- (bromide) ion._
* [34] _Step 2 (fast)_
* [35] _The bromide ion (acting as a nucleophile) attacks the intermediate carbocation to give the final product 1,2-dibromoethane._

#### 7.1.3 Electrophilic addition of hydrogen halides, HX to alkenes

2024/ASRJC/CHEM

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:19]

Example

In the electrophilic addition of HC_I_ to propene, electrons move from the \(\pi\) electron cloud of propene to the electrophilic H\({}^{8+}\) end of the polar HC_I_ molecule. Two possible carbocations are generated as shown.

The secondary carbocation has more electron-donating alkyl groups attached to the C\({}^{+}\) which disperses the positive charge on the carbocation to a greater extent and gives rise to a more stable carbocation intermediate.

Subsequently, more of the secondary carbocation is attacked by C_I_- nucleophilic in the fast step to form the major product, 2-chloropropane.

#### 7.1.4 Electrophilic addition of water/steam to alkenes

[MISSING_PAGE_POST]

_Exercise 7.4_

What is the product obtained when the following alkene undergoes hydration?

### Oxidation

Unlike alkanes, alkenes undergo oxidation easily.

Alkenes are oxidised **only** by potassium manganate(VII), KMnO\({}_{4}\), a strong oxidising agent. The type of organic products formed depends on the temperature at which the oxidation is carried out.

Oxidation of alkenes can take place:

without cleavage (rupture) of the C=C bond (mild oxidation) or

with cleavage of the C=C bond (strong oxidation / oxidative cleavage)

#### 7.2.1 Mild oxidation

This oxidation involves breaking of the \(\pi\) bond in the alkene to form a diol.

Equation to represent the oxidation:

\begin{tabular}{|p{142.3pt}|p{142.3pt}|p{142.3pt}|} \hline
**Type of reaction** & Mild oxidation & Mild oxidation \\ \hline
**Reagent** & KMnO\({}_{4}\) in NaOH(aq) or KOH(aq) & KMnO\({}_{4}\) in dilute H\({}_{2}\)SO\({}_{4}\) \\ \hline
**Condition** & **cold** & **cold** \\ \hline
**Observation** & The purple KMnO\({}_{4}\) solution is decolourised. Brown ppt of MnO\({}_{2}\) is formed (as MnO\({}_{4}\) - is reduced to MnO\({}_{2}\) in alkaline medium) & The purple KMnO\({}_{4}\) solution is decolourised (as chromium\({}_{4}\) - is reduced to MnO\({}_{2}\) in alkaline medium) & This reagent is also commonly referred to as cold alkaline / acidified aq, KMnO\({}_{4}\) \\ \hline \end{tabular}

Application

This is another useful test for unsaturation; i.e. to detect the presence of a C=C double bond.

#### 7.2.2 Strong oxidation (also called oxidative cleavage)

This oxidation is more vigorous as it involves the cleavage of C=C bond; i.e. the double bond is completely broken.

\begin{tabular}{|p{113.8pt}|p{113.8pt}|p{113.8pt}|} \hline
**Type of reaction** & Strong oxidation / oxidative cleavage & Strong oxidation / oxidative cleavage \\ \hline
**Reagent** & KMnO\({}_{4}\) in NaOH(aq) or KOH(aq) & KMnO\({}_{4}\) in dilute H\({}_{2}\)SO\({}_{4}\) \\ \hline
**Condition** & **heat under reflux** & **heat under reflux** & This reagent is also commonly referred to as \\ \hline
**Observation** & \(\bullet\) The purple KMnO\({}_{4}\) solution is decolourised. & \(\bullet\) The purple KMnO\({}_{4}\) solution is decolourised. & not concentrated \\ \(\bullet\) Brown opt of MnO\({}_{2}\) formed & (as MnO\({}_{4}\) - is reduced to Mn\({}^{2+}\) in acidic medium) & & KMnO\({}_{4}\) \\ \hline \end{tabular}

\begin{tabular}{|p{113.8pt}|p{113.8pt}|p{113.8pt}|} \hline Case & Structure of alkene & Final products of strong oxidation \\ \hline

### Reduction via Catalytic Hydrogen

This reaction is an example of **reduction** using **heterogeneous** catalysis (**NOT** electrophilic addition).

One industrial example of this heterogeneous catalysis reaction is the production of margarine, where polyunsaturated plant oils are hydrogenated.

Application

This reaction is useful in **determining** the number of C=C double bonds in an organic compound by measuring the amount of hydrogen that reacted with one mole of the compound.

One mole of H\({}_{2}\) reacts with **each** C=C bond present in the alkene.

Summary of Chemical Tests for Alkenes

The following reactions covered in the earlier sections may be used as **tests for unsaturation** because they give rise to easily observable colour changes:

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|} \hline

H\({}_{2}\)SO\({}_{4}\) & heat & The purple KMnO\({}_{4}\) solution is decolourised. \\ \hline KMnO\({}_{4}\) in KOH (aq) & heat & The purple KMnO\({}_{4}\) solution is decolourised with the formation of brown precipitate of MnO\({}_{2}\). \\ \hline \end{tabular}

## 9 Electronic effect (Inductive effect)

Electronic effect is mainly due to the presence of polar bonds and as a result, there are two possible inductive effects: **electron-donating** and **electron-withdrawing**.

An inductive effect is the shifting of electrons in a **g bond** in response to the electronegativity of nearby atoms. Inductive effects play a major role in understanding chemical reactivity of organic compounds.

An atom like fluorine has an electron-withdrawing effect as it can pull the bonding pair away from the atom it is attached to. Most atoms that you will come across have an electron-withdrawing effect when they are attached to a carbon atom, because they are _mostly more electronegative than carbon_.

However, some groups of atoms have an electron-donating effect and "push" electrons towards the carbon they are attached to, making it slightly negative. Metals, such as lithium and magnesium, inductively donate electrons.

A simple example can be illustrated using the polar covalent bond: H-C_I_. Due to the large electronegativity difference between H and C_I_, the H atom will possess the 5+ charge while C_I_ atom the 5- charge. The ability of a bond to be polarised is often termed as the "inductive effect".

\begin{tabular}{|c|p{142.3pt}|} \hline
**Inductive effect** & \multicolumn{1}{c|}{**Examples**} \\ \hline  & Electronegative atoms and groups (e.g. halogens, carbonyl groups and cyano (-CN) groups) \\ Withdrawing & \\ \hline  & Alkyl groups (e.g. \(-\)CH\({}_{3}\), \(-\)CH\({}_{2}\)CH\({}_{3}\) etc.) \\ Donating & \\ \end{tabular}

Note: C is slightly more electronegative than H
