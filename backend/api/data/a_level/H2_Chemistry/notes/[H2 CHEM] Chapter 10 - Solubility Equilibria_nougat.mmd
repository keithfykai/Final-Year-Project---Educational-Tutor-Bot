**SOLUBILITY**

**The solubility of an ionic salt is the amount of solute that can dissolve in a certain quantity of solvent or solution at a specified temperature.**

**Units = mol dm**\({}^{\alpha_{3}}\)****

**Saturated SOLUTION**

**The solution that contains the maximum amount of salt that it can dissolve.**
## 5 Solubility product

* It is an equilibrium constant.
* It is the product of the molar concentration of the constituent ions in a saturated solution, raised to the appropriate powers at a given temperature.

* Units = (mol dm\({}^{3}\))\({}^{m\times}\)

_Note: The solubility of a salt can change while solubility product is constant for a given solute at any specified temperature._

_Note: \(K_{\varphi}\) allows a direct comparison of the solubility of different salts only if the mol ratio between the product ions are the same._

(c) discuss the effects on the solubility of ionic salts by the following:

(i) common ion effect

(ii) formation of complex ion, as exemplified by the reactions of halide ions with aqueous silver ions followed by aqueous ammonia For more notes & learning materials, visit: www.overmugged.com
