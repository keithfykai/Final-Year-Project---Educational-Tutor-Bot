### Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation

Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation states that:

Every **point mass attracts** every other **point mass** with a **force** that is directly **proportional to the product of their masses** and **inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them**.

Consider two point masses of \(m_{t}\) and \(m_{2}\) separated by a distance \(r\). Each will exert a force \(F\) on the other, and its magnitude is given by

\[F=G\frac{m_{t}m_{2}}{r^{2}}\]

where 

The two forces form an **action-reaction pair** and have the following characteristics,

* are equal in magnitude,
* are opposite in direction,
* act on different bodies
* are of the same type (gravitational force).

\(G\) is called the _gravitational constant_ (or constant of universal gravitation), which has been measured experimentally to be: \(\textbf{{G=6.67 x 10^{-11} N m^{2} kg^{-2}}}\). It is given in the list of constants provided on the second page of all tests and exams.

Important points to note about Newton's Law of Gravitation

1. Newton's Law of Gravitation is a **universal** law. It applies everywhere in the universe.
2. **Attractive nature of gravitational force:** Note that the masses in this case are always attracted to each other.
3. The gravitational force is a **field force** that always exists between two masses regardless of the medium that separates them and the two masses need not be in contact with other. In fact, it would still exist if there were no medium between them.

4. **Inverse-square law:** Newton's Law of Gravitation is an example of an **inverse-square law**, i.e., the force is inversely proportional to the square of the separation of the masses. \[F\propto\frac{1}{r^{2}}\]
5. Newton's Law of Gravitation can be applied to spherical bodies as though they were point masses with all their mass concentrated at their geometrical centres.

**Example 1: Finding Resultant Gravitational Force**

Three identical masses, each of mass \(m\), are located on a table at the corners of an equilateral triangle of side \(d\). Determine the resultant gravitational force on mass C due to masses A and B.

**Solution**:

**Concept:** If several masses are present, each pair will experience a mutual gravitational attraction. The resultant gravitational force on a given mass is **the vector sum of the separate attractive forces acting on it due to the masses interacting with it.

### Gravitational Field Strength

The gravitational field is a **region of space** where a **mass** will experience a **gravitational force**.

Consider a particle of mass \(m\) placed at a point in a gravitational field (due to another mass \(M\)).

The particle would experience a **gravitational force**, \(F_{g}\), in the gravitational field, given by:

\[F_{g}=mg\]

**Definition: Gravitational Field Strength, \(g\)**

The gravitational field strength \(g\) at a point is the **gravitational force per unit mass** acting on a small test mass placed at the point.

\[g=\frac{F_{g}}{m}\]

where \(\begin{array}{c}\mathbf{g}\ :\\ \mathbf{F_{g}}\ :\end{array}\) gravitational field strength at that point

gravitational force acting on mass \(m\) placed at that point in

the gravitational field.

**Notes:**

1. S.l. unit of \(g\): N kg-1 or m s-2.
2. \(g\) is a **vector** quantity. Its **direction is determined by the gravitational force acting on a **mass \(m\) placed at the point** in the gravitational field.
3. Mass \(m\) is a particle that is placed in the gravitational field. It is not the mass that is creating the gravitational field. Hence, mass \(m\) is often known as the _test_ mass. The mass \(M\) that is creating the gravitational field is known as the _source_ mass. The presence of the test mass is not necessary for the field to be present.
4. \(g\) is also commonly known as the _acceleration due to gravity_ or _gravitational acceleration_.

#### 7.2.1 Gravitational Field of a Point Mass

If a point mass \(M\) is placed at some point in space, it will set up a gravitational field around itself. Suppose we wish to determine the gravitational field strength \(g\) at a distance \(r\) away from this point mass \(M\). We need to place a test mass \(m\) at the distance \(r\) away from this source mass \(M\).

The test mass would experience a gravitational force \(F\) as it is in the gravitational field created by \(M\). By Newton's Law of Gravitation,

The magnitude of the gravitational force acting on \(m\) due to the gravitational field set up by \(M\),

\[F=G\frac{Mm}{r^{2}}\]

From the definition of gravitational field strength,

The magnitude of gravitational field strength due to \(M\) at a distance \(r\) away from \(M\),

The magnitude of gravitational force acting on test mass \(m\)

The magnitude of the gravitational field strength at a point due to a point mass \(M\) at a distance \(r\) away is given by:

The equation is also valid for gravitational field strength outside a spherical body of uniform density or spherical shells of uniform density, where its whole mass is concentrated at its geometric centre.1\(r\) would then represent the distance between the test mass and the geometric centre of the source mass.

#### 7.2.2 Representation of Gravitational Field

We use field lines to represent a gravitational field. The gravitational field lines are related to the gravitational field in the following manner:

1. **Direction** The direction of the gravitational field strength \(g\) is **tangent** to the gravitational field line at each point in space.
2. **Magnitude** The magnitude of the gravitational field strength is **proportional to the number of lines per unit area** through a surface perpendicular to the lines. Therefore, \(g\) is large when the lines are close together and small when they are far apart.

**Gravitational Field Line Diagram** For a point mass**

* The gravitational field in the vicinity of a point mass is always directed _radially towards_ the point mass.
* The magnitude of the gravitational field is inversely proportional to the square of the distance from the point mass. Therefore, the number of field lines per unit area decreases at further distances from the point mass, indicating the diminishing strength of the field.
* The field is really 3-dimensional, but on paper, we can only take a 2-dimensional slice of it. This is a radial field.
* Note that \(\circ\) Fields lines end on a mass and extend back all the way to infinity. \(\circ\) Field lines never cross one another.

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:8]

#### 7.2.3 Gravitational Field Strength (Acceleration due to Gravity)

If the only force acting on a mass \(m\) is the gravitational force, which is given by \(mg\), where \(g\) is the gravitational field strength at the point, then applying Newton's second law,

\[\begin{array}{c}\textit{m}\textbf{a}=mg\\ \textbf{a}=\textbf{g}\end{array}\]

Hence the mass will have an acceleration equal to the gravitational field strength \(g\). Thus the gravitational field strength \(g\) is also known as _acceleration due to gravity_ or _gravitational acceleration_.

#### 7.2.4 Variation of \(g\)

However, when we try to measure the value of \(g\) at various regions on Earth, the value of \(g\) varies. At the poles, \(g\) is 9.83 m s\({}^{-2}\), while at the equator, it is 9.78 m s\({}^{-2}\). In Singapore, it is about 9.79 m s\({}^{-2}\).

What accounts for this variation? There are mainly three factors affecting the value of \(g\) measured.

**(1) The Earth is not a perfect sphere**

Earth is approximately an ellipsoid, flattened at the poles and bulging at the equator. Its equatorial radius is greater than its polar radius by 21 km. Thus a point at the poles is closer to the dense core of the Earth than a point on the equator. This is one reason the gravitational field strength increases as one proceeds, at sea level, from the equator towards the poles.

**(2) The density of the Earth is not uniform**

The density of the Earth varies from region to region over the Earth's surface. The northern hemisphere, for instance, has far more land area than the southern hemisphere. Accurate measurements of the gravitational pull are used to identify different densities of materials beneath the Earth's surface. These measurements are used in prospecting for oil, coal and other minerals.

**(3) The Earth is rotating**

The Earth rotates about an axis passing through the poles. Because of the Earth's rotation, the gravitational force on a body that is not at the poles has to also provide the body with the centripetal acceleration required for rotation.

The farther the body is from the poles and the nearer it is to the equator the larger the centripetal acceleration required. Therefore, the _measured_ gravitational acceleration gets smaller as one approaches the equator.

The measured acceleration is also called the acceleration of free fall (or the apparent gravitational field strength).

#### 7.2.5 Measurement of acceleration of free fall

In this experiment, a steel ball bearing is made to fall a known distance, \(s\), from rest and the time taken to fall this distance is measured using an electric stop-clock.

When the two-way switch is changed to the 'down' position, the electromagnet releases the ball and simultaneously the clock starts. At the end of its fall, the ball opens the 'trap door' of the impact switch and the clock stops.

Assuming air resistance is negligible and applying the equations of motion,

\[s=ut+\frac{1}{2}at^{2}\ \ \Rightarrow\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ a=\frac{2s}{t^{2}}\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \text{where $t$ is the time taken to fall the distance $s$.}\]

Accurate measurements of \(s\) and \(t\) will allow the acceleration of free fall to be obtained.

**Example 3: How Earth's rotation affects the weight measured**

Consider a crate of mass \(m\) resting on a weighing scale at the equator.

Take the Earth to be a uniform sphere of mass \(M\) and radius \(R\), spinning on its axis.

On the diagram, draw all the forces acting on the crate.

Write down an expression for the reading of the weighing scale supporting this mass.

Write down an expression for the 'apparent' gravitational acceleration indicated by the weighing scale and determine its value.

### _Satellites_

A satellite is a moon, planet or machine that orbits a planet or star. For example, Earth is a satellite because it orbits the sun. Likewise, the moon is a satellite because it orbits Earth. Usually, the word "satellite" refers to a machine that is launched into space and moves around Earth or another body in space.

Earth and the moon are examples of natural satellites. Thousands of artificial, or man-made, satellites orbit Earth. Some take pictures of the planet that help meteorologists predict weather and track hurricanes. Some take pictures of other planets, the sun, black holes, dark matter or faraway galaxies. These pictures help scientists better understand the solar system and universe.

Still other satellites are used mainly for communications, such as beaming TV signals and phone calls around the world. A group of more than 20 satellites make up the Global Positioning System, or GPS. If you have a GPS receiver, these satellites can help figure out your exact location.

**Example 4:** **Investigating satellite motion**

Consider a satellite of mass \(m\) revolving around a larger mass \(M\) in a circle of radius \(r\).

Determine the relationship between the radius of the orbit and

(a) the velocity of the satellite;

(b) the period of rotation.

**Solution:**

As the satellite revolves, its velocity keeps changing as the direction of motion keeps changing. Hence, the satellite is accelerating. From the topic of Circular Motion, we know that a resultant force must be providing this centripetal acceleration.

The gravitational attraction of the large mass \(M\) on the satellite keeps the satellite in orbit, i.e., **the gravitational force acting on the satellite (by the mass _M_) provides for the centripetal force required for the satellite to maintain circular orbit about the mass \(M\).

**Example 5: How do you 'weigh' the Earth?**

When Newton first discovered his Law of Gravitation, he had neither the value of \(G\) nor the mass of the Sun.

In 1798, a hundred and twenty-one years after Newton proposed the Universal Law of Gravitation, Henry Cavendish2 conducted the first experiment to measure the force of gravity between masses in the laboratory, and obtained accurate values for the gravitational constant, \(G\), and the mass density of the Earth. With the value of \(G\), it was possible to obtain a value for the mass of the Earth.

Footnote 2: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cavendish_experiment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cavendish_experiment)

By considering the motion of the moon about the Earth, show that the mass of the Earth \(m_{e}\) is approximately 6 x 10\({}^{24}\) kg. You may assume that the distance between Earth and the moon is \(r=4.0\times 10^{8}\) m.

**Solution:**

The **gravitational force** acting on the moon by the Earth's gravitational field **provides** for **the centripetal force** required by the moon to move in orbit about the Earth.

_(NOTE: the statement above is required to explain the following steps below. Please write this in exams!)_

By Newton's 2\({}^{nd}\) Law,

\[F_{g}=m_{m}\,\mathfrak{a}_{c}\]

\[\Rightarrow\,\,G\,\frac{m_{s}m_{m}}{r^{2}}\,\,\,=m_{m}\,r\,\omega_{m}{}^{2} \,\,=\,\,m_{m}r\bigg{(}\frac{2\pi}{T_{m}}\bigg{)}^{2}\]

\[\Rightarrow\,\,m_{e}=\frac{4\pi^{2}}{G}\frac{r^{3}}{{T_{m}}^{2}}\]

Substituting for \(G\), \(r\) and since we know that the moon takes approximately about 1 month to make one complete revolution around the Earth,

\[\Rightarrow\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,

#### 7.3.1 Geostationary Satellites

Geostationary satellites are satellites in orbits where the satellites are always positioned over the same geographical spot on Earth.3 They appear stationary when seen from Earth.

Footnote 3: Besides the geostationary orbits, satellites can have other orbits as well. Check out the following sites for different types of satellites, orbits and functions by scanning the QR codes below.

#### Key Features of Geostationary Satellites:

1. **Period** \(\circ\) 24 hours (same period as the Earth's rotation about its own axis)
2. **Direction of rotation** \(\circ\) same direction as the rotation of the Earth, i.e. from west to east.
3. **Plane of rotation** \(\circ\) the plane that contains the equator.

The gravitational force on the satellite is always directed towards the centre of the Earth and so any circular orbit must have its centre at the centre of the Earth. If the orbit is not in the equatorial plane, the satellite will sometimes be over the northern hemisphere and sometimes over the southern hemisphere and so will not be geostationary.

**Advantages of Geostationary Satellites**

1. As they remain stationary above the same point on Earth, they are ideal for use as communication satellites as they require no tracking to receive signals from Earth. This is why there is no need to keep adjusting the satellite dish to receive TV signals from a particular geostationary satellite.

2. As geostationary satellites are positioned at such a high altitude (see Example 6 for its height above the Earth's surface), they can capture almost the full-disk Earth image, rather than a small subsection. Hence, they are ideal for meteorological applications and remote imaging.

**Disadvantages of Geostationary Satellites**

1. As geostationary satellites are positioned at such a high altitude, the spatial resolution (i.e. the amount of detail shown) of their images tends to be not as good as satellites which are much closer to Earth.
2. Another problem with geostationary satellites is that since they are positioned above the equator, they cannot see the north or south poles and are of limited use for latitudes greater than 60-70 degrees north or south.

**Example 6**: **Geostationary Satellite**

A communications satellite of mass \(m\) is placed in a circular geostationary orbit.

Find its height above the Earth's surface.

(Take radius of the Earth to be 6.38 x 10\({}^{6}\) m and the mass of the Earth to be 5.98 x 10\({}^{24}\) kg).

**Solution**:

The **gravitational force** on the satellite **provides** the required **centripetal force**.

_(NOTE: the statement above is required to explain the following steps below. Please write this in exams!)_

By Newton's second law:

#### 7.3.2 Weightlessness

There are two types of weightlessness - true weightlessness and apparent weightlessness.

**True Weightlessness**

**An object is truly weightless when there is no net gravitational force acting on it**, such as when it is at an infinite distance away from any other body, or when it experiences opposing gravitational forces that exactly cancel one another out.

**Apparent Weightlessness**

An astronaut orbiting the Earth in a space vehicle with its thrusters off is often said to be 'weightless' as well. To understand why, let us try to 'weigh' this astronaut in the space vehicle.

Suppose an astronaut is standing on a weighing balance in a space vehicle orbiting the Earth. Let us first consider the space vehicle, astronaut and weighing balance as a single system. Let the mass of this system be \(M_{\text{sys}}\).

The only force acting on this system is the gravitational force due to the Earth's gravitational field, \(F_{g}\).

Since the space vehicle is in a circular orbit around the Earth,

\(\Rightarrow\)\(F_{g}\) provides for the centripetal acceleration required for the space vehicle to move in a circular orbit.

By Newton's 2nd Law,

\(F_{g}=M_{\text{sys}}\)\(a\)

But

\(F_{g}=M_{\text{sys}}\)\(g\)

\(\Rightarrow\)\(M_{\text{sys}}\)\(g=M_{\text{sys}}\)\(a\)

Therefore,

\(a=g\)

The space vehicle, the man and the weighing balance all have the same acceleration of \(g\).

Now consider forces acting only on the astronaut at position X in the orbit.

By Newton's 2nd Law,

\(mg-N=ma\)

where \(m\) is the mass of the astronaut and

\(a\) is the acceleration of the astronaut.

However, from above, \(a=g\).

Therefore,

\(mg-N=mg\)

\(\Rightarrow\)\(N=0\)

Therefore, we see that the weighing balance does not exert a support force on the astronaut.

By Newton's 3rd Law, the astronaut does not exert a force on its support, the weighing balance. The reading indicated on the weighing balance is **zero**. The astronaut thus experiences the sensation of 'weightlessness'.

Hence, **an object is considered to be (apparently) weightless when it exerts no contact force on its support.** This happens when the object is accelerating with an acceleration of \(g\), e.g. an object in free fall or an object orbiting around the Earth.

### Gravitational Potential and Gravitational Potential Energy

#### 7.4.1 Gravitational Potential Energy

Consider a region of space in which a gravitational field, created by source mass \(M\), is present.

Consider a mass \(m\) placed in this gravitational field. If no external force is applied on mass \(m\), it will accelerate towards mass \(M\) due to the attractive gravitational force on \(m\) by \(M\). Let's say we apply an external force on the mass to move it between two points, from A to B, without changing its kinetic energy. By conservation of energy, whatever work is done by the external force would be equal to the change in gravitational potential energy of the system of 2 masses, \(M\) and \(m\), i.e.

work done by an external force to move \(m\) from A to B in the gravitational field,

\[\begin{array}{ll}&W=\Delta U_{{}_{AB}}=U_{{}_{B}}-U_{{}_{A}}\\ \mbox{where}&\Delta U_{{}_{AB}}\quad:\mbox{Change in gravitational potential energy of the system as mass $m$ moves}\\ &\quad\mbox{from A to B}\\ &U_{A}\quad:\mbox{Gravitational potential energy of system when $m$ is at A}\\ &U_{B}\quad:\mbox{Gravitational potential energy of system when $m$ is at B}\\ \end{array}\]

If point A is at an infinite distance from \(M\), then the gravitational field strength due to \(M\) would be zero there. The gravitational potential energy is zero at that point (\(U_{A}=U_{\infty}=0\)), then

\[W=\Delta U_{{}_{AB}}=U_{{}_{B}}-U_{{}_{A}}=U_{{}_{B}}\]

i.e. the work done by an external force to move a mass \(m\) from A (at infinity) to a point B without a change in kinetic energy is the gravitational potential energy of the system when mass \(m\) is at B.

From the concept of work done by a force, the **gravitational potential energy4**_U_**of a system of two point masses \(M\) and \(m\) separated by a distance \(r\) is given by \(\int_{{}_{\infty}}^{r}\frac{GMm}{r^{2}}dr\). It can be shown that

Footnote 4: A more rigorous derivation of the Gravitational Potential Energy (GPE) between 2 point masses and the gravitational potential of a point mass can be found in Appendix B.

\[\begin{array}{ll}&U=-G\,\frac{Mm}{r}\\ \end{array}\]

**Notes:**

1. S.I. unit for _U_: joule (J).
2. The **gravitational potential energy is actually a property of the system of the two masses** rather than of either mass alone. There is no way to divide this energy and say that so much belongs to one mass and so much to the other. Therefore, we say that it is the **gravitational potential energy of the system of \(M\) and _m_**. However, if _M_>>_m_, as for the case of the Earth and the apple, we often use the phrase "the potential energy of the apple". This is because when an apple moves in the vicinity of Earth, changes in the potential energy of the Earth-apple system appear almost entirely as changes in kinetic energy of the apple, since the changes in the kinetic energy of the Earth are negligible.
3. \(U\) is a scalar quantity. A scalar quantity can be positive or negative in value. However, gravitational potential energy is always negative. The negative sign has nothing to do with direction.
4. **Why is \(U\) negative and what is the significance of the negative sign?**

* Gravitational force is attractive in nature.
* To bring a mass from infinity to the point in the field without changing its kinetic energy, an external force opposite to the gravitational force needs to be applied.
* Since the external force and displacement of the mass are in opposite directions, the external force does negative work on the mass in the process.
* As GPE at infinity is taken as zero, the GPE at any point must be negative.

**Example 7: Gravitational Potential Energy of a System of 3 Masses**

**Example 8: Gravitational Potential Energy Changes near the Earth's Surface**

Show that the expression \(U=-G\frac{Mm}{r}\) can be reduced to the expression \(mg\Delta h\) for calculations of changes in gravitational potential energy near the Earth's surface, i.e. for \(\Delta h<<\) radius of the Earth \(R_{E}\).

**Example 9: Escape Speed**

The minimum speed with which a mass should be projected from the Earth's surface in order to escape Earth's gravitational field is known as the **escape speed** of the body from Earth.

2. Plot a graph showing how each of the following physical quantities associated with the satellite varies with distance from the centre of Earth: 1. kinetic energy; 2. gravitational potential energy; 3. total energy.

**Solution:**

#### 7.4.2 Gravitational Potential

Whenever a field is present in a region, we can always define a scalar property of the field at each point in the region. This property is called the _potential_ of the field. This _potential_ of a field is associated with the _potential energy per unit mass_ that a test mass will possess when it is placed at the point in the field.

**Definition: Gravitational Potential, \(\phi\)**

The **gravitational potential** at a point in a gravitational field is the work done per unit mass, by an external force, in bringing a small test mass from infinity to that point, without any change in kinetic energy.

**Notes:**

1. S.I. unit of gravitational potential \(\phi\). J kg\({}^{-1}\).
2. The gravitational potential is a **scalar quantity**.
3. The gravitational potential at infinity is taken to be zero.

**Gravitational Potential due to a Point Mass :**

The gravitational potential \(\phi\) at a point a distance \(r\) away from a source point mass \(M\) is given by:

**Note:**

1. The equation is also valid for any point outside masses of radial symmetry. This means that, for instance, we can assume the whole mass of the Earth to be concentrated at the Earth's centre. The gravitational potential _beyond the Earth's radius_ can then be calculated using the formula given above.

The gravitational potential at a point in the field is the work done per unit mass in bringing a test mass from infinity to that point.

Since the gravitational field is attractive and zero potential is at infinity, the gravitational potential is always negative.

2. All points at the same distance from the centre of the Earth will have the same gravitational potential. Points of the same potential are known as points of **equipotential**. Equipotential lines/surfaces join points of equal potential. Below are diagrams showing the cases of uniform fields (near the surface of the Earth) and radial fields (for point and spherical masses): 

The gravitational field is uniform close to the surface of the Earth. This results in uniformly spaced equipotential lines. The gravitational field obeys the inverse square law. Hence the distance between adjacent equipotential lines increases as distance from Earth increases. Equipotential lines are always perpendicular to field lines. Diagrams of equipotential lines give us information about the gravitational field in much the same way as contour maps give us information about geographical heights which show regions of same heights as shown below.

**Relationship between Gravitational Potential Energy \(U\) and gravitational potential \(\phi\)**

\[U=m\phi\]

As we move a mass from one point to another, the change in gravitational potential energy is given by

\[\Delta U=m\Delta\phi=m(\phi_{\phi}-\phi_{i})\]

#### 7.4.3 Relationship between Potential and Field Strength

Consider a mass \(M\) fixed in space. Suppose we move a mass \(m\) from point P to point P' in the gravitational field of \(M\) by applying an external force \(F_{ext}\) such that there is no change in the kinetic energy of \(m\). Then

\[\Rightarrow F_{ext}=-F_{g}\] where \[F_{g}\] gravitational force acting on \[m\]. (Note that \[F_{ext}\] and \[F_{g}\] vary with \[r\].)

The change in gravitational potential energy of \(m\), \(\Delta U\), is equal to the work done \(W_{ext}\) by external force \(F_{ext}\) in moving a mass \(m\) from point P to point P' (without an increase in kinetic energy) i.e.,

\[\Rightarrow W_{ext}=\Delta U\] But \[W_{ext}=\int_{r_{p}}^{r_{p}}F_{ext}dr\] \[\Rightarrow \int F_{ext}dr=\Delta U\] \[\Rightarrow F_{ext}=\frac{dU}{dr}\] \[\Rightarrow F_{g}=-\frac{dU}{dr}\]

**Relationship between Gravitational Force \(F_{g}\) and Gravitational Potential Energy \(U\)**

\[\boxed{F_{g}=-\frac{dU}{dr}}\]

Dividing both sides of \(F_{g}=-\frac{dU}{dr}\) by \(m\), we obtain:

**Relationship between Gravitational Field Strength \(\alpha\) and Gravitational Potential \(\phi\)**

\[\boxed{g=-\frac{d\phi}{dr}}\]

**Notes:**

1. \(\frac{d\phi}{dr}\) is known as the **potential gradient**.
2. The magnitude of the potential gradient at a point in the gravitational field gives the magnitude of the gravitational field strength at the point.
3. The **negative sign** indicates that gravitational field strength points in the direction of decreasing \(\phi\).

**Note:** The four relationships in the boxes are only valid for point masses (and spherical objects) while the other four relationships are valid for all cases.

## Appendices:

### Appendix A: Variation of the Gravitational Field Strength above and below the Earth's Surface

Consider the Earth to be a non-rotating spherical planet of uniform density \(\rho\). Take the radius of the Earth to be \(r_{E}\), and the mass of the Earth to be \(m_{E}\).

To determine the variation of \(g\) with respect to the distance from the centre of the Earth \(r\), the following results are useful:

* The acceleration due to gravity **outside** a spherical body of uniform density is the same as if the entire mass of the body were concentrated at its centre.
* The acceleration due to gravity at all points **inside** a spherical shell of uniform density is zero.

With these results, we are able to obtain expressions for the acceleration due to gravity both above and below the Earth's surface.

### Gravitational Field Strength above the Earth's surface (\(r\geq r_{E}\))

It follows from Result 1 that for \(r\geq r_{E}\), \(g=G\frac{m_{E}}{r^{2}}\) ; and at \(r=r_{E}\), \(g=G\frac{m_{E}}{r_{E}}\)2

Since \(G\) and \(m_{E}\) are constants, \(g\propto\frac{1}{r^{2}}\).

### Gravitational Field Strength below the Earth's surface (\(r\leq r_{E}\))5

Footnote 5: The gravitational field strength below the Earth’s surface is not explicitly required in the syllabus, it is only introduced here for completeness.

Consider a point P below the Earth's surface and at a distance \(r\) away from the centre of the Earth.

* The gravitational field at P,
* \(g=g\) at P due to spherical shell A + \(g\) at P due to spherical mass B
* By Result 2,
* Gravitation field at P due to shell A = 0, and
* By Result 1,
* Gravitation field at P due to spherical mass B
* \(G\frac{M_{B}}{r^{2}}\) where \(M_{B}\) is the mass of the spherical mass B\[\text{But}\qquad M_{B}=\rho\ (\text{Volume of spherical mass B})=\rho(\frac{4\pi^{3}}{3})\]

Hence the gravitational field at P (with \(r<\) radius of the Earth) is:

\[g\qquad=\frac{G}{r^{2}}(\frac{4\pi^{3}\rho}{3})=(\frac{4\pi G\rho}{3})r\]

Since \(\frac{4\pi G\rho}{3}\) is a constant, we see that for \(r<t_{E}\), \(g\propto r\).

A sketch of \(g\) against \(r\) is shown below.

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:36]

\[U_{A}=U_{\infty}=\left[-G\,\frac{Mm}{r_{\ast}}\right]=0\]

Then,

\[U_{B}-U_{A}=U_{B}=-\,G\,\frac{Mm}{r_{B}}\]

Therefore, the gravitational potential energy \(U\) of a test mass \(m\) placed at a distance of \(r\) away from the source mass \(M\), is given by

\[U=-\,G\,\frac{Mm}{r}\]

From the definition of the potential at a point, the potential \(\phi\) at a point at a distance \(r\) away from the source mass \(M\),

\[\phi=\frac{U}{m}\]

\[\Rightarrow\quad\left[\begin{array}{c}\phi=-\frac{GM}{r}\\ \end{array}\right]\]

You may assume that, as the space station is in LEO or MEO, it is in uniform circular motion about the centre of the Earth.

### D6 Adapted from UCLES N08/II/3 and N04/II/3

A satellite of mass \(m\) orbits a planet of mass \(M\) and radius \(R_{\rho}\)with a speed of \(\nu\). The radius of the orbit is \(R\). The satellite and the planet may be considered to be point masses with their masses concentrated at their centres. They may be assumed to be isolated in space.

On the figure, draw the variation with orbital radius of

Your line should extend from \(R=1.5\,R_{\rho}\) to \(R=4\,R_{\rho}\).

A point mass \(m\) is at a distance \(r\) from the centre of the Earth.

**(a)**: Write down an expression, in terms of \(m\), \(r\), the Earth's mass \(m_{E}\) and the gravitational constant \(G\), for the gravitational potential energy \(V\) of the mass. (Consider only values of \(r\) greater than the Earth's radius. Mass of Moon = 7.4 x 10\({}^{22}\) kg; mass of Earth = 6.0 x 10\({}^{24}\) kg.)

Certain meteorites (tektites) found on Earth have a composition identical with that of lunar granite. It is thought that they may be debris from a volcanic eruption on the Moon.
