**The study of kinematics begins with the introduction of precise terminology and language for describing motion, to reduce ambiguity in expression and confusion in thought. Using multiple representations such as motion diagrams, graphs and equations, we can express motion of objects.**

**Introduction**

Kinematics is the branch of mechanics which deals with the description of the motion of bodies. In this chapter, two types of motion will be covered, namely,

along a straight line (rectilinear motion), and

on a plane (non-rectilinear motion).

## Appendix A Terms of Reference for Kinematics

### Distance and Displacement

* Distance is a scalar quantity while displacement is a vector quantity.
* Distance refers to the length of the path travelled by a body regardless of the direction of motion.
* Displacement is the distance of a body or a point, in a specified direction, from reference point.

**Check Your Understanding 1**

When displacement of a body is zero, the distance travelled by the body must be zero. (True / False)

### Speed and Velocity

Speed is a scalar quantity while velocity is a vector quantity.

**Definition:** Speed is distance travelled divided by the time taken.

**Definition:** Velocity is the rate of change of displacement.

Direction of the velocity is the same as the direction of the change in displacement.

### Instantaneous Speed and Velocity versus Average Speed and Velocity

Both average speed and average velocity are measured over a time interval \(\Delta t\). However, the phase "how fast" more commonly refer to how fast a body is moving at a particular instant. Since a moving body often changes its speed during its motion, it is common to distinguish between the average quantity and instantaneous quantity.

* **Instantaneous speed** is the speed at a particular point or a particular instant of time. Instantaneous speed = 

* **Instantaneous velocity**\(\nu\) is the average velocity for a diminishing time interval \(\Delta t\).

\[\nu = \text{rate of change of displacement}\ \frac{ds}{dt}\] \[= \text{gradient of displacement-time graph at that instant}\]

Hence **instantaneous velocity** (or simply **velocity**) can be defined as the rate of change of displacement.

**Note:**

The instantaneous speed is always equals to the magnitude of the instantaneous velocity because distance and displacement become the same when they become infinitesimally small.

* **Average speed** refers to the total distance travelled divided by the total time taken. Average speed is 

* **Average velocity** refers to the total change in displacement of the body divided by the total time interval. average velocity = 

### Some examples of speeds

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:4]

## Appendix A Anderson Serangoon Junior College

### Acceleration

**Definition:** Acceleration is the rate of change of velocity.

Acceleration is a vector quantity. S.I. unit is written as m s\({}^{2}\).

**Average acceleration** of any body is calculated using the equation:

\[<a>\frac{\Delta v}{\Delta t}=\frac{\nu-u}{\Delta t}\]

where \(u=\) initial velocity \(v=\) final velocity after the time interval \(\Delta t\)

In practice both velocity and acceleration can be taken to mean instantaneous velocity and instantaneous acceleration.

* **Instantaneous acceleration** = \(\frac{d\nu}{dt}\) = gradient of velocity-time graph at that instant

* A body is accelerating if and only if it is changing its velocity. This can be shown in several ways:

* by change in magnitude only, i.e. the speed changes while the direction remains the same;
* by a change in direction only, e.g., a body moving with constant speed in a circular path; or
* by a change in magnitude and direction simultaneously.

How do we know if the body has no acceleration?

* whether by a constant amount or a varying amount
- then it is accelerating.

* Conversely, a body with a constant velocity is not accelerating.

Constant acceleration means that the velocity is changing by a constant amount

* **Deceleration** means that body is **slowing down**, regardless of direction of motion.

Note: While acceleration can have a positive or negative value, deceleration can only have a positive value.

Example 3

A car was travelling with an initial velocity \(u\) m s\({}^{\text{-1}}\). After a time interval of \(\Delta t\), it is moving at \(v\) m s\({}^{\text{-1}}\). In the table below, calculate the acceleration for each time interval and state the corresponding type of motion.

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|} \hline \(u\)\(l\)\(m\) s\({}^{\text{-1}}\) & \(v\)\(l\)\(m\) s\({}^{\text{-1}}\) & \(\Delta t\)/s & \(a\)/ m s\({}^{\text{-2}}\) & **Motion of the car** \\ \hline
5.0 & 20 & 3.0 & 5.0 & Speeding up \\ \hline -5.0 & -20 & 5.0 & \\ \hline -30 & -14 & 2.0 & \\ \hline
25 & 2.0 & 4.0 & \\ \hline
10 & -5.0 & 3.0 & \\ \hline \end{tabular}

* Direction of acceleration same as direction of velocity \(\rightarrow\) body speeds up
* Direction of acceleration opposite to direction of velocity \(\rightarrow\) body slows down

Check Your Understanding 2

Negative acceleration means the body is slowing down. (True / False)

Graphical representations offer an overall description of the motion of the bodies. The two main areas of focus in graphical appreciation are: Area and Gradient. Graphically, when plotting a dependent quantity \(\nu\) against time (horizontal axis-time), the gradient represents the rate of change of \(\nu\).

The 3 main types of graphs and their relationships can be summarized as below.

**Worked Example**

A car is travelling with uniform acceleration along a straight road. The road has marker posts every 100 m. When the car passes one post, it has a speed of 10 m s-1, and when it passes the next one, its speed is 20 m s-1. Calculate the car's acceleration.

**Example 5**

A motorcar, starting from rest, has an acceleration of 2.6 m s2. After it has travelled a distance of 120 m, it slows down at a rate of 1.5 m s-2 until its velocity is 12 m s-1. Calculate the final displacement of the motorcar from the starting point.

### Motion in the Presence of Air Resistance

* In the presence of air resistance, a falling body will not accelerate uniformly. The air resistance opposes the motion of the body.
* Air resistance or viscous force is a function of the speed of the body. It is proportional to speed when speed is low, and is proportional to (speed)\({}^{2}\) when speed is high.
* Consider a body falling in air,

* When a body falls in air, the air resistance opposing its motion increases as its speed rises, thereby reducing its acceleration
* Eventually, air resistance acting upwards equals the weight of the body which acts downwards. The resultant force on the body is then zero (since the two opposing force balance each other) and hence the net acceleration is then zero. The body then falls with a constant velocity, called **terminal velocity**.
* The value of terminal velocity depends on the size, shape and weight of the body.
* A small dense body such as steel ball-bearing has high terminal velocity. A light body such as a raindrop or one with a large surface area such as a parachute has low terminal velocity.

**Example 7**: Consider a body being dropped from rest with initial velocity \(u=0\). Taking the point of projection as reference and downwards as the positive direction, sketch the \(a\)-\(t\), \(\nu\)-\(t\) and \(s\)-\(t\) graphs for motions **(a)** without air resistance and **(b)** with air resistance

## Appendix A Detailed Comparison of Body Motions with and without air resistance

A ball is thrown vertically upwards with an initial velocity \(\nu_{0}\).

No air resistance :

[https://www.vg.utube.com/wat/whit.htm](https://www.vg.utube.com/wat/whit.htm)

The graphs below depicts its velocity of the ball from the point of throwing, until the ball reaches the thrower's hand in the case when

* air resistance is neglected (Graph A)
* air resistance is considered (Graph B)

Taking upward as positive

Without Air Resistance (Graph A)

Constant negative slope because the only force acting on the ball is gravity (neglect air resistance).

Net force is the force of gravity, magnitude of acceleration = 9.81m s\({}^{2}\).

With Air Resistance (Graph B)

There are two forces acting on body.

* A downward weight.
* Retarding force, which is downward when body is going up, and upward when body is coming down.

Resultant acceleration is due to these two forces.

Anderson Serangoon Junior College

Physics 9749 / 8867

There are six features to note about the graphs.

1. Slope for graph B during the upward journey is steeper than graph A

* In graph B, force of gravity and drag force act on ball in the same direction.
* Larger net force (since both forces act downwards) acting on the ball in graph B as compared to graph A.
* Graph A has only gravity as its net force.
* Larger acceleration, steeper slope on the velocity-time graph.

2. Slope for graph B during the downward journey is center than graph A
* R) in the downwards direction.
* Acceleration (gradient of graph B) of the ball in graph B would be gentler as compared to graph A.

3. Slope for graph B equals that of graph A at the maximum height
* Drag force is proportional to the speed of the body.
* Ball at instantaneous rest
* No drag force and net force is force of gravity.
* Magnitude of acceleration is 9.81m s\({}^{-2}\).

4. Area under graph B for upward journey is less than that of graph A
* Some energy is lost due to friction when the ball travels with air resistance.
* Only part of the kinetic energy is being converted to gravitational potential energy, results in lower height
* Area under \(\nu t\) graph represents change in displacement.
* Smaller area in graph B to represent lower height.
* For graph A, neglecting air resistance, all the kinetic energy converted to gravitational potential energy and the ball reaches a greater height.

5. Time to reach maximum height is less than time taken to come down for graph B
* As body is going up, retarding force and weight are in same direction.
* As body is coming down, retarding force and weight are in opposite direction.
* Magnitude of resultant acceleration as body is going up is larger than the magnitude of resultant acceleration as body is coming down.
* Area on the upward journey is equal to the area of the downwards journey, thus causing \(t_{\nu}<t_{\delta}\).

6. For graph B, Magnitude of \(\nu_{\delta}\) is less than that for \(\nu_{\delta}\)
* Velocity with which the ball leaves the thrower's hand is \(\nu_{\delta}\).
* Velocity of the ball just before it reaches the thrower's hand is \(-\nu_{\delta}\).
* Magnitude of \(\nu_{\delta}\) is less than that for \(\nu_{\delta}\).
* Throughout the journey, energy is lost as heat due to the air resistance.
* Kinetic energy when the ball returns is less than that when it leaves the hand. Since KE = \(\%\) mv\({}^{2}\), smaller KE means smaller speed.
