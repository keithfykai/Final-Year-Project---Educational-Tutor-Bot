CHAPTER ANALYSIS

Solving simultaneous equations in two variables by substitution, with one of the equations being a linear equation

Relatively straight forward chapter

1 key concept

Concepts usually tested as a stand-alone topic but conceptually can be tested in other topics (Coordinate Geometry, Equations it inequalities etc...)

EXAM

Easy to make careless mistakes if not weary on substitution and expansion in Algebra

Medium overall weightage

Tested consistently every year

Typically, an 6m question, 1 question in one of the papers

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:3]

**Example:**

Solve the following simultaneous equations

\(y-2x=1\)

\(y-4x=-3\)

Solution

From Equation (1),

\(y=1+2x\)

\((3)\)

Substitute Equation (3) into Equation (1)

\((1+2x)-4x=-3\)

\(x=2\)

Substitute \(x=2\) into Equation (3),

\(y=1+2(2)\)

=5

**Take Note**

Questions asking for the points of intersection between 2 lines is also using simultaneous equations

**Simultaneous Equations**

Set of equations that have common unknowns

**Linear Equations [Assumed knowledge from E-Math]**

**2** known methods to solving

**Elimination [Not recommended unless obvious]**

**Nuttiply or divide either one or both linear equations by a constant so that they can contain an identical term**

**Eliminate the identical term by subtracting or adding the equations to obtain an equation with only one unknown**

**Use this equation to solve for the unknown and substitute the result into either one of the original equations to solve for the other unknown**

Substitution

Express one of the unknowns in one of the linear equations in terms of the other unknown

Substitute the transformed equation into the other linear equation to obtain an equation with only one unknown

Use this equation to solve for the unknown and substitute the result into either one of the original equations to solve for the other unknownExample:

Solve the following simultaneous equations

\(3x^{2}+y^{2}=28\)...... (1)

\(3x+y=8\)... (2)

Solution

From Equation (2),

\(y=8-3x\)... (3)

Substitute Equation (3) into Equation (1)

\(3x^{2}+(8-3x)^{2}=28\)

\(3x^{2}+64-48x+9x^{2}=28\)

\(12x^{2}-48x+36=0\)

\(x^{2}-4x+3=0\)

\((x-1)(x-3)=0\)

\(x=1\) or \(x=3\)

Substitute \(x=1\) into Equation (3)

\(y=8-3(1)\)

\(=5\)

Substitute \(x=3\) into Equation (3)

\(y=8-3(3)\)

\(=-1\)

Solution

Express one of the unknowns in one of the linear equations in terms of the other unknown

Substitute the transformed equation into the other linear equation to obtain an equation with only one unknown

Use this equation to solve for the unknown and substitute the result into either one of the original equations to solve for the other unknown 

### Common Mistakes

When dealing with fractions:

\[\left(\frac{x+2}{3}\right)^{2}+3\mathbf{y}=7 \tag{1}\] \[\left(\frac{x^{2}+4x+4}{9}\right)+3\mathbf{y}=7\] (2) \[x^{2}+4x+4+9(3\mathbf{y})=9(7) \tag{3}\]

* Many students will forget to square the denominator when dealing with fractions **[Step 2]**
* Many students will forget to use algebraic identities when expanding the numerator **[Step 2]**
* Many students will forget to muttiply the denominator to **EVERY** single term in the equation to get rid of the denominator **[Step 3]**

### Non-Linear Equations

Personal advice:

**ALWAYS** use the linear equation and make one of the unknowns there the subject. Never use the non-linear equation

In the example above, clearly the circled equation is easier as we do not need to deal with squares in the non-linear equation

If possible, try to avoid making fractions and using fractions during the substitution phase. This is due to the fact that many students always make careless mistakes when manipulating with fractions

In the example above, making y the subject will be easier than x as it does not deal with fractions

In the unfortunate event that fractions are unavoidable, then remember that when removing the denominators, it must be untributed to every single term in the equation
