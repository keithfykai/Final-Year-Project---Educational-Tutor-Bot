#### 1.1.1 Amines

Simple amines are named by adding the suffix -_amine_ to the name of the longest alkyl group that is attached to the nitrogen atom.

The longest carbon chain containing the amine group is considered the parent structure. Number the alkane chain beginning at the end nearer the amine group.

**Note:** An alternative way of naming amines is to replace the final - in the name of the parent compound with the suffix -_amine_.

In secondary and tertiary amines, the capital N denotes the location of the substituents directly attached to the nitrogen atom.

If there is a functional group of higher priority, the -NH\({}_{2}\) group can be considered as an _amino_ substituent in the prefix.

#### 1.1.2 Amides

Primary amides with an unsubstituted -NH\({}_{2}\) group are named by replacing the -_oic acid_ of the parent carboxylic acid with -_amide_.

If the nitrogen atom is further substituted, the location of the substituent group is denoted by a capital N.

In the aqueous medium, the basicity trend in ammonia, primary and secondary amine is the same as in gaseous phase. However, tertiary amines are less basic than secondary and primary amines in aqueous medium because:

1. The bulky alkyl groups attached directly to N atom hinder the donation of its lone pair to form a bond with a proton.
2. The resulting conjugate acids are not as effectively solvated through hydrogen bonding by the surrounding water molecules (absent in gaseous phase) as compared to conjugate acids of primary and secondary amines. Thus, the conjugate acids are less stable, resulting in tertiary amines to ionise in water to a smaller extent.

###phenylamines

Phenylamines are considerably less basic than ammonia. This is because in phenylalanine, the lone pair of electron on nitrogen is delocalized into the benzene ring. This decreases the electron density on the nitrogen atom, making the lone pair of electrons less available to form a dative bond with a proton.

Figure 1: Resonance structure of phenylamines

#### 3.2.1 Substituted Phenylamines

Their relative basicity depends on the nature of the substituent attached to the benzene ring.

Electron-donating groups increase electron density on the benzene ring, making the lone pair of electrons on nitrogen atom more available for donation to an acid. Hence these substituted phenylamines are more basic than phenylamine.

Electron-withdrawing groups decrease electron density on the benzene ring, making the lone pair of electrons on nitrogen atom less available for donation to an acid. Hence, these substituted phenylamines are less basic than phenylamine.

### Amides

_LO 19(9): explain why amide is neutral in terms of delocalisation of the lone pair of electrons on nitrogen_

Amides give neutral solutions in water (not basic). The delocalisation of the lone pair of electrons on the nitrogen atom over the C=0 bond reduces the electron density on the nitrogen atom such that the lone pair of electrons on the nitrogen atom is not available for protonation.

## 5 REACTIONS OF AMIHES AND AMIDS

### Amines

The chemistry of amines is dominated by the lone pair of electrons on nitrogen atom. They can behave:

* as bases (donating the lone pair to a H\({}^{+}\) ion or an acid)
* as good nucleotides (being able to attack at the partial positive end of a polarized bond)
* refer to Topic 22; Chemistry of the Transition Elements

#### 5.1.1 Reaction with acids

_10 19(b): describe the reaction of amines in the formation of salts_

Amines (both aliphatic and phenylamines) can act as a base to react with acids (mineral or carboxylic acids) to form salts.

Amines with bulky R-groups are insoluble in water (forming two immiscible layer when mixed) due to the presence of non-polar hydrocarbon skeleton which hinder the formation of hydrogen bonds with water molecules.

However, soluble ionic salts are formed through acid-base reaction when acids are added. The ionic salts are soluble in water (forming a homogeneous solution as they can form favourable ion-dipole interaction with water molecules) but insoluble in organic solvents. Thus an amine can be separated from other organic compounds by converting it to a water-soluble ammonium salt. You may refer to Topic 8: Introduction to Organic Chemistry on the details of the extraction procedure.

#### 5.2.1 Reduction of amides

Amides can be reduced to amines by lithium aluminium hydride.

#### 5.2.2 Hydrolysis of amides

Amides can be hydrolysed by aqueous acids (e.g. dil H\({}_{2}\)SO\({}_{4}\)) or alkalis (e.g. dil NaOH) when heated under reflux to yield the carboxylic acid or salt respectively. Although the exact same bond is cleaved in both acidic and alkaline hydrolysis, the products of hydrolysis depend on the pH of the environment.

2.3 Reagents and conditions: dilute NaOH, heat under reflux, followed by acidification with dilute H\({}_{2}\)SO\({}_{4}\) to yield the carboxylic acid

Ammonia will be produced if the primary amides undergo alkaline hydrolysis (a distinguishing test). For substituted amides, amines are formed instead.

### Acid-Base behaviour

Having both the acidic and basic groups, amino acids are amphoteric, reacting with both acids and bases to form ionic salts.

Isoelectric point (pl) of an amino acid (or protein) is the pH at which the overall net charge on the amino acid is zero and it exists primarily as the neutral zwitterion. This isoelectric pH depends on the nature of the side chain, R.

Figure 6.1: Draw the structures of the major species of lysine that can exist in aqueous solution of various pH. Start with the species in a solution of very low pH and consider the change in structure as pH increases. Hence identify the major species that exists at isoelectric point.

### 6.4 Titration curves of amino acids (Application Example)

Titration of amino acids are very similar to the titration of polyprotein acids. Refer to. Topic 15 Acid-Base Equilibria for titration curves and polyprotein acids.

Using glycine as an example,

At pH < 2.34, all possible sites of glycine are protonated. Since -CO3H group is a stronger acid than -NH3 group, the stronger acidic -CO2H group will be neutralised first by the addition of base, OH - followed by the -NH3 group: The reaction is as follows:

In the titration curve, the protonated (cationic) form of glycine was titrated against NaOH of same concentration. The cationic form predominates at low pH before OH - is added. When some OH- is added, a portion of the cationic form undergoes neutralisation to form zwitterion, resulting in buffer region **X** (mixture of cationic form and zwitterion).

Note that when 0.5 equivalent of OH- is added, amount of cationic form unreacted = amount of zwitterion formed. This is the maximum buffering capacity where pH=PK3.

The solution only contains zwitterion when at the first equivalence point and pH = pI of glycine.

As more OH- is added, the -NH3 group is neutralised to form the anionic form, leading to a new buffer mixture containing zwitterion and the anionic form in region **Y**. Note that when 1.5 equivalent of OH- is added, amount of zwitterion unreacted = amount of anionic form produced. This is the maximum buffering capacity where pH=PK3.

At the second equivalence point and beyond, all sites are de-protonated and the solution only contains the anionic form of glycine.

### Peptide bond formation to form polypeptides and proteins

_LO 19(l): describe the formation of peptide (amde) bonds between a-amino acids and, hence, explain protein formation_

Amino acids are the basic units of polypeptides and proteins. An amide bond between amino acids is also called a peptide bond. Peptide bonds are formed from the condensation reaction between the \(-\)CO\({}_{2}\)H and the \(-\)NH\({}_{2}\) groups on two amino acids through the elimination of a water molecule. In this manner, any number of amino acids can be bonded in a continuous chain.

**A dipeptide** is the result of 2 amino acid molecules condensing together to form a peptide bond with the elimination of a water molecule while a **tripeptide** results from 3 amino acids molecules doing so with the formation of two peptide bonds and the elimination of two water molecules, and so on.

**Lecture Exercise 6.2**

A small peptide X is hydrolys according to the following reaction.

**Note:** In the lab, the reaction between a carboxylic acid and an amine would result in salt formation, but living organisms employ enzymes to form peptide bonds.

### 7.1 Hydrolysis of Proteins

_LO 19(k): describe the hydrolysis of proteins_

Proteins can by hydrolys into their constituent amino acids either by an appropriate enzyme or heating under reflux in the presence of aqueous acid or alkali for several hours in the laboratory.
