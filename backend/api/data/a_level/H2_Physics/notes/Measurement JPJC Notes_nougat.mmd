## Introduction

* Physics aims to understand the natural world around us and to represent the various phenomenon via mathematical relationships. Scientific experiments are then designed to test out the validity of the mathematical relationships.
* Such experiments involve the measurements of various physical quantities. The reliability of the measurements is important so as to correctly verify the concepts and theories. The precisions of any experimental results should also be quoted to an appropriate numbers of significant figures to reflect on the order or accuracy.
* In this lecture, we will learn to use different physical quantities, their SI units and how to work with the errors and uncertainties incurred when taking measurements. We will also be learning the classification of physical quantities as scalars or vectors, the addition and subtraction of vectors and the resolving of a vector into its components.

### 1 Sl units

_(a)_ _Candidates should be able to recall the following base quantities and their units: mass (kg), length (m), time (s), current (A), temperature (K), amount of substance (mol)._

### 1 Physical quantities

* Physical quantities are quantities that can be measured.
* A physical quantity consists of a numerical value and a unit.
* For example, the height of a man is about 1.70 m.

In experiments, instruments are used for the measurement and recording of various physical quantities. Some examples are:

\begin{tabular}{|l|c|} \hline
**Physical quantity** & **Instrument** \\ \hline Mass, weight & Spring balance, lever balance \\ \hline Length & Ruler, vernier callipers, micrometer screw gauge \\ \hline Time & Stopwatch, clock, cathode ray oscilloscope \\ \hline Temperature & Thermometer \\ \hline Angle & Protractor \\ \hline Electric current & Ammeter \\ \hline Potential difference & Voltmeter \\ \hline \end{tabular}

In 1960, the international scientific community adopted a number of conventions about physical quantities and their units. The _Systeme Internationale d'Unites_ (International System of Units) is based on seven base quantities and their corresponding units, called _base units_.

### Base quantities and base units

Base quantities are physical quantities that are fundamental and are not defined in terms of other physical quantities.

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|} \hline
**base quantity** & **usual symbol for** & **SI base unit** & **symbol for** \\  & **base quantity** & & **base unit** \\ \hline Mass & \(m\) & kilogram & kg \\ \hline Length & \(l\) & metre & m \\ \hline Time & \(t\) & second & s \\ \hline Electric current & \(I\) & ampere & A \\ \hline Thermodynamic Temperature & \(T\) & kelvin & K \\ \hline Amount of & & mole & mol \\ substance & & & \\ \hline Luminous intensity\({}^{\star}\) & \(L\) & candela & cd \\ \hline \multicolumn{3}{l}{\({}^{\star}\)not in syllabus} \\ \end{tabular}

There are other physical quantities such as velocity and pressure that need to be measured. Such physical quantities are called derived quantities.

_Candidates should be able to express derived units as products or quotients of the base units and use the named units listed in 'Summary of Key Quantities, Symbols and Units' as appropriate._

### Derived quantities and derived units

Derived quantities are physical quantities that are defined in terms of base quantities according to a defining equation.

For example, velocity is a derived quantity and it has the defining equation \(\nu=\frac{\text{change in displacement}}{\text{time taken}}\)..

Units of derived quantities are called derived units and are expressed as products or quotients of base units.

Derived units can be obtained from the defining equation as follows:

The defining equation for velocity is \(\nu=\frac{\text{change in displacement}}{\text{time taken}}\)..

Hence, the unit of velocity is m s\({}^{-1}\)(metre per second).

_[Note the space break between the m and s\({}^{-1}\)]._In determining derived units, it is important to differentiate between symbols used for the physical quantities and the corresponding symbols for units. A summary of the usual symbols and units for different physical quantities can be found on pages 34 - 35 of the 9749 H2 Physics syllabus document (www.seab.gov.sg).

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|} \hline Derived & Defining equation & Derived unit & Usual unit \\ \hline acceleration & \(\frac{\text{change in velocity}}{\text{time}}=\frac{\nu-u}{t}\) & \(\frac{\text{m s}^{-1}}{\text{s}}=\text{m s}^{-2}\) & - \\ \hline force & \(\frac{\text{change in momentum}}{\text{time}}\) & \(\frac{\text{kg m s}^{-1}}{\text{s}}=\text{kg m s}^{-2}\) & newton (N) \\ \hline pressure & \(\frac{\text{force}}{\text{area}}=\frac{F}{A}\) & \(\frac{\text{kg m s}^{-2}}{\text{m}^{2}}\) & \multirow{2}{*}{} \\  & \(\frac{\text{force}}{\text{area}}=\frac{F}{A}\) & \(=\text{kg m}^{-1}\text{ s}^{-2}\) & \multirow{2}{*}{} \\  & \(\frac{\text{force}}{\text{area}}\times\text{displacement in the direction of the force }=\text{$F$s}\) & \(\text{kg m s}^{-2}\) & \\ \hline power & \(\frac{\text{work}}{\text{time}}=\frac{E}{t}\) & \(\frac{\text{kg m}^{2}\text{ s}^{-2}}{\text{s}}\) & \multirow{2}{*}{} \\  & \(\frac{\text{work}}{\text{time}}=\frac{E}{t}\) & \(=\text{kg m}^{2}\text{ s}^{-3}\) & \\ \hline potential difference & \(\frac{\text{work}}{\text{charge}}=\frac{E}{Q}\) & \(\frac{\text{kg m}^{2}\text{ s}^{-2}}{\text{A s}}\) & \(\text{volt (V)}\) \\ \hline \end{tabular}

### Dimensionless quantities and dimensionless constants

* Dimensionless quantities are physical quantities that have no units. Some examples are refractive index and relative molecular mass.
* All real numbers and some mathematical constants like \(\pi\) have no units. They are called dimensionless constants.
* Note: Some physical quantities that are constants have units. Some examples are: \[\begin{array}{l}\circ\text{acceleration of free fall, }g=9.81\text{ m s}^{-2},\\ \circ\text{elementary charge, }\text{e}=1.60\times 10^{-19}\text{C}\end{array}\]_(c) Candidates should be able to use SI base units to check the homogeneity of physical equations._

### Homogeneity of equations

* An equation is called homogeneous or dimensionally consistent if every term on both sides of the equation has the same units. That is, units on the LHS = units on the RHS.
* For example, for an equation W = X + Y, the units of the physical quantities W, X and Y must be the same.
* Base units can be used to check the homogeneity of physical equations.

**Example 1**

Check whether the following equations are homogeneous and state whether they are physically correct.

(a) \(\nu=u+at\)

(b) \(\nu=u+2at\)

(c) \(s=ut+at\)

where s is displacement, \(\nu\) is final velocity, \(u\) is initial velocity and \(a\) is acceleration.

**Solution:**

(a) \(\nu=u+at\)

Unit of v = m s\({}^{-1}\) (unit of velocity)

Unit of \(u=\) m s\({}^{-1}\) (unit of velocity)

Unit of \(at\) = m s\({}^{-2}\times\) s = m s\({}^{-1}\)

Hence equation is homogeneous. This is physically correct.

(b) \(\nu=u+2at\)

Unit of \(\nu=\) m s\({}^{-1}\)

Unit of \(u=\) m s\({}^{-1}\)

Unit of \(2at=\) m s\({}^{-2}\times\) s = m s\({}^{-1}\)

Hence equation is homoeneous. But it is not physically correct.

(c) \(s=ut+at\)

Unit of s = m

Unit of \(ut=\) m s\({}^{-1}\times\) s = m

Unit of \(at=\) m s\({}^{-2}\times\) s = m s\({}^{-1}\)

Equation is not homogeneous and thus definitely physically incorrect.

An equation that is physically correct must be dimensionally consistent or homoeneous.

However, note that an equation that is dimensionally consistent or homogeneous may NOT be physically correct.

**Example 2**

In the ideal gas law, \(\rho V=nRT\) where \(n\) is the number of moles of gas, \(p\) is pressure, \(V\) is gas volume and \(T\) is the thermodynamic temperature. What are the possible units of \(R\)?

**Solution:**

\(\rho V=nRT\)

\(R=\dfrac{pV}{nT}\)

Units of \(R=\dfrac{\left(\text{kg m}^{-1}\text{ s}^{-2}\right)\text{m}^{3}}{\left(\text{ mol}\right)\text{K}}=\text{kg m}^{2}\text{ s}^{-2}\text{ mol}^{-1}\text{K}^{-1}\)

**Example 3**

Bernoulli's equation, which applies to fluid flow, states that

\[p+hpg+\dfrac{1}{2}\rho v^{2}=k\]

where \(p\) is a pressure, \(h\) a height, \(\rho\) a density, \(g\) an acceleration, \(v\) a velocity and \(k\) a constant. Show that the equation is dimensionally consistent and state an SI unit for \(k\).

**Solution:**

(a) Since \(p=\dfrac{F}{A}\),

units of \(p\) \(=\dfrac{\text{units of }F}{\text{units of }A}\)

\(=\dfrac{\text{kg m}\text{ s}^{-2}}{\text{m}^{2}}\)

\(=\text{kg m}^{-1}\text{ s}^{-2}\)

units of \(h\rho g\)\(=\)units of \(h\)\(\times\) units of \(\rho\)\(\times\) units of \(g\)

\(=\)m kg m\({}^{-3}\) m s\({}^{-2}\)

\(=\)kg m\({}^{-1}\) s\({}^{-2}\)

units of \(\dfrac{1}{2}\rho v^{2}\) \(=\)units of \(\rho\)\(\times\) units of \(v^{2}\)

\(=\)kg m\({}^{-3}\) \(\left(\text{m s}^{-1}\right)^{2}\)

\(=\)kg m\({}^{-1}\) s\({}^{-2}\)

Since the terms separated by the addition signs have the same SI base units, the equation is dimensionally consistent. Hence, the SI base units of \(k\) should be kg m\({}^{-1}\) s\({}^{-2}\).

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:7]

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|} \hline \(T/K\) & \(\dfrac{1}{T}/K^{-1}\) & \(\dfrac{1}{T}/10^{-3}K^{-1}\) \\ \hline
273 & 0.00366 & 3.66 \\ \hline
283 & 0.00353 & 3.53 \\ \hline
293 & 0.00341 & 3.41 \\ \hline \end{tabular}

However column 3 is preferred as it gives a better representation.

Although the labelling of the two axes shown below are correct, the latter gives a better presentation.

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|} \hline \(t\) & \(t\) & \(t\) \\ \hline \(t\) & \(t\) & \(t\) \\ \hline \(t\) & \(t\) & \(t\) \\ \hline \(t\) & \(t\) & \(t\) \\ \hline \(t\) & \(t\) & \(t\) \\ \hline \(t\) & \(t\) & \(t\) \\ \hline \(t\) & \(t\) & \(t\) \\ \hline \end{tabular}

_Candidates should be able to make reasonable estimates of physical quantities included within the syllabus._

### Estimates Order of magnitude of physical quantities

* The ability to estimate the value of a physical quantity and to compute an approximate answer is a necessary skill in problem solving. The estimated answer can serve as a check on the calculation.
* In making an estimation or approximation of the physical quantities, it is usually necessary to make some assumptions.

**Example 4**

What is a reasonable estimate for the amount of energy needed to boil a flask of water? The energy needed is given by \(Q=mc\Delta\theta\) where \(c\) is the specific heat capacity of water and is approximately \(4.2x10^{3}Jkg^{-1}K^{-1}\).

**Solution:**

Estimated room temperature = 30 \({}^{\circ}\)C

Thus, \(\Delta\theta=70K\).

What about the mass of water?

Estimated volume of normal flask = 1.5 litres.

Thus, the mass of water is about 1.5 kg.

The estimated amount of energy needed \(Q=mc\Delta\theta=(1.5)\big{(}4.2\times 10^{3}\big{)}70=4.4\times 10^{5}J\)Some estimation are only to the 'power of ten' of the number that describes that physical quantity. This is referred to as an _order of magnitude_ of the physical quantity.

Physical quantity Estimate / Order of Magnitude

Diameter of a nucleus 10\({}^{-15}\) m

Diameter of an atom 10\({}^{-10}\) m

Weight of a man 10\({}^{3}\) N

Weight of a car 10\({}^{4}\) N

### Units Conversion

* Sometime physical quantities are given in units other than S.I. Units. For calculation in Physics, the values have to be converted to S.I. Units.
* 1 cm\({}^{3}\) = \(\alpha\)m\({}^{3}\)
* 60 km h\({}^{-1}\) = \(\alpha\)m s\({}^{-1}\)
* 1 g cm\({}^{-3}\) = \(\alpha\)kg m\({}^{-3}\)
* _Candidates should be able to show an understanding of the distinction between systematic errors (including zero errors) and random errors._

**2 Errors and uncertainties**

* When an experimenter conducts an experiment and uses the instruments to take readings, the experimenter has to depend on his own skills to obtain as accurate a reading as possible.
* However, each instrument also has a _limit of accuracy_ within which the experimenter is working with.
* Thus, physical quantities _cannot_ be measured exactly with any instrument.
* Errors are _uncertainties_ in measurements. They may arise due to: (a) the measuring instruments used, (b) the techniques or skills of the experimenter, (c) the surrounding physical conditions, (d) the experimental design or method used. These errors caused measurements to deviate from their actual or true values.

### Systematic and Random Errors

* There are two types of errors; systematic and random.
* The table below shows the comparison between a systematic and a random error.

\begin{tabular}{l|l} Systematic error & Random error \\ \hline Definition: & Definition: \\ Systematic errors result in readings & Random errors result in a scatter of readings about a mean value, such that the readings have an equal chance of being over or under its true or actual value. \\ \hline The error is thus systematic if: & The error is thus random if: \\ (a) repeated measurements under the same conditions yield the same error in magnitude and sign. & (a) repeated measurements results in errors with different magnitudes and signs. \\ (b) its value changes in a predictable manner. & Reducing Error: \\ Systematic errors can be reduced by using good experimental techniques, replacing faulty equipment or via calibration curves. & Random errors can be reduced by taking an average of several readings. \\ Systematic errors cannot be eliminated by taking an average of several readings. & This is as random errors tend to cancel each other out when taking average as both positive and negative errors are equally likely to occur. \\ \hline Examples & Examples \\ Zero errors on instruments. & Random parallax error when reading a scale. \\ \end{tabular} For example, when the gap of a micrometer screw gauge is closed, its reading is not zero but +0.01 mm. The zero error thus caused the measurement to be larger than the actual value. If the zero error is -0.01 mm, then the measurement will be smaller than the actual value.

To reduce the error, the zero error should be subtracted from the measured value to obtain the actual value.

The error may be reduced by having the scale as close as possible to the object to be measured, and viewing the scale with the line of sight perpendicular to the scale.

Reaction time of the experimenter. Random error due to irregularity of a physical quantity. For example, in a time measurement, there may be a consistent delay between the experimenter observing an event and starting a stopwatch. The error may be reduced by starting and stopping the stopwatch to the same stimulus.

For example, the diameter of a rod is not uniform and this causes random error in the measurement of its diameter.

The error may be reduced by starting and stopping the stopwatch to the same stimulus.

The error may be reduced by measuring the diameter at several positions along the length of the rod, and then averaging.

_(k)_: _Candidates should be able to show an understanding of the distinction between precision and accuracy._

### Precision and Accuracy

#### 2.2.1 Accuracy

Accuracy is the degree of closeness the measurements are to the true value. Accurate measurements will have readings that are close to the actual or true value of the physical quantity.

Accuracy depends on the instrument used, the skills of the experimenter and the techniques involved.

#### 2.2.2 Precision

Precision is the degree of agreement of repeated measurements of the same quantity. Precise measurements will have a small spread of readings, resulting in small random errors. Imprecise measurements will have a large spread of readings and thus large random errors.

On the other hand, precision of a measuring instrument refers to the extent or limit of sensitivity of the physical quantity being measured. For example, the precision of a metre rule is up to 0.1 cm, while the precision of a micrometer screw gauge is up to 0.001 cm. Hence, a micrometer screw gauge is a more precise instrument compared to a metre rule.

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:12]

In deciding which instrument to use when measuring a physical quantity, low fractional or percentage uncertainty is required. For examples, vernier calipers and micrometer screw gauge are used for small readings.

_(I)_: _Candidates should be able to assess the uncertainty in a derived quantity by addition of actual, fractional or percentage uncertainties or by numerical substitution (a rigorous statistical treatment is not required)._

#### 2.3.3 Uncertainties in derived quantities

* The final result of an experiment is seldom obtained by a single measurement. It is usually calculated from an expression containing different measured quantities.
* Consider the measurement of the length of a glass block using a ruler. \(L=(2.1\pm 0.1)\) cm
* \(R_{1}=(0.85\pm 0.05)\) cm
- \(R_{2}=(2.95\pm 0.05)\) cm
* \(L=(R_{2}-R_{1})=2.10\) cm
* What about the uncertainty of the length measurement?
* \(L_{max}=3.00-0.80=2.20\) cm
* \(L_{min}=2.90-0.90=2.00\) cm
* Hence, \(L\) range from \(2.20\) cm to \(2.00\) cm.

Thus, we can write the length as follows:

\(L=l\pm\Delta l=2.1\pm 0.1\) cm

The uncertainty of \(L\) is \(\Delta l=0.1\) cm

It is also obtained as follows: \(\Delta l=\Delta R_{1}+\Delta R_{2}=0.05+0.05=0.1\) cmThe table below shows how the uncertainties of the derived quantities \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), \(D\), \(E\), and \(F\) are calculated. The measured quantities \(x\) and \(y\) have uncertainties \(\Delta x\) and \(\Delta y\) respectively, while \(k\), \(m\) and \(n\) are all dimensionless constants.

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|} \hline Operation & Equation & Uncertainty \\ \hline Addition & \(A=mx+ny\) & Absolute uncertainty, \(\Delta A=m\Delta x+n\Delta y\) \\ \hline Subtraction & \(B=mx-ny\) & Absolute uncertainty, \(\Delta B=m\Delta x+n\Delta y\) \\ \hline Multiplication & \(C=k\alpha y\) & Fractional uncertainty, \(\frac{\Delta C}{C}=\frac{\Delta x}{x}+\frac{\Delta y}{y}\) \\ \hline Division & \(D=k\frac{x}{y}\) & Fractional uncertainty, \(\frac{\Delta D}{D}=\frac{\Delta x}{x}+\frac{\Delta y}{y}\) \\ \hline Product with powers & \(E=k\alpha^{m}y^{n}\) & Fractional uncertainty, \(\frac{\Delta E}{E}=m\frac{\Delta x}{x}+n\frac{\Delta y}{y}\) \\ \hline Quotient with powers & \(F=k\frac{x^{m}}{y^{n}}\) & Fractional uncertainty, \(\frac{\Delta F}{F}=m\frac{\Delta x}{x}+n\frac{\Delta y}{y}\) \\ \hline \end{tabular}

#### 2.3.4 Significant figures

* The number of significant figures in a result is simply the number of figures that are known with some degree of reliability.
* Thus, it will be sufficient to give uncertainties to one significant figure (s.f.).
* The measured quantities are then rounded off to the same decimal place (d.p.) as the uncertainties.

Note:

1. All uncertainties are rounded off to 1 significant figure.
2. The derived quantity is then rounded off to the same decimal place as its uncertainty.

Thus, in measuring the length of the glass block, \(L=2.1\pm 0.1\) cm.

\(L=2.10\pm 0.10\) cm is wrong because uncertainty written has 2 significant figure. Uncertainty can only has 1 s.f.

\(L=2.10\pm 0.1\) cm is wrong because the length should be expressed to 1 dp, same number of dp as its uncertainty.

**Example 5**

A rectangle has a length \(l\) = (34.3 \(\pm\) 0.1) cm and breadth \(b\) = (21.8 \(\pm\) 0.1) cm. Calculate the perimeter \(P\) and area \(A\) of the rectangle and express their values with their absolute uncertainties.

**Solution:**

\(P=2l+2b=2\times\)(34.3+ 21.8) = 112.2 cm

\(\Delta P=2\Delta l+2\Delta b=2\times\)(0.1 + 0.1) = 0.4 cm (to 1 s.f.)

\(\therefore P=(112.2\pm 0.4)\) cm (to 1 dp, similar to dp of uncertainty)

\(A=lb=34.3\times 21.8=747.74\) cm\({}^{2}\)

\(\Delta A=\frac{\Delta l}{l}+\frac{\Delta b}{b}=\frac{0.1}{34.3}+\frac{0.1}{21.8 }=0.00750\)

\(\Delta A=\)0.00750\(\times\)\(A=0.00750\times\)747.74 = 5.61 cm\({}^{2}\) = 6 cm\({}^{2}\) (to 1 s.f.)

\(\therefore A=(748\pm 6)\) cm\({}^{2}\)

**Example 6**

In a simple pendulum experiment to determine the acceleration due to gravity \(g\), the equation used is \(T=2\pi\sqrt{\frac{l}{g}}\), where \(T\) is the period and \(l\) is the length of the pendulum. The values for \(T\) and \(l\) are \(\left(2.16\pm 0.01\right)\) s and \(\left(1.150\pm 0.005\right)\) m respectively. Determine the value of \(g\) with its uncertainty.

**Solution:**

Rearranging the equation, we have \(g=\frac{4\pi^{2}l}{T^{2}}\).

\(g=\frac{4\pi^{2}\times 1.150}{2.16^{2}}\)

\(g=9.7308\) m s\({}^{-2}\)

Fractional uncertainty in \(g\), \(\frac{\Delta g}{g}=\frac{\Delta l}{l}+2\frac{\Delta T}{T}\), and we have

\(\frac{\Delta g}{9.7308}=\frac{0.005}{1.150}+2\left(\frac{0.01}{2.16}\right)\)

\(\Delta g=0.1\) m s\({}^{-2}\) (1 s.f.)

Therefore, the value of \(g\) is \(\left(9.7\pm 0.1\right)\) m s\({}^{-2}\).

**Example 7**

A metal cube of side \(L\) has a mass of \(M\).

**(a)** If \(M\) = (0.065 \(\pm\) 0.001) kg  and \(L\) = (0.200 \(\pm\) 0.001) m, determine its density \(\rho\)  and express \(\rho\) with its associated uncertainty.

**(b)** What are the possible errors in the measurements and how can they be reduced?

**(c)** Suggest possible improvements to the determination of the density.

**Solution:**

(a) Density, \(\rho=\dfrac{M}{L^{3}}\) = \(\dfrac{0.065}{0.200^{3}}\) = 8.125 kg m\({}^{-3}\)

\[\begin{array}{l}\text{Fractional error}=\left(\dfrac{\Delta M}{M}\right)+3 \left(\dfrac{\Delta L}{L}\right)\\ =(0.001\ /\ 0.065)+3(0.001\ /\ 0.200)\\ \text{Absolute error, }\Delta\rho=0.0304\times 8.125\\ =0.247\\ =0.2\text{ kg m}^{-3}\text{ (to 1 s.f.)}\end{array}\]

Therefore, density, \(\rho\) = (8.1 \(\pm\) 0.2) kg m\({}^{-3}\)

**(b)** Random error: parallax error in length reading

non-uniformity of the length of the sides of the cube

Systematic error: zero error of weighing balance

zero error of metre rule f: zero mark of ruler is not clear

**(c)** Random error: use a marker/pointer when measuring length

take repeat readings and determine the average length

Systematic error: take into account zero error

Improvements: use vernier calipers to measure length.

**Example 8**: The equation connecting object distance \(u\), image distance \(\nu\) and focal length \(f\) for a lens is \(\dfrac{1}{u}+\dfrac{1}{\nu}=\dfrac{1}{f}\). A student measures values of \(u\) and \(\nu\) with their associated uncertainties, which are \(u=(50\pm 3)\) mm and \(\nu=\left(200\pm 5\right)\) mm. Determine the value of \(f\) with its uncertainty.

**Solution:**

\(\dfrac{1}{f}=\dfrac{1}{50}+\dfrac{1}{200}=40\) mm

To determine \(f_{\max}\),

\(\dfrac{1}{f_{\max}}=\dfrac{1}{u_{\max}}+\dfrac{1}{\nu_{\max}}\)

\(\dfrac{1}{f_{\max}}=\dfrac{1}{53}+\dfrac{1}{205}\)

\(f_{\max}\approx 42.112\) mm

To determine \(f_{\min}\),

\(\dfrac{1}{f_{\min}}=\dfrac{1}{u_{\min}}+\dfrac{1}{\nu_{\min}}\)

\(\dfrac{1}{f_{\min}}=\dfrac{1}{47}+\dfrac{1}{195}\)

\(f_{\max}\approx 37.872\) mm

Therefore, the actual uncertainty in \(f\) is

\(\Delta f=\dfrac{f_{\max}-f_{\min}}{2}\)

\(\Delta f=\dfrac{42.112-37.872}{2}\)

\(\Delta f=2\) mm (1 s.f.)

Therefore, the value of \(f\) is \(\left(40\pm 2\right)\) mm.

**Example 10**:

A car changes its velocity from 30 m s\({}^{-1}\) due East to 25 m s\({}^{-1}\) due South.

Calculate (a) the change in speed, and

(b) the change in velocity of the car.

**Solution:**

(a) Since speed is a scalar quantity, it has a magnitude only. Hence, the change in speed is \(\underline{25-30}=-5\) m s\({}^{-1}\).

(b) Change in velocity, \(\Delta\vec{v}=\vec{v}_{t}-\vec{v}_{i}\)

\(\Delta\vec{v}=\vec{v}_{t}+\left(-\vec{v}_{i}\right)\)

Drawing a vector diagram, we have

Using the Pythagoras' Theorem,

\(\Delta v^{2}={v_{i}}^{2}+{v_{f}}^{2}\)

\(\Delta v^{2}=30^{2}+25^{2}\)

\(\Delta v=39\) m s\({}^{-1}\)

\(\tan\theta=\dfrac{v_{f}}{v_{i}}\)

\(\tan\theta=\dfrac{25}{30}\)

\(\theta=40^{\circ}\)

Therefore, the change in velocity is 39 m s\({}^{-1}\) at an angle of 40\({}^{\circ}\) below the horizontal, as shown in the diagram.

_(i)_ _Candidates should be able to represent a vector as two perpendicular components._

### Components of vectors

* A vector can be split up into two parts which are called the components of the vector. The components are usually chosen to be along two mutually perpendicular directions.
* The process of finding the components is known as resolving the vector into its components.
* For example, the horizontal and vertical components of \(\vec{R}\) are: \[\vec{R}_{x}=\vec{R}\cos\theta\;\;\text{and}\;\;\vec{R}_{y}=\vec{R}\sin\theta\;\; \text{respectively, as shown below.}\] \[\vec{R}_{y}\] \[\vec{R}_{x}\]
* Note that the magnitude of \(\vec{R}\) can be obtained from its components using the Pythagoras' Theorem, where \(R^{2}={R_{x}}^{2}+{R_{y}}^{2}\), and the angle \(\theta\) can be calculated using \(\tan\theta=\dfrac{R_{y}}{R_{x}}\).
* The resolution of vectors into their components provides an alternative way of adding and subtracting vectors, and is useful in determining the resultant vector for more than two vectors.

**Example 11**

Calculate the horizontal and vertical components of a force of 50 N, acting at an angle of 40\({}^{\circ}\) above the horizontal.

**Solution:**

Resolving the force into its components,

\(F_{x}=50\cos 40^{\circ}\)

\(F_{x}=38\) N

\(F_{y}=50\sin 40^{\circ}\)

\(F_{y}=32\) N

Therefore, the horizontal component of the force is 38 N, while the vertical component of the force is 32 N.

**Example 12**

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:22]

A body of weight 100 N rests on a plane which is inclined at 30\({}^{\circ}\) to the horizontal. Calculate the components of the weight parallel to and perpendicular to the plane.

**Solution:**

Resolving the weight into its components,

\(W_{\mu}=100\sin 30^{\circ}\)

\(W_{\mu}=50\) N

\(W_{\perp}=100\cos 30^{\circ}\)

\(W_{\perp}\approx 87\) N

Therefore, the component of the weight parallel to the slope is 50 N, while the component of the weight perpendicular to the slope is 87 N.

**Definitions of SI Base Units**

The **metre** is \((299\ 792\ 458)^{-1}\) of the distance light travels in one second.

The **kilogram** is equal to the mass of the International Prototype kilogram (a platinum-iridium cylinder) kept in Sevres, Paris.

The **second** is defined in terms of 9 192 631 770 periods of a particular wavelength of light emitted by a caesium atom.

The **ampere** is the steady current flowing in two straight, infinitely long and parallel conductors of circular cross-section, placed one metre apart in a vacuum, which will produce a force of \(2\times 10^{-7}\) N acting perpendicularly on a metre length of conductor.

One **kelvin** is exactly \((273.16)^{-1}\) of the temperature interval between absolute zero and the triple point of water.

One **mole** is the amount of any substance containing the same number of elementary units (atoms or molecules) as there are atoms found in 0.012 kg of carbon-12.

The **candela** is the luminous intensity, in the perpendicular direction, of a surface of 1/600 000 square metre of a blackbody at the temperature per square metre.
