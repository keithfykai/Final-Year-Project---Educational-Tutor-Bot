### Boyle's Law

At constant temperature, the **volume** of a given mass of ideal gas is **inversely proportional** to the applied **pressure**.

### Charles' Law

The **volume** of a given mass of ideal gas at constant pressure is **directly proportional** to its **temperature** expressed in **Kelvin**.

### The Combined Gas Law

Combining Avogadro's Law (\(V\!\propto\!n\)), Boyle's Law (\(V\!\propto\!\frac{1}{\rho}\)) and Charles' Law (\(V\!\propto\!T\)), we have:

\[V\!\propto\!\frac{nT}{p}\]

\[V\!=\!\text{constant}\times\frac{nT}{p}\]

\[\frac{pV}{nT}\!=\!\text{constant}\]

The exact value of the constant depends on the amount of gas (n).

Thus for 1 mol of an ideal gas, the constant

(i) is denoted by the symbol \(R\)

(ii) is known as the **molar gas constant**

(iii) has a value of **8.31** J K\({}^{-1}\) mol\({}^{-1}\) (in SI unit)

### The Ideal Gas Equation

Since for 1 mol of gas, \(\frac{pV}{T}\!=\!R\)

Therefore for n mol of gas, \(\frac{pV}{T}\!=\!nR\)

Rearranging, we have the ideal gas equation

**Worked Example 1**

At 150 \(\times\) 10\({}^{3}\) Pa, a fixed mass of an ideal gas occupies 300 \(\times\) 10\({}^{-6}\) m\({}^{3}\) at temperature T. What will be its volume at 250 \(\times\) 10\({}^{3}\) Pa at the same temperature?

Using the ideal gas equation, \(p_{1}V_{1}=nRT-(1)\) and \(p_{2}V_{2}=nRT-(2)\)

Given a fixed amount of ideal gas at constant temperature T, (1) = (2)

\(p_{1}V_{1}=p_{2}V_{2}\)

\((150\times 10^{3})(300\times 10^{-6})=(250\times 10^{3})(V_{2})\)

\(V_{2}=1.80\times 10^{-4}\) m\({}^{3}\)

**Worked Example 2**

A sample of neon gas occupies a volume of 4.0 \(\times\) 10\({}^{-3}\) m\({}^{3}\) at 50 \({}^{\circ}\)C. Determine the new volume occupied by the neon gas when the sample is heated to 80 \({}^{\circ}\)C at constant pressure.

Using the ideal gas equation, \(pV_{t}=nRT_{t}-(1)\) and \(pV_{2}=nRT_{2}-(2)\)

Given a fixed amount of Neon (g) at constant pressure, \(\dfrac{(1)}{(2)}\)

\(\dfrac{V_{t}}{V_{2}}=\dfrac{T_{1}}{T_{2}}\)

\(\dfrac{4.0\times 10^{-3}}{V_{2}}=\dfrac{50+273}{80+273}\)

**Worked Example 3**

An inflated balloon has a volume of 6 dm\({}^{3}\) at sea level (1.0 \(\times\) 10\({}^{5}\) Pa) and is allowed to ascend in altitude until the pressure is 0.45 \(\times\) 10\({}^{5}\) Pa. During ascent, the temperature falls from 22 \({}^{\circ}\)C to -21 \({}^{\circ}\)C. Calculate the volume of the balloon at its final altitude.

Using the ideal gas equation, \(p_{1}V_{t}=nRT_{t}-(1)\) and \(p_{2}V_{2}=nRT_{2}-(2)\)

Given a fixed amount of gas inside the balloon, \(\dfrac{(1)}{(2)}\)

\(\dfrac{p_{1}V_{t}}{p_{2}V_{2}}=\dfrac{T_{1}}{T_{2}}\)

\(\dfrac{(1.0\times 10^{5})(6\times 10^{-3})}{(0.45\times 10^{5})(V_{2})}=\dfrac{(22 +273)}{(-21+273)}\)

\(V_{2}=\dfrac{11.4\times 10^{-3}\) m\({}^{3}}{}\)

**Worked Example 4**:

Tennis balls are usually filled with air or nitrogen gas to a pressure above atmospheric pressure to increase their "bounce". If a particular tennis ball has a volume of 144 cm\({}^{3}\) and contains 0.33 g of nitrogen gas, what is the pressure inside the ball at 24 "C?

Amount of Na gas (\(n\)) = 0.33 28.0 = 1.179 \(\times\) 10\({}^{-2}\) mol

Using the ideal gas equation, \(pV\)= \(nRT\)

\(p\)(144 \(\times\) 10\({}^{-6}\)) = (1.179 \(\times\) 10\({}^{-2}\))(8.31)(24 + 273)

**\(p\) = 202 \(\times\) 10\({}^{3}\) Pa**:

Learning points:

For calculations involving

1) **only one**\(pV\)= \(nRT\) equation, **ALL** parameters need to be changed to SI units when doing calculation.

2) **two**\(pV\)= \(nRT\) equations, **only temperature** parameters need to be changed to SI units when doing calculation. Unit conversions for pressures (atm or kPa to Pa) and volumes (cm\({}^{3}\) or dm\({}^{3}\) to m\({}^{3}\)) would be cancelled out when combining **two**\(pV\)= \(nRT\) equations.

**Checkpoint 1**:

1. The compressed-air cylinder of a particular scuba diving outfit has an internal volume of 1.88 dm\({}^{3}\), and contains air at a pressure of 1.75 \(\times\) 10\({}^{5}\) Pa. Calculate the volume of air that is available at a pressure of 1.01 \(\times\) 10\({}^{5}\) Pa at the same temperature. State your assumption.
2. A syringe containing 30.2 cm\({}^{3}\) of an ideal gas at 20 "C, with a pressure of 1 atm acting on the plunger, was cooled to -50 "C. To what value will the volume decrease if the pressure remains constant?* A meteorological balloon is to be filled with helium at atmospheric pressure. What will be the volume of the balloon if it is to hold all the helium gas from a 25.0 dm\({}^{3}\) gas cylinder at 150 atm? Assume constant temperature.
* The balloon will burst if its volume exceeds 4000 dm\({}^{3}\). If the balloon in (a) was filled at 15 \({}^{\circ}\)C, what is the maximum temperature that the balloon can withstand without bursting at atmospheric pressure?

### Further manipulations of the Ideal Gas Equation

The Ideal Gas Equation can be manipulated to determine properties such as concentration, molar mass (or relative molecular mass) and density of a gas.

To determine the **concentration** of a gas, the Ideal Gas Equation is rearranged as follows:

\[\begin{array}{c}\rho V=nRT\\ p=\frac{n}{V}RT\end{array}\]

To determine the **density**, \(\rho\), of a gas, the Ideal Gas Equation can be rearranged as follows:

\[\begin{array}{c}\rho V=nRT\\ \rho V=\frac{m}{M}RT\\ \rho=\frac{m}{V}\times\frac{RT}{M}\end{array}\] (where \[m\] is mass in g, and \[M\] is the molar mass in g mol\({}^{-1}\)) \[\rho=\rho\times\frac{RT}{M}\]

**Worked Example 5**

A 0.258 g gas sample at 182 \({}^{\circ}\)C and 100 kPa has a volume of 115 cm\({}^{3}\). Determine the relative molecular mass of the gas.

\[\begin{split}\begin{split}\begin{split}\begin{split} \begin{split} pV&=nRT\\ pV&=\frac{m}{M}RT\end{split}\end{split}\end{split}\]

Thus, the relative molecular mass, \(\underline{M}=84.8\) (no units)

**Checkpoint 2**

**(i)** Calculate the volume occupied by 2.00 g of carbon monoxide at 20 \({}^{\circ}\)C under a pressure of 6250 Pa.

**(ii)** What will its volume be if its temperature is raised to 40 \({}^{\circ}\)C, keeping the pressure constant?

**2)** What mass of zinc is required to produce 2.00 dm\({}^{3}\) of hydrogen at 15 \({}^{\circ}\)C and 100 kPa by reacting with excess acid?

**3)** A gas is found to have a density of 2.65 g dm\({}^{-3}\) at 24 \({}^{\circ}\)C and 102 kPa. Determine the relative molecular mass of the gas.

_Note: It is necessary to carry out the unit conversion to SI units for density before calculation._

## 3 Mixture of Gases

When gases, which **do not react chemically with each other**, are mixed in a vessel, each gas will behave independently of the other gases. The contribution which each gas makes to the total pressure in the vessel is known as the **partial pressure**.

The **partial pressure** of a gas in a mixture is the pressure the gas would exert if it alone occupies the same volume of the container at the same temperature. Therefore, partial pressure of gas \(\propto\) amount of gas in a certain volume of vessel and temperature. There is only partial pressure, no partial volume.

**Success Criteria:**

To be able to use Dalton's Law to determine the partial pressure of gases in a mixture

### Dalton's Law of Partial Pressure

At constant temperature, the **total pressure** of a mixture of gases which do not react chemically with each other is equal to the **sum of the partial pressures** of the gases present in the mixture.

where \(\mathbf{p_{\text{total}}}\) = total pressure of the gaseous mixture,

\(\mathbf{p_{\text{A}}}\), \(\mathbf{p_{\text{B}}}\), \(\mathbf{p_{\text{C}}}\), \(\mathbf{p_{\text{D}}}\) = partial pressures of gases _A, B, C, D_ respectively

### Relationship between Partial Pressure and Mole Fraction

In a mixture of three gases, \(A\), \(B\) and \(C\), with partial pressures \(\mathbf{p_{\text{A}}}\), \(\mathbf{p_{\text{B}}}\), \(\mathbf{p_{\text{C}}}\), the total pressure can be calculated from the Ideal Gas Equation.

\(\mathbf{p_{\text{total}}V=n_{\text{total}}RT}\) _(1)_

Similarly, the partial pressure of each gas in the mixture, e.g. gas A, can also be calculated using the ideal gas equation.

\(\mathbf{p_{\text{A}}V=n_{\text{R}}RT}\) _(2)_

By rearranging equations 1 and 2, \(\dfrac{RT}{V}\) can be expressed in terms of \(P\) and \(n\) and \(\dfrac{RT}{V}\) is a constant value.

From equation 1: \(\dfrac{P_{total}}{n_{total}}=\dfrac{RT}{V}\)

From equation 2: \(\dfrac{P_{A}}{n_{A}}=\dfrac{RT}{V}\)

Hence, \(\dfrac{P_{A}}{n_{A}}=\dfrac{P_{total}}{n_{total}}=\dfrac{RT}{V}\)

\(\dfrac{P_{A}V}{P_{total}V}=\dfrac{n_{A}RT}{n_{total}RT}\)

where \(\dfrac{\mathbf{n_{A}}}{n_{total}}\) is the mole fraction of gas \(A\) in the mixture

The **mole fraction** of a component (i.e gas _A_) in a mixture is defined as the **ratio** of the number of moles of gas \(A\) to the total number of moles of gas present (i.e gases \(A\), \(B\) and _C_) in the mixture.

**Mole fraction of A = \(\dfrac{n_{A}}{n_{total}}=\dfrac{n_{A}}{n_{A}^{+}n_{B}^{+}n_{C}}\)**A solid hydrocarbon is burned in air in a closed container, producing a mixture of gases having a total pressure of 3.34 atm at 298 K. Analysis of the mixture at 298 K shows it contains 0.340 g of water vapour, 0.792 g of carbon dioxide, 0.288 g of oxygen, 3.790 g of nitrogen and no other gases.

Calculate the mole fraction and partial pressure of carbon dioxide in this mixture.

\[n_{total} =n_{H_{2}O}+n_{CO_{2}}+n_{O_{2}}+n_{N_{2}}=\frac{0.340}{18.0}+ \frac{0.792}{44.0}+\frac{0.288}{32.0}+\frac{3.790}{28.0}\] \[=0.1812\text{ mol}\] \[\text{Mole fraction of CO}_{2}=\frac{n_{CO_{2}}}{n_{total}}=\frac{0.018 }{0.1812}=0.0993\] \[p_{\alpha}=\frac{n_{CO_{2}}}{n_{total}}\times p_{total}=0.0993 \times 3.34=0.332\text{ atm}\]

### Applications of Dalton's Law of Partial Pressures

When a gas is collected over water, there is water vapour mixed in with the gas. The gas is said to be saturated with water vapour.

The water level inside the gas measuring tube is then adjusted to be equal to the external water level. Thus, the total pressure of the gases inside the measuring tube is equal to the atmospheric pressure (i.e external pressure).

Dalton's Law can then be used to determine the partial pressure of the dry gas.

\[p_{total}=p_{dry\text{ gas }}+p_{water\text{ vapour }}=p_{atmosphere}\] \[p_{dry\text{ gas }}=p_{atmosphere}-p_{water\text{ vapour }}\]

**Checkpoint 4**

**1)**: A 10.0 dm\({}^{3}\) container contains 2.00 g of hydrogen and 7.00 g nitrogen. If the temperature of the mixture is 30 \({}^{\circ}\)C, calculate (i) the pressure of the mixture (ii) the partial pressure of each gas (ii)
**2)**: A 5.0 dm\({}^{3}\) cylinder containing hydrogen at a pressure of 500 kPa is connected to a 3.0 dm\({}^{3}\) cylinder containing argon at a pressure of 300 kPa and sufficient time is allowed for the gases to mix completely. Calculate the partial pressure of the two gases and the total pressure in the joined cylinders. The system is maintained at a constant temperature. State any assumptions you made in your calculation.

**Checkcopoint 4 (Continued)**

* A sample of KCl/O\({}_{3}\) is partially decomposed, producing oxygen gas that is collected over water. The volume of gas collected is 0.250 dm\({}^{3}\) at 25 \({}^{\circ}\)C and 1.02 \(\times\) 10\({}^{5}\) Nm\({}^{-2}\) total pressure. \[2\text{KCI/O}_{3}\text{ (s)}\to 2\text{KCI/ (s)}+3\text{O}_{2}\text{ (g)}\] The vapour pressure of water at various temperatures is presented in the following table. 

(i) What is the amount of oxygen collected?The Kinetic Theory of Gases

The Ideal Gas Equation is an empirical law based on experimental observations and describes the behaviour of a gas in macroscopic terms. The Kinetic Theory of Gases is a simple model that attempts to explain the behaviour of the particles in the gases.

**Success Criteria:**

To be able to state basic assumptions of the kinetic theory as applied to an ideal gas

### Assumptions of the Kinetic Theory

* A gas is composed of tiny particles that have **negligible volumes(size)** compared to the volume of the container.
* There are **negligible intermolecular forces** between the gas particles.
* Collisions between gas particles are perfectly elastic (no net loss in kinetic energy).

### The behaviour of real gases

A gas is said to exhibit ideal gas behaviour if it obeys the ideal gas equation exactly under any conditions. A plot of \(\frac{\rho V}{RT}\) versus \(p\) will give a horizontal straight line.

However, real gases do not behave ideally under all conditions. When experiments are performed on a real gas such as nitrogen, the plot of \(\frac{\rho V}{RT}\) versus p does not yield a straight line. Instead, the graph shows a deviation from the ideal plot.

_(The deviation from the ideal plot will be covered in section 4.2.3.)_

The reasons for real gases showing deviation from ideal behaviour are:

* There are **intermediate forces** between the gas particles. _(refer to section 4.2.1)_
* The gas particles take up space and do occupy finite **volumes**. _(refer to section 4.2.2)_The effect of intermolecular forces of attraction between gas particles on the measured gas pressure

In this container (with a movable piston), the gas particles are too far apart to interact.

The pressure of the gas is the force exerted on the wall of the container when the gas particles collide with the wall.

It is equal to the external pressure that is exerted to hold the piston in place.

As \(p\propto\frac{1}{V}\), when the volume of the container is halved (by pushing down the piston), the pressure of the gas is expected to double.

However, the gas particles are now close enough to interact. The intermolecular forces of attraction between gas particles will lower the force of collision of particles with the wall of container.

So the final pressure is less than double of the original pressure.

#### The effect of molecular volume on the measured gas volume

In this container (with a movable piston), the gas particles are far apart.

The free volume of space in which the gas particles can move around is equal to the volume of the container as volume taken up by the gas molecules is negligible compared to the volume of the container.

When the external pressure exerted on the container is doubled, the volume of container is halved.

However, the gas particles are very close together. The free volume of space in which the gas particles can move around is now less than the volume of the container as volume taken up by the gas molecules becomes non-negligible compared to the volume of the container.

#### Factors affecting deviation of real gas from ideal gas behaviour

A real gas would behave most like an ideal gas (or approach ideal behaviour) at low pressure and high temperature.

It deviates greatly from ideal behaviour at high pressure and low temperature.

The extent and degree of deviation of real gas from ideal gas behaviour depends on:

a) pressure

b) temperature

c) the nature of the gas (type of intermolecular forces and molecular size to compare the volume of a gas molecule)

**a) Pressure**

_Graph of \(\frac{\mathit{PV}}{\mathit{RT}}\) vs \(\mathit{p}\) of a real gas vs ideal gas_

**At low pressure,**

* The gas particles are far apart so the intermolecular forces of attraction between them are negligible.
* The total volume of the gas particles is negligible compared to the volume of the container.

**Deviations at high pressure**

* The gas particles are very close. The total volume of the gas particles is no longer negligible compared to the volume of the container.

* The gas particles are moving rapidly and they have sufficient kinetic energy to overcome the intermolecular forces of attractions between them. So the intermolecular forces of attraction can be considered as negligible.

**Deviation at low temperature**
* The gas particles have lower kinetic energy and are insufficient to overcome the intermolecular forces of attractions. The intermolecular forces of attractions between them become significant and are no longer negligible.
* **Nature of the Gas**

_Note:_

Focus on the low pressure region to compare the degree of deviation from ideal gas (horizontal line)

* The stronger the intermolecular forces of attraction of a gas, the greater the deviation from ideal gas behaviour.
* Gases with larger molecular mass indicate a larger molecular size, therefore stronger instantaneous dipole-induced dipole interactions between molecules.

**Checkpoint 5**:

1. The following graphs are drawn for equal amounts of an ideal gas and three real gases at constant temperature. Answer the guiding questions and suggest the identities of real gases **X**, **Y** and **Z**.

**Guiding questions:**

1. **Use the graphs to determine the extent of deviation from ideal gas behaviour for X, Y and** **Z** at low pressures.
2. **Using chemical bonding knowledge, identify the type of intermolecular forces of attraction for each gas in the options.**
3. **Compare the strength of intermolecular forces of attraction for the three gases.**
4. **Apply "the greater the intermolecular forces of attraction, the greater the deviation from ideal gas behaviour" and select the option showing the correct identities.**

## For Interest:

### The van der Waals Equation

Engineers and scientists who work with gases at high pressures often cannot use the Ideal Gas Equation to predict the pressure - volume properties of gases. This is because the behaviour of the gases deviating from ideal behaviour is too large.

The van der Waals Equation takes in to account the attractive forces present in real gas and the finite volume occupied by the gas molecules. This equation is able to predict the behaviour of real gases better.

### Real - life Applications of Gas Laws

#### (A)

Airbags in Modern Cars

Most modern cars are equipped with an airbag, which inflates in a few microseconds during sudden impacts. This protects the driver and the passenger seated in the front seat, who may otherwise be thrown against the steering wheel or dashboard.

So what enables the deflated airbag to inflate within microseconds during sudden impacts?

There is a solid pellet of sodium azide, NaN\({}_{3}\), in the airbag.

During a sudden impact, NaN\({}_{3}\) will be ignited and undergo decomposition, generating a large amount of nitrogen gas, N\({}_{2}\).

\[2\text{NaN}_{3}\left(\text{s}\right)\to 2\text{Na}\left(\text{s}\right)+3 \text{N}_{2}\left(\text{g}\right)\]

The N\({}_{2}\) gas produced fills the entire airbag, inflating it in the process.

At constant temperature and pressure, a mass of 124 g of NaN\({}_{3}\) is needed to fill a 70 dm\({}^{3}\) airbag with N\({}_{2}\) gas. Thus it is easier to carry the NaN\({}_{3}\) pellet around than a bag full of air.

A recreational dive in Maldives under the supervision of a dive professional allows a diver to explore the underwater up to a depth of 12 m.

Deep underwater, the weight of the sea water exerts much greater pressure on the body of a scuba diver than it is at the surface level. The pressure exerted by the sea water on the diver increases with depth.

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|} Pressure exerted on a diver at the surface level & 1.0 atm (\(p_{\text{hum}}\)) \\ Pressure exerted by 10 m of sea water on a diver & 1.0 atm \\ \end{tabular} So a diver diving at the depth of 10 m will experience a total pressure of 2.0 atm.

As the diver begin to ascend to the surface, the volume of air in the lungs will increase with decreasing pressure, according to Boyle's Law.

So the volume of air in the lungs will double! This sudden increase in volume can rupture the membranes of the lungs. Therefore it is important that the diver ascend slowly, stopping at certain points to adjust to the falling pressure.

Calculate the total pressure and partial pressure of oxygen.

A gas canister, used in camping stoves, contains mainly butane under sufficient pressure to cause it to liquefy partially.

State two assumptions of the kinetic theory as applied to ideal gases and use these to explain whether you might expect the gas in the canister to behave as an ideal gas.

The canister was connected to a gas syringe and the valve opened slightly to allow some of the gas into the syringe. It was found that 0.200 g of the gas took up a volume of 96.0 cm\({}^{3}\) at a temperature of 20.0 \({}^{\circ}\)C and a pressure of 1.01 \(\times\) 10\({}^{5}\) Pa.

Calculate the average relative molecular mass of the gas mixture.

Based on safety considerations, explain why the gas canister with residual butane should not be disposed of by burning.

Cylinders of pressurized carbon dioxide are used to produce carbonated drinks. One such cylinder has an internal volume of 2.5 dm\({}^{3}\), and contains 2.3 kg of carbon dioxide.

Calculate the pressure (in Pa) the carbon dioxide gas would exert inside the cylinder at 25 \({}^{\circ}\)C.

In fact, the pressure inside the cylinder is 2.2 \(\times\) 10\({}^{7}\) Pa under these conditions. Explain why this differs from the pressure you calculated in (a).

A 500 cm\({}^{3}\) can of cola has 2.0 g of carbon dioxide dissolved in it under pressure. When the can is opened, carbon dioxide is released to the atmosphere immediately till it goes flat. A saturated solution of carbon dioxide is then left in the can with a concentration of 1.5 g dm\({}^{-3}\) at a pressure of 1 atm and 25 \({}^{\circ}\)C.

Calculate the volume of carbon dioxide that is released to the atmosphere when it goes flat. [Assume carbon dioxide behaves as an ideal gas under these conditions.]* [15] The volume of 1 mole of carbon dioxide was measured at various pressures but at a constant temperature of 285 K. The results obtained were plotted as shown below.
* [16] 0.2 mol of radon is stored in a 20.0 dm\({}^{3}\) flask with 0.8 mol of fluorine at 127 \({}^{\circ}\)C. (a) Calculate the total pressure in the flask. (b) Calculate the partial pressure of radon and fluorine in the flask. (c) Radon and xenon are in the same group. A scientist hypothesises that radon has similar chemical reaction as xenon. Xenon can react with fluorine according to the following reaction. \[\mathrm{Xe(g)+F_{2}(g)\longrightarrow XeF_{2}(g)}\] The mixture of radon and fluorine in the flask was sparked at 127 \({}^{\circ}\)C. What is the final pressure in the flask if the temperature is maintained at 127 \({}^{\circ}\)C?
