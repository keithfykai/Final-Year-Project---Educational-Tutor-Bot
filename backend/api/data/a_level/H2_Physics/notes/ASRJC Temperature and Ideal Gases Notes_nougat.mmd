### Thermal Equilibrium

* When objects or substances are in contact such that heat is able to flow from one object or substance to another, they are said to be in thermal contact.
* When two bodies in thermal contact have the same temperature and there is no net flow of heat between them, the two bodies are said to be in thermal equilibrium.
* When two bodies are in thermal equilibrium, their temperatures are the same.
* Therefore, the temperature of a body is the physical property which determines whether the body will be in thermal equilibrium with another body.

**Zeroth Law of Thermodynamics**

If two bodies \(X\) and \(Y\) are separately in thermal equilibrium with a third body \(T\), then \(X\) and \(Y\) are in thermal equilibrium with each other.

### Temperature Scales

* A thermometer is calibrated according to a temperature scale.
* Two temperature scales, the empirical scale and the thermodynamic scale have been established.
* They are established by making use of reference or fixed points.

### The Empirical Scale

* The empirical scale of temperature is a scale of temperature that is based on the variation with temperature of a property of a substance, assuming that the property varies linearly with temperature although it may not necessarily be so.
* An example is the Centigrade scale used in a mercury thermometer. This empirical scale of temperature is based on the expansion of mercury's volume with rising temperature.
* At melting point of ice (0 \({}^{\circ}\)C) and the steam point (100 \({}^{\circ}\)C) which are fixed points, the respective values of thermometric property X are measured as \(X_{\circ}\)and \(X_{100}\).
* To calculate an unknown temperature \(0\), the corresponding thermometric property \(X_{\circ}\) is measured. \(0\) can be calculated as

**Anderson Serangoon Junior College**

**PHYSICS 9749**

**Worked Example**

A resistance thermometer has a resistance of 9.97 \(\Omega\) at the ice point and 14.04 \(\Omega\) at the steam point. Find the temperature on the centigrade scale of this thermometer when its resistance is 11.51 \(\Omega\).

**Solution**

\[\theta\ =\ \frac{X_{\circ}-X_{\circ}}{X_{\circ 100}-X_{\circ}}\times 100=\frac{11.51-9.97 }{14.04-9.97}\times 100\ =37.8\ ^{\circ}\text{C}\]

**Thermodynamic Scale of Temperature**

* Empirical scale may agree at the calibration points of, for example 0 \({}^{\circ}\)C and 100 \({}^{\circ}\)C but not at intermediate temperatures.
* Hence, we want an ideal temperature scale that does not depend on the properties of a particular material.
* The gas thermometer comes closest to this ideal temperature scale.
* The principle of a gas thermometer is that the pressure of a gas at constant volume increases with temperature. A quantity of gas is placed in a constant volume container and its pressure is measured at 0 \({}^{\circ}\)C and 100 \({}^{\circ}\)C, say; and a straight line drawn.
* Graphs of pressure versus temperature at constant volume for three different types and quantities of gas are plotted.

**Extrapolation of the graph shows a hypothetical temperature \(-273.15\ ^{\circ}\)C at which absolute pressure of gas would become zero for different quantities of gas used as well as different gases used.**

**We use this extrapolated zero-pressure temperature as the basis for a temperature scale with its zero at this temperature. This is the thermodynamic (or Kelvin) temperature scale.**

**This acts as the basis for a temperature scale independent of properties of a material.**

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:5]

**Example 1**: A fixed mass of an ideal gas is maintained at constant volume. The pressure of the gas at the triple point of water is \(1.00\times 10^{5}\) Pa.

Determine the thermodynamic temperature of the gas when its pressure is \(1.20\times 10^{5}\) Pa.

## Appendix B Avogadro Constant and Molar Quantities

* The Avogadro constant \(N_{A}\)is the number of atoms in 0.012 kg of carbon-12.
* This number was found experimentally to be \(6.02\times 10^{23}\).
* The mole is a unit for the amount of substance.
* One mole of any substance is the amount containing \(6.02\times 10^{23}\) particles.
* For instance, one mole of argon gas contains \(6.02\times 10^{23}\) Ar atoms and one mole of water contains \(6.02\times 10^{23}\) H\({}_{2}\)O molecules.
* The mass of one mole of a substance is known as the molar mass \(M\). The unit for molar mass is kg mol-1.
* The mass of one atom or molecule \(m\) can be found by dividing the molar mass of the substance by the Avogadro constant.
* Sometimes, it is convenient to express ideal gas in terms of the total number of molecules \(N\) in the gas.
* For \(N\) molecules, the number of moles \(n\) is given by \(n=\dfrac{N}{N_{A}}\) where \(N_{A}\)is the Avogadro constant.
* Hence, the ideal gas equation becomes where \(p\) is the pressure of the gas \(V\)is the volume of the gas \(N\)is the number of molecules \(k=\dfrac{R}{N_{A}}\), where \(T\) is the thermodynamic temperature \(R=8.31\) J K\({}^{+}\)mol-1

**Check Your Understanding 1**

1. One mole of hydrogen has the same number of atoms as one mole of neon. (True / False)

## Chapter 2

## Appendix C The Ideal Gas Equation

### State of a Gas

* The state of a gas is the condition in which a particular material exists.
* It can be described using the following macroscopic properties that can be easily measured:
* Any changes in the state of a gas can be brought about by changing any of the above properties. For e.g. if pressure is changed, then either volume, temperature or both will change.

### The Experimental Laws

* Based on experimental observations, the following laws were formulated:

**PHYSICS 9749**

Combining the gas laws, we have

\[\frac{\rho V}{T}=\text{constant}\]

This constant is proportional to the amount of gas (measured in moles).

Hence, the equation of state is \(\rho V=nRT\) or \(\rho V=NkT\)

where

\(n=\)_amount of substance (measured in moles)_

\(R=\) molar gas constant 8.31 J mol\({}^{\text{-1}}\)K\({}^{\text{-1}}\)

\(N=\)_number of molecules_

\(k\)_is the Boltzmann constant (1.38 x 10\({}^{23}\) JK\({}^{\text{-1}}\))_

Experimental evidence shows that the equation of state is only true for an ideal gas. An ideal gas is one where there is no potential energy (due to negligible electrostatic forces) between molecules.

**An ideal gas is one which obeys the equation of state \(\rho V=nRT\) at all pressures, volumes and temperatures.**

Real gases approximate the behaviour of an ideal gas at

\(\circ\)low pressure and

\(\circ\)high temperature

**Example 3**

In the figure, the volume of flask X is twice

that of flask Y. The system is filled with an

ideal gas. If the mass of gas in X is \(m\), what is

the mass of gas in Y?

**Thinking Process**

**What is the significance of the tube linking the two flasks?**

The tube equalizes the pressure in the two flasks as there is no net flow of gas molecules in

the tube when equilibrium is established.

**Anderson Serangoon Junior College**

**Physics 9749**

**Worked Example**

After the pressure of the air in a bicycle tyre has been increased slightly by pumping air into the tyre, the amount of air in the tyre increased by 2%, the thermodynamics temperature by 1%, and the internal volume of the tyre by 0.2%. By what percentage has the pressure of the air in the tyre increased? [2.8 %]

**Solution**

\[\begin{split} pV=nRT&\quad\Rightarrow\quad\quad \frac{pV}{nT}=R=\text{ constant}\\ \frac{p_{1}V_{1}}{n_{1}T_{1}}=\frac{p_{2}V_{2}}{n_{2}T_{2}}& \Rightarrow\frac{p_{2}}{p_{1}}=&\left(\frac{n_{2}}{n_{1}} \right)\left(\frac{T_{2}}{T_{1}}\right)\left(\frac{V_{1}}{V_{2}}\right)\\ &=&\left(\frac{102}{100}\right)\left(\frac{101}{100} \right)\left(\frac{100}{100.2}\right)\\ &=1.028\end{split}\]

The final pressure is 2.8% higher than the initial pressure.

**Example 4**: An ideal gas exerts a pressure of 60 Pa in a container of volume \(V\), when its temperature is 400 K and the number of molecules present is \(N\). Another sample of the same gas exerts a pressure of 30 Pa in the same container when its temperature is 300 K. How many molecules are present in a unit volume of this second sample?

**Thinking Process**: What are the variables in this question?

\(p\), \(N\) and \(T\)

\(V\)and k are constant.

### Kinetic Theory of Gases

* In the kinetic theory, the pressure of an ideal gas is related to the impact of molecules with the walls of the container; its temperature to the sum of kinetic energies of the molecules; its volume with the space in which the molecules are free to move.
* The kinetic theory of gases applies the laws of mechanics (Conservation of momentum, Newton's laws of motion, etc) to molecular movement so that expressions for the pressure and temperature of a gas can be expressed in terms of the molecular speed, mass, number of molecules, etc.
* The assumptions of the kinetic theory include: 1. A gas consists of a **large** number of identical molecules.
2. The gas molecules are in rapid, random motion.
3. There are no **inter-molecular forces** between the molecules, except during a collision.
4. The **volume** of the gas molecules is negligible compared with the volume of the container.
5. Collisions between gas molecules and with the walls of the container are **elastic**.
6. The **time** taken for a collision is negligible compared with the time interval between collisions.

## Appendix D Mean Kinetic Energy of a Molecule

* Here, we find an expression for the mean kinetic energy of a molecule of an ideal gas. This is a microscopic quantity which is nearly impossible to measure even with sophisticated equipment.
* The approach is to relate this microscopic quantity to the macroscopic properties of the system.

### Microscopic and Macroscopic properties of ideal gas

#### d.1.1 (a) Derivation of \(\boldsymbol{\rho V=\frac{1}{3}\,Nm\big{<}c^{2}\big{>}}\)

(b) Show that the mean kinetic energy of a molecule of an ideal gas is proportional to the thermodynamic temperature
* The pressure exerted by a gas can be explained by the kinetic theory. When randomly moving gas molecules hit the wall of the container, they exert a force on the wall. Since pressure is defined as force per unit area, a gas exerts pressure on the wall of the container during collisions with the container.
* Consider a single molecule of mass \(m\) in a cubical box with sides of length \(L\). At this instant after it has just collided with the left-hand side wall, it is moving with velocity \(u\) directly towards the right-hand side wall of the box.
* Initial momentum before collision with the wall = \(mu\) (\(\rightarrow\) positive direction)
* Final momentum just after collision with the wall = \(-mu\) Note: This is because the collisions are elastic. Refer to assumption 4.
* initial momentum =
- \(mu\) =
* Before making another collision with the left-hand side wall, the molecule has to travel a distance \(2L\).
* As the speed is \(u\), the time between collisions with the same wall will be \(\frac{2L}{u}\).

Adding all the equations together, we get

\[N\Big{\langle}c^{2}\Big{\rangle}=N\Big{\langle}u^{2}\Big{\rangle}+N\Big{\langle} v^{2}\Big{\rangle}+N\Big{\langle}w^{2}\Big{\rangle}\]

\[\Big{\langle}c^{2}\Big{\rangle}=\Big{\langle}u^{2}\Big{\rangle}+\Big{\langle} v^{2}\Big{\rangle}+\Big{\langle}w^{2}\Big{\rangle}\]

Since the gas molecules are in random motion (assumption 2), there is no tendency for the gas to exert a greater pressure in any one direction. It follows that

\[\Big{\langle}u^{2}\Big{\rangle}=\Big{\langle}v^{2}\Big{\rangle}=\Big{\langle} w^{2}\Big{\rangle}\]

\[\Big{\langle}c^{2}\Big{\rangle}=3\Big{\langle}u^{2}\Big{\rangle}\]

\[\Big{\langle}u^{2}\Big{\rangle}=\frac{1}{3}\Big{\langle}c^{2}\Big{\rangle}\]

From equation (*), the pressure \(p\) exerted by the gas on the wall of the container is

\[\boxed{\rho=\frac{1}{3}\frac{Nm}{V}\Big{\langle}c^{2}\Big{\rangle}}\]

The term \(Nm\) is equal to the total mass of the gas sample (\(M\)). Therefore,

\[\frac{Nm}{V}=\frac{M}{V}=\rho\]

where \(\rho\) = density of the gas

Hence, another equivalent expression for pressure is

#### d.1.2 Root-Mean Square Speed of Molecules in an Ideal Gas

From the above derivation, _% Nm\(<\)c\({}^{2}\)\(>\) = 3/2 nRT_

Root-Mean-Square speed = \(\sqrt{<c^{i}>}\) = \(\sqrt{\frac{3nRT}{Nm}}\)

where \(N\) = number of gas molecules in sample

\(m\) = mass of one molecule

\(n\) = number of moles in sample

The quantity \(\sqrt{<c^{i}>}\), which is the square root of the mean-square speed of the molecules, is called the 'root-mean-square speed' \(c_{\rm ms}\).

Since \(N\) is the number of gas molecules and \(m\) is the mass of one molecule, the product _Nm_ gives the mass of the sample.

If for \(n\) = 1 mole, then the number of molecules \(N\) = 6.02 x 10\({}^{23}\); and _Nm_ = molar mass \(M\)

Root-mean-square speed \(c_{\rm ms}=\sqrt{<c^{i}>}\) = \(\sqrt{\frac{3RT}{M}}\)

This expression implies that the root-mean-square speed of molecules in an ideal gas is proportional to the square root of its thermodynamic temperature and inversely proportional to the square root of its molar mass.

For a given gas (fixed _M_), the molecules are moving about with a larger average speed when the temperature is higher. Also, at a fixed temperature, the gas with a smaller molar mass has molecules with higher speeds on the average.
